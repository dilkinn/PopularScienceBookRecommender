0,0393312763,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69589444-jen,5,"There are some advantages to growing up very southern. In addition to being born with impressive trigger discipline, you squirrel away an arsenal of colloquialisms to fall back on in times of befuddlement or great stress. Case in point: When your effete boyfriend decides he’s had enough of the cloistered life of a scribe, and begins to masquerade as a man. To wit: laboring with a spare tire on the side of the road in the dead of winter for hours. You grow concerned, step out of the car, and say: “It’s colder than a well digger’s ass in Idaho out here. Want me to help you with that, darlin?” Not to be emasculated by the object of his affections, he dismisses you and attacks a lug-nut with revitalized purpose. “Bless your cotton socks.” You say.Sensing an opportunity to stake out the narrow band of human accomplishment that has defined his academic life, he rises, doffing his chapeau, he carefully intones: “I think your idiom is all wrong here.”Snatching the tire iron away from him you say: “It’s a sorry excuse for a functional intellect that don’t know a fulcrum from his asshole. Say that highfalutin shit to me again and we’re finished, Reginald!”“I...” He stammers.“So help me GOD, if you bring up Heidegger right now, I will knock a turd outta you that’ll whizz like a wire-nail!”Sufficiently chastened he goes back to work. You get back into the car, slamming the door, and putting some Hank on to soothe your savage soul. Another hour passes and you glance out the window to see Reginald writhing on the ground, making obscene snow angels, muttering about pure reason’s ability to count a horse’s teeth before it opens its mouth. Seizing the opportunity to gloat, you step out of the vehicle and loom over the poor bastard like the shadow of death. In a voice that would make a snowman shiver, you say: “Where’s your post structuralism now?” We’re getting way off track here right out of the gate. My question is: Have you ever, while searching for the perfect way to capture the effect a book had on you, said: “It’s enough to knock a slop-hound offa gut-wagon.”? Did the shockwave of its profundity reduce all chatter at the dinner table to its constituent utterances? Did someone come up to you afterwards, nursing their cocktail, and proceed to compliment your unique vernacular? Did you then reply acidly: “It’s been a dream of mine to choke someone to death with the laryngeal nerve of a giraffe.”? Well, I’m not sure what that says about your inclination to read this book, and you’re starting to develop an odd obsession with giraffes, but let me take a moment to explain to you how badass Black Holes are. There’s a few kinds, but here are two:CHADS are really big stars, who inevitably get fed up with the monotonous routine of fusing hydrogen into helium, which prompts CHADS to shake it up a bit and try some heavier elements. But they come to the horrifying realization that it’s turtles all the way down. At which point CHADS say: “It’s enough to make a billy goat puke!” And just straight up reverse their own plumbing. Tearing up the stellar neighborhood like right bastards, before exiting so dramatically from the scene that they punch a damn hole in the fabric of space-time.TIMS are smaller fellas who are just fucking fed up with everything, they’re sick to death of the whole game, and they’re trying desperately to quit drinking. But they’ve got a friend that’s constantly hanging around them and handing them shots. They’re the ultimate enabler: BILLS (a binary star). The whole time TIMS are pleading with BILLS: “I gotta quit this shit. If I should have a few more hydrogen-sours; I’m gonna overcome my electron degeneracy pressure and go on a real tear, BILL. A real goddamn tear.” But BILLS don’t give a shit and just keep egging TIMS on until, as suggested, they go on a hellacious tear and rip space-time’s breeches.In both cases, these catastrophic events create what are known as Singularities, and the thing about ‘em is; you ain’t even allowed to look at ‘em. See, light ain’t even fast enough to outrun the gravitation of a Black Hole, (that’s why it’s black!) but light is overconfident (because it’s a cosmic speed limit, and that gives it the big-head) and it’s always trying its damndest to give it a go. So you got this circle of light delineating the outer edges of a Black Hole, where light is sprinting with everything it has, but like a kid being held by her suspenders, it’s just running in place. That’s a warning my friend, you cross that line and something so horrible happens to you that physicists had to make a term up for it. It’s called Spaghettification. I ain’t joking. Look it up. Anyway, it’s presumably unpleasant as all hell, but probably brief as hell, as far as unpleasant as hell things go.Now here’s an interesting thing about TIMS, since they always get a certain amount of booze in them before they go swarping about, their hellraising (luminosity) always peaks in a predictable way, and since we know from some big brains that the intensity of light falls off with the square of the distance, we do something nifty with it. If we know an object’s absolute brightness we can calculate how far away it is based on how dim it is when it arrives at our light collectors. Now there are some further complications to this, but I ain’t gonna get into that. That’s what this book is for. Anyway, they’re damn handy.One more thing before I go that’ll make you shit through the eye of a needle without touching the sides: At the center of our galaxy is a Black Hole that’s all the time going off on the most destructive row you’ve ever seen in your life. LENNY here has a mass about 4 million times that of our sun. And he don’t stop for nothing. Beats the piss outta TIMS, and BILLS, and JOEYS, and FRANKS, and CHADS. And he don’t stop at giving them a concussion. He EATS the bastards!Accrete some stellar knowledge with this book!"

Thorne has done an excellent job of putting just about anything you'd want to know about the topic in layman's terms, but the math and physics is also there if you want it. He blends the science and the history together and comes up with an interesting read not only about what we know about stellar death, but how we got there. In the last chapter he presents some of his own research on how black holes may be used to create time traveling wormholes. You don't get much cooler than time-traveling wormholes. Seriously."

Thorne is one of the most important researchers in gravity and black holes.I this book,after a introductin as a sf short tale where a spaceship goes to the evet horizon of different sizes of black holes to investigate,the author explains clearly the principle of relativity is to say that the physical laws are the same in all inertial reference frames,this priciple is the origin of the special relativity theory (the special relativity theory could have been discovered many years before because the Maxwell equation for a electromagnetic wave is invariant under Lorentz transformations and not in galilean transformations,in this sense the electromagnetic theory by Maxwell is the first classic field relativistic theory)second the equivalence principle that is the origin of the generl theory of relativity where the spacetime is curved by the presence of matter and energy and the light follows geodesics ,the short lines between two points that are not in this case straight lines,for example in a sphere surface the geodesics are maximun circles or meridians.In the following chapters the author tells the birth and evolution of the concept of neutron star and black holes by the work of Scharzschild,Chandrasekhar,Oppenheimer and others and the idea of the Hawking radiation .After this ,the search of astronomical black holes as result of imploding massive stars and the big black holes in the galactic nucleus,recently confirmed,also the search of gravitational waves,the last test of the theory and also recently confirmed.Te book ends with two speculative subjects,the structure of the hipotetical singularity inside a black hole as a quantum space time foam as quantum gravity predicts and the existence of womholes in the spacetime sustained by exotic matter and its possible use for interestellar trips or time machines(here the movie"" Interestellar"").Also other point of the book is the sociology of science,the science in USA versus soviet union and the history of the independent discovery of the Teller Ulam design of the termonuclear devices(by Sajarov in the soviet union).A reference book of popular science on relativity,black holes,wormholes,time machines and its history."
3,0393312763,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84365525-taha-ansari,5,"Incredible. What a masterpiece! Thoroughly detailed without being overly complicated. Kip Thorne, a recent Nobel laureate awarded for his immense contributions in gravitational wave detection, goes through the most important junctures in 20th century physical research, explaining along the way the most important concepts in relativistic physics. After detailing Einstein’s endeavors to formulate the two theories of relativity and establishing his field equations, and qualitatively explaining them by means of ingenious thought experiments and beautiful spacetime and embedding diagrams, he then dives into the many attempts to solve these equations, a quest taken by the leading physicists of the twentieth century, each one manipulating them in their own unique way hoping to derive solutions that could explain the century’s biggest questions: What is the ultimate fate of a star? Do physical laws allow the formation of black holes and naked singularities? Can an “infinitely advanced civilization” create time warps and keep them from collapsing in on themselves? Do the laws that govern the universe allow time travel or does nature’s abhorrence of time machines protect the universe from the many paradoxes associated with them?Kip Thorne approaches each question by first giving the general historical circumstances in which the theoretical and experimental efforts were at their peak (world war two for instance and the international effort put into building and developing the atomic bomb), he then introduces the main characters involved, and what makes this book so unique, is that the author not only focuses on the final results of their endeavors, but instead shines as much light on the process, including the successes and the failures. Kip also gives a brief account of each character’s background, describing the constraints and the advantages that had had influence on their work (mostly political and financial constraints). What also makes this book stand out, is the important implication of the author in most topics approached. He describes in detail the kinds of relationships that connect physicists including himself to other scientists (Mathematicians, astrophysicists, etc.) and displays through many examples the importance of interdisciplinary communication. (And apparently physicists are keen on making bets)For those who are wondering if this book is outdated, most explanations given in this book still remain valid, some of which have even been proven years after the book was published (Gravitational waves for example). Most importantly, this book is not only for those who want to expand their knowledge in relativistic physics, it is also a great demonstration of how scientific knowledge is built and a great source of historical information. I cannot recommend it highly enough!"
4,0393312763,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5979619-boudewijn,4,"Written by Nobel Prize winner Kip Thorne, this book gives an easy to read and understandable overview of the development of black hole theoryStarting with the Newtonian physics, the Michelson-Morley experiment and the subsequent development of Einstein’s theory of special relativity Thorne sets the framework for the following chapter.Immediately after special relativity was accepted by the scientists, the mathematics predicted the existence of black holes. Thorne describes the initial scepticism until the embrace of the black hole concept later on. Besides that, he also describes the search for these objects and the later on developments in the black hole theory.Accompanied with easy understandable illustrations, I was pleasantly surprised how well I could follow the concepts and understand them in a large degree. The behaviour of space and time in the black hole’s singularity became understandable. Not a small feat for such a difficult topic.Toward the end, Thorne deals with the more specalutative questions such as wormholes and time travel. This was nice to read, but not the main part of the book. The book describes the search for gravitational waves - which have recently been found and resulted in Thorne’s Nobel Prize.All in all, I can surely recommend this book to anyone with an interest in science and astrology in particular. Thorne’s easy reading style and easy to understand explanations makes this a worthwhile read. 4 stars."
5,0393312763,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2765658-steve-walker,5,"This classic was first published in hardback in 1994. It is one of the best books written on the topic by one of the key players in the field. This book stands out for a number of reasons: 1)quality of the writing,2)An excellent bibliography, and 3) very well done illustrations. I have lost count of the number of astronomy books published in the last 14-20 years with poor quality photos or drawings. I wish Dr. Thorne would write a revision of the based on the recent discoveries made by the Hubble and Chandra Space Telescopes. This book is worth your time, and a careful reading will give you a good understanding of how our knowledge of black holes developed and what may come next.Christopher Nolan, director of the forthcoming movie ""Interstellar"" based the movie on some of the ideas in this book. Dr. Thorne was a consultant to the movie and is listed as one of the executive producers of the film. "
6,0393312763,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23888196-rama,5,"Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Black HolesKip Thorne is an eccentric author who reveals scientific enterprise of quantum gravity and black holes research in a simple language. This book is rich in history, and classical (Newtonian physics and theory of relativity) and modern physics (quantum mechanics) are presented in non mathematical form. We get rare first hand insights of scientific styles and temperament, and his personal involvement in various aspects of black holes research and his interaction with scientists all over the world especially those from former Soviet Union and the impact of communism on black hole research. The first part of the book describes theory of relativity, concept of spacetime fabric of the universe and curvature of spacetime in presence of matter (stars, galaxies, etc.) to generate gravity. The author gives us a good historical background to build his case for black hole concept. Theory of relativity predicts the existence of black holes but Einstein refused to accept it and so is Arthur Eddington another leading exponent of theory of relativity. The idea of black holes remained in academic obscurity among few who believed in it and it progressively became clear that dying giant stars undergo implosions in which nuclear force the strongest of all four forces of cosmos buckles under gravitational force creating a blackholes. Black holes have been discovered in the center of dying giant stars and in centers of galaxies, and efforts are underway to detect the black hole gravitational waves carried to earth from distant parts of the universe and to seek the secret of what is inside a black hole: a route to another universe? The author warps up the second part by discussing the possibility of constructing wormholes with exotic matter (tunnels in space connecting two widely separated locations in the universe) through hyperspace for interstellar travel and back to the future. He is one of the leaders in proposing interstellar travel. Physicists and academics are too conservative to get involved in space travel research as it is traditionally linked to science fiction and Star Trek junkies. The author can mesmerize the reader with his incredible knowledge and ease with which he can communicate to the reader; at the same time he is eccentric enough to work in one of his laboratory (Palomar Mountains) nude and draw criticisms from peers. He is also crazy enough to take bet with peers for things such as Penthouse magazine and annoy his wife and family with Mormon heritage. This book is free of marketing strategies of the publisher as the author shares his knowledge with the reader to his best of abilities to make everyone understands it even by offering few simple calculations and formulas. Do not be discouraged by the size of the book (619 pages). The text flows well and it is deeply engrossing. Anyone interested in black hole and space travel must have this book. "
7,0393312763,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2911555-whitney,3,"I have always been interested in anything related to quantum physics. I didn't expect this to be an easy read but I didn't really expect to have any problem getting through it since I've been researching this type of stuff since I was in 8th grade. I underestimated this book. It's written in a way that's fairly easy to understand, but the theories themselves were giving me a hard time. If you are interested in learning more about black holes and time warps and are willing to reread every paragraph until you understand then I definitely recommend this book."
8,0393312763,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1241339-clif,4,"I had read Einstein's book ""The Evolution of Physics"" (reviewed) and with the introduction that he supplied, felt I was ready to fall into black holes. I had seen a cover blurb describing Kip Thorne's book (subtitle: Einstein's outrageous legacy) as exemplary science writing and, though it is somewhat dated (1993) bought a used copy.Thorne wastes no time, initially taking the reader on a visit to black holes of various sizes, though widely separated in distance, in our galaxy. Relativity is seen by the wildly different amount of time experienced by the astronauts compared to that on earth during their absence. A trip to the center of the Milky Way at light speed would only be 30 years for the voyagers but many thousands of years would pass on earth, many thousands more for the return trip!This a result of what Einstein found - that time is relative. There is no independent time, alike for everyone everywhere. Only the speed of light is constant everywhere and always. It is this adjustment of our dimensions of height, width and depth to accord with the constant of light speed that results in the weird stretching and compressing of objects and of time.The central theme of the book is gravity and what happens when it becomes far more powerful than we know it to be in our solar system. Even as early as the 18th century there was speculation about what would happen if a star was so massive that its gravity would prevent even light from escaping.Thorne takes us on the investigation through physics that really took off after Einstein came up with the concept of spacetime, which is curved by gravity. Because spacetime is a dimension that we can never see, limited as we are to the 3 dimensions that we know, Thorne uses what are called embedding diagrams to give a sense of how curvature of spacetime can result in the three angles of a triangle summing to more or less than 180 degrees, or the shortest distance between two points not being a straight line as we would see it.The best way I've found to think of spacetime is as follows: light must always follow the shortest path between two points and it must do so at the fixed speed of 186,000 miles per second. Einstein showed that light has mass, though very little, and is therefor affected by gravity.The intense gravity of the sun is enough to bend the path of light that passes near it. If we look at the light of a star with high precision, we note that if the sun's edge passes near the position of that star, the star's light will be offset from where it would otherwise be, shifting the position of that star in relation to all the other stars seen in that part of the sky. As the sun moves away, the distant star appears to move back into its normal place.Now, if light cannot change speed and must be coming to us from that distant star by the shortest path at all times, then it is the path, through Einstein's spacetime, that is distorted because of the sun's gravity. Were the sun a black hole, the distant star's light passing near it would be greatly displaced, just as the text in a book would be moved and distorted as you pass a magnifying lens over it.Surprisingly, the author is able to make the strangeness he describes comprehensible. The idea that as stars become increasingly massive their fate takes them to different endpoints - white dwarfs, neutron stars and finally black holes, is clearly explained with many diagrams and side comments. I only had difficulty in the last chapter where he goes into time machines. There, the level of abstraction went where I could not follow, and abstraction is what the cutting edge of physics is all about.You will get a great introduction to great minds in math and physics of the 20th century, many of them friends of Kip Thorne. There are plenty of personal accounts and a good bit of humor to humanize what might be a dry subject. There is excellent coverage of the instruments used, such as the radio telescope or the X-ray detecting satellites. Thorne does a great job of catching the reader up in the excitement of the professionally curious who are forever asking why.Something I had not considered before, the author relates how traditional optical astronomy, starting with the naked eye, only reveals a relatively quiet universe. The rip-roaring world of X-rays, gamma rays and gravity waves cannot be ""seen"" without special instruments that have only been practical within the last 75 years. An exciting part of the book for me was the story of Grote Reber, a hobbyist in Wheaton, Illinois, who built his own backyard radio telescope and detected (with low precision) strong radio sources before professional astronomers knew about them. So impressive was his work that astronomers from the Yerkes Observatory traveled to visit him.Thorne takes you across the electromagnetic spectrum, from light through radio and X-rays up to the latest area of investigation, non-electromagnetic gravity waves, being sought as the inevitable result of black holes in collision. Since Kip Thorne recommended the construction of the first gravity wave interferometer at Caltech, he's well placed to discuss the search. Because of the age of this book, I was curious to see what happened with this particular project, called LIGO. As it happens, it was built and operated for several years but detected no gravity waves. It has been dismantled and a successor instrument is about to take up the search.Black holes are discussed in great detail, as you'd expect, but not as you'd expect the discussion can be followed without difficulty through the decades, as one great mind after another puts up an idea to be either upheld against fierce criticism or destroyed by the math of another. Behind it all lies Einstein's relativity that opened up a chapter on the search for truth by minds that have to model places in the universe where matter and energy take on magnitudes unknown to human experience.I had to chuckle when Thorne would describe untold hours and even years of work being upset like this: After X had been working on the problem, trying to tie together the different loose ends, Z showed that, after all, everything could be explained by looking at the math in a different way, that, really, there was no difficulty after all. You can imagine the real storm and strife of egos behind a summary statement like this, with someone screaming, WHY DIDN'T I SEE THAT!Join Kip Thorne for this inside story on what is real, though it may contradict our experience. There are more weird things in this book than in a carnival freak show, yet all of them have stood up to the best testing that has been devised."
9,0393312763,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65973916-gridgirl,4,"Kip Thorne, author of Black Holes and Time Warps, is one of three Nobel laureates for Physics of 2017. He and his colleagues Barry Barish and Rainer Weiss have been honored for their contribution to the observation of gravitational waves. In September 2015 physicists were able to measure those gravitational waves – which are an experimental reassurance of Einstein’s general theory of relativity – for the first time in history.Thorne wrote this book in 1993 and therefore twenty-two years before they had first observed gravitational waves. Nevertheless, the book goes into the general theory of gravitational waves and the process of developing a suitable observatory for these waves – all of this, without using complicated formulas or the like. This is a theme throughout the whole book. Thorne does an incredibly good job in explaining black holes, general relativity, spacetime curvature and time travel (or rather the possibility of time travel) in a very easy, narrative way that doesn’t ask too much of an intent and interested reader. He uses analogies whenever the concepts get very complex. In no way, shape or form you have to be a doctor of physics or anything like that to understand the general concepts of this book. On the contrary, it is a great way to dive a little deeper into the topic for everyone who likes documentaries about space or is into science-fiction in space.Don’t be afraid if you don’t like maths. The most complicated formula in this book is literally (a+b)² = a² + 2ab + b² and it this is just additional information for mathematically interested readers according to Thorne.Basically, I can sum up what I wrote above in just two words: READ THIS. I know it seems intimidating, because it’s a thick book about physics. The truth is, I’m a physics student and it still took me half a year to read it. But nobody expects you to gulp down a 600 page NF about physics in one sitting. The time it takes is very rewarding, because you educate yourself while getting a general idea about what has been going on in physics for the last 100 years.Sidenote: Kip Thorne won a bet against Mister Stephen Hawking once and if that’s not impressive, I don’t know what is!4/5"
10,0393312763,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16130362-karl,4,"In this book, Thorne tried to write a pop-science book giving the state of play in theoretical astrophysics (in 1995, so obviously a bit dated) but at the same time making it accessible to the non-practitioner. He presents the development of physics up to the then-present day in a combination of theoretical sidebars and some very basic mathematics held together by character sketches, anecdotes, and biographies of those involved.My father bought this for me in about 2001, just after I'd dropped out of university. I read it cover to cover, twice, and came away with a combination of understanding and deep confusion - not from any problems with the delivery, but because the subject matter itself is deeply complex. I have a terrible habit of skim-reading, which one definitely cannot do with books of this ilk. The topics within - particularly the sections on relativity and event diagrams - require the reader to spend some time turning them over in the mind to reach an intuitive understanding.Having now finished my mathematics degree, I re-visited BH&TW to see if my opinions had changed. They haven't. It's still an excellent book, although, as pointed out earlier, somewhat dated. Nonetheless Thorne's writing has a comfortable, informal style and, as a (semi-auto)-biographical work on the most influential physicists of the last century, this book is well worth a look."
11,0393312763,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8101737-peter-tillman,5,"Kip Thorne, the Feynman Professor of Physics at Caltech, is best known to the general public for his 1988 wormhole ""time machine"" proposal. Press coverage included a photo of the author doing physics in the nude on Mt. Palomar. ""Embareassing,"" but didn't hurt the book sales. The wormhole work grew out of a request from Carl Sagan for a plausible FTL transport scheme for his 1985 science-fiction novel Contact (which I recommend). Sagan's request made Thorne realize the value of thought experiments that ask, ""What things do the laws of physics permit an infinitely advanced civilization to do, and what do the laws forbid?"" This style of speculation by world-class scientists has become popular (and somewhat respectable) in the last decade, and has resulted in some very stimulating reading, such as K. Eric Drexler's Engines of Creation (1986), and Hans Moravec's Mind Children (1988) and Robot (1999).My 1999 review: https://www.sfsite.com/10b/bh67.htm"
12,0393312763,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,4,"This book about gravity and black holes seems more like a detailed history of the last 100 years of physics, particularly the effort to unite quantum mechanics with Einstein's relativity theory. Throughout the book, Thorne discusses the personalities of the titanic thinkers involved and this provides the reader with a welcome relief from the long, technical story about black holes (for most, probably more information than you want to know). Thorne refers to spacetime ""fabric,"" but it's not clear how space or time is a ""fabric."" The effects of massive gravitational bodies on space is easier to grasp than the effect on time. The book's title includes ""time warps"" but ""time"" throughout this book remains a mystery. His diagram on time and space (p. 95) confused me. If one is moving in space, one is moving in time, yet his diagram has ""time"" as stationary, as a fixed moment of time. In a tucked away footnote, Thorne restates Einstein's formula that mass and energy ""are really different names for the same concept."" As mass and energy lie at the heart of all cosmic things, referring to them as a concept struck me as wrong. Also, if they are the same, what is it? Is it matter, energy or something else common to both? On gravity, we know that mass attracts matter and energy, but what is it about mass that gives it the power to attract? Thorne is silent or I missed it if he did discuss it. Thorne states that a free particle ""moves solely under the influence of its own inertia"" (""no external forces push or pull"") and also states that a body resists ""being accelerated by forces that act on it."" Does this mean that freedom - where the basic impulse of matter and energy is to move freely - lies at the heart of the cosmos? Thorne states that ""when gravity is present a [free] particle is one ""on which no forces act except gravity."" How is a particle then free if it's affected by gravity? Also, is there any place in the cosmos where a particle is not affected by gravity? Thorne writes about gravitational waves (""ripples of spacetime curvature""), gravitons or particles assocated with gravitational waves, and gravitational radiation. While these are central to his discussion of black holes, as presented these terms were hard to grasp.When gravity is weak, Thorne states that the Newtonian paradigm and Einstein's curved spacetime ""are almost identical,"" but Newton's theory doesn't work at extreme scales, as with black holes, which is where Thorne sees the effects of quantum mechanics. I don't know what that means of course, but this is still all mind-blowing stuff. Thorne is among the best out there in terms of what he writes about, the writing itself, and his ability to move the general reader along toward a greater understanding of a reality that is totally unlike anything we know on earth. "
13,0393312763,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27131192-arko,5,"This book is one of the finest work I have come across till date in terms of the content and clarity for any layman with an interest in Physics. Brilliant to the core. It is Kip Thorne's tour de force to form an account of the history and the details about black holes and study on the nature of spacetime in terms of classical & quantum analysis. He being the pioneer in gravitational wave detection strategies and expert in black hole & wormhole theories , some chapters are more like is personal account itself.This has turned out to be a perfect way to start my new year along with the wonderful discoveries of gravitational waves from merging black holes and neutron stars in the last couple of years. The grandeur of this book is the dive into the nature of reality itself which we learn through studying black holes/wormholes or singularities. Whatever we perceive is well attached to which frame of reference we are on.It reminds me of few lines from the work of William Blake here:""To see a world in a grain of sand And a heaven in a wild flower, Hold infinity in the palm of your hand And eternity in an hour."""
14,0393312763,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30982871-james-f,4,"My only problem with this book (apart from its being twenty years old) is the title; wormholes and ""time machines"" are discussed briefly in the last 45 pages, but the book is actually a popular account of every aspect of black holes, at an above-average level of popularization -- about as high as one could expect without much mathematics. Thorne, whose field is general relativity, begins with two chapters outlining special and general relativity -- Einstein's ""legacy"". The third chapter explains the prediction of black holes, which were not taken seriously as existing in the real world. The next two chapters are on white dwarfs and neutron stars and the Chandrasekhar limit, and the next two explain why massive stars must implode to form black holes. The 7th chapter is on the ""Golden Age"" of black hole research and what was discovered about them; the 8th chapter is on the search for actual black holes. The ninth chapter is on massive black holes in radio galaxies and quasars. Then there is a chapter on gravity waves, one on different ways of considering black holes, one on the discovery that black holes can evaporate, and one on the interior of black holes and the problem of singularities. The last chapter is the one on wormholes and the theory of time machines. The book combines the history of the discoveries with the actual science in a very interesting manner; this is probably the best of the books I have read this month, apart from the classic by Weinberg, and the historical approach means that although the science is somewhat outdated the book really never becomes outdated, because the history is still the history."
15,0393312763,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6265174-erickson,5,"It is an eye-opening book for gravitational physics, even for physics students trained in GR as it covers very broad topics and development of general relativity and black hole physics.What's nice to this book is that it has a lot of personal elements - how different important figures are different in their characters and the way they guide their students and how they come to accept and reject certain ideas, or even how certain people gets attention or not by the community by virtue of his character. It also contains various clashes between people that is hallmark of science as human endeavour. Kip Thorne nicely put in these elements which prevented the book from being just another watered-down physics popularising book.I especially like the way the experts guide their students in this book explained in every bit of important development and how ideas come to be disagreed or agreed between students and mentors.

It contains much more information about the historical developments of Einstein’s theories of special and general relativity, as well as the legacies that have been left behind in the discovery of neutron stars, black holes and supermassive black holes lying in the hearts of all galaxies. The book’s up close and personal look at the various scientific personalities involved in these discoveries (Chandrasekhar, Oppenheimer, Zwicky, Wheeler and many more) allows readers to relate to the struggles and triumphs of these great minds who are after all, only human."
17,0393312763,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21608852-george-moore,5,"What is remarkable about this book is that it stays relatively current, even after twenty years. The controversy on black holes has come to a pitch recently, with wild new theories and denials. The hard science, however, is here, and is laid out in a way that is accessible for common readers. I have to say, after reading a few other popular science works on cosmology, Thorne has a unique way of keeping the subject clear, and building a real suspense into the discovery and understanding of each new step along the way. I spent about a year reading this the first time, in bits and pieces, when time allowed. I found myself revelling in it, not wanting the story to end. "
18,0393312763,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34907719-stephie,5,"Although it's slightly outdated now and there have been theories proven and disproved since its publication, I would recommend this book to anyone with a keen interest in Physics regardless of their background knowledge. The book delves into the history of how Einstein changed the way Physicists viewed the Universe, the controversy it caused, and the discoveries of many other Physicists from around the world.Loved it!"
19,0393312763,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60036118-alok,4,"Great book .....I recommend this to almost everyone, Has a lot of concepts cleared, Love the Astronaut Story in the beginning, Scientific concepts put in the most elegant way, Must read for everyone, After reading this book.......You will want to know more about the subject"
20,0393312763,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27488361-ahmed-samir,4,Excellent book. Very good simplification of a number of physic concepts. Does need a basic understanding of gravity and an idea of stellar masses before attempting to read and fully grasp concepts. 
21,0393312763,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56337414-lora-carney,4,"I'm not what you would call an intellectual and I've never studied Physics, but I found this book easily accessible and even fascinating. I decided to read it because it was cited as one of the sources for the science behind a time travel series I follow, and I wanted to try to grasp the very real science behind the fictional events in the stories.The book basically tells the story of the rise of Cosmology and Particle Physics since the 1920s, explaining in layman's terms the leading theories, discoveries and the scientists who initiated the theories that we now accept as fact, proven through mathematical formulae where physical proof is still beyond our reach.It effectively starts with Einstein and his alternate ideas to Newtonian Physics and works forward from there. This sounds like it could have made for dry reading, but the personalities as well as trials and political conflicts that affected the personalities involved bring the events to life on a very human level. Sometimes it's even funny, like when Professor Thorne describes an incident where he made a bet with Stephen Hawking about the existence of black holes and when sufficient proof settled the bet, Hawking, with the help of a group of students, broke into Thorne's office at Cal Tech to sign off on the bet, which was written out on a document displayed on the office wall.The book as a whole gave me a sense of the global scientific community, which can be co-operative beyond national lines or competitive on a more personal level and even riddled with as much ego as the acting world at times. It explains the process for acceptance of new ideas within that community, which I had no idea of before.I found the book as interesting as many spy stories, and have only given it 4 stars instead of 5 because I had hoped to learn something about time loops from it, which was not really touched on despite mention in the description. It was written in an engaging style that is rare for writers on science, though the fictionalized Prologue suggests that the author had best stick to non-fiction.I enjoyed the read, and I now know a lot more about the subject matter than I did before I read it. Whether I read more on the subject is yet to be seen."
22,0393312763,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68411138-santosh,4,Good read. Black holes: when and where the idea was stated and how and into what it evolved.. A tale of the strangest thing in the universe.
23,0393312763,http://goodreads.com/user/show/100506586-isla,2,"One of the best, most clear set of reasons and reflections I’ve ever read. Everything he writes is brilliant."
24,0393312763,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2869857-mauricio-cardona,5,"I'm on page 66 and basicly it's taliking about the newtonian's physical laws and how a guy tried to find a flaw in the law witch states that light is measured the same and depends on motion so this guy is michelson and he created a technique that now is known as michelson's interferometry and he measures light in aether in every season and finds out that they all come out to be the same measurements.I'm on page 100 and this chapter was about the general retaivity that states that it doesn't work inside a black hole and it is said that Quantum gravity law's will be the set of laws that can. Also in the thirteen century Roger, Bacon Established the concept that science shoud base It's reasoning with experimental evidence. Also that Antoine Also created the law of conservation of matter which is the first law in thermodynamic which states that as much heat you put in that is not as much energy you will get.I'm on page 140 and basically I'm learning the diagram of a black hole and what sorrounds it for example the absolute horizon is in the black hole and the apparent horizon is the outer layer of black hole and basicly the apparent horizon sucks in all the photons that try to get away now what sorrounds a black hole is accretion disk which is basically a gas that could also be found in a nuetron star.FINAL REVIEWThe book I read was Black Holes and Time Warps and this story is (non-fiction) all about Theoritical theories which some are actually based on evidence and some are on hypothesis. On the travel to the universe you learn knew things like vacuum fluctuations which is basiclly a huge empty space filled with virtual particles. You also become part of arguments either theories are true or not, one argument is if worm holes are real or not, now believe what you want but what ask yourself how does all the power needed to time warp how is it all contained, you would need a force what force is used? and where do you get that energy? To tell you the truth I'm really skeptical on the concept of time travel.I gave the book a five out of five because I really enjoy learning knew things and complex things like this really great equation which I'm trying to learn and it's the Shrodinger's equation, now this connects with the book because It's complex and that's how the book is, and that's why I like it. My favorite word from this book is Wave/Particle Duality, I like this word not because it sounds cool but because I never knew what it means and it's definition is that wave's also act like particle like an electromagnetic wave acts like a photon and we know this because if this was not true we wouldn't be able to notice it's there and we know because it occilates the opposite charge. I recommend this book to anybody who like's science and like's to read."
25,0393312763,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58245160-james-jordan,5,"Review of Black Holes and Time Warps: Einstein’s Outrageous LegacyBy Kip S. Thorne. Dr. Thorne was a winner of the 2017 Noble Prize in physics, a winner of the 2016 Special Breakthrough Prize in Physics, the Albert Einstein Medal in 2009 from the Albert Einstein Society, and the Niels Bohr Medal in 2010 from UNESCO (among many other significant awards). He is the Caltech Feynman Professor of Theoretical Physics, emeritus. You can read summaries of his life, his work, and his awards here, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kip_Thorne, and here, https://www.its.caltech.edu/~kip/inde... and here, https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/	Dr. Thorne is an elected member of the American Philosophical Society. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America...	The word “philosophy” comes from the Greek words philos—loving, and Sophos—wise. Literally, then, the word means loving wisdom. In the Socratic dialogs collectively known as the Apologia, Plato recounts in the first-person the words of Socrates’ defense to the capital charges of impiety and corrupting the youth. Socrates famously begins his defense by claiming that he has no wisdom, that everything he knows comes from his rigorous examination of human and physical nature. It is in the Apologia that Socrates also famously said that “the unexamined life is not worth living.”	I cannot tell you who first expressed the idea that understanding the universe is essential to understanding life on earth. But I can say that I accept this principle as correct, and that I have read and continue to read books by Brian Greene, Neil deGrasse Tyson, and Alan Lightman among others in my continuing attempt to inform my own life and my fiction, believing that the best nonfiction is about facts while the best fiction is about truth. 	It was with this background and set of beliefs that in 2008 I first read Black Holes and Time Warps: Einstein’s Outrageous Legacy. The book begins with a science fiction episode about interstellar travel and the experience of approaching and entering a black hole. There are those who would argue, perhaps Kip Thorne himself, that the final chapter of the book returns to science fiction with its discussion of wormholes and time travel. More precisely, when I discussed this issue with Dr. Thorne, he said that he thinks the answer to the question of whether time travel is theoretically possible is controlled by the laws of quantum gravity, which humans do not yet understand well. In laboratories the kind of exotic matter needed to hold open a wormhole has been created, however. Although all fiction is composed of made-up facts, the best fiction relates truths, and in the genre of science fiction what can theoretically be true. Is it the goal of theoretical physics then to parse both fact and truth? I also ask, what kind of book begins with a science fiction story, from there delves into specific biographies, other historical events, and thought experiments, and halfway through the book the author surprisingly but elegantly becomes one of the characters, the book becoming part memoir? This is Black Holes and Time Warps; its genre is sui generis. The book is an achievement of literary invention that clarifies the greatest physical complexities: relativity and quantum mechanics.	Black Holes and Time Warps was published in 1994. In 2010 I asked Dr. Thorne if he planned to update the book. He said then that there while there had been significant advancements in the study of aspects of cosmology outside the scope of his book, there hadn’t been significant advancements in the study of black holes and warped spacetime to warrant an update. In hindsight, however, I speculate whether Dr. Thorne’s 2010 answer to my question about updating his book was incomplete. There had been theoretical advances in the study of black holes and warped spacetime, the stuff of science fiction, talk of building a LIGO platform in outer space, but at the time when we spoke about a possible update of Black Holes and Time Warps there had been no duplicable observations of physical phenomena to validate Dr. Thorne’s theories about black holes, warped spacetime, and gravitation. That changed on September 14, 2015 when the recently upgraded LIGO facilities in Louisiana and Washington state recorded gravitational waves passing the earth. These gravity waves could only have been created by the collision of black holes. Black holes must exist before they can collide. This discovery, proof of the existence of gravity waves, validated Einstein’s prediction of their existence one hundred years earlier. Since then LIGO has detected other gravitational waves. In fact, on December 3, 2018 LIGO announced the observation of four new black hole mergers and further stated with confidence that ten stellar-mass binary black hole mergers and one merger of neutron stars have been detected. Such a statement on September 13, 2015 would have been the stuff of science fiction: humans detecting black holes and neutron stars colliding by observing and analyzing gravity waves.I thus argue that Black Holes and Time Warps is more relevant today than it was when it was first published as facts—the existence of gravity waves—have been verifiably observed, turning what had been theoretical truths into scientifically accepted facts.  	The American Institute of Physics— https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America...— has honored Dr. Thorne with its Physics Science Writing Award in Physics and Astronomy. Black Holes and Time Warps, with a preface by Stephen Hawking, exemplifies why this award was well deserved. The book is written in plain but beautiful English in Dr. Thorne’s strong, easy to recognize voice. Like most great physics books written for the lay public, no understanding of math expressed in Greek letters is required to benefit from its explanations of the underpinnings of the universe. To accomplish this, within the text of Black Holes and Time Warps Dr. Thorne presents charts and diagrams, making these challenging subjects more understandable, making them more comprehensible, accessible to a mathematically challenged mind such as mine.	Within its pages, Black Holes and Time Warps introduces its readers to the lives and work of not only Einstein but of, among others, Stephen Hawking, Charles Misner, Niels Bohr and his student Werner Heisenberg, Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, Dr. Thorne’s mentor and thesis advisor at Princeton John Archibald Wheeler. Black Holes and Time Warps is a veritable who’s who of astrophysics. It is irrefutable that Kip Thorne deserves a place as a character in his book as he has been and is a major participant in the evolution of human understanding of the universe. The research for this book was impressively extensive. Dr. Thorne taped interviews with 47 leading scientists, according to the appendices on pages 585-86 of his book. Much of Dr. Thorne’s research was in Russian, largely because when he was writing it, a significant portion of Einstein’s work written in German had been translated into Russian but not yet into English and Dr. Thorne’s research included many astrophysics papers written in Russian that had not yet been translated into English. Making the subject matter of Black Holes and Time Warps accessible to a lay reader was no small feat for an astrophysical, biographical, historical explanation of relativity and quantum mechanics. Black Holes and Time Warps is one of the few books that the first time I read its last word, I immediately turned back to the beginning to read the book again.   "
26,0393312763,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7915393-simon-mcleish,4,"Originally published on my blog here in August 2000.Picador has the makings of a most interesting series of popular science books. The idea is to get a personal picture on topics of current interest, written by prominent characters involved in the research. However, as a series, it rather shoots itself in the foot by omitting any listing of the other books; this one merely mentions that there are four earlier volumes, information of absolutely no help in identifying them.There are problems in this book too, particularly the dull first half. I would imagine that, given their importance in twentieth century physics, quantum mechanics and relativity will be explained in every book in this series, and the length at which these explanations are repeated is really unnecessary. I feel that more writers should follow Brian Greene's example in The Elegant Universe, and keep the explanation as brief and to the point as possible, pointing the reader who has never read a detailed account to other books. (There can be few public libraries which would not have at least one good book on this subject.) Certainly, Black Holes and Time Warps could do with a good deal of editing, if not re-writing, in its chapters on these subjects.There is a sudden improvement as soon as the account turns to the renewed research into black holes following the end of the Second World War, particularly once Thorne himself becomes involved during the sixties. He is clearly quite a character, involved in smuggling manuscripts out of the Soviet Union to be published in the West, and in several bets made about then current questions about the detailed nature of black holes. He is also effectively responsible for the discovery of the possibility that if a stable wormhole could be created and manipulated in a specific manner without destroying it, then it would form a type of time machine. (The mass media coverage of this result included a photograph of Thorne ""doing physics in the nude"".) As can be expected, his account of black hole research includes much that is about the personalities of those involved; illustrations include private snap shots of dinner parties.The second half is interesting, well explained popular science; any reader put off by the first four chapters is missing out."
27,0393312763,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27172446-woflmao,5,"This book tells the story of the science of black holes (despite the title, ""time machines"" feature only in the last chapter, where it is concluded that they most likely cannot exist). It follows the chronological development of the theory, blending biographical facts about the leading scientists and their research environment with easy to follow non-technical explanation of the results. There is not a single formula in the main body of the text, but you still get a good conceptual grasp of what's going on.It is a very well-written book. The biographical presentations are sympathetic and take care to show how the researchers' ideas could develop - or not develop - in the research environment of their time and place. The main actors in this play Einstein (who started it all with his theory of relativity) Eddington and Chandrasekhar(who first thought and fought in detail about what happens when massive stars collapse), Oppenheimer (who, besides constructing the first atomic bomb, was the first to develop a theoretical model of a black hole), Landau, Wheeler, Zeldovich and Novikov (who refined the theory and trained many of the leading black hole researchers of the coming generation), up to Hawking (who included quantum theoretical considerations and predicted the evaporation of black holes) and Penrose (who introduced topological methods into cosmological research).It is a charming book and will leave you smarter than before, unless you already are an expert on black holes."
28,0393312763,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1409618-mattr76,5,"This is a fantastic book, and makes me wish I had become an astrophysicist. I've read a handful of books on the subject of cosmology and physics but where those have fallen short, Professor Thorne has achieved excellence. Other books present current theories (of the author usually) without much substantiation (not quite as fact though), which is understandable due to the typically advanced and/or esoteric mathematical underpinnings. Thorne overcomes this without beating the reader to death with equations by eloquently explaining the reasoning behind the theory, including what problem it was trying to solve, what alternatives there might have been, or what objections were raised. While he does this, he's also overcoming another shortcoming in this genre, dryness, by including human characters: the physicists who worked alone, together, or in opposition to others to unlock the secrets of the Universe. I especially found the passages about Soviet physicists interesting, how the politics of the Cold War kept otherwise cooperative thinkers apart, and how the nuclear arms race both hindered and helped astrophysics research. This is one small example of the connections Thorne shows between his field and others.Overall this is an outstanding work of science literature, even though it is 20 years old. Fans of Interstellar are probably already aware of Professor Thorne's involvement. In this book, especially the short story prologue, we can get a glimpse of the singularity from which that film sprung."
29,0393312763,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11165350-lauren,4,"I love books about physics, particularly books that attempt to explain our universe and its contents. In a parallel universe, one in which my math skills were quite a bit better, I would have become a physicist and joined in the effort to understand everything.In this universe, I am limited to satisfying my curiosity with physics books written for the lay reader. This was a particularly good one. It starts with Einstein's discovery of special and general relativity, and continues through the mid 90's, focusing much of its attention on black holes.The book is interesting, but suffers from the problem of being written by someone who is in this field of research. Why is that not a good thing? Because I think Thorne spends too much time discussing the research done during his period of research, not inflating his own role, but taking care to mention, seemingly, each and every physicist who has contributed to our knowledge of black holes. This is a very nice thing to do, but as a lay reader, I would have appreciated more of a focus on the big guns (like Hawking). My favorite parts of the book are those when he details how a particular discovery is made, pointing which parts of the scientist's thinking was correct, and which was incorrect. In this way, Thorne seems to capture that mistakes are critical to the advance of science.(Note: this is an older book - I need to do some browsing to figure out what has changed since its publication.)"
30,0393312763,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6963539-ala,5,"This is probably the best pop science book I ever read. Granted, I picked it up when I was still a young, idealistic undergrad -- not a cynical, quantum gravity shmavity, string-theory-is-crap, PhD. However, I think it would appeal to me even now. I love how the history of the gravitational physics is presented and the culture of physics and physicists. When I was reading it I didn't know, for instance, about the distinction between theorists and experimentalists, and I ate stuff like that up. And the anecdotes are also fascinating. I remember this one section about Chandrasekhar and how he did a bunch of his calculations for his work on white dwarfs with a hand computer -- as in turning a crank. Talk about machine language! Amazing how guys did things in those days... Anyway, Kip Thorne, Cal Tech relativist that he is, certainly knows what the heck he is talking about, but he also knows how to present in an engaging way. Highly recommended. "
31,0393312763,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23490280-philip-gordon,4,"I read this book when I was just going into high-school, and in sparked a long interest in astrophysics and quantum mechanics. Thorne explains difficult to parse concepts with an engaging and understandable voice, using numerous examples, while not afraid to delve into the nitty-gritty physics and math if necessary. His mention of a bet with Hawking was especially amusing, since Hawking brought it up in one of his own books (as well as the fact that Thorne seemed to have sealed the deal).Though my interest in the subject matter has waned in recent years, I still have a fondness for the way things like relativity, temporal distortion, star-collapse and event horizons were explained in this book. It's a handy reference to anyone wanting to dip their toes in the workings of the world, and substantial enough that you won't be left hanging in any slightly more in-depth discussion on the same. Would highly recommend to anyone with even a passing interest in the subjects it tackles."
32,0393312763,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48759791-hrant,3,"I bought this book in 2003 randomly, but never had the chance to read it until recently. The writer who is a scientist describes throughout this book the different discoveries made by different scientists that shape our understanding of what black holes are; their properties, existence and behaviour. There are photographs of people and illustrations and graphs explaining different concepts like space-time, hyperspace, Doppler shift etc. To me some concepts were a bit hard to understand for example electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations or virtual particles. The last chapter which was about wormholes and the possibility of time machines was more like science fiction based on absurd assumptions. Note: Some people involved in the area of quantum physics and astrophysics were the same people who did the research and development of the atomic bomb and the hydrogen bomb both in the Soviet Union an the USA. Some part of this book describes these developments."
33,0393312763,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54112145-landon,4,I really like books like this. Whenever I go into any type of store I'm always picking up books that is similar to this book. Any books related to the universe I would read. This book is a must have especially for someone who is interested in time travel. This book is basically a manual on how to go forward in time. Remind me of back to the Future you know. To me the book is well written and the book was everything that I expected and more. It's an excellent read. Good book.
34,0393312763,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2641971-faith,5,"What I liked best about this book is that it was very readable for the non-scientist/mathematician without over explaining things any intelligent, educated person might know. The topic is fascinating. Though some details are now outdated, it is an invaluable history of the scientific path from Einstein's theories to black holes. It left me wanting to read more."

38,0393312763,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63403903-peter-wolverton,5,Well written and mind expanding. Kip Thorne is a great writer in addition to being a great physicist.
39,0393312763,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3801050-mike-dangerous,5,"Mom gave me this in hardcover when it came out in 1994, as she knew I was studying General Relativity. I read it for the first time in December 2019. The book has sentimental value for me based on when I received it and when I read it. I had a good discussion with my mom about the book after I finished it.This is a great book for anybody who wants to attempt to understand relativity for the layperson and who has the patience to read a 600 page book which is full of technical detail on the science (yet with no equations) and narrative detail on dozens of people. Many of those people are normal grad students, post-docs, and professors who will be known only to folks in the field. Most folks on the street barely know of Thorne, Hawking, Feynman, Wheeler, Zeldovich, Oppenheimer, Landau, Chandrasekhar, and Einstein; though they may have an idea about Einstein or Hawking and perhaps some recollection of the others. The dozens of others described help paint a candid and naturally biased picture of a scientific network -- I found this refreshing and helpful for reinforcing connections in the scientific work (though possibly it is pointless narrative for some readers).Thorne deserves credit for being conservative and non-sensational in his writing in 1994 -- the book ages well. The scientific content is outrageous enough given its departure from the everyday physics on the surface of the Earth. And in the end, that basic hardworking approach to science made real progress. It is a nice touch that Thorn got the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics. Same for Rainer Weiss who was out in left field (MIT's junky building 20) working on this in the 1970s and 80s; he was still alive and got the prize too, along with another gravitational wave experimenter, Barry Barish. The prize was for the LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory) experiment which detected gravitational waves (ripples in the spacetime fabric). That's just one chapter in the 15 or so chapters of the book.Four stars. Plus a bonus star for long term hard work!"
40,0393312763,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31526875-francisco-rodr-guez,5,"I have loved this book. Both for its science and for its amazing insight into how science is done.Sciencewise: it taught me really well, with clear logical argument, about stars and their evolution (the best description of star evolution and how different types were predicted that I have read), neutron stars, radioastronomy, gravitational waves, LIGO, black holes, the completely baffling quasars, the different paradigms of black holes (e.g. as membranes, as electrical circuits, as generators... ), the relation between black holes and entropy, worm holes, time machines, black hole’s no hair theorem, Hawkin’s radiation, the inside of black holes, .... all fascinating.But on top of that, this book surprised me due to the light it shines on the scientific method! The amazing variety of scientific minds, each with its strengths and weaknesses, scientifically and socially. Some very creative and courageous, often wrong, but sometimes oracular. Others careful and rigorous. Some young and bold, others old and careful, yet some others young and careful, and others old and bold. Some caring about the team, others about the science. Some funny, some serious. The existence of mental blocks in the community. The influence that terminology can have on creativity and thought. The importance, or non importance, of marrying theory with experiment, depending on the scientist and the context. The effect of government and society on how science is done. The amazing and hard effort of experimentalists (e.g the story of radioastronomy from “im picking some strange noise” to increasing the resolution enough to find black holes). The process of having new ideas: be it from a long and hard work in a calculation, or from sudden genius insight before going to bed. It gives precious insight into how to supervise students (basically each scientist had its own way). Above everything else, the book successully transmits the passion and effort required in science, and its joy."
41,0393312763,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10974082-christine,4,"I've been reading this book on and off between other books, so it's taken me a whole year to finish it. Not ideal. Each chapter builds on the discoveries expounded on in the preceding, so forgetting what was covered in chapter 2 makes chapter 3 considerably more difficult to grasp. Not that it matters. Let me explain:Black Holes and Time Warps was published in 1994. It is, at this point, nearly 25 years old. Which means that despite its accessible and comprehensive overview of the discovery and development of the concept of black holes, it has become very outdated. For example, Thorne talks about the planning stages of LIGO. Short for the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, at the time of publication this project involved building two humongous underground vacuum tubes in the continental United States to detect and measure tiny fluctuations in gravity caused by, among other things, colliding black holes or exploding stars. As of 2018 not only does LIGO exist as visualized in the States, and has for decades, it has detected gravitational waves. Similar detectors were built in Europe and another is planned for India. What do their discoveries mean for our understanding of space and black holes and physics in general? You'd have to read a different book to find out. Now, if you want a book that will give you a really solid understanding of the physics of black holes and a general overview of astrophysics from the early 1900s until the 1990s, this book is an excellent resource. But if you want that overview to bring you right up to the present day, Thorne's high quality work should not be your selection. It's not that I don't think this book is a wonderful resource, because it is. I would just hate for someone else to look up after spending a year reading this and realize they too could have spent the time reading something twenty years newer."
42,0393312763,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21430140-jerry,5,"Despite being written over almost exactly a quarter century ago, this is still a highly informative book. It is both a description of the then-current state of black hole and singularity theories but also a history of how scientists had arrived at that point; and a highly accurate prediction of what would be discovered “in the early 2000s”.Reading his expectations about what gravity wave detectors would find, when, and how, was one of the most fascinating parts of the book, coming now just a few years after LIGO and other gravity wave detectors have become accurate enough and stable enough to detect Einstein’s predicted gravitational waves. A little of the history of LIGO is here; Thorne, at Caltech, was one of the founders of the project.But even more fascinating is the history of singularity research; how it ties together general relativity and quantum mechanics; and how physicists’ conceptions about how the world ought to work both advanced our knowledge and held it back.As physicists worked with astronomers, theoreticians were able to make predictions and see how those predictions stacked up against the observable world.From this rich information, the astrophysicists generated dozens of detailed models to explain radio galaxies and quasars, and then one by one their models were disproved by accumulating observational data. This, at last, was how science was supposed to work!Even more fascinating is how the observable world expanded as physicists predicted and found more of the universe to observe than just the optical, from x-rays to gravity waves.Another interesting aspect was how deeply the equivalence of matter and energy goes, to the point that black holes were predicted both by Newtonian and relativistic physics. If light is treated as a particle, or corpuscle as pre-relativistic physicists called it, the mass needed for a black hole can be predicted using escape velocities. Although the behavior of the photons is different, and wrong, under Newtonian calculations, the mass is correct.Toward the end, he also talks about wormholes, and how they necessarily mean time machines if they can exist—as well as reasons that they likely can or cannot exist.I picked up this book on a whim at a used book sale; I should have read it years ago. It’s a great story about science at its worst, at its best, and at the deepest level of our understanding of the universe."
43,0393312763,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50579622-jason-whittle,4,"With the recent photograph of a black hole it was good to get a history of the physics community’s relationship with this strange object. By watching the interactions of different physics teams and personalities it also re-enforced the curse of social psychology and the delays and false starts it fosters, with great young minds held back by professors past their sell by date. So many decades and ideas lost to Tenure.My one regret with this book is that Professor Thorne does not reflect on what that history teaches us. The Physics community continues to build each new hypothesis on other hypotheses, so confident that the ones that have been endorsed for decades are Laws of nature. It was so unfortunate that the term Law was used until the mid-thirties for what are essentially theories. By building one theory on top of another, on top of another, without reviewing anomalies in the first ones, great minds have been sent on what, in centuries to come, may be seen as empty wild goose chases. The longer the early anomalies remain unanswered the more science resembles religious dogma. Dr Thorne is so embedded in the language and the world of physicists that mathematical models for worm holes become as real to him as the mug of tea on his desk. Naked singularities, hairless blackholes. The element of conjecture has been forgotten much as if it was the second Council of Nicaea."
44,0393312763,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37763623-dipanshu-gupta,4,"What happens when one of the top dogs of Black Hole research writes a popular book on them? Absolutely nail it, duh! To be honest, I knew pretty much everything written in the book before I read it, including the math behind it. I had even read some of his tome, ""Gravitation"", written with Misner and Wheeler. What I did love about this book was however the stories behind the work. I had learnt a lot about Oppenheimer from my previous reading of Richard Rhodes' ""Making of the Atomic Bomb"", it's fascinating to learn how he worked in a seminal work on black hole collapse. My favourite person from the book (probably everyone's) was John Wheeler. He is the personification of a scientist who has one foot firmly planted in imagination and the other in reality. He has this amazing physical insights and a knack for having the right words (black holes, no-hair). Too many of his students grew up to become legends in their own right; Feynman, Berkenstein, Thorne, Wald, Unruh, Misner. Phew! Now criticisms. I feel like the book gets too technical at places for people unacquainted with physics. Tried but can't think of many more. Highly recommended. "
45,0393312763,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71002883-anthony,5,"This book had a profound impact on me when I first read it back in 1998, so much so that I feel it is worth reposting a review I wrote on Amazon.com around the time of reading. I was so happy to hear Professor Thorne was one of the recipients of the 2017 Nobel Prize for Physics. Once a reader embarks on the journey of discovery through this book, it is hard to turn back. Thorne manages to keep one interested, with each topic and chapter logically following from the last. He uses numerous diagrams, photographs and simple language to enlighten the reader. For example his illustration of how stars of various mass 'die' gives a masterful introductory explanation into white dwarfs, neutron stars and black holes in one diagram!This book not only describes complex cosmological phenomena, but gives concise accounts of the people involved and their political and social influences. It is essential reading for anyone interested in the mysteries of space and leaves the reader contented that he now has at least some comprehension of phenomena that everyone seems to have heard about (quasers, pulsars, neutron stars, black holes) but few understand."
46,0393312763,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31149090-tom-bzdu-ek,5,"I recently finished reading a book by Kip Thorne titled ""Black Holes & Time Warps: Einstein's Outrageous Legacy"". I have to admit that this was the best popular physics reading for me in a very long time -- even though the book itself is now nearly qaurter-century old!You may know Kip Thorne as the theoretical physicist that worked as a scientific consultant for movie Interstellar. Three decades ago, he also helped Carl Sagan with making the physics in his novel Contact more scientifically sound. Kip Thorne makes the impression of a rather introvert and silent guy, but his words are very deep and he very quickly gets to the essence of a problem.In his book ""Black Holes & Time Warps"", Kip Thorne discusses the developments of astrophysics over the past century. He begins with introducing the ideas of Einstein on special and general relativity, later moves to quantum mechanics, and finally he combines the two when discussing the physics of imploding stars. Chapters on theoretical developments are nicely combined with discussions of experimental astrophysics. Using historically accurate stories about the heroes of these fields and by expounding their experimental challenges, he makes seemingly arcane disciplines like X-ray and radio-wave astrophysics into a thrilling reading. He also ventures into less known topics in theoretical physics, for example how it is technologically feasible to extract energy from a rotating black hole (which I had no clue about before!).Besides achieving to extract the most essential ideas with only hand-drawn illustrations and zero equations, Kip Thorne also manages to discuss the intricate sociology of science: How some major ideas appear too soon and thus remain unappreciated by scientists for decades, while at other times the community is adjusted to certain way of thinking such that many people come up with the same discovery nearly simultaneously. Kip discusses the difference between American, European and Soviet organization of science and highlights positives and negatives of both, and also delves into stories, such as that of Landau, where the political regime strongly intervened with the lives of the scientists. Kip is also very careful to mention not just the big shots in the fields, but also the less known actors whose contributions were essential for the developments in science. Modern science is often not made by the big shots, but by the plentiful small contributions of the whole community. Towards the end of the book, Kip Thorne discusses detection of gravitational waves. Yes, this guy worked on LIGO three decades before it started yielding any experimental signals! Although when writing the book he was more optimistic about the pace of the experimental developments than they turned out in reality, he describes in an amazing detail -- and in great agreement with the actual data from 2016 -- the expected signal of from a black-hole merger.The final parts of the book contain some speculations about wormholes and time-warps. Even here, Kip Thorne is very careful to distinguish rigorous scientific findings from fantasies and wishful thinking. He clearly says that assuming that such exotic objects exist, it follows from Eintein's equation that this-and-that would be their properties, and that there would be these-and-those paradoxes appearing. He does not pretend to have answers when there are none. This is in stark contrast with books of Michio Kaku, who seems to present exotic possibilities as mostly sorted out, and who often fails to articulate fantasies from science.In conclusion, I found Kip Thorne's ""Black Holes & Time Warps"" an eloquent book that accurately reflects both the developments and the sociology in science. It's a long read (over 600 pages). Nevertheless, it was very enjoyable, and I am disappointed for not having read this book earlier!"
47,0393312763,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16072690-sahil,5,"The best book I have read in a long time. As someone with a lot of interest in physics and astro physics (however, only trained in Maths), I have heard phrases such as 'the star imploded to form a black hole/neturon star/white dwarf' dozens of times over the years and was never able to find explanations that found the balance between being too technical vs. too non technical. I found that Kip Thorne's book found the perfect balance and was able to answer the implosion question, and many other questions I didn't even know I had, with the perfect amount of technical detail that I needed in order to temporarily staving my curiousity while also igniting it to delve into the mathematics through other books.My only qualm is that the book has not been updated since 1993 and thus misses a lot of the discoveries that have been made in the interim (especially LIGO's successses). I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in astro physics. "
48,0393312763,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82627993-tom-jolly,4,"It took me about 1/2 year to read this. Obviously, the material is a bit dry. There's a lot of interesting history in here, but I was mostly interested in the physics. Sadly, there is zero math in the book, so most of the descriptions of gravitational theory were limited to somewhat vague descriptions; it's hard to talk about singularities, event horizons, black hole evaporation, and ""the inside of a blackhole"" without using any math, though Kip Thorne makes a valiant attempt. The book is huge, over 600 pages, and there is some meat in it, but the bits I was mostly interested in were lacking. I keep hoping to find a book that's somewhere in between a general audience book like this one and a graduate text, and there aren't a lot of those around. Despite the lack of math, this was still a good book to read, fairly entertaining in small bites, and quite educational, mostly due to the historical perspectives. "
49,0393312763,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59252999-roo-phillips,5,"A couple of years ago I emailed Kip Thorne and asked if he would be willing to chat with me about physics. He politely declined due to his press tour for the movie Interstellar (lead scientist). Just getting that reply made me realize what a class act he is. His character shined in this magnificent book. It is as much a history of 2oth century physics as it is a theoretical explanation of how black holes work. Thorne superbly tells both stories. It was a commitment to read, and it hurt my head at times, but I couldn't put it down. I'm sure it helped that I'm a sucker for historical physics, but that aside, Thorne is a master at telling interesting stories (significant portion dedicated to super bombs) and making complicated concepts easy-ish to understand. I assume his press junkets have ended by now, I think it's time to reach out again..."
50,0393312763,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8194637-useresu,4,"Finally :DThis is a huge book and not only in its size, but also content. It could’ve been couple of different books I think. Especially that some parts you read as a great achievement of human minds and collaboration showing the history of breakthroughs is not written by a single name you learn finally at the physics lessons. On the other hand parts of the book read more like a class handbook and are devoid of human factor. Both are good, but it makes the book read differently, which puts you out of balance. Finally it is a very good especially when it comes to understanding what science is about in its purest form, how it hoovers above any divisions - political or otherwise. It’s just very very very long and big 😄"
51,0393312763,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73614421-krityug-singh-nischal,5,"The theme of this book is amazing as well as interesting. I love to read this book as I read. It's about an amazing theory developed by Einstein which has some aspects which could not solve himself. Due to him not being able to solve them no more some are still a mystery. Still, there is a lot which has been solved and ready for us to look at just like what science called are ""Sleeping Giants"". These giants are so huge that our sun is a million and some times ∞ in mass, size and gravitational pull. They have no destruction property hence they can't be destroyed nor we can get protection against them."
52,0393312763,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11704304-kevin-schultz,4,"A third of this book covers general relativity in layman's terms, a third is specific to black holes, and a third delves more into the personalities and approaches of the physicists that put the pieces together. I thoroughly enjoyed the intro to general relativity. I have an engineering background so I understand some of the math at a high level (the book doesn't include them specifically, but they're easy to find on Wikipedia), but I never learned this kind of physics in any formal way. The minutiae about black holes became a bit too detailed, but you can skim sections without losing the crux of the book."
53,0393312763,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76948872-michelle-leah-forbes,5,"Prof. Thorne wrote this book at least two decades before he was awarded the Nobel Prize for his work in guiding the team that created the LIGO gravitational wave observatories. It's a wonderfully written and easy-to-follow guide through the science that guided their work, the engineering challenges that were overcome along the way, and the relativistic and quantum physics that inform their work. For those who are math-phobic, rest easy. Where math is required at all it's expressed in the simplest possible terms, usually by way of simple geometry and trig. You won't need calculus at all."
54,0393312763,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7604227-taweewat,4,"Great story about gravity and its development from Newton to Einstein to Hawking and many other physicists who contribute to this field. Being an insider as a physicist, Kip Throne has a privilege to tell this story in an insider perspective without other trace of suspicion about the topic. Great read for people who are interested in this topic, but might be a little too complicated for an average-Joe to understand some materials without some background in Physics. "
55,0393312763,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84494335-patricia-valimaa,5,"This book has taught and introduced me many ideas; the no hair theorem, the hoop conjecture, Penrose's use of topology to describe singularities and the importance and vital need to take into account different frames of reference, and different 'paradigms'. It has also given me a full outlook of how a difficult concept is tackled, and how one must occasionally follow intuition but also hold a skeptical view of every single process that may come into play."
56,0393312763,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16362429-vance-j,5,"Fascinating book that holds up incredibly well 25 years later. Kip Thorne is a very lucid writer who tells a great story. I was amazed that many of the ideas in this book appear in the move Interstellar - I shouldn’t have been so surprised as he was the science advisor for the movie, but still. Recently awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work discovering gravitational waves (he tells some of the work towards that in this book), I look forwards to reading more of his work."
57,0393312763,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11436449-christine-cordula-dantas,5,"An excellent book, with a clear presentation of concepts and good illustrations, intertwined with historical notes and personal recollections. The author is a leader in general relativity, having received the Nobel prize in 2017 for his contributions to the LIGO gravitational waves detectior. Chapter 10 deserves an update on the detection of gravitational waves (this book was published in 1994), as well as some of the biographical notes. 5/5"
58,0393312763,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68271236-ethan-hulbert,5,"Finally got through this. What a book! Everything you could ever possibly imagine on black holes and related phenomena over 619 pages.Kip Thorne is a very engaging author, although some of the parts in the middle move a little slow and feel back-and-forth in time. I think when Thorne gets to the parts of the story that he was around for, the pacing suffers a bit. But not too much.Absolutely loved the wormhole chapter.I can't imagine anything that would have made this book more complete."
59,0393312763,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85873074-william-boyle,3,Had some good stuff but talked way too much about history and people involved in black holes. It talked a great deal about the people who built the atomic bomb and that was really annoying. This book did further my knowledge of black holes and did raise some questions as well. Good read. Strayed far too much though.
