0,0195124413,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35276649-amin,4,"""فارسی در ادامه""A very informative and easy-to-read book on complexity and complex systems. Although I learned a lot about the computer science and biological perspectives to complexity and I enjoyed it, but I think the focus on these perspectives is too much and very detailed which leaves very little space for equally interesting perspectives, such as socio-economic approach, or the so called complex adaptive systems approach. Therefore, the book on complex adaptive systems by Miller and Page might be complementary to this book, if we share the same concernsدر بین چندین اثری که اخیرا در مورد علم پیچیدگی و کاربردهای آن خوانده ام، به لحاظ نگارشی و آموزشی بهترین اثر بوده است. میشود گفت که با رویکرد علوم کامپیوتری و با به کار گیری نظریات زیستی به پیچیدگی نوشته شده و بعد از خواندن این کتاب این جسارت را پیدا کرده بودم تا با دوستان متخصص در علوم ذهن و روشهای کمی در بیولوژی و مفاهیم علوم کامپیوتر درباره موضوعات کتاب گفت و گویی داشته باشم. اما در طرف مقابل، بسیاری از مسائل محتوایی و کاربردی تر، مثلا در حوزه های اجتماعی و اقتصادی یا به طور کلی جنبه های انسانی تر مغفول مانده اند. بنابراین، کتابهای دیگری که عموما بوسیله اقتصاد و مدیریت خوانده ها درباب کاربردهای علم پیچیدگی نوشته شده اند می توانند مکمل چنین اثری باشند. متوجه شدم که ترجمه ای هم از این اثر روانه بازار شده، اما اکیدا مطالعه متن روان انگلیسی توصیه میشود"
1,0195124413,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16160897-warpdrive,4,"Nice introductory book about a number of topics in the emerging field of ""complexity"". Complexity is a very broad subject, still under significant theoretical development, that touches upon many scientific fields such as biology, computer sciences, information theory, genetics, network theory etc, so this book occasionally feels a bit disjointed (which is unavoidable considering the nature of the subject) - it must be said however that the author manages to convey, in a clear manner, the main features of this fascinating field of research.Fascinating topics such as chaos theory (with a concise but very nice explanation of the ""logistic map"" example, which is a classic introductory subject), are competently treated by the author, and with enthusiasm and clarity. In particular, the author explains clearly how apparent randomness and chaotic behavior can arise even from very simple deterministic systems. Fundamental concepts are also addressed in a lucid way: starting from the concept of information, down to the very concept of complexity (considered from a computational, entropic, fractal, logical depth, thermodynamical, and statistical perspectives). Fascinating examples and studies of complexity (and even of life-like behavior) arising as emergent phenomena in structures as conceptually simple as ""cellular automata"" (even a simple two-state cellular automaton has been demonstrated capable of universal computation), provide real food for thought. The technique of ""genetic algorithms"" provides amazing results and demonstrate how complex solutions and ""intelligent"" behavior can emerge even from the simplest set of rules. The relationship between computability and natural structures is also explored, with fascinating insights. The idea of life as essentially an information-processing phenomenon is quite appealing too.Overall, the author explains very effectively, and convincingly, the great importance of thinking about complex systems in terms of nonlinearity, decentralized control, distributed feedback mechanisms, controlled randomness and statistical representation of information, and that a simplistic reductionist approach (according too which the global behavior of a system can be simply deduced from knowledge of the individual components) is in many case totally inadequate. This is an enjoyable book for anyone who is interested in an introduction to the study of complexity, especially if you have a background in computer sciences. "
2,0195124413,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22196506-robert-dormer,5,"I actually brought this book by accident, thinking it was strictly about computation complexity theory. Instead, it turned out be about the newish science of Complexity Theory. What a happy accident - this is currently tied for most informative and interesting book I've read all year. The scope of this book is broad, and covers a plethora of topics - evolution, computational complexity, turing machines and definite procedures, molecular genetics, immunology, neurology, graph and network theory, power laws, fractal geometry, information theory and thermodynamics, to give an incomplete list, all as seen through the lens of complexity theory. If you're already familiar with most of these topics, you'll still find new information here, and some of the history given for these fields is, by itself, worth the price of purchase. If you've ever seen references to computation and information in physics and biology, but had only the vaguest notion of what they were getting at, this book will explain it for you in a clear and engaging fashion. Engaging, easy to read, and consistently mind blowing. I can honestly say I've acquired a new interest, and that I'm better informed about a number of topics than when I started, thanks to reading this book."
3,0195124413,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22699228-matthew-quann,2,"Through no fault of its own, I did not enjoy ""Complexity: A Guided Tour."" The field of complexity has long interested me in the abstract, but I found this introductory text to be way over my head with respect to content. I was able to follow for the first 100 pages or so but, pun intended, it simply became too complex for me to handle. I think if I had a background in computer science or theoretical mathematics I could have found more to appreciate, but this is not to say that Melanie Mitchell's writing is obtuse or frustrating, rather it is the concepts that are puzzling. I also found the passages which related complexity to genetics and biochemistry most intriguing as they planted the notions in the fertile soil of my background (wow, that is just as terrible to read as I thought it would be). In any case, this may be a tremendous book, but it is leagues above and beyond my understanding."
4,0195124413,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3250760-chris-aldrich,5,"This is handily one of the best, most interesting, and (to me at least) the most useful popularly written science books I've yet to come across. Most popular science books usually bore me to tears and end up being only pedantic for their historical backgrounds, but this one is very succinct with some interesting viewpoints (some of which I agree with and some of which my intuition says are terribly wrong) on the overall structure presented. For those interested in a general and easily readable high-level overview of some of the areas of research I've been interested in (information theory, thermodynamics, entropy, microbiology, evolution, genetics, along with computation, dynamics, chaos, complexity, genetic algorithms, cellular automata, etc.) for the past two decades, this is really a lovely and thought-provoking book. At the start I was disappointed that there were almost no equations in the book to speak of - and perhaps this is why I had purchased it when it came out and it's subsequently been sitting on my shelf for so long. The other factor that prevented me from reading it was the depth and breadth of other more technical material I've read which covers the majority of topics in the book. I ultimately found myself not minding so much that there weren't any/many supporting equations aside from a few hidden in the notes at the end of the text in most part because Dr. Mitchell does a fantastic job of pointing out some great subtleties within the various subjects which comprise the broader concept of complexity which one generally would take several years to come to on one's own and at far greater expense of their time. Here she provides a much stronger picture of the overall subjects covered and this far outweighed the lack of specificity. I honestly wished I had read the book when it was released and it may have helped me to me more specific in my own research. Fortunately she does bring up several areas I will need to delve more deeply into and raised several questions which will significantly inform my future work.In general, I wish there were more references I hadn't read or been aware of yet, but towards the end there were a handful of topics relating to fractals, chaos, computer science, and cellular automata which I have been either ignorant of or which are further down my reading lists and may need to move closer to the top. I look forward to delving into many of these shortly. As a simple example, I've seen Zipf's law separately from the perspectives of information theory, linguistics, and even evolution, but this is the first time I've seen it related to power laws and fractals.I definitely appreciated the fact that Dr. Mitchell took the time to point out her own personal feelings on several topics and more so that she explicitly pointed them out as her own gut instincts instead of mentioning them passingly as if they were provable science which is what far too many other authors would have likely done. There are many viewpoints she takes which I certainly don't agree with, but I suspect that it's because I'm coming at things from the viewpoint of an electrical engineer with a stronger background in information theory and microbiology while hers is closer to that of computer science. She does mention that her undergraduate background was in mathematics, but I'm curious what areas she specifically studied to have a better understanding of her specific viewpoints.Her final chapter looking at some of the pros and cons of the topic(s) was very welcome, particularly in light of previous philosophic attempts like cybernetics and general systems theory which I (also) think failed because of their lack of specificity. These caveats certainly help to place the scientific philosophy of complexity into a much larger context. I will generally heartily agree with her viewpoint (and that of others) that there needs to be a more rigorous mathematical theory underpinning the overall effort. I'm sure we're all wondering ""Where is our Newton?"" or to use her clever aphorism that we're ""waiting for Carnot."" (Sounds like it should be a Tom Stoppard play title, doesn't it?) I might question her brief inclusion of her own Ph.D. thesis work in the text, but it did actually provide a nice specific and self-contained example within the broader context and also helped to tie several of the chapters together. My one slight criticism of the work would be the lack of better footnoting within the text. Though many feel that footnote numbers within the text or inclusion at the bottom of the pages detracts from the ""flow"" of the work, I found myself wishing that she had done so here, particularly as I'm one of the few who actually cares about the footnotes and wants to know the specific references as I read. I hope that Oxford eventually publishes an e-book version that includes cross-linked footnotes in the future for the benefit of others.I can heartily recommend this book to any fan of science, but I would specifically recommend it to any undergraduate science or engineering major who is unsure of what they'd specifically like to study and might need some interesting areas to take a look at. I will mention that one of the tough parts of the concept of complexity is that it is so broad and general that it encompasses over a dozen other fields of study each of which one could get a Ph.D. in without completely knowing the full depth of just one of them much less the full depth of all of them. The book is so well written that I'd even recommend it to senior researchers in any of the above mentioned fields as it is certainly sure to provide not only some excellent overview history of each, but it is sure to bring up questions and thoughts that they'll want to include in their future researches in their own specific sub-areas of expertise."
5,0195124413,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25360918-blair,3,"Maybe I should not blame the messenger for delivering the news that measuring or even defining complexity is complex, and there are multiple conflicting ways to try and do that. So the issues I hoped would be addressed, such as a discussion of emergent properties that goes beyond vague hand waving, were not addressed, perhaps because they can’t be. There are some worthwhile chapters giving examples on the emergence of complex adaptive behaviour from a large number of simple but connected components. We learn about ant colonies, evolution, the immune system and the human brain. We can see what happens, but I guess the why, the underlying principles, are only there in a shadowy form at present.Given the background of the author, I should not be surprised that the book quickly moved on to artificial intelligence rather than what was advertised in the title. We even get an entire chapter devoted to her thesis. It was all reasonably interesting, but it felt to me like a bit of a bait and switch.Even in the bait section, the chapter on entropy replicates the popular confusion on this topic. We get the entropy as disorder interpretation, complete with the messy room analogy, then the Boltzmann definition as the set of all possible microstates, then back to disorder. In the middle of it all, she really annoyed me with this throwaway line: “The relationship between information and physics became clear only in the twentieth century, beginning with the discovery that the ‘observer’ plays a key role in quantum mechanics.” No, that is not a discovery; it is a hotly contested metaphysical assumption.I have to wonder how much I should trust all the other information from outside her field, such as the immune system or the brain, when she can’t coherently explain basic physics.Generally, I thought the book was an interesting and pleasant read. To be fair, the title only promised a guided tour, and that is what we got."
6,0195124413,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5925863-bastian-greshake-tzovaras,4,"If you have a background in biology or computer science you might find that you already much of the stuff that is discussed in this book, but as it's 'a guided tour' and not 'the expert's compendium to complexity' that's more than okay. If you want to learn about the investigation of complexity without having too much knowledge about it you will get a great overview that is pretty easy to understand imho. For me it was a quick, fun read that put the different topics together quite nicely. And seriously, how couldn't I love a book that brings together von Neumann, Szilard, Turing, RA Fisher, Sewall Wright, JBS Haldane, Robert Axelrod and Stephen J Gould (lots or evolutionary biology/population genetics porn there!) — among many others! If not too many of those names ring a bell for you: that's a great chance to learn about some of the people whom I'd count to the greatest minds of the 20th century."
7,0195124413,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10468222-jo,4,"Very nice introduction to complex systems research & ""complexity"" in general.This book made me flash-back to my Computer Science studies, but in a very good way. It touches on theoretical foundations (Turing Machines, decidability, halting problem, genetic algorithms, fractals, laws of thermodynamics, ...) but the writing is very fluent and approachable.The author introduced me to the field of Network Theory, a science that builds on graph theory. It leads to interesting questions (and answers!) like ""Why is the world wide web so resilient?"" or ""How can we structure an organization to become more resilient?"" Good stuff!What I really like about the book is the way the author links all these topics. Before reading this, I never thought about the similarities between, say, the way the immune system works, how ant colonies forage for food and how a genetic algorithm looks for an optimal solution.If you're not afraid of a bit of math in your books and want an overview on topics like: * What is complexity? * How do we measure and/or compare complexity? * How does nature ""compute""? * Can we extract common principles from complex systems as different as ant colonies and the global economy? Then this book is for you!"
8,0195124413,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66212855-thomas-preusser,4,"Complexity is an emerging multidisciplinary branch of science. The origins of this new branch of science is in the realm of biologic ecosystems such as ant colonies in which a network of relatively simply programmed ""building block"" agents (i.e. ants) seems in net to exhibit a certain level of environmental ecosystem cognition (i.e. complexity). This cognition supports adaptation, and hence the term Complex Adaptive Systems is often used inclusive at the apex of human brain and global internet systems. The author Melanie Mitchell has a background in computer science, which is indicative of the multidisciplinary underpinnings of complexity science. The academic focus for complexity science comes from the Santa Fe Institute which was created by researchers from nearby Los Alamos Labs to foster muiltidisciplinary connections, primarily among academics.The author uses a broad brush that is successful in presenting what can be difficult concepts to a broad audience. At the same time this is an overview which progresses in later chapters towards the more cutting edge topic of network thinking. Network thinking extends and broadens the concept of ecosystem beyond what most people think of as an ecosystem which is biologic, to for example physics where there is an ecosystem of networked subatomic particles making up matter. This brings us to the 800 pound gorilla in the science room, i.e. the recent inferences of mysterious dark matter and dark energy which make up some 95.1% of the universe and are dark because they cannot be observed. The 800 pound gorilla in the science room wrestles with the age old scientific paradigm of making predictions and verifying with observation. Thus progress on dark matter and dark energy will likely come from a physics that has a strong dose of network thinking supporting inference, and this book is a good place to start. "
9,0195124413,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6338644-rushi,4,"How does an ant colony organize itself? How does the immune system work? What is the similarity between the world wide web and your brain? If you have pondered any of these questions, ""Complexity: A Guided Tour"" is just the book for you.1Any computer scientist who graduated in the last ten or so years would have covered some of the topics in Melanie Mitchell's ""Complexity: A Guided Tour"", and would have probably wished that they had Ms. Mitchell as a lecturer! Ms. Mitchell is clearly passionate about her subject. Her book covers a number of topics in the emerging field of Complexity such as emergent behaviour, computer science, genetic algorithms, network theory, etc. Ms. Mitchell does not get too technical, but still manages to convey the key ideas with clarity. Her explanation of Turing's universal computer and the ""Halting Problem"" are great examples of explaining a complex topic in an approachable manner. I enjoyed the chapters on genetic algorithms, computability and cellular automata. I wish she had gone into a bit more detail on Network theory.This is an enjoyable book for anyone who is interested in computer science or is mathematically inclined. Those without a background in computer science may find it a bit of a slog. Ms. Mitchell also provides generous notes and references for further study. I enjoyed this book very much."
10,0195124413,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8325737-philipp,4,"As a non-fiction book, this is very well written - it's on the level of an undergrad, with few actual formulas and very little ""jargon"" (most of it is hidden in the footnotes for interested readers). Since the author often intersperses her own personal views and experiences working in the field the book feels more like listening to an excited relative explain his or her field at a party than a technical explanation at a conference. I'm also impressed about the overall niceness of this book - for example, I would've found stronger words about Wolfram's research on cellular automata, which others have. As a rule many of the portrayed more modern scientists seem to have an ego so big that it stands in the way of truth - i.e., their new pet theory is supposed to explain most of biology but is just an oversimplified exercise that quickly falls flat once actual data is incorporated. But again, Mitchell doesn't make fun of these models but sees them as necessary stepping stones towards a better model.To summarize, like Basti said in his review, you got to love a book that brings together so many giants of different scientific disciplines."
11,0195124413,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3733820-keith-swenson,4,"The Science of Complexity is arguably one of the most important fields of study today because it is struggling to explain many emergent phenomena around us using a new tool of computation. As you can imagine, these are not simple topics to understand, but Melanie Mitchell does a marvelous job of of making these difficult topics understandable.Why is this subject important? Want to know how the brain works? It is a complex network of neurons, and thought is an emergent phenomenon. Want to know how weather systems work? Again, this is complexity. Want to understand how the stock market works? This is another complex system. How about an ecosys? Complexity again. Want to understand biological evolution? Once again, a complex system with unexpected emergent behaviors. Human organizations also exhibit complexity. Same with macro economics. All of these fields evade precise analysis using reductionist principles: there are no simple formlas. We have no ""intuition"" about complex systems, and so the emergent behaviors are often surprising, and even bewildering. However, new computing techniques are yeilding ways to reason about complex systems.This book is a tour through the most important contributions to the field, and Melanie Mitchell has a true gift to explain each step clearly and concisely, without any complicated mathematics. She has the best explanation of Gödel's Theorem I have ever seen.What does the book cover? 1 - Brief explanation of why the study of complexity is important2 - Historical background, Aristotle, Galileo, Newton, Poincaré, and Feignbaum's early work on chaos.3 - What is information? Introduces Maxwell's demon, the thought experiment that appears to violate the laws of thermodynamics. Information is the key to understanding the conundrum, but that comes several chapters later. Explains Claud Shannon's threory of information content.4 - Computation; a brilliant chapter on its own starts with David hilbert's list of 23 unsolved mathematical problems, and then immediately to Kurt Gödel's solving of a number of them, most famously the idea that any logical system (including Mathematics) has statements that can be made that can not be proven within that logical system. Then to Alan Turing's demonstration that there are problems that can not be decided (in a finite time) and invented the basis for modern computer processing. All this is done without complicated mathematics.5 - The background of evolution, which also seems to violate the laws of thermodynamics.6 - Simplified genetics and the similarity to computing machines.7 - Definitions of complexity, including fractals. These chapters have all laid the foundation for part 2.8 - Self reproducing computer programs and Von Neumann's contribution to the architecture of computing systems9 - Excellent chapter on Genetic algorithms, and how they can be designed to create answers that were not known by the designer of the program.10 - Cellular Automata including Stephen Wolfram and his discovery of extremely simple programs are capable of producing extremely complex results. This is a key non-intuitive theme: complexity does not have to come from a complex design.11 - Computing with Particles is a glimpse at the idea that what we experience as particles, could just be interference patterns in the cellular automata that underlies the universe. No, this is not a serious attempt at cosmology, but instead a demonstration of how we might think differently about reality.12 - Information processing in living systems explores how these same principles of computation apply in the immune system, ant colonies, cellular metabolism. What information is needed to coordinate these activities, and how is that information distributed. some compelling examples of how computation explains how real world systems work.13 - Analogies, a detailed description of some of her early research into a kind of artificial intelligence. She created a program to make analogies, and it is harder than you think.14 - On computer modeling, including the prisoner's dilemma and other models of human social behavior.15 - The Science of Networks is about how networks act in surprising ways, and these might explain some puzzling social behaviors.16 - Applying network Science to real world networks, such as the brain, genetics, epidemiology, ecologies, and human built networks like power and telecommunications. Includes description of some limitations of this approach.17 - Mystery of scaling shows some surprising correlations between some of this math and computaqtion and the workings of biological systems.18 - Evolution, again, this time with the help of what we have learned, and how Stuart Kauffman has determined that there is an innate tendency for living systems to become more complex over time.19 - ConclusionsComplexity is intertwined with computation. We all know how computers have brought us the Internet, and social systems like Facebook and Goodreads. What is not as well known is how computing is bringing in a whole new kind of science. These new ideas will has as profound an effect on the world, as Calculus did in the years after Newton discovered it. This new kind of computing works directly with large numbers of units, without having to simplify the system to an approximate model. From this research, surprising, unintuitive results are appearing, which may lead to being able to make more accurate predictions about how such systems will behave.The most interesting part of the book is how such models might explain the way that the universe operates. Each particle acts on each other particle, but in the past we have never been able to works up from there to the way that gasses work, or to explain things like turbulence. It turns out many natural systems work like a network. The study of raw networks can give us understandings that are useful for understanding the world.Really enjoyed this book so much, and feel it is so important. I would like to give it 5 stars, but because the the narrow focus on the field, I fear that most readers will find it a bit too esoteric. In these cases I use 4 stars. However, this is an incredibly important topic, and Melanie Mitchell's book in also incredibly important in providing a way to make this understandable to anyone willing to expore into this new field."
12,0195124413,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69801085-lee-kuiper,3,"Expansive but not comprehensive. The book gives a good smattering from a scattering of niche scientific fields but doesn’t really tie it all together satisfyingly. It felt like I was carefully examining a specific puzzle piece and then I’d set it down and examine another piece intently but it never fit with the previous or consecutive pieces. In the end I was still left with a jumbled pile of puzzle pieces. Granted I can see the contours of the individual pieces a little more clearly but I’m still frustrated I can’t see the finished (puzzle) picture.Basically, the book lacks a “big picture” structure to hold it all together. There could have been more of an effort to connect the nodes and try to describe the whole. Also, the book is somewhat abstract and mathematical—not overly so but some people (like me) may struggle. I really appreciated the frequent use of diagrams and the rare effort she made to keep things a little more concrete (i.e. Robby the robot).All in all, it was an interesting read. And Melanie Mitchell was a good guide considering the range she had to cover. She was articulate and clear. Her pacing was good. I did often feel like I somehow got behind the whole tour group and needed to stop and ask a few questions to clarify. This being a book, I couldn’t do that. I guess next time I will have to go on an actual tour to annoy the guide with all my questions.3.4 out of 5"

It was an interesting introduction to several new topics pertaining to complexity, such as the logistic map and cellular automata. The author does a good job explaining both why these topics are important as well as how the processes work. There were all lot of new topics that I really enjoyed hearing about.However, there were several points where I felt incredibly bored, specifically from when she began to describe her PhD thesis. I think the bits on biology could have been better explained - as a layperson, I wasn't really able to follow those parts as well as I would have liked."

It does not require any prior knowledge and is very well written.The most challenging part was the chapter on the halting problem and Turing machines. If you got through that, the rest of the book won't be too much of a challenge.

Natural science books. It provides a detailed introduction to complexity science, trying to explain how complex, organized, and adaptive behaviors emerge through simple interactions. Melanie Mitchell was born in the United States. He was educated at Brown University, in 1990 Nian to the University of Michigan Ph.D. Representative works: "" Artificial Intelligence: A Guide for Thinking Humans "", "" Complexity: A Guided Tour "", "" An Introduction to Genetic Algorithms "", etc. Table of ContentsChapter 1: What is Complexity?Chapter 2: Dynamics, Chaos, and PredictionChapter 3: InformationChapter 4: ComputationChapter 5: EvolutionChapter 6: Genetics, SimplifiedChapter 7: Defining and Measuring ComplexityChapter 8: Self-Reproducing ProgramsChapter 9: Genetic AlgorithmsChapter 10: Cellular Automata, Life, and the Universe “ Brazil: The Amazon rain forest. Half a million army ants are on the march. No one is in charge of this army; it has no commander. Each ant is nearly blind and minimally intelligent, but the marching ants together create a coherent fan-shaped mass of movement that swarms over, kills, and efficiently devours all prey in its path. What cannot be devoured right away is carried with the swarm. ” Kevin Kelly in the "" Out of Control "" in this book also mentioned a similar example. In creatures such as bee colonies, ant colonies, and fish colonies, individuals may not have very high intelligence, but when they form a group, they produce something we call "" intelligence "". Collective wisdom manifested certain wisdom than individual things. It is a whole, as a creature with independent thinking. In this case, group wisdom seems to be higher than individual wisdom. And Le Bon in his "" of The Crowd: A Study of Popular The Mind "" is described in another case. Human individuals together, but it will become more emotional, less rational groups. So why are these two differences? The collective formed by humans, in other cases, seems to have burst out with greater abilities. Relying on collective power, we can build spaceships and supercomputers, which are far from the personal ability. So, in the same way, will the individuals formed by bee colonies, ant colonies, and fish groups also appear mob? “ Although much is now understood about ants and their social structures, scientists still can fully explain neither their individual nor group behavior: exactly how the individual actions of the ants produce large, complex structures, how the ants signal one another, and how the colony as a whole adapts to changing circumstances (eg, changing weather or attacks on the colony). And how did biological evolution produce creatures with such an enormous contrast between their simplicity and their collective sophistication? ” Ant case group and the situation is very similar to a computer system, a computer may be able to execute complex commands, but for a single transistor, it did not know they belong to a great whole part of. It just performs mechanical operations by the procedures set by itself. Similarly, a single ant probably does not know how amazing the ant colony is. Perhaps, a single ant behavior almost entirely by genes determined. In this way, do ants have the ability to think independently? Even if ants have this ability to think independently, how much can independent thinking account for in unconscious thinking? Isn’t an ant to an ant nest what a microcircuit means to a computer? Does this indicate that there is a programmer behind the material world we see? The behavior of ants is good, or the behavior of humans. It seems that they are all programmed by a certain designer behind it. These things we call instinct, are they just code instructions written by him? Even in the process of evolution, is it just like we set the initial variables and evolution rules in the program, and then let the program derive freely? "" We saw that an explanation of ants and their social structures are still incomplete; similarly, scientists don't yet understand how the actions of individual or dense networks of neurons give rise to the large-scale behavior of the brain. They don't understand what the neuronal signals mean, how large numbers of neurons work together to produce global cognitive behavior, or how exactly they cause the brain to think thoughts and learn new things. And again, perhaps most puzzling is how such an elaborate signaling system with such powerful collective abilities ever arose through evolution. ” Even if we can understand the behavior of a single neuron, but we still difficult to understand wisdom, such awareness of what, in the end, is how generated from between individual neurons. We can see a single neuron, and we can also measure bioelectricity, but we cannot see consciousness. So far, no device can accurately measure what is realized? Many simple individuals, grouped, suddenly produce something complicated. How did it happen? “ Economies are complex systems in which the “simple, microscopic” components consist of people (or companies) buying and selling goods, and the collective behavior is the complex, hard-to-predict behavior of markets as a whole, such as changes in the price of housing in different areas of the country or fluctuations in stock prices. Economies are thought by some economists to be adaptive on both the microscopic and macroscopic levels. ” Many human games have very simple rules, but they can evolve thousands of variants. The board games include Go and Chess. Ball games include basketball and football. The simpler the rules, the more people can participate. And the various variants that may occur randomly are therefore more numerous. So in fact, in our real life, whether it is human nature or society, there are many, to build complex systems in simple rules and random variation foundation. "" The World Wide Web came on the world scene in the early 1990s and has experienced exponential growth ever since. Like the systems described above, the Web can be thought of as a self-organizing social system: individuals, with little or no central oversight, perform simple tasks: posting Web pages and linking to other Web pages. ” From our current point of view, the core idea of the Internet is very simple, although there are many complicated technical details. Even the designers of the Internet must have never fully expected the Internet to develop into what it is today. There is probably no technology in human history that is faster than the Internet and has shaped the appearance of human society more deeply. Perhaps some new technology will appear in the future, reshaping human society, just like the new technology that has appeared in history. From the large-scale use of steam engines to the large-scale use of electric energy to the popularization of the Internet. These new paradigms seem to detonate one by one, starting from a basic point, and gradually deriving a splendid civilization. "" The complex behavior emerging from simple rules in the World Wide Web is currently a hot area of study in complex systems. Figure 1.5 illustrates the structure of one collection of Web pages and their links. It seems that much of the Web looks very similar; the question is, why? ” What reference value does this have for our own lives? If we can set some simple principles for ourselves. And implement these principles for a long time. In time, it may evolve beyond our imagination. Elon Musk mentioned the first principles many times. My understanding is that civilization should focus on the essence of things. Don't stick to specific methods. Steve Jobs said something similar. Consumers will not say that he needs a car, he will only say that he needs a faster horse. “ Now I can propose a definition of the term complex system: a system in which large networks of components with no central control and simple rules of operation give rise to complex collective behavior, sophisticated information processing, and adaptation via learning or evolution. ” Blockchain is a large-scale decentralized network. If we compare these characteristics, it also has the potential to become a complex system. “ Here is an alternative definition of a complex system: a system that exhibits nontrivial emergent and self-organizing behaviors. ” In these two definitions, the author emphasizes self-organization. A strong central organization, no matter how strong its center, there are bound to force the incompetent local organization in individual creativity, there is no way to be fully realized. Therefore, each unit of a complex system should be given strong self-control. If the control of the center is too strong, it may weaken the vitality of each component. "" DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS THEORY (or dynamics) concerns the description and prediction of systems that exhibit complex changing behavior at the macroscopic level, emerging from the collective actions of many interacting components. The word dynamic means changing, and dynamical systems are systems that change over time in some way. ” Microsoft currently promotes three clouds, namely Office 365, Dynamic 365, and Azure Cloud. Where Dynamic 365 concern is the needs of enterprise applications. Select Dynamic a term like this, perhaps because companies are facing a rapidly changing environment. “Aristotle (like many theorists since) was not one to let experimental results get in the way of his theorizing. His scientific method was to let logic and common sense direct theory; the importance of testing the resulting theories by experiments is a more modern notion. The influence of Aristotle's ideas was strong and continued to hold sway over most of the Western science until the sixteenth century—the time of Galileo. ” From BC, 300 years to the year 1600 years, in which about 1900 years, the sure someone questioned Aristotle's idea, but look, it seems that no one can succeed to come up with strong evidence to refute his ideas. Why is there such a thing? Because most people are lazy and unwilling to think, do they directly accept authoritative opinions? Or it is because the importance of empirical experiments in Galileo before, has not been paid attention to it? “ Newton's famous three laws are as follows: Constant motion: Any object not subject to a force moves with unchanging speed. Inertial mass: When an object is subject to a force, the resulting change in its motion is inversely proportional to its mass. Equal and opposite forces: If object A exerts a force on object B, then object B must exert an equal and opposite force on object A. ” Physics and mathematics charm, probably lies, they tried to use the most concise way to describe the numerous hidden under the true meaning of things. These subjects tend to things in nature are exploring their natural curiosity, and always try to go deeper explorations. Even about Newton's three major laws, we can raise further questions. Why do these three laws exist? Is there any deeper reason behind it? “ Newton's insight—now the backbone of modern science—was that this law applies everywhere in the universe, to falling apples as well as to planets. As he wrote: “nature is exceedingly simple and conformable to herself. Whatever reasoning holds for greater motions, should hold for lesser ones as well.” ” I think that, regardless of the universe are very finely designed and produced or naturally occurring, it is the principle behind it should all be concise and intuitive. Complex things must not be the source. The place of departure should be straightforward. The starting point should be straightforward. "" The mathematician Pierre Simon Laplace saw the implication of this clockwork view for prediction: in 1814 he asserted that, given Newton's laws and the current position and velocity of every particle in the universe, it was possible, in principle, to predict everything for all time. With the invention of electronic computers in the 1940s, the “in principle” might have seemed closer to “in practice.” ” In this case, does this mean that everything in our universe is already doomed? The reason why we think that matter is unknown for the future is simply that we don't know all the parameters. If we have mastered all the parameters, then, in theory, we should be able to introduce all the changes. The so-called randomness only exists under the premise that we don't know the random occurrence. Once we understand the preconditions for generating randomness, then true randomness probably becomes pseudo-random. In this case, there is no secret in the future of the universe. Of course, it is almost impossible to understand all the pre-parameters, and even if these parameters are known, the computing power required to predict the future may far exceed human capabilities. "" It was the understanding of chaos that eventually laid to rest the hope of perfect prediction of all complex systems, quantum or otherwise. The defining idea of chaos is that there are some systems—chaotic systems—in which even minuscule uncertainties in measurements of initial position and momentum can result in huge errors in long-term predictions of these quantities. This is known as “sensitive dependence on initial conditions.” ” In a complex system, small changes in initial variables may lead to huge differences in results. This means that although in theory, we can speculate on the results, we must require our understanding of the initial parameters to be extremely accurate. But the problem is that our measurement must have errors. This contradiction has led us simply impossible to obtain accurate initial conditions and to predict future trends. "" Poincaré discovered sensitive dependence on initial conditions when attempting to solve a much simpler problem than predicting the motion of a hurricane. He more modestly tried to tackle the so-called three-body problem: to determine, using Newton's laws, the long-term motions of three masses exerting gravitational forces on one another. Newton solved the two-body problem, but the three-body problem turned out to be much harder. ” Newton attraction between two objects phenomenon has been well explained, intuitive look, the two objects deduction to three or even more when the object, which is probably a similar situation, the actual situation is not the case. The three-body problem is far more complicated than the two-body problem. And our universe there are astronomical objects, to accurately predict that their behavior becomes more difficult. Sometimes the outward extension is known, it appears to be simple, practical on, if we think deeply, but found not the case. "
17,0195124413,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7069868-john,4,"First of all, let's say that ""Complexity: A Guided Tour"" is a clear and understandable picture of what ""mainstream introductory Santa Fe Institute Complex Systems Science"" (SF-CSS) is concerned with. It's a fine book about what has now come to strike me as a strange tradition.There is a lot to like: all of the greatest hits are here with suitable background knowledge (bifurcation in logistics maps, numerical chaos, cellular automata, genetic algorithms and adaptation, information theory, theory of computation, various measures of complexity, game theory, network dynamics, etc.), I was particularly pleased to learn a few new things about complexity in biology (such as metabolic scaling theory and the complexity of gene regulation) presented as a bridge to topics I knew, which was what I was hoping for. There's a point of view, but it's clearly trying to be fair. What does complexity mean to SF-CSS? Complexity is the phenomenon where complicated behavior emerges from the interaction of 'simple' parts, and moreover some complicated aspect of the system's dynamics or structure continues to manifest even after simplifying those parts in models. This seeming interest in primarily the models themselves is a much different treatment of what complexity is about than from, say, Thomas Homer-Dixon or researchers who build world dynamics models. Why isn't ""Complexity"" about complex issues? or about complicated truths? or difficult problems? or problematic situations?In no small part, SF-CSS seems to be the way it is because it comes from particle physicists looking to the next stage of their career; physicists who have successfully transformed how we understand the small and are looking to the large. They are looking for the model systems of interaction; the simple systems that display identifiable complex traits, as this is how physical intuition works. Computer scientists and mathematicians, necessarily confined to their corresponding abstractions, also shaped this community. Therefore, modeling plays an oversized role in these discussions, with a chapter on computer modeling coming up suddenly in the discussion. The one character of modeling this book doesn't notice is that models are not benign: the adaptivity of people means that we stoop to the level of the models we are presented. There is the tragedy of when people following the models themselves. For example, we now know that if you teach an economics where people act in a self-interested way, they tend to act in a more self-interested fashion. There is also the tragedy that results when others are expected to behave according to models: the difficulty of handling an insurgent population is that they don't care about rational game-theoretic outcomes, but will not respect any power that does not have legitimacy, a legitimacy earned by being perceived as treated in a fair and decent way. Let's not even get into the tragic ways Darwinism has been misunderstood in the past or network logic distorts our lives today. Scientific models have a context beyond where they are introduced in scientific history, but echo back into society with the classical effects of structuration, making us into something new.In this regard, the capacity of analogy making and conceptual slippage is also treated only positively, as a source of innovation and creativity. Today, we know that unconscious substitutions are also the source of biases and confusions. Sometimes, these slippages take hold to the degree that they are no longer visible to a particular scientific community, such as we see from Philip Agre's critiques of some artificial intelligence traditions. Having said that, my concern is not that the material isn't sufficiently critical. I love a sense of scientific wonder and think it leads to a richer life. What I think is generally missing in SF-CSS (as presented here) is a kind of groundedness and specificity. To be fair, some of the subjects mentioned as not being mentioned (ecology, climatology, medicine) tend to be more grounded. This book is also a tour of the conceptual highlights of the subject, so maybe a conceptual focus is to be expected. Yet I fear that some of SF-CSS culture has internalized a bit of Rutherford's ""All science is either physics or stamp collecting."" I think we need more stamp collectors, particularly when some kinds of stamps start fading and shriveling up. A complexity topic notably missing, path dependency, also speaks to the need for a more specific and contextually grounded science.I know however that things are looking up in this regard. I heard a recent talk by Eric Smith (a well-respected member of the SF-CSS community), who said that it's time for the complex systems community to start taking the specificity of chemistry and biology seriously. I have hope for a more grounded science of complex systems."

19,0195124413,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5952398-ed,4,"Melanie Mitchell is an excellent writer and teacher. She explains things very clearly, providing enough detail to be informative without overwhelming readers who have limited prior knowledge of the subject. This is an extremely useful book for anyone who wants to become familiar with basic concepts in the study of complexity. Mitchell exemplifies the concepts by discussing the immune system, ant colonies, biological metabolism and genetic networks. I found the book informative and enjoyable. The book succeeds in conveying some of the excitement surrounding the new interest in complexity. My one reservation is that it may actually understate the revolutionary implications of the field by neglecting some of the more visionary ideas of thinkers like Stuart Kauffman and Robert Rosen. For example, seven of the nineteen chapters are devoted to computer simulation. Although Mitchell discusses many definitions of complexity, she never mentions Rosen's contention (in Life Itself) that the world of computing machines is inherently simple, and that true complexity is exactly what cannot be reduced to an algorithm and simulated by a machine. For Rosen, a complex system is a system of interdependent functional components, each of which is meaningful in the context of the whole. Recognition of this complexity allows us to take explanation to a higher level, not just asking how a component does something (the mechanism or algorithm), but why it does it (its relevance within its organizational context, which is part of a larger ecological context) I think this kind of explanation requires methods of contextual interpretation that are more common in the humanities and social sciences, consistent with Kauffman's call (in Investigations) for a new union of art and science. Scientists doing computer simulations can evade the problem of investigating natural contexts that may be boundless and changing, since they get to define a fixed context for the machine when they write a program. They tell the machine what game to play, what kind of network to build, what pattern to look for in the data. The machine cannot and need not construct its own context within which its actions can be meaningful to itself. Mitchell is well aware that our computers do not yet construct meaning, function or purpose--she calls it AI's hardest problem--but she seems to feel that this can be overcome with more sophisticated machines and programming. So we keep using mechanical models for natural systems that some of our deepest thinkers believe to be irreducible to mechanics. In an effort to get a machine to do something meaningful, Mitchell wrote a program named ""Copycat"" to get a computer to make analogies, under the direction of Douglas Hofstadter. She simplified the problem by asking the computer to work with strings of letters, solving problems such as ""abc is to abd as mrrjjj is to ?"" She operationalized some basic concepts for the computer, such as rightmost, leftmost, successor and predecessor, and programmed it to build on those concepts as it made associations. After six years of very smart programming (and a doctoral dissertation), she got the computer to complete analogies sensibly. (Its most common solution to the problem above was mrrkkk, but occasionally it came up with the more subtle mrrjjjj--get it?) She has discovered a possible mechanism--a very elaborate one at that--by which a system could recognize a certain kind of pattern in the data. But if we ask, why this pattern, the answer remains simple. The machine seeks the kind of pattern we told it to look for. If we were studying a natural system, the answer would be inherently complex, since we would have to understand what patterns the system itself looks for, by seeing their relevance within its own developing organizational and ecological context. I don't see how that understanding could be expressed in an algorithm. I agree with Kauffman that the biosphere ""is doing something literally incalculable, nonalgorithmic."" I wish that the book had included some discussion of these issues, which a science of true complexity must address. "
20,0195124413,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62618304-ali,5,"I didn't wanna write any review, but this book was really perfect and persuade me to bring some paragraphs :“One striking instance of Evo-Devo in action is the famous example of the evolution of finches’ beaks. As I described in chapter 5, Darwin observed large variations in beak size and shape among finches native to the Galápagos Islands. Until recently, most evolutionary biologists would have assumed that such variations resulted from a gradual process in which chance mutations of several different genes accumulated. But recently, a gene called BMP4 was discovered that helps control beak size and shape by regulating other genes that produce bones. The more strongly BMP4 is expressed during the birds’ development, the larger and stronger their beaks. A second gene, called calmodulin, was discovered to be associated with long, thin beaks. As Carol Kaesuk Yoon reported in the New York Times, To verify that the BMP4 gene itself could indeed trigger the growth of grander, bigger, nut-crushing beaks, researchers artificially cranked up the production of BMP4 in the developing beaks of chicken embryos. The chicks began growing wider, taller, more robust beaks similar to those of a nut-cracking finch …. As with BMP4, the more that calmodulin was expressed, the longer the beak became. When scientists artificially increased calmodulin in chicken embryos, the chicks began growing extended beaks, just like a cactus driller …. So, with just these two genes, not tens or hundreds, the scientists found the potential to re-create beaks, massive or stubby or elongated. The conclusion is that large changes in the morphology of beaks (and other traits) can take place rapidly without the necessity of waiting for many chance mutations over a long period of time.  Another example where Evo-Devo is challenging long-held views about evolution concerns the notion of convergent evolution. In my high school biology class, we learned that the octopus eye and the human eye—greatly different in morphology—were examples of convergent evolution: eyes in these two species evolved completely independently of one another as a consequence of natural selection acting in two different environments in which eyes were a useful adaptation. However, recent evidence has indicated that the evolution of these two eyes was not as independent as previously thought. Humans, octopi, flies, and many other species have a common gene called PAX6, which helps direct the development of eyes. In a strange but revealing experiment, the Swiss biologist Walter Gehring took PAX6 genes from mice and inserted them into the genomes of fruit flies. In particular, in different studies, PAX6 was inserted in three different parts of the genome: those that direct the development of legs, wings, and antennae, respectively. The researchers got eerie results: eye-like structures formed on flies’ legs, wings, and antennae. Moreover, the structures were like fly eyes, not mouse eyes. Gehring’s conclusion: the eye evolved not many times independently, but only once, in a common ancestor with the PAX6 gene. This conclusion is still quite controversial among evolutionary biologists. Although genetic regulatory networks directed by master genes can produce great diversity, they also enforce certain constraints on evolution. Evo-Devo scientists claim that the types of body morphology (called body plans) any organism can have are highly constrained by the master genes, and that is why only a few basic body plans are seen in nature. It’s possible that genomes vastly different from ours could result in new types of body plans, but in practice, evolution can’t get us there because we are so reliant on the existing regulatory genes. Our possibilities for evolution are constrained. According to Evo-Devo, the notion that “every trait can vary indefinitely” is wrong.”Excerpt From: Mitchell, Melanie. “Complexity.” iBooks. "
21,0195124413,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1879990-adam,2,"It's funny the ideas you get about books before you read them. I for some reason got the sense that this would be long and dense and impactful, and put off reading it for that reason. The truth is that it's almost entirely vacuous. The writing is plain and occasionally condescending, but the real sin is that it spends so much time retreading tangential intellectual histories. I know not everyone comes into this book off of two in-depth histories of biology, but it's a bit cheeky to just present chapters worth of wikipedia-tier descriptions of evolutionary concepts and never acknowledge that this is not, in fact, what ""complexity"" is. Mitchell lays out the conceptual space that Complexity inhabits, a realm that vaguely transcends mechanistic theories through terms like ""chaos"" and ""emergence"", makes some vast promises on what it can deliver, and then kicks the can down the road for a dozen chapters worth of much smaller ideas, most of which are just contexts where complexity occurs. At best, they're distinct concepts like network theory, genetic algorithms, cellular automata, and chaos theory, all of which have clearly defined uses on their own. They just never add up into anything broader. Coming out of a deep dive into semiotics, it was also a bit frustrating to see her bring up so many problems it addresses, even ones from related disciplines like cybernetics, and yet never mention it at all. I know semiotics could easily feel like another one of the wishy-washy dead-end science-adjacent fields that complexity itself gets accused of being. Still, it does seem like it would help define the terms here a bit. I'm not convinced complexity is an empty box, because plenty of the things she's put in it seem valid and useful. Unlike semiotics, though, I'm just entirely unconvinced that the box itself is a meaningful new paradigm, that the pieces inside necessarily belong together, or that they're really disjunct from existing approaches."
22,0195124413,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1480967-david,4,"I finished Melanie Mitchell's Complexity, a Guided Tour a few days ago, and it was pretty neat. Mitchell is studying complex systems, and common properties that a variety of complex systems demonstrate (for instance, scale-free behavior). She reviewed Hofstadter's approach to Gödelian incompleteness, and gave an excellent overview of many of the current approaches to genetics. The most surprising thing I learned from the book was that the model of genetic encoding of DNA which I had been taught is not correct: I had learned that one sequence coded for precisely one gene - this has been replaced with a model where a sequence codes for multiple genes depending on the actions of the gene regulators, where it is started and stopped, etc. This of course renders our whole approach to biotechnology regulation, intellectual property, etc, as irrelevant as the union of phlogiston chemists, and that actually makes me vastly more concerned that we are not effectively regulating the research and development of genetic modifications in both animals and plants.I was also surprised that she mentioned climate change, but did not delve into how climate science would necessarily be impacted by some of the complexity seen in other phenomena - she goes into great length in several places to point out that mistaking the map for the territory is easy to do, but then doesn't question whether or not that has happened in climate science.It's a good book. "
23,0195124413,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4745159-michael-quinn,4,"Complexity is a very broad subject that touches upon many scientific fields that hold a prominent place in the popular imagination: chaos, information theory, molecular biology, artificial intelligence. For that very reason, it makes a great popular science book, since there are a lot of topics to jump around in. At the same time, a reader might walk away without ever truly understanding what complexity is. That's OK, since the term still lacks a rigorous definition among most scientists.Mitchell is a solid writer, and she does a good job balancing the needs of being thorough with the desire to be accessible. There is some mathematics condescension here (statements like ""remember in high school""), which is unfortunate but seems inevitable given our assumptions about the book-reading public.The book can also seem a little disjointed at times, since its connecting thread seems to be ""hey, this is neat!"" It can also seem repetitive to those who have read a popular science book in a similar field (like Gleick's The Information).Nonetheless, if only for the amazing introduction to metabolic theory, this book is a must read. It's bristling with interesting new ideas, and it's written in a welcoming manner. People who like science, computing, mathematics or just big concepts will definitely enjoy."
24,0195124413,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3692137-xing-chen,4,"One of the things I enjoyed most about Complexity was the author's description of how she entered the field and embarked upon research under the tutelage of Hofstadter. As a young research scientist at the start of my career, I found the description very encouraging and insightful.I particularly liked the chapter that described her work in some detail- the iterative process of running 'codelets' on statements to extract meaningful relationships between elements and generate analogies. The material covered, aside from that chapter, provided a basic introduction to the fields that are most readily associated with the science of complexity. As I'm already familiar (at a rudimentary level) with concepts such as DNA replication, Turing machines, fractals, cellular automata, genetic algorithms, scale-free networks, and the like, these chapters served to refresh my memory and consolidate key principles, and did not provide fresh insights that could be found elsewhere. This makes Complexity appropriate for beginners, rather than for readers who are seeking vast amounts of technical detail and in-depth coverage."

However, I'm relaxed about that now because it seems there IS no such unifying concept (yet).Highly recommended book that touches on so many interesting topics. Looking at them through the lens of complexity makes them even more interesting. (Computation, genetics, the immune system, ant behaviour, the world-wide web, power distribution networks, cellular automata, randomness, fractals...)Time will come, I'm sure, when the study of any scientific/technical topic (as opposed to humanities topics) other than the trivial, will require ideas from this field.What I got out of the book was the realization that my conception that ""the world is a complex place"" is true to a degree which I hadn't conceived before.

Melanie Mitchell was a student of Douglas Hofstadter (...maybe I'll finally get around to reading GEB now!) and was at SFI for a time. Her writing is clear and accessible, more so than many other scientist-writers I've read this year (*cough* Hidalgo *cough*) –– terms clearly defined, controversial theories given fair treatment from both sides, unafraid to dive into technical details where helpful, a measured and nuanced tone that does justice to the ambiguities of a nascent field –– and the topics cover a wide range (a sampler: the second law of thermodynamics, information theory, chaos, evolution, networks, game theory / the evolution of cooperation, computation). One could conceivably read specialized books about any of these topics, but she communicates the most important developments in these fields clearly. I also appreciate the entertaining anecdotes about some remarkable people (von Neumann, Wolfram, etc), and even the gratuitous pictures of so many scientists :D The section that most tickled my brain was III: Computation Writ Large. I remember programming the Game of Life in my intro to CS class, but the significance of cellular automata was lost to me then. Decentralized control, what – this is a completely different paradigm from all the computing I know (and in fact, do on a daily basis.) It's a little mind boggling to realize that you can't quite predict the behavior of the whole from the per-cell rule chosen (there's a strong parallel between this and chaos, of course: the power of non linearities), the implication being: it might not be obvious how to pick an exact rule to create the outcome we want in these systems; we can't just choose / design the correct algorithm. Good thing we have meta algorithms (genetic, etc)! But there's still something dissatisfying about not being able to intuit or analytically determine the answer. The human brain strains to find universal patterns and elegant rules! If our consciousness were structured differently, maybe this would be more comprehensible to us? (I'm thinking of Ted Chiang's ""Story of Your Life"".) Do the common patterns across many complex systems (eg exploration / exploitation) hint almost at something fundamental to be discovered, or are these are all just contingencies of evolution... Anyhow, lots of interesting ideas and developments in this field. I will stay tuned."
38,0195124413,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86576157-minervas-owl,5,"I read Mitchell Waldrop's Complexity when I was a college kid, and I enjoyed it. Chaos and unpredictability seem far more interesting than feedback loops and control of linear systems, which I was studying in the classroom. The book even had something to do with my change of major to economics. But now I think about it, Waldorf focuses much more on scientists who study complexity than complexity itself.  In contrast, Melanie Mitchell makes a genuine effort to help readers see complexity playing out in front of their eyes. She covers a kaleidoscope of topics in this book: logistic map, fractals, Turing machine, cellular automata, immune systems, metabolism, and genetic networks. The topics scatter around various scientific fields, but they all showcase one theme: the interaction of components leads to complex global behavior on a larger scale, unexplainable by knowledge of the individual components themselves. Sometimes, the complex global behavior looks like a demon's work and causes headaches, such as fluid turbulence. Sometimes it looks like a miracle, such as how the Non-von-Neumann-style machine could do universal computing without CPU and RAM, how genetic networks create human beings using only 25,000 genes, and how stomata networks of plants does decentralized optimization. I like Melanie's two programming examples the most. In Robby the can-collecting robot game and the one-dimensional majority classification game, she unveiled the power of local-rule-based algorithms. In addition to that, she didn't find the solutions by deducing from knowledge. Instead, she used the genetic algorithm. The solutions turn out interpretable, but they are hard to think of in the first place. And I am left to wonder the force of genetic algorithm in finding the dark corners of design space. I would be interested in coding these two games myself."
39,0195124413,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44289250-robert-martin,5,"A brilliant introduction to the nascent field of complexity science – Mitchell really does a fantastic job of illuminating the (brief-ish) history of the subject and exploring the central tenets, however fluid they may be. This book is an excellent companion to Gödel Escher Bach, on which no further comment is needed.Complexity shows up in diverse fields like physics, economics, biology, and computer science. One of the most fascinating things is self-reference, for example, DNA not only contains the instructions for how to build proteins, but it also contains instructions to build a parser (the ribosomes) for itself. Perhaps translating this into the realm of AI might yield some interesting results.Mitchell is clearly an experienced scientist, and this comes through in the way she discusses the material: nothing is presented as 'the truth' – even for the work of scientists whom Mitchell clearly respects, she provides a very balanced view with many criticisms. There is a good amount of anecdote, and it is pretty readable, though some of the concepts (like Turing’s undecidability) are a bit funky. I find interesting that Mitchell alludes to the fact that the current academic field of complex systems itself is very much similar to a pre-emergent complex system, where there are many individual undercurrents but currently lacking a new generation to demonstrate a cohesive narrative. It’s very tempting."
40,0195124413,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61750298-yvo-hunink,4,"Where the majority of complexity books is hard stuff to get through, Mitchell has done a great job of writing a more comprehensible piece. A clear history of the field, together with some important fundamental properties of complex systems are now much cleares to me, such as bifurcations, fractal dimensions, and small-network and scale-free behaviors.What was new to me, even though in retrospect I should have seen it with Kauffman too, was the concept of Cellular Automata. It truly does help me understand much better how machine learning algorithms can learn to find patterns with the help of emergent behavior.Especially the impact that this field seems to have on understanding genetics is noteworthy. We are much more similar to other life forms than we thought, with the help of 'strange attracting' behavior from regulating genes.While I made many notes during the writing of this, referring to potential applications in the social sciences, specifically in local city government, I would have like Mitchell to dive a little bit deeper in this aspect of complex (adaptive) systems. Maybe there is still too much mystery, but I also have found many interesting links in fractal dimensions in the behavior of fish relating to spacial environments, which we can potentially generalize to human behavior in the physical space. Therefore, not the full score for this one, but a great book to read."
41,0195124413,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31584402-mbogo-j,5,"Complexity like theoretical physics is one of those fields of knowledge that always has something that interests me. Every year my books read list features a book or two from these fields. I've been out of the complexity game for a while now and needed sort of a refresher course to get into the mood. The last time I was on its beat, I got really interested on fractals and Mandelbrot sets, ended up doing some side research in the area. After this book I might do some deep dive on the evolution development idea which I found to be very fascinating.This book is a good intro albeit a bit complicated on a few topics. I found it had the right depth and I vastly enjoyed the areas which were interesting to me. It had a computer science bent and in areas of abstract logic which are of mild interest to me, I maintained a sort of detached reading attitude and just looked for the gist of things.[I tend to prefer speculative fields to cold calculating logic] These areas are for comp science die-hards or your cup of tea if you enjoy thinking about permutations of logic gates. Still it is a good book on complexity and I believe accessible to anyone with an interest in complexity."
42,0195124413,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3346245-deane-barker,5,"A lovely book that acts as a survey of the wide world of disciplines and research that could fit under the banner of ""complexity.""There are a lot: network/graph theory, cellular automaton, self-organization systems, Turing machines, power laws, evolution, etc. Mitchell covers each one, and circles back at the end to discuss the (sometimes controversial) state of complexity science and research.The subtitle of ""a guided tour"" is apt. Mitchell doesn't go too deep on any one thing. She covers a survey of all sorts of things from a distance. Each one refers back to previous ones, but not so much that you have to have incremental understanding. There were absolutely subjects that mystified me (ex: The Halting Problem), but I still love the book as a whole.If you have even a passing interest in complexity theory and complex systems but don't know where to start -- this is your book."
43,0195124413,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55810171-bhaskar-kumawat,5,"This book is a beautifully written introduction to the concept of complexity science. Instead of spending too much time on definitions and formalism, it immediately introduces the five cornerstones of the study of complex systems - statistical physics, dynamical systems, information theory, computation and networks - and talks about how these are linked to each other.There is, as of now, no universal theory of complexity and the Dr. Mitchell doesn't bias towards the existence of such a thing. Instead she accurately describes the study of complexity as a study of systems taking inspiration from the five fields mentioned above - something that is now becoming commonplace. A bit heavier on the computation side, but that's exactly what I like so no complaints. In fact, I now feel really interested in studying a bit of computation theory in more detail."
44,0195124413,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8156215-ann,4,"This book is a great introduction to the topic of complexity with clear and engaging writing. Mitchell lines out the thoughts, difficulties and benefits, and varied examples of how complexity is being investigated in computer science, biology, neuroscience, ecology, and more. She highlights exciting ideas with well presented examples, includes some of the personalities of those most prominent in these investigations, and also clearly explains where answers, questions, and results get ambiguous and contentious. Topics included are computer programming, fractals, chaos, and other interesting ideas, all put forth easily. The book includes notes by chapter, a bibliography, and index.Highly recommended."
45,0195124413,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62306747-hakan,5,"After giving brief and concise information about physics, computer science, biology, genetics,fractals and genetic algorithms, universal computers, game theory, entropy, information theory, networks, thermodynamics, mathematics and its masters and many disciplines, she examines the relation of all these disciplines to Complexity Science. The author shows the opportunities that complexity science can achieve. Even the concepts that form the basis of Complexity science have not yet formed a common vocabulary. And the author complains about it, but hopeful. VERY INSTRUCTIVE AND FULL OF USEFUL INFORMATION. RECOMMENDED."
46,0195124413,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46186153-kartikeya-agarwal,4,"With words like 'complex-adaptive systems, chaos theory, feedback loops' being thrown at us with increasing frequency, I discovered this book in order to know a little something about complex systems. The ideas in this book are unique, at least to me, and give forth examples about how complexity theory is the common element amongst seemingly dissimilar areas which include economics, evolutionary biology, networks and information theory, and ant colonies. I expected more on the economics/finance front since that is the field I am more interested in. Nevertheless, it was an interesting read paving the way for more books on the topics discussed."
47,0195124413,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13055874-james-igoe,4,"I enjoy reading in systems and complexity, and this was a nice addition to my shelf, with a slightly different take than other books. I found a few areas in the first half a bit tedious, overly long, repetitive, and not illuminating, but generally, it's a great overview of seminal work and very thought-provoking. The first half overlaps but nicely differs from other books I've read, covering things like chaos and information processing, and the latter half of the book I found more engaging, focused on models, computation, network science, and scaling. As mentioned, although I found the first half a bit of a slog at times, the second half was very engaging."
48,0195124413,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2459103-ogi-ogas,5,"My ratings of books on Goodreads are solely a crude ranking of their utility to me, and not an evaluation of literary merit, entertainment value, social importance, humor, insightfulness, scientific accuracy, creative vigor, suspensefulness of plot, depth of characters, vitality of theme, excitement of climax, satisfaction of ending, or any other combination of dimensions of value which we are expected to boil down through some fabulous alchemy into a single digit.But I thought this book was terrific."
49,0195124413,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62282083-denis-romanovsky,5,"I could not expect the emerging theory of complexity to be so interesting and so deep. This book has really opened my mind and let me change the way I think about things around us - dynamics, chaos, emergence, information, computation, fractals, evolution, genetics, networks... all these staff seems to be interconnected. The beast of complexity is definitely huge and exciting. What bad is that now I have even more questions than I had before this book. So there is more stuff to read... But doesn’t it the way science work on people? :) "
50,0195124413,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8742827-jack,2,Too complex for meThis book is definitely not for the faint at heart. I ha a great deal of difficulty with figuring out what points were being made and how I knew more after reading a chapter than I did before (most of the time I didn't ). Perhaps I just didn't have enough prerequisite knowledge. At any rate I had a hard time staying interested.
51,0195124413,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64556439-bob-in,3,"For a while, I was pleased and understanding the aspects of the history of science and math as Mitchell explained it from the perspective of complexity theory. It was a large reach she attempted. Her venture into the logistics equation had a graphic of animal population by generation that was badly wrong. "
52,0195124413,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22491330-pe-o,4,"If you have a background in computer science and/or biology, you'll be familiar with many topics and concepts presented here. Dr. Mitchell nonetheless succeeded in creating an introduction to complex systems understandable to wider public. Big plus: she described actual experiments and didn't waste time with history lessons."
53,0195124413,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86000068-christian-euler,4,"This is a very solid, well-researched reference on the topic. As it is more expository than narrative, I would suggest approaching it as a reference book rather than something to be read cover to cover. I particularly liked the author's efforts to make clear historical misconceptions that are commonly accepted or taken for granted. I will definitely purchase this book to keep on my shelf!"
54,0195124413,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70642066-dustin,5,"A fantastic introduction to the science of complexity, as well as a continuation (and realization) of some of Douglas Hofstadter’s (Mitchell’s PhD advisor and author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning Godel, Escher, and Bach) ideas. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in Biology, Neuroscience, Computer Science, AI, and/or complex systems. "
55,0195124413,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17591546-carlos-gonz-lez,4,"Wonderful little book. Immensely readable. Only 4 stars because the final third of the book really drags on. But fear not--the rest is chock-full of insights and engaging information about the complexity sciences.Let me put it this way: the Genetic Algorithms chapter had me opening up my IDE and writing my own implementation of ""Robby"" the can-picking robot, ok? It's *that* good."

Dr. Mitchell was one of the three great and very influential professor I learned machine learning from during my PhD, and this book, which is not a textbook, is a great tour guide."
