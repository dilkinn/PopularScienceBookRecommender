0,1416583408,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695058-john,2,"""Date I finished this book"" should be ""Date I stopped reading this book.""I kept hoping that it would become more interesting, but, on page 180 I finally gave up.I wanted to like this book. She sets the groundwork that while we humans spend a lot of time with dogs, we actually know very little about them. So she tackled the research to actually learn about dogs (it implied that she was doing the research since she earlier said very little research had been done on dogs).First annoyance: it seems that she's referring to lots of other research on dogs. So, I guess there has been lots of research on dogs? Which is it-- there has been or there hasn't.Second annoyance: blah blah blah, a little interesting info, blah blah. I was reading way too much not-interesting info to get to the interesting point. I could have been interested in the studies. I could have been interested in comparison to other studies on animals. But I found myself just getting enough information to be either left with wanting more, or feeling that the study was insufficient. As someone else said, this book could have been written in 60 pages.Third annoyance*: too many distractingly tangential footnotes (one every second or third page?). Focus on telling a better story and less on mentioning everything you want to say about dogs or research or other amazing animals.Bottom-line, it was too disappointing and distracting to finish.*I have a nephew and two nieces. I've really been wanting to tell a large audience this. Thank god this review came along and I could finally tell someone. Oh wait, this has nothing to do with this book."

Let’s see, this book is written by Dr. Alexandra Horowitz, a cognitive scientist specializing in animal research. She must be one smart lady. And she’s also a dog person! This should be interesting. Let’s loll on the sofa and read it.”Molly:		(jumps up and looks expectantly)Me: 	“The title is a part of a joke: “Outside of a dog, a book is man’s best friend. Inside of a dog it’s too dark to read.” Heh heh. Isn’t that funny?”Molly:		(jumps into lap and licks mouth)Me:	“Aww, stop it! I’m trying to read here. According to page 51, licking around my mouth is a manipulative behavior. You are stimulating me so that I’d vomit up some partially digested meat for you to eat. Gross. So please sit nicely and listen.”Molly:		(curls up with a sigh)Me:	“Do you know that you’re better than chimps in reading humans? They have this experiment in which dogs and chimps had to find hidden food items utilizing clues from humans. Some of the humans were made to wear blindfolds or buckets over their head, while others had unimpeded view of where the food was supposed to be hidden. Chimps begged from both kinds of humans, while dogs begged from those whose eyes were visible. See --- you’re smarter than our primate cousins!” Molly:		(snorts)Me:	“You’re right. Chimps are way overrated. How about this: a dog can detect a teaspoon of sugar diluted in a million gallons of water --- two Olympic-sized pools full. That’s your real-life super power, Krypto! That’s Superman’s dog, by the way. He flies around with this cute little cape --- ” Molly:		(snores)Me: 	“Nap time, eh? Hmm…more animal research: wolves, bees, deers, ticks. Actually, all I want to read about is dogs, dogs and dogs. Some of these researches are interesting in their own right and are useful as comparison, but others seem to be barely tangential. This writer can be very long-winded.”Molly:		""Arf!""Me:	“An attention-getting bark, which is distinct from the rumble of a  growl, or the ominous snarl (page 140). Do you know that your barks can be as loud as 130 decibels? That’s up there with thunderclaps and plane takeoffs. That's another super power! Why are you looking at me like that?”Molly:		(glances at the dining room, tail wagging)Me:	(looks at the clock). “It’s time for lunch! Your circadian rhythm tells you that. Okay, let’s eat.”Molly:		(snatches the book and runs away with it)Me:	“Hey stop that! I still have to find out why you Fox Terriers are such little rascals!”"
2,1416583408,http://goodreads.com/user/show/841949-tracey,4,"Alexandra Horowitz racked up major brownie points right from the beginning with this book. The title comes from one of my favorite quotes ever, from the mouth of Groucho Marx. Also, early on she heads complaints off at the pass by stating that she is using ""owner"" rather than ""pet parent"" or some other such silly phrasing because that's the legal term, and she will use ""him"" and ""his"" when referring to dogs in general because that's the English default, and, knowing dogs as she does, ""it"" is not an option. That latter scored high with me: I have Issues with writers who use ""it"" for animals (particularly those who talk about a mare or stallion and then call the horse ""it""), so this made me happy. She is a long-time dog person, so all else being equal we are kindred spirits.  And it is a fascinating look at canine life and behavior. I'm not sure it made me see my dog in a whole new light as she promised it would, except for a qualm every time I scratch her back that I might be asserting my dominance – but she loves every second of it, so if I am dominating her she's ok with it. I pretty much knew about the dominance of scent in a dog's life; I did not know about the way a dog perceives color (they're not colorblind, exactly). I knew a little about signs of dominance and submission; I didn't know about what face-licking might really mean. (Pop goes the illusion…ew.) I like the insight that the pitch of a voice, canine or human, in many ways equates to size: low and menacing indicates not only a warning but the idea ""and I'm big enough to follow through, too.""  Something I sort of knew but found confirmation for: wolves howl when they're lonely. So, I can attest, do beagles. Only moreso. One valuable thing this book does is reiterate the common-sense yet somehow easily overlooked point that, just as we don't know why our dogs do some of the things they do, most of what we the people do (much less say) is utterly incomprehensible to dogs. That, very simply, they don't think the way we do. It's all very well for us to say ""don't get up on the couch, no, bad!"" – but there's a very simple reason it's so hard to enforce. To a dog the couch is not an expensive piece of furniture which needs to be protected from shed fur and stains – it's a nice soft elevated surface to curl up on, with a nice back to it to curl up against, and after all that's what the bipeds use it for. And how can you honestly expect a dog to ignore that pail of food scraps and wrappers under the sink when it's just sitting there at her level smelling (to her) so wonderful? Again, ""no, bad!"" doesn't really make sense to a dog, however often and however loudly it's repeated. It's food. It's there. It's unprotected. It's hers. Dogs don't naturally do many of the things we ask them to do; many owners, and even many trainers seem to either forget that they're not mute people but canines, and this is where dressed-up dogs doing ridiculous things on command come from. Poor things.  This book made me happy I never successfully trained any of our dogs to heel (not that I tried too strenuously).  I was simultaneously impressed with and bemused by the tales of the research studies that have been conducted on dogs; on the one hand, some of the results are fascinating – where dogs' mental processes may (or may not) function like toddlers'; on the other, I found myself marveling that well-educated grownups spend their days fooling around with dogs, all in the name of science. Some of them wore buckets on their heads.  (ETA: OK, that was very long. I hacked out the personal bits about my own beasts; it's all on my blog, though.) Overall, this book did an admirable job of both teaching me what an umwelt is and helping me deepen my understanding of a dog's. This was a comprehensible, mostly-plain-language, often very funny and occasionally moving study which both solidified and informed my stance as a fiercely partisan dog person. While it's not intended as a training guide, there's some wonderfully common sense information, particularly toward the end, which will be valuable both with Daisy and when – hopefully years from now – I next need it. Did it change the way I see my beagle? Not much. But I do feel like I have a better handle on what's going on between those long ears. I have an even deeper appreciation for that always-busy nose. And I'm kind of glad she's never been much of a face-licker. "
3,1416583408,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4688790-zengardener,1,"Incredibly dry AND pretentious ... I couldn't even finish the book. I have a dog and have fostered and volunteered for many shelters and rescues so I am always amazed and intrigued at how each dog I've met has a different personality. This book lacks what its subjects have in overflowing abundance. The author might as well have been writing a manual on understanding robots or clinical notes about mice in a cage, as nearly every sentence was cold, flat and gratuitously verbose. I'm not one who generally posts on a public forum at all, let alone contribute anything other than positive thoughts (""if you don't have anything nice to say..."") but I was so bewildered to see this book listed as a NYT bestseller that I was compelled to save those of you needing a little color/flavor in your ""good reads"" some money that could otherwise be spent on treats for your favorite four legged-friend. "
4,1416583408,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80323930-nat,3,3.5Longwinded at times but still interesting; providing a treasure trove of insights into man’s best friend. 
5,1416583408,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4490040-carly,4,"""Outside of a dog, a book is a man's best friend. Inside of a dog, it's too dark to read.""Inside of a Dog is a valuable read for anyone seeking to learn more about our furry companions. Horowitz starts with the basics, focusing on a dog's 
umwelt
 and the ways that it differs from a human's. Dogs aren't colorblind, but their perception of color does differ from ours. Scent is far more important in the doggy world than it is to us. Most important of all, dogs and humans simply see different  affordances in the objects around them. As Horowitz points out, a dog doesn't see the small matching dog bed as the appropriate place for the dog to sleep. Your bed is just as comfortable, with the added benefit that it smells like you. If you want your dog to sleep in its dog bed, you'll be far more successful if you wrap the nasty plastic-smelling thing in a well-worn blanket.I volunteer in an animal shelter and interact with a lot of emotionally wounded dogs, and I originally picked up this book in my continuing quest to better understand the ways to distinguish submissive behaviours from inviting ones. For example, as Horowitz notes, a dog rolling on its belly can be either inviting a tummy rub or showing submission, and it can be surprisingly challenging to determine which, especially if the dog is already showing many other signs of stress such as ""whale-eyes"" or tucked tail and ears. While Horowitz does detail these and other signs, I'm not sure I found an answer to this particular question. (My current solution is to make brief contact, then retract my hand and force the dogs to repeatedly re-solicit attention, which they tend to do by crawling towards me and/or pawing my hand. I'm quite sure they find it irritating, but it's kind of cute when they start batting at my hands and mumbling at me.)I also really enjoyed the part where Horowitz talks about doggy play. I am quite familiar with the play-bow, the stance that dogs take to invite rough-and-tumble play. In fact, I've noticed that many humans--myself included--tend to do our own version of the play-bow by slapping our palms on the ground and jerking our necks forward while brandishing a squeaky toy or ball. According to Horowitz, this play etiquette is far more complex than I realized: just as a human abbreviates a joke or a greeting with old friends, dogs abbreviate the play-bows with dogs they don't know and are far more elaborate with those they don't. I mostly enjoyed Horowitz's analysis of the procedures, perils, and pitfalls of the various tests, but there was one case where I think she was dead wrong. The study sought to ascertain whether dogs as a species have an innate drive to rescue their people. The researchers had the owners fake injury or heart attacks, then analysed the dogs' reactions. The dogs tended to be both nonplussed and unworried by their owners' apparent peril, and not a single one tried to seek assistance from the bystanders. From this, Horowitz concluded that doggy rescues are really more of a fluke caused by the dogs' tendencies to want to be near their owners. Given Horowitz's own statements in earlier chapters, I find this reaction rather ridiculous. Horowitz is very clear about dogs' heavy dependence on sound and smell. No matter how dramatically the owners were shrieking, I'm quite sure they didn't smell fearful or injured. To me, this seems like a limited and utterly useless test that tells us more about human assumptions than animal behaviour. However, in almost every other experiment she described, Horowitz did a nice job the ways in which dog behaviour differs from our human expectations, and the reasons behind these differences. In addition to the problematic hero-dog test, Horowitz describes a large set of experiments that attempt to define doggy intelligence in areas such as object permanence or complex emotions such as jealousy or deception. Some of these were both fascinating and illuminating. For example, dogs ""fail"" various intelligence tests that try to invoke complex reasoning because they tend to go to the humans and ask for help. As Horowitz points out, one could argue that the dogs are performing complex reasoning and tool utilization: they know from experience how to use humans to open refrigerators and cans, so why not get their help in these tests as well?Overall, Inside of a Dog is a great read for anyone who wants to know a bit more about the world their dog inhabits. From understanding play rituals to analysing attention-getting behaviours to dealing with doggy separation anxiety, Inside of a Dog is full of fascinating facts about the curious lives of our canine companions."
6,1416583408,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1550655-andrew,2,"This is a disappointing book, with few insights for a dog owner or someone interested in animal behavior. Despite having an extensive collection of footnotes leading back to the scientific literature, the conclusions of the book could have been handled in 60 pages instead of 300:•	Dogs are not color blind but blues and greens stand out for them. Yellow/orange/red objects are all undifferentiated.•	Short vision is not very good (though smell can compensate for it when objects are close to the muzzle). Dogs with longer muzzles (like retrievers) have a different broader field of vision than dogs with a short muzzle, like a pug. This makes them more attuned to motion.•	Dogs don’t have a sense of self-awareness, as indicated by chimpanzees or humans when before a mirror. Humans or chimps will use the mirror to preen, while dogs largely ignore the reflection.•	Dogs have up to three times the number of rods in their retina, giving them better visibility at night but washing things out in bright light.The author has surprisingly little about the developmental period during the first year of the life of a dog. And there are even some missed elements, such as Horowitz questioning why her dog is reluctant to enter a dark elevator after a walk (hint: it’s in the washout of the eye’s rods in bright light, something humans also experience when going from light to dark)."
7,1416583408,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1789637-katrina-michie,4,"This book totally changed how I see and interact with dogs. It seems like common sense to me now, but it gave me a whole new appreciation for dogs. I was hoping this would be more like Radiolab's brand of science, or maybe a Mary Roach type of look at dogs, but it's not quite as much of a page turner--maybe because it's actually written by a scientist and not a journalist. This is a benefit in a lot of ways though. I would still really recommend it if you are all about your dog(s) like I am and wishing you understood how they think or see the world. We can't ever really know what our dogs are thinking, but this book really helped me understand how my dog is processing the world around differently than humans. Really glad I read this."
8,1416583408,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1393336-jennifer-aka-em,3,"This is a lovely, unsentimental, fairly thorough, scientifically-grounded look at the dog-human bond: how it evolved, how the canine's sensory equipment shapes his (or her) world and relationship with us, and how a deeper understanding of that world - ""the inside of a dog"" (yes, from the Groucho Marx quotation) - should shape ours with them. Didn't so much change or illuminate, but anchored what I think I know about my dog and dogs in general in explanations of canine behaviour drawn from the author's own experiences and her background as a comparative psychologist.The dog-human bond is something very special to me -- having owned dogs all my life, and currently being on a full-on tear to work towards the overturning of BSL (breed specific legislation) in Ontario which is the product of and continues to cause such cruelty to dogs and their families. It's about more than treating other creatures with the respect they deserve; it's about how human beings can and should respectfully share the planet with other living things. That perspective in microcosm is taught, I believe, through the relationships parents encourage (or deny) when or if they bring that first puppy into the home. Teaching a child to treat a dog with gentleness, kindness and compassion is teaching a child to love. Teaching that lesson from the deeply-informed perspective that Horowitz provides here can only enrich the both the dog's life and the family's. One of the author's points is that dogs most often give us much more than we give them. Another is that the fundamental quality of the relationship between dogs and humans - that affection, that love - is beyond the reach of science. Maybe so, but anyone who has bonded with a dog knows it to be true."
9,1416583408,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1429082-daniel-solera,4,"I saw this book on a bestsellers shelf at the Barnes and Noble by where I work. Having become a dog-owner in August, I picked this up hoping it would be insightful and entertaining. The book aptly declares that it is not a training manual and that readers shouldn't expect tips on how to raise a proper puppy. Instead, it is a psychological examination of dogs, including what they know, what their world is like and how we fit into it.Alexandra Horowitz attempts to explain such baffling questions as ""What do dogs think?"" through various methods. Rather than anthropomorphize dogs, which the book routinely discourages, she relies heavily on scientific and psychological experiments performed on dogs and other animals, such as rats and monkeys. She first tackles the mind of a dog by asking readers to place themselves in a dog's world or their umwelt. By imagining our primary senses to be smell and taste, we instantly realize how radically different dogs' lives are than those of humans, who rely more heavily on sight and hearing. From that crucial departure, we go onto notice seemingly simple things: dogs are much closer to the ground, thus everything on the floor is more interesting to them; they rarely walk in a straight line because smells eminate from all directions, etc.Bookending each section and interspersed among the scientific findings are brief anecdotes of one of Horowitz's dogs, Pumpernickel. Though she constantly asks us to avoid using human terms with dogs (such as ""have fun"", ""get bored"", ""feel ashamed"", etc.), these little stories are told with a fondness that breaks with this animal-only treatment. But this is natural - anyone who owns and loves a dog will find it impossible to treat it strictly like a domesticated animal in a symbiotic relationship. Yet despite this seemingly dry approach to investigating a household pet, I finished this book with a greater understanding of what makes a dog tick. Among the many tidbits: dogs don’t reflect on themselves; they understand day and night but not necessarily the abstract concept of time; they do get bored at home but are resourceful at entertaining themselves; the cadence of their play is a series of identifiable actions; they have an impressive theory of mind and can detect intentions; they use their owners as tools to achieve certain ends, and many others.Inside of a Dog was a delightful read. I will admit that I derived much of my enjoyment from imagining my own dog, a 6-month Shih Tzu named Penny, in every situation described. Though I would recommend this to anyone regardless of their pet situation, having a dog in your house or apartment will definitely elevate this book to a new level."
10,1416583408,http://goodreads.com/user/show/782451-rae,4,"""Outside of a dog, a book is man's best friend. Inside of a dog it's too dark to read."" Groucho MarxAlexandra Horowitz has taken up Groucho's challenge and given us a book that at least we can read about the inside of a dog. Clearly a dog lover she has written a valentine to man's best friend.What makes dogs uniquely suited to that special status? What's going on behind those big brown eyes? You will find answers to these and many more questions - such as why the swich to digital TV has made it possible for you and your dog to enjoy those reruns of Lassie. "
11,1416583408,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2690037-mimi,4,"I usually don’t include autobiographical information in a book review, but in this case I’ll make an exception! Like Alexandra Horowitz, I am and always will be a dog person and since the day I was born, a doggie has shared my world. It all started with Marshmallow, a lovely golden mutt who lived amongst us until I was 13-years old (she was 16 at the time). Then, to my wonderful pleasure, my parents first adopted Roxy, the quirky basset hound, and then came Maggie the English Bulldog…and this is when things really got wildly fun as my Mom and Dad entered the wonderful world of bulldog breeding and dog shows. What fun! After getting married, my husband and I went to the local animal shelter and adopted Irving…a little mutt who we think could best be called a corg-huaua (a corgi-Chihuahua mix? Perhaps…) He was with us for 12-years before the inevitably sad moment was upon us…and although our hearts were broken, we knew our lives would not be complete without a canine companion, so we adopted Moe. Moe is still with us…and so is Rudy, a funky & cute stray mutt who wandered into our lives 4 months ago. Dogs are an integral part of my consciousness, evoking important memories of the past while providing an ongoing source of companionship and love. I share this because I think it has a great deal to do with my feelings about this book. Inside a Dog is an amazing exploration of the dog’s unwelt (or subjective reality). In other words, it’s a serious attempt to delve into the life of a dog and try to understand the world from the dog’s point of view. Through in-depth discussion of domestication, sensory awareness and canine-human connections, the author effectively elicits a greater understanding of a canine’s reality.One thing I particularly appreciate about the way Ms. Horowitz presents this information is that while so much of it is based on very sound scientific research, she, like me and many of her readers, is a dog lover. As a result, she applies this science while not reducing our relationship with our doggie friends to science alone. Throughout her research, she provides supporting anecdotes about her sweet Pumpernickel…reminding us of the magically non-scientific, poignant aspect of our relationship with our furry, slobbery companions.A must read for dog lovers…or anyone interested in animal research!"
12,1416583408,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4969387-john,2,"A 2.5This book was a little disappointing for me. I wanted to get it as a Christmas present for some dog owner friends. Instead they are getting a bicycle pump. Although full of some interesting thoughts and research data, overall the book felt a bit dull, a bit lacking. It is neither practical enough to be an owner’s manual, nor detailed enough to satisfy my interest in the experiments behind the ideas. It seems to try to tread a middle road between pop and intellectual, and instead turned me off to both aspects. The premise of the book is good, and I like the idea of trying to see the world as your dog does to better understand. I was challenged by the idea that smell is the most important sense to the dog, not sight or hearing. And throughout the book there were other wonderful nuggets of information to chew on. But overall there was not enough to hold my interest. And by the last 100 pages I thought the book was dragging on. Tough to recommend though not a total waste. "
13,1416583408,http://goodreads.com/user/show/918327-amanda,2,"This book did make me appreciate my dog a little more but I found it to be too dry and boring for the most part to give it a higher rating. I also found many eye-rolling moments- she seems a very permissive dog parent. For example, advocating that the dog should be allowed to wander and smell anything and roll in anything, ect, during walks; should be allowed to ""smell like a dog"" as long as possible; sleep in your bed with you.... I just personally am of camp that believes my dog should work around me not the other way around."

Some interesting information can be found in this book, but I had to wade through a bunch of slush to get to it. The best bits were talked about on NPR when the book was first published. Too bad, really, that I could hardly keep my eyes open while reading most of it. Two stars: it was okay. "
15,1416583408,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,1,"She's very long-winded. The introduction took forever & probably was a good enough synopsis of the book. There wasn't much there even after a good 4 hours of listening - almost halfway through.Her point about breeds being indicative of general behavior given similar upbringing was repetitious, to put it kindly. Her comparison between wolf & dog behavior was poor. I agree with her conclusion that not all behavior should be attributed to the wolf root nor the human breeding & interaction. It does fall somewhere in between, but her major premise for discounting wolf pack behavior was because the difference between wild & penned wolf packs. She mentions how penned wolf packs do resemble dog packs in some ways, so undercuts her argument.She says feral dogs packs don't resemble wolf packs. She should spend some more time around feral packs in rural areas since several examples she provides are wrong in that environment, although they might hold true in urban & suburban settings. It might have to do with the number of dogs, too.She really lost me when she discussed house breaking a dog by ignoring a puddle. She actually said that bringing the dog to the scene of the crime & punishing them was bullying! She also says that there's nothing to worry about when your dog goes running off after something in the woods - it will come back. She's one of these people that believes every critter has a better nature & appealing to it is all that is needed for training in every case. She's an idiot who really needs to get out of her ivory tower more. I might have continued if the science was harder, but she watered it down & spent so much time covering her ass on every declaration. They're critters - living beings! Of course we're dealing with a bell curve of general behaviors. That's a given. She should have said that once at the beginning & left it at that, but no, she had to point it out at every point possible. Yuck."
16,1416583408,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1075536-jessica-blevins,5,"Great insight into the life of a dog...I highly recommend. The book is mostly scientific studies of how dogs really see, smell, hear and what they know about their human owners...but includes personal anecdotes throughout as well. I learned a lot about dogs in general and definitely look at my dog in a different light now. For example, I learned that dogs look to humans when they need help or can't figure something out...and that they pay a lot of attention to us, even when we don't realize it. I learned that my dog likes nothing better than to smell something new, so leisurely walks outside where I let him lead the way are important as are other ways of allowing him to smell new things. There's some practical advice in there as well (check out the last chapter) that I've been able to put into action, like hiding treats around the house to keep your dog from getting bored and to emphasize places that you want them to go and spend time in...and getting down on his level when you walk into the room helps to keep him from jumping on you...he just wants to look at you eye to eye.

18,1416583408,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43249460-kellynn-wee,5,"So: I recently got a dog. His name is Chai; he's at least part Shih Tzu, although a bit too leggy to fully qualify as such. I've read Horowitz's ""On Looking"", which I enjoyed, and I thought that this was probably a good time to learn what the umwelt--the universe; the way of seeing--of my dog was. I thought this would be a breezy read but found myself welling up at several points. This book has been mischaracterised as overly verbose and technical when I found it to be the exact opposite. Horowitz is a scientist: she is a precise, informative, cogent writer, unromantic and practical. But she is also a dog owner: and the portraits of Pumpernickel, her dog, which open every section, are so effulgent with love and warmth that it reveals Horowitz's own stance with every word, in that dogs are animals, and behave in animal-like ways, but they have also co-evolved with humans to be a truly remarkable example of inter-species companionship, and thus are truly, weirdly, indescribably special. I often find myself anxious about Chai's care, particularly in light of the recent human-ification of dogs: my Instagram feed is full of Pomenarians gnawing on raw quail, of corgis heeling perfectly through busy wet markets, of barkday parties with perfectly coiffured puppers and their $45 nosework toys. What Horowitz has done is really to remind me that a dog is a dog is a dog. That they are animals but that does not mean that they are dumb or unintelligent. That they see through their noses; that they will probably pee on your carpet at some point despite your best efforts; that they are remarkable attention-payers and attention-getters and manipulators of human behaviour; that they do not know what is wrong and what is right, only what attracts anger and what attracts treats; that they enjoy the world most when they are given plenty of time to smell it and put it in their mouths and roll through it. I loved learning that Chai can see different colours than I do, that he can smell time, that, when left at home, he is probably kind of bored but exists in his own private world as his own dog; that he is a social creature who can modify his behaviour in play; that he sniffs my crotch to reconfirm that I am who I am; that he speaks through minute adjustments in his body; that he follows and directs my gaze; that he mirrors my actions to signal companionship. I loved realising that dogs and us overlap in precious and strange ways, and that is why they make such ideal companions--that their life is not too-long and not too-short, enough to span our own; that their speeds, their ways of seeing and smelling, are in temporal affinity to our own; that they respond to our touch.Maybe it did not necessarily teach me anything absolutely shocking or brand new--considering the dearth of doggy knowledge that is online nowadays--but I found in this book a sense of reassurance. That maybe Chai will never learn to heel perfectly but that is OK. That his shivering nosy delight in an unremarkable bush will teach me a little more about the geography of smells in my neighbourhood and is more important and joyful to him than his ability to match my pace through the concrete sidewalk. That his perked ears and frozen body is seeing or smelling something preternatural, that I cannot see with my inferior flicker-fusion sight rate. That playing with other dogs is a complex dance of communication and self-awareness and joy. I think, like Horowitz puts it, I will begin to revalue the importance of mornings. Not for Chai's capacity to reshape himself into a dog that is convenient for me, but for a chance to expand both our capacities for exploration and experience and joy."
19,1416583408,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4598813-beki,2,"Though primed to love this read before ever setting eyes to type by a bone-deep interest in both the scientific (animal behavioral studies) and emotional (I'm nuts for dogs!) subject matter, I was somewhat surprisingly less than wholly engaged by either (treatments of the subject matter) and left rather profoundly unsatisfied upon the arrival of the last page turned: a failure not of writing, but rather one of content. Or perhaps I should clarify that as content unanticipated. Written in an accessible, engaging style --not always an easy task with a science-based subject -- and flush with anecdotally-entertaining conversational sidebars, this very readable text sacrifices its own authority to educate and engage on the blade of an apparent failure to understand its own target demographic. By measure of marketing, scientific content and textual skew, this book is clearly designed to speak to a demographic of me: a dog lover who knows dogs, has dogs, and loves dogs ... loves them enough to spend both time and money to self educate on the subject of how such dogs might perceive the world around them differently than I would otherwise assume, in my humanness, they do. But in speaking to this very specific demographic of me, Horowitz fails to tell me anything of note. Anything surprising. Anything I didn't already know, if not specifically and consciously, at least on a gut-level plane of experienced ownership where dog and dog-owned meet. Buttressing her thesis with little more than a resume in the field and process-oriented explanations of why her dog stories are more scientifically telling than my dog stories, or your dog stories, Horowitz doesn't fail to make her case so much as she fails to make her case as an authority on a subject with depths beyond the obvious.A dog's world is defined by smell over sight is the primary thrust of her conversationally conveyed content. Not a thrust with which I would quibble. But seriously, has anyone in the history of ever actually loved a dog and not already known this? Yes, Horowitz validates her assertions (a bit more complex than I've made them sound) with years of scientifically sound observational methodology. But what, exactly, is that methodology, you may ask. She watches her dog play and records what happens. In a journal.Okay. I'll grant you, I've made it all sound egregiously simplistic, but I do so not to denigrate so much as illustrate how the author, herself, sold out her own authority on the subject about which she writes. Not by failing to impart what she, a rigorously trained, animal behavioral scientist, has observed; but rather by portraying herself as ""one of us"" to such a conversational extent that she effectively becomes as one of us: a knowledgeable and experienced dog-lover sharing dog stories about her own dog over a trained and experienced scientist divulging scientific findings about a test subject or group.And it is in this impingement of her own authority that Horowitz fails the audience to which she aspires to speaks. By crawling down into the audience to tell personal stories of a beloved pet, Horowitz sacrifices the podium of expertise required to effectively present her scientific observations as anything inherently more valid than anecdotal evidence as might be offered by any other knowledgeable dog owner with years of experience observing their own pet. And she compounds this impingement of her own scientific authority by presenting findings not above and beyond what her target demographic already specifically or instinctively knows, but rather by spending the lion's share of her page count doing little more than reaffirming the obvious: your dog sees the world by smell rather than sight, and my telling you as much is scientifically relevant because I've got a fancy name for it while you just call it being nosy.As I said: an entertaining enough read for someone who loves dogs, but less than wholly engaging as anything more profound (or educational) than one dog lover talking to another. So if you take your dog to the grocery store in an emerald-studded handbag tucked under one arm or dress it up every Wednesday in a a sailor suit for a play date in the park? Then yes, this might be just the scientific expose you're looking for on how a dog perceives the world around it. But if you're the kind of dog lover who picks up a book on dog perception and consequent behavior written by a scientist to the specific purpose of self educating beyond the territory marked out by The Dog Whisperer and your own observations of a beloved, if occasionally perplexing, pet? Then this is probably not the book you're looking for. It's certainly not the one 
I
 was."
20,1416583408,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6016813-ana-rusness-petersen,0,"The first thing that must be said about this book is that it was obviously written by someone who loves dogs, and opened my eyes to truly interacting and living with a dog as a friend, rather than as a being to be taken care of and trained like a child, as someone to be understood and developmentally enhanced.It was a little challenging to really get engrossed in at the beginning, and was much more scientific than the anecdotal adventure I was expecting when I selected this book off the shelf at the bookstore. (It must also be said that the adorable doggie face on cover completely sold me on the book in the first place – yes, I judged a book, at least partially, by its cover.) Despite this, I am glad I stuck with the book until the end. I learned some interesting facts about the dog species, such as their unique visual perception (far-sighted vs. near-sighted, blurry vs. sharply focused, and more subject to see moving objects), and how smell and taste actually provide a richer and more informative experience for dogs than vision. Despite the wealth of information provided, the manner in which this information was delivered left something to be desired. The author completely shifted narrative from the interspersed storytelling about her experiences, interactions, and memories of her own dog, Pump, into a scientific, fact-spewing voice that twisted various facts and experiments to prove her points. Sources were not cited in a scientific or academic manner, and the sheer number of variables in some of the experiments were not taken into consideration as possible weaknesses in the research, but rather, encouraged as an added bonus. Additionally, the author took on a holier-than-thou, this is how you should raise and interact with your dog approach. Her advice on how to “train” a dog by incorporating the dog’s umwelt (and therefore, the understanding of his/her goals, motivations, method of communication) was much more effective and enjoyable to read. The strongest part of this book was the last chapter, “The Importance of Mornings,” which really served to summarize the authors main points and messages in a clear, concise and passionate manner that illuminated how much she really cares about dogs and what she really wanted to pass along to readers of her book. That being said, stories, facts, and perspectives presented in the main body of the text added a depth of specifics to this summary chapter, and added to its strength – a reader would not have had the same experience or gotten as much out of it if he/she had just read the last summarizing chapter."
21,1416583408,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793473-clif-hostetler,3,"Haven't we all wondered what our dogs think of us? This is the next best thing to reading a book written by a dog. I am not a current dog owner, but I grew up on a farm with multiple dogs. Over the years I had read that those dogs of my youth saw me as the leader of their pack. This book debunks that myth. This book says they considered me to be be their a meal ticket. What a come down! All these years I thought I was the ""Alpha Dog.""The purpose of the book is to help people to understand what's it's like to be a dog. The main difficulty for humans trying to understand dogs is to imagine life with the ability to smell and interpret odors that's about one-hundred times better than the human nose. It's an ability to smell the world in multiple dimensions; in past, present and future tenses; distinguishing between animal, vegetable, and mineral; and do so continually, even when not inhaling. It's a concept almost unimaginable for humans.A burning question I've had all my life was not answered by this book as explicitly as I wished. The question is: When a dog howls in accompaniment to a musical instrument such as a harmonica, is it enjoying the music or is it an indication that it hurts their ears? I have wondered about this all my life, and I know others have too. She does offer the following observation: ""Adult wolves howl daily: among packs, a chorus of howling may help coordinate their travels and strengthens their attachment.""  From this I infer that when a dog hears me play a harmonica, it perceives that I am howling, and it is instinctual for dogs to join in with others when they hear howling taking place. So perhaps it's a dog's way of saying, ""We are family!"" In other words, it's a positive experience for the dog, and it's not hurting their ears.The author discusses the propensity of dogs to roll around on dead and rotting carcasses, a behavior I always found particularly disgusting. She doesn't explain the dog's motivation as explicitly as I had wished. However, from other things said in the book I understand the dog to be using their primary sensory experience (olfactory) to say, ""My what a wonderful bouquet of odors, I think I'll take some of it with me."" It would be the human equivalent of using their primary sensory experience (visual) to sigh in pleasure at viewing a beautiful vista and then taking a photograph to keep with them.Another question I have that was not addressed by the book: How do some dogs find their way home over long distances? I know a person who tried to get rid of a dog by driving 15 miles away from home, dumping the dog there and driving off in direction away from home. (I know this is a terrible thing to do to any dog.) The dog found its way home after a couple days. How did it do that? Was it by scent, or by internal sense of direction? Has anybody researched this ability?The author advises dog owners not to give their dogs frequent baths. She says,""And no dog wants to smell like a bathtub that has a dog in it."" Now I realize that the dogs of my youth were living in a paradise for dogs. The rural farm setting provided plenty of room for them to roam and smell. And more importantly, we never gave our dogs baths. The only time they got baths was when they jumped into creeks or mud puddles on there own initiative, usually to cool off."
22,1416583408,http://goodreads.com/user/show/758088-eve,5,"If you have a dog, if you're a dog person or an all around animal person - you have to read Inside of a Dog: What Dogs See, Smell, and Know by Alexandra Horowitz.""Go look at a dog. Go on, look---maybe at one lying near you right now, curled around his folded legs on a dog bed, or sprawled on his side on the tile floor, paws flitting through the pasture of a dream. Take a good look---and now forget everything you know about this or any dog. ""This is admittedly a ridiculous exhortation...What we'll find, in looking at dogs through a scientific lens, is that some of what we think we know abut dogs is entirely borne out; other things that appear patently true are, on closer examination, more doubtful than we thought. And by looking at our dogs from another perspective --- from the perspective of the dog---we can see new things that naturally occur to those of us encumbered with human brains. So the best way to begin understanding dogs is by forgetting what we think we know.""True to her word, Horowitz pretty much decimated everything I thought I knew about dogs, many of which are commonly-held, accepted beliefs. Misunderstandings about man's best friend stem, Horowitz explains, from humans anthropomorphizing dogs [""We see, talk about, and imagine dogs' behavior from a human-biased perspective, imposing our own emotions and thoughts on these furred creatures""]. For example, dogs don't urinate to mark their territory - they actually urinate to provide information/messages to other dogs. Horowitz compares a fire hydrant as a common bulletin board for the neighborhood. Horowitz breaks down these and other ""myths"" in organized fashion, systematically concentrating chapter by chapter on a different cognitive experience: how dogs see, smell, hear, and think. Interspered with the clear scientific passages are personal observations and anecdotes of Horowitz's own dog, Pumpernickel or ""Pump,"" which infuse the book with an intimate feel. You can tell this scientist loves dogs :)I think Inside of a Dog was so mindblowing for me because dogs seem so known and not at all mysterious, when in fact, they are surprising creatures worthy of in depth study. The mind of a dog is a fascinating perspective to explore. "
23,1416583408,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4211531-marty,3,"Liked it. Kind of skimmed some parts of it. Didn't learn as much as I thought I would. Was already aware of a lot of the concepts - how important smell is, that dogs are still animals no matter how much we want them to have human characteristics. New to me: Dogs' eyes have a faster ""flicker-rate"" than humans. Imagine that the speed of our vision processing is to a dog like us watching an old silent movie where we see the flickers between frames. That's what our vision would be to a dog. Therefore dogs see things slightly sooner and faster than we do. That's why movement is so noticeable to them. About the sense of smell - This is their most important sense. Everything is processed by way of scent. Notice the constantly moving nostrils. Imagine a scent in the air constantly moving because of the air movement, and having to follow it. Scent has age to a dog, a dog can tell how much time has passed since something happened because of the freshness of a scent. Loved her advice to dog owners in the last chapter. Wish every dog owner would read this. Go for a Smell Walk. Train thoughtfully. Allow for his Dogness (let him roll in whatever it is). Consider the Source (his breed matters, he's an animal, dogs have ""handedness"", right pawed or left pawed). Give him Something to Do. Play with Him.Don't bathe your dog Everyday. Pet Friendly (not all dogs like to be petted, or like to be petted in different ways). Get a mutt. Anthropomorphize with Umwelt in Mind. (A complex animal cannot be explained simply.)Why does Angel lick Anna so much? She sees Anna as a puppy to clean off. Why does Angel lick the carpet? Smell and taste (mouthing) are how dogs explore and learn more information."
24,1416583408,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14139887-david-buccola,5,"If you love dogs, I really cannot imagine a better book to read. Alexandra Horowitz brings the latest and greatest scientific insights on dog behavior to us, the average dog lover, in the most grounded accessible way imaginable. While the science is fascinating and has definitely helped me better understand my pups, what I really loved was the way Horowitz discusses the limits to what science can research. The book centers on this idea of umwelt, which according to Horowitz, ""which originated with the biologist Jakob von Uexküll, is that the world of each animal is defined by how he/she perceives and acts on the world."" It's the very basic idea that is so compelling because she urges us to see the world through the eyes (and really the nose) of our dogs. Understanding their perception of the world is fascinating and key to a deepening of our relationship, but it also helps us understand our dogs preoccupation with smells and sights that are meaningless to us. As I read the book, I found myself intoxicated by every moment with my dogs as I started to understand the soft laughter of my dogs at play, their fascination with smells, and the closeness of our bond. My need to keep a pace during our walks gave way to more exploration for their little noses to explore. Lastly, one of my favorite things about this book was the way Horowitz weaves the narrative of her pup Pumpernickel throughout the book in a way to introduce topics. The stories will resonate with any dog lover and make the book so much more enjoyable to read. I'd write more but Tinker Bell is letting me know it's frisbee time. "
25,1416583408,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1253351-terry,3,"""Inside of a Dog"" is written by a cognitive scientist/animal ethnologist/behaviorist who studies dogs and she writes about them and their behavior in straightforward prose very accessible to laypersons (and possibly offensive to scientists by virtue of over-simplification). She doesn't just study dogs, she likes/loves dogs. So you can guess why I read this book. She begins by describing the evolution of dogs from wolves and their gradual domestication and association with human beings. Then she goes on to describe their senses of smell, hearing and sight to ours so we can better understand how they communicate and what they sense as compared to what we're probably sensing. Then she gets to actual behavior--always in the context of the sense and evolution. She's big on letting dogs be dogs (walk at their pace so they can savor smells we can't; don't run your dog as its only form of outdoor exercise (no sniffing!) and never run your dog on a bike. Alpha dog trainers (like Cesar) overdo the discipline in relationships with dogs when equally acceptable behaviors can be achieved by giving the dog a chance to exercise its innate desire to please. Walking the dog precisely at heel is excessive discipline (and boring for the dog) as long as the dog responds to voice command when it wanders too far. In other words, just the kind of discipline we practice with Jenny and Toby.... As well as I know my dogs and as clearly as we communicate with one another, this book helped me to better understand what they're saying and how they're trying to say it. "
26,1416583408,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1826682-trish,3,"Horowitwz is a scientist, after all. She has rigorously edited her book so that it is accessible to non-scientists, and tries to tell us which of the dog behaviors we observe are actually what we may believe them to be. Are dogs as knowledgeable as they appear? What do their behaviors signify? But first she must describe what she will do, set the parameters, explain her approach...I did not become engaged until late in the game, when Horowitz gave us a section on ""theory of mind"": can the dog know what we're thinking or are they simply responding to other physical cues?From this point the book explains some experiments conducted, their results, the conclusions. This is unfailingly interesting to me, though I get breathless at the amount of time and energy involved in constructing a successful experiment which may yield one data point and no firm conclusions.At the end of the book, Horowitz takes off her scientist hat and tells us what she thinks. She urges us to look on our pets as individuals with unique behaviors and not to be too regimented in our thinking about how they should perform or behave. Her final quote is a paean to her dead pet, Pump, in which she describes one of his ears ""like a felted leaf, dried in the sun."" Dog-people will find this an interesting book which will inform their understanding."
27,1416583408,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10386400-ryan-holiday,4,"I was only halfway through this book when I left it on an airplane and lost it. It took me a week to get a new copy, at which point I had completely forgotten most of the notes I had made in the first few chapters. If you can avoid this problem you should read it, and do so continuously because it has a flow that serves it well. The book is about dogs and the study of dogs but in the scientific rather than the ownership sense.This means she did real experiments, is a real expert and isn't just passing along personal observations. At the same time, she uses anecdotes from her dog to illustrate and explain her findings. The result is a nice mix between one of those unreadable books from a college professor and something you'd see on Oprah. The author is well-read in other fields, a skill she uses to tie in a bunch of interesting tangents. She spends a bit of time talking about flicker-fusion rates which are worth learning about. She also uses the concept of umwelt - an organism's understanding of the environment around it - which is an interesting exercise in empathy. If you've read Cesar Milan's book(which I like) this is a good companion."
28,1416583408,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1291915-lauren,4,"I had always imagined that my girls experience the world so differently than I do - I'd pictured a hyper-reality of smells, colors, sounds - and this book confirms that a dog's world is indeed more ""sensory"" than our own. Not surprisingly, their noses are their primary sensory organ, while humans rely more on their eyes. Smells tell their story, and it appears that there is no smell that dogs find repugnant, in fact, the stinkier something is to humans, the more dogs seem to love it! Dog behavioral psychology is discussed, but because there is not a lot of research into some aspects, the author substitutes other animals that have been studied, and makes assumptions about how dogs would react in certain situations. This habit of saying ""well, birds/reptiles/other mammals did this, so dogs would too..."" seemed unreliable to me for a number of reasons (domestication, the bonds between humans and dogs, etc.) but interesting nonetheless. 3.5 stars, rounded up because I love dogs so much :)"
29,1416583408,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6954412-hathal,2,"I bought this book because I liked the cover very much. After reading it, I can say that this book is:-Very informative: 1-I had an insight of the efforts made to study animal cognition. 2-It was also interesting to know how the relationship between dog and man evolved.3-Dogs senses and body language were extensively covered.-Boring:1-Around 300 pages with too much repetition of some points made clear from the first time already; perhaps, intended for dogs who can read! I had to stop reading several times. 2-Somehow the surprise factor was not there! I love surprises. There could've been many in this book if it was written in a different way.3-Human cognition is going through an overhaul due to functional MRI and other brain scanning technologies. I thought I may see something in this book like that. Eventually, It appeared that what's inside of a dog is still inside of a dog. Maybe in the near future.Worth reading though.."
30,1416583408,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3948872-laura,3,"Good specific information about how dogs see the world differently than us. They lack the blind spot directly in front of us we have that we constantly fill in; they lack the sharp close focus that primates have for faces; they see a much bigger slice of the world in front of them than we do. And their ability to smell makes us look like we can't tell the difference between roses and rotting meat. The author got up my nose right up front, unfortunately, by insisting that she would use ""he"" as the gender neutral pronoun and insisting that wasn't political because . . . well, the author seems to think she can deny the political implications through force of will. Piffle. But her love of her dog made me forgive much. A good bus book. "

I recommend this book to anyone who has dogs, wants to get a dog, or just loves animals."

It's not going to help me train Thran. Instead, it revolutionized how I understand, relate to, and love Thran. I've always been a dog person, but this book made me believe that all people are, deep down, dog people. It's well-written and fast-paced, scientific yet personal. A must-read for anyone who shares their life (or wants to someday share their life) with a dog. "

It is certainly well written and interesting, but I guess I'm just not that into dogs. I mean, I like dogs, and all; I just don't need to know every little thing about how they operate. Kind of like a car, I guess."
34,1416583408,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3555205-kimari,2,"If you know anything about dogs, you might not get much out of this book. The science is easy enough for a grade schooler to understand, and while accessible to the masses, it was ultimately disappointing to me. The scientific research the author discusses is her interpretation. Even worse is the lack of complete citations. The author's opinion of what a dog's mind is capable of is cold and limited. Her fear of being accused of anthropomorphism is all too evident. She rails against anthropomorphizing to the point of undermining the intelligence of all animals. She frequently contradicts herself, dogs can/can't read emotions, dogs can/can't reason, dogs know/don't know when they misbehave.Body language is very important to canines, but it is only briefly discussed. The authors fails to mention the varied abilities, behavior, development, intelligence, and psychology of different dog breeds. She keeps reminding us that dogs aren't 1) people 2) wolves 3) complex thinkers 4) capable of emotion. I agree with the first two, but the rest really depends on the individual dog.I didn't find the chapter introductions with Pump very entertaining. Forced whimsy is not fun. I did enjoy the section about vision. I think anyone not already familiar with it would find it interesting, even if the science is over-simplified.The author mentions Pump eating grapes and raisins. If you didn't read the footnotes, you may not be aware that they are toxic to dogs. Please, don't feed grapes, raisins or currants to a dog. There are other people foods that are toxic to dogs; chocolate, garlic and onions are just a few.

I’m not supposed to bring it up. But of the two we have, the Chihuahua absolutely refuses our instructions to go to the bathroom outside. I mean, this is a dog that will hold his bowels for days sometimes, despite going out every two hours or so, and then, in the middle of the night, sneak out of his bed and find a nice spot to unleash his gift to us all. Seriously, he’ll wait days. I’ve begged, threatened, given him treats for going outside (always on accident, I’m sure) and have tried to follow potty training advice, but he always finds a way. Always. So, this book is about the ‘mind’ of the dog. You know, how a dog thinks. After reading every word of this book, I think I’ve figured out exactly what my dog thinks when it’s shitting all over my house. “Hey, this dumbass will just clean up my shit no matter where I put it. He must really like it. So I’ll surprise him with shit surprises all the time! Especially when he least expects it!”So, the book didn't teach me how to trick him into crapping outside. I'm bummed.

This book is not about how to train or improve a dog's behavior, but it might help you with your dog in some ways.I was amused by the author's comparisons of dogs with children, reminding me of my childless dog loving friends and even friends with children that think of their dog as one of the children. Sometimes children are smarter than dogs, but because dogs can manipulate their owners so often, I think dogs must be smarter than most people.I have always had an aversion to being spit or drooled on, and have never liked being licked either. Now I know why dogs want to lick--it goes back to the instinct of wild mother dogs regurgitating food as their pups lick the mother dog's muzzle. Now I think I like being licked even less.The next time you make eye contact with your dog, or even your cat, and you wonder what she is thinking, you might want to pick up this book.

Horowitz' insights seem convincingly grounded to me, as she stands with one foot planted on the terra firma of scientific research and the other on the cushy throw rug of pure love of dogs. One can go within the space of three pages from a lucid explanation of the structure of a dog's eye (more rods than cones) and what that means about their visual acuity & perception (really good at detecting movement on the periphery of vision; very sensitive to movements that don't fit with their expectations, e.g., bikes, skateboards, etc.) to a diary entry about an experience with her beloved mutt Pumpernickel. To her great credit, the more personal elements of the book aren't just sprinkled atop the scoops of science like peanuts on a sundae; they illustrate her points, move the writing along, and call to mind one's own experiences with dogs.Heartily recommended to anybody who is at all interested in dogs, or even those who just like to see cognitive science in furry, panting action."
38,1416583408,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1041843-erick-pettersen,4,"Although much of what Horowitz writes may seem like common knowledge, because we've seen this behavior from our dogs, she gives credence to suspicion. Yes, she tells of the meaning of dogs' body language, such as the wagging tail or the panting smile. Though, Horowitz also tells of the watchful eyes of dogs that seem to study human behavior with much more diligence than we study theirs. It is through this study of the human psyche that dogs know doing the wiggle dance makes people laugh, the waste basket is not a toy box, and making messes in the house is a no-no. Throughout ""Inside of a Dog,"" Horowitz tells stories of her dog Pump (Pumpernickel) to illustrate sections and chapters. Unbeknown to Pump, Horowitz monitored Pump's behavior for years, so she could gain knowledge and pass that knowledge onto other dog lovers. ""Inside of a Dog"" takes humankind to uncharted territories, allowing dog people the chance to understand more about themselves and their world from a dog's perspective."
39,1416583408,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37796-janet,4,"I rarely read non-fiction but this was a gift from someone who knows I love dogs. Alexandra Horowitz is a psychologist who spent a year researching dog behavior while observing and loving her own dog. She wisely knew not to research dogs in a laboratory - instead she went to dog parks and videotaped dogs doing whatever dogs do. The book is at its best when she just relates the dog behavior she sees and then connects it to scientific knowledge of dog's ancestry and anatomy to help us identify what they are saying when they act in certain ways. She occasionally goes into too much scientific detail but that is more than balanced by stories of her own dog that reinforce her findings with real life examples. I've had a lot of dogs, and I spend a lot of time with them. I didn't find a lot of surprises in this book but I did realize that I'm pretty good at 'reading' my own dogs behavior. This is a fun book for dog lovers. What makes this book stand above others that strive to explain dog behavior is the author's love of her dog, and her love and respect for all dogs. "
40,1416583408,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2265122-barbara-burd,4,"My granddaughter who's six gave me this book because she ""knows I like dogs and it was on the NYT bestsellers list."" I grew up with dogs and have had a dog most of my life, I currently have a little white miniature Schnauzer named Sadie, who I got from a shelter about three years ago. This is definitely a book for dog lovers. It's not a training manual, but rather an attempt to use cognitive behavior theory to explain the actions of dogs, The author began as a scientist studying primates, but because of her love of her dog, re-focused her research on dog behavior, The book is grounded in research, but peppered with anecdotes of her relationship with her dog, While written from a scientific perspective, these stories keep the reader connected to understanding dog behavior. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to understand the umwelt of another species. While the author debunks many of the current beliefs we have about dog behavior and cognition, I appreciate my dog's abilities more after reading this book."
41,1416583408,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65869572-paul-falk,4,"The author explains in a straightforward manner that there is more to a dog than meets the eye. A researcher herself of dog behavior, she offers an interesting perspective, not just for dog owners - everyone. I must admit, some of the examples she presented gave me an aha moment. I came away more knowledgeable about man's and woman's best friend.Ask any dog owner if they ever wished they could communicate more effectively with their dog? Of course, we know the answer to that. Better still, how about if they were able to listen to what their dog had to say? We might be surprised to learn that our canine friends communicate with us more than we realize. We just need to be able to know what to listen for. This well-written book demonstrates how we can look for the subtle signs. If you're a dog owner and think you know it all, then I highly recommend this book to you. You won't be disappointed."
42,1416583408,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3882199-christina,3,"I struggled through a good portion of this book. It was so much more scientifically focused than I realized it would be. There were chapters that seemed to go on long after I was satisfied with the information presented and ready to move on. I wanted to love this book, but I found my favorite parts were actually at the beginning of each chapter, when the author is sharing her personal experiences with her own dog.Overall, I feel as though dogs cannot be stuffed into little boxes according to ""science"". Science says my dog licks my face because he wants me to regurgitate my lunch, whereas I firmly believe those puppy kisses are one of many ways of communicating affection and happiness. :) Basically, I don't even agree with some of this book, despite the research. "
43,1416583408,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5376228-greta-fisher,5,"This book is part science and part love story for the authors late dog. Horowitz attempts to make us see (smell) the world from a dogs perspective and to threat the dog accordingly. A person who has or has had a dog share their life cannot help but feel lucky and perhaps more curious about about the canine who shares their life after having read this book -also (unless this isn't already happening)- take the dog on smell walks -really,really slow walks full of intensive sniffing. Dog and person will not leave the smelly spot until the dog is ready to do so. "
44,1416583408,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23865-rachel,4,"Horowitz provides the dog lover (and really, only a dog lover would be reading this) with insight into how dogs actually perceive the world (as opposed to how humans perceive dogs and the world). While I was initially drawn in by the promise of scientific insight and observation, it was the heartfelt anecdotes of the interactions between the author and her dog, Pump, which really captivated me. My only complaint would be that the book lacked cohesive organization in certain parts."

Some fascinating insights into how dogs have evolved into a symbiotic relationship with humans. Only downside was the author's often pretentious writing style, sounding at times like she'd swallowed a thesaurus or had just gotten a 365 new words a year calendar, interspersed with occasionally too cutesy-poo essays on her own dog, Pumpernickel. Still, a good read and recommended for anyone fascinated by dogs."
46,1416583408,http://goodreads.com/user/show/174365-kurtbg,4,"This is a great book that attempts at describing a dog's inner perspective. the author is an animal behavior psychologist, and, of course, a dog lover. The book is weighted more towards a scientific approach and exploration which I appreciate. I was looking for insights into dog behavior and not a biased dog love fest which can be common in such books. In short, she's aware of the anthropomorphic trappings and does a good job of keeping them in check."
47,1416583408,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1947301-ericka-clouther,3,Not as much interesting information as I was hoping for as a dog owner. Lots of filler.

Dog kisses might not be just dog kisses either but the dogs looking for a little extra treat (regurgitated food- yuck!). The book might have been better with tighter editing.

Some reviewers on Audible mention how the narrator's delivery bothered them. While the narrator wasn't highly engaging, her reading didn't bother me. The plodding movement forward through details that didn't always seem relevant to understanding dogs did.Listening to this book took me longer than usual for most audiobooks, and often I found myself not easily recalling what I had heard last. Aside from a few insights that resonated with me, most of the quality information got lost in the sea of scientific studies about various animals.Thankfully, the final chapter ""The Importance of Mornings"" reviews the major take-aways any dog owner can learn from. If you don't have time for this whole book, flip to that final chapter and read the insights there. The rest of the book has the research to back up Horowitz's conclusions and suggestions, but you really don't have to read them all. "

I love my furry bestfriends, my fuzzy companions, my four-legged children. I take their health, happiness, and safety very seriously. Far more serious than I take my own.That's why I stopped reading at page 34 when Alexandra Horowitz decribes how dogs can taste most of the same flavors as humans and causally mentions how her dog likes the occational grape.... which is highly toxic. I am an uncompromising, inflexible, iron-willed hardass when it comes to toxic substances and animals. I know I am not the only one that had to watch helplessly as a beloved one squirmed and cried and died because they were so heartbreakingly trusting enough to eat something I unwittily gave them.So what does this have to do with dog behavioral traits and how they perceive the world and how we humans anthropomorphize them with our own experiences? For me- everything. I can't read a book about dogs written by an author that doesn't call poison control the second a grape rolls off the counter onto the floor, where a slobbery, life and death wrestling match should await between you and your naïve barking baby.

One thing I felt compelled to mention is when she said ""dogs do not form true packs"" around 12%. Maybe she went on to discuss this more - I'll never know - but clearly she's never lived in a rural area. Dogs form packs ALL the time, and any farmer can tell you that it's a problem with both feral and tame dogs.

Being a person who has been owned by a series of dogs and is currently being handled by a mutt, I have found the relationship between human and dogs special. This book explains why the relationship is unique. As with many who are affliliated with dogs - I do anthropomorphize my pet, as does the author freely admits, but she also goes behind the anthropomorphization, to explain what the behavior is (or may be). I may not look at my dog and other dogs the same way as I have. The writing is easy going without a lot of scientific or clinical jargon."

We get the astounding facts: 200 to 3000 million sensory receptors compared to our miserly 2 million; smell is the fastest way to the brain, faster than vision through the visual cortext, via connections to nerves in olfactory balls; vomeronasal sacs above the mouth or in the nose; constant sniffing is akin to shifting their gaze as we do to take in a scene; dogs have bladders that allow for the release of just a little urine at a time which has no other purpose than marking. But we also get metaphors and analogies that help us feel the science: scents on a hydrant are like a community center bulletin board; preventing a dog a groin/butt smell is tantamount to asking us to open a door blindfolded. I now see Milo, our dog of three years, more keenly. His annoying behaviors are a little less annoying. His actions a bit more fascinating."

I thought there would be some hints on what to do with your dog when it barks or doesn't behave. When I go for walks I see pet owners disciplining their dogs for behaviors that I see as normal behavior, such as barking at strangers. Several times I have seen people hitting or kicking their dog just because they bark at a stranger walking by. But this is not the type of book it is and the writing style just wasn't interesting. If for some reason you need a textbook on dog behavior I would say this would be a good one, but for just the average reader hoping to learn more about why their dog misbehaves, this is not the one to read."

There wasn’t as much content as I was expecting for the length of the book. It could have been condensed as it seemed to take a while to get to the interesting parts. After a certain point I felt like I had gained everything I could from the book and was keen to finish it.

I did however like the chapter about why its a good idea to take your dog for walks where they can just sniff and smell to their heart’s content (the walk is for the dog, not for you) and the way she discounts the pack theory and instead describes the relationship between dogs and their humans as more of a gang of friends.

Ethologist Alexandra Horowitz provides scientific fact and personal anecdotes to illustrate why our dogs do what they do.

75,1416583408,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3088222-harry-steinman,3," Recently read (most of) Alexandra Horowitz’s “Inside of a Dog: What Dogs See, Smell and Know”. I very much enjoyed Horowitz’s inner chapters that describe the biological and physical mechanics of dog senses. The first few chapters—a servicable rehash of the basics of All Things Dog—would be interesting to someone just discovering dogs. The last third proposes to discuss more of dog emotion and reason. The middle chapters are the meat. Chapters names include, “Sniff” “Mute” “Seen By A Dog”. The biological-cum-behavioral reporting is priceless. (Did you know that dogs have several organs for scent processing lacking in humans? The vomernasal organ and olfactory bulbs? Or that speed with which dogs can process light information in the retina’s rod cells means that they cannot see a moving image on an analog TV but can on a digital? Better get your HDTV right now! The next few chapters depart from biological reportage and enter the world of cognitive research. It’s mostly fact-based; no crunchy granola ideas here...not yet. “Seen By A Dog” looks at a dog’s use of its vision. The sections look at attention-getting and gaze following and compares dogs, infants and primates. Where this gets a bit too sweet for me is when Dr. Horowitz makes conclusions about the dog’s cognitive states that are admittedly supported more by her intuition than research: “This must mean that…” She properly telegraphs her opinions, but I’d rather the opinions be left for an afterword or for a final chapter than being mixed in with her otherwise excellent reporting. I was less interested in the outer chapters. “Noble Mind” starts by examining how dogs learn by observing other, and then focuses on Horowitz’ ‘Theory of Mind’—the cognitive ability any animal must possess in order to recognize that another creature has cognition that is independent of the observing animal. Horowitz believes that an animal ""must"" possess a sense of its own cognition in order to realize that another has an independent mind as well.  “Inside of a Dog” attempts to portray the canine mental experience by focusing on the placement and limitations of their physical senses. (For example, how does the height of a dog affect its apprehension of the world?) “You Had Me At Hello” draws the reader further into cognitive territory. And finally, “The Importance of Mornings” is Dr. Horowitz’ prescription for a ideal relationship with a dog. At last we come to opinion as opinion. The description of her model is sometimes too personal for me, but I liked a few of her ideas and may adopt one or two—“take a dog on a smell walk” comes to mind.There’s 100 solid pages of information in the middle. The next 40 pages go into her Theory of Mind and the research that prompts Horowitz’ conclusions. I didn’t find the last 100 pages terribly engaging but all of the book is well-written and another reader might enjoy what I simply skimmed."
76,1416583408,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3452713-cody-sexton,2,"Wittgenstein said that if a lion could speak we wouldn't be able to understand what he said,  because how can we know the world of a lion? But what about the world of a dog? By taking a look at the dog from the dogs point of view, Alexandra Horowitz takes us inside the mind, or life, of the dog. By exploring each of the dogs senses and how they interpret the information received from those senses she shows us a side of our dogs that we rarely think to consider. Take for example the compulsion dogs seem to have when it comes to marking territory. Contrary to popular opinion dogs don't only urinate on objects as a way to mark their territory, but instead, ""marking seems to be a way to leave information about who the urinator is, how often he walks by this spot in the neighborhood, his recent victories, and his interest in mating. In this way, the invisible pile of scents on the hydrant becomes a community center bulletin board."" Almost as if your dog is leaving little wet and yellow friend requests all over town.A lot of the information in this book has been interesting, just not interesting enough to get me to like it better than I did. What I had hoped for was an exposition on the theory of mind applied to dogs but what I got was a Phd dissertation stretched out over three hundred pages peppered with cartoons and diary entries. The author is obviously a scientist first and a writer second, which, to be fair, is not necessarily to her discredit, but it is to her audiences, it's almost as if she tried to cram everything she knew about dogs into one book. I suspect that those who have never been around dogs for any length of time, or even know what a dog is, are going to be the only ones that will get any real benefit out of this book. As for the rest of us, well, you don't ask questions when you know the answers viscerally. So, after reading this, what is it like to be a dog? I don't know. I can imagine what it would be like to be me as a dog but that's not the same thing. And that's not usually what we mean when we ask that question. Whatever it's like, I bet it's pretty sweet. "
77,1416583408,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1127864-sandy,5,"That bark--that incessant, sharp, and, oh, so very loud bark--is a good thing. It is an invitation to play. Though to my ears it is rather like a drill sergeant's inviting me to drop and give him 50, it is a friendly appeal. Until I read Alexandra Horowitz's Inside of a Dog, What Dogs See, Smell, and Know, I was sure my daughter's dog, Clyde the dachshund mix from the shelter in Monroe, hated my living guts.Having read this book, I feel better. And smarter.The gentle, humble look--the look that says, 'Do with me what you will'?--when my daughter puts him in his winter coat is a look of submission, but this is not a good thing. The winter coat is like the blanket under which we used to insert him every night, thinking it was a good thing. When I told my daughter that in Clyde's mind this was a show of our dominance, the tucking-in came to an end. (The wearing of coats continues because he shivers when he should poop so she'll bring him inside, and she won't be played.)Another detail I couldn't let my daughter read for herself but had to report across the living room: Those crazy kisses he gives you when we get home after a long day? He is trying to get you to regurgitate and share whatever you ate after a day of hunting.Because dogs are dogs, not three-dimensional avatars of our wild selves. They are their own selves. Horowitz's book describes the sensory and cognitive experiences of dogs and how we've come to know these things about them. The book is as readable as it is insightful and fun. My favorite moment in the book comes when she describes how dogs use their best loved tool to achieve their desired results. The tool? Their humans. You want that treat you can't quite get to? Then get to the human whom you can get to in so many ways. The treat is yours.Dogs are our connection to the wild. Having read this book, I have come to appreciate we are wild. We are connected. We change everything. To love your dog as a dog is to love all that is wild and to find our place in that landscape."
78,1416583408,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4901614-caroline,5,"Maybe this is just because I like cognitive psychology and I love dogs, but I absolutely loved this book. It is, in some places, a little technical -meaning there are certain passages people might struggle with if they don't have some kind of background knowledge about cognition. However, for the most part, it is highly readable.I think my favorite part (besides everything else that I loved) is reading her little descriptions of her dog Pumpernickel (the whole book is almost a eulogy to the dog, who died a few years before the book was published). I found that I could thoroughly relate to the uniqueness she saw in some of her dog's little quirks (for example: I was always fascinated how, whenever my dog needed medication, he always managed to eat the turkey I would hide it in, then daintily spit the pill out).My favorite insight is how she points out how much dogs love smells. They obviously don't distinguish between good smells and bad smells like we do -there is only interesting smells and uninteresting smells. We bathe dogs for our own happiness; Fido doesn't really care how bad he smells, so long as he smells like himself. She advises owners to let dogs smell like themselves for as long as we can stand it so that they can be recognizable to other dogs more easily. Although the book is not necessarily a reliable training manual, it does provide some insights into what will make training simpler. For example, the mistake I tend to see most often around the dog park is when an owner admonishes a dog for not coming when called. She points out that in a dog's understanding of the world, the consequence comes with your arrival, not the with behavior it probably didn't realize it was supposed to be engaged in. Therefore, the owner is actually lowering their chances of having their dog come when called.In the end, I would highly recommend this book for anybody who owns a dog or is thinking about getting a dog. Insight in your dog's umwelt (their experience of the world) might, in the end, make you a better dog owner."
79,1416583408,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5684635-michelle,5,"I am so glad to finally be sitting down and writing this review. It has taken me a good couple of weeks to get to it because I didn't have time at first and then we had some major trauma occur with our own dog last week that made me unable to face actually writing a review on a dog book. That's all over now (with a happy ending luckily!) so here I am now to finally give my thoughts on this book.First up, this is a book about dogs so I was pretty much bound to love it straight away. Our dog is pretty much on par with our first born so I just love reading about dogs in any way I can and seeing how other people relate to their own canines.Inside of a Dog was a great mix to me. It was full of scientific research facts thrown in with a lot of the author's personal experiences and observations with her own dog and others in comparison. I found some of the chapters utterly fascinating, especially the part that describes just how powerful a dog's nose really is. We have a beagle so the little bit thrown in there about what a beagle can detect with their nose meant that I have never looked at her the same since reading it.I loved all of the comparisons made between dogs and other species of animals and I also loved the cute little personal reflections that were thrown in at the beginning and throughout most of the chapters by the author and her beloved dog 'Pump'. You can tell that this book was written by a true dog lover, not just someone with a lot of canine knowledge who decided to write a book about it. Yes, I sometimes smell my dog and find myself laying down next to her to get a feel for what she is thinking and after almost losing her last week all I can say is that anyone who doesn't understand the amazing bond we can have with these animals is missing out big time.I highly recommend this book to anyone who is a dog lover and wants to know a little bit more about the inner workings of these wonderful animals. "
80,1416583408,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17252252-kate,3,"This book was mostly enjoyable because of Horowitz's exuberant, unrestrained affection for dogs, which appears nearly every page with an endearing anecdote about her dog Pumpernickel (AKA Pump). No one who has ever known and loved a dog can fail to be moved by her descriptions of dogs playing, sleeping, nuzzling, and getting into doggish trouble.The book is also written in a generally amiable and approachable voice, neither talking down to the reader nor charging ahead with complex scientific concepts that would go over most readers' heads. The one issue that I have with this book is that there isn't enough of the complex scientific concepts — it's surely easier to explain dog cognition to the lay reader if one doesn't go beyond theories and ideas that would be on any respectable Psych 101 syllabus. Horowitz does note that dogs, unlike chimps or humans or even rats, have been relatively neglected by psychology and neuroscience, and for a long time what we ""knew"" about dogs was either from behavioral observation or analogy to wolves' behavior. Perhaps this accounts for the lack of really neurosciencey stuff (fMRI studies? EEG data on dogs?) that I was expecting from this book — those experiments may not have been done yet.Setting aside my issue with the not-science-heavy nature of the book, it is an interesting philosophical piece on the dog. Horowitz mentions often how we anthropomorphize dogs, often to their and our detriment. After highlighting dogs' strengths (sense of smell, ability to manipulate humans with cuteness) and how their experiences differ from humans, she makes a good argument for why we should consider these differences in how we interact with our dogs (for example, by not pulling our dog away from sniffing ""nothing"" on the sidewalk). This book is like a travel guide that clues you in to the customs of another culture, but the foreign culture here is the unique province of the Dog."

""Inside of a Dog"" is an incredible look at the world through the eyes of a dog - and a psychiatrist. (I think she's a psychiatrist? Something along those lines.) It's the story of the author's dogs, Pumpernickel and Finnegan, a comprehensive observation of dogs, a study of human psychology, and so much more. Packed with wisdom from such unlikely tangential sources as Jacques Derrida, and the more predictable ones like Pavlov, this book encourages us to really look at the world through the eyes of a dog - without being trite or schmaltzy about it. The author explains at length the importance of smell and hearing to a dog, and how those senses color their world - more so even than eyesight. In a practical sense, I learned a lot about dog behaviors from this book. Aside from knowing, even, now I *understand* why dogs go for the groin as soon as I walk into their homes; why they jump up, bracing their paws on my forearms, and try to smush their faces close to mine; why the little chihuahua who was off-leash and running in the middle of a two way street ran when I stopped my car and tried to pick him up (I was so close!); and why they have to stop at every single clump of grass and stick their noses in it, or stare into the bushes for five minutes at a time. I feel like I can read them better now and understand their world, and that kind of animal psychology has always been interesting to me. The only weird thing about this book is the writing. I'd almost question whether English was the author's native language or not, because the diction and syntax are just a little off. It took me out of the book a couple times, and made the text seem almost cumbersome to read sometimes, but don't let that stop you from picking this up."
82,1416583408,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4817593-tl-wagener,2,"Honestly I always finish books. And this one sits on my bedside table, a pen stuck in the spot where I stopped. Dammit!I got it at the airport in Las Vegas, on a layover from Dallas to L.A. (O! Vegas! I so do not get you!) Such a pretty book. I shopped every bookseller in the terminal, looking for a magazine that wasn't insulting or a book that I actually might want to own. This was the only remaining copy of a beautifully designed book and I love me the dogs so -- yeah. I sprang for it.I kept reading and reading and waiting for some revelation. I did like the news about the domesticated foxes, and that has been a topic of many lovely ensuing conversations with friends. But she lost me when she recommended feeding grapes to dogs (renal failure? hello?) and also when she suggested that all dogs hate all clothing. (Thundershirts? Ever hear of them?)I didn't wait around for strike three. I got stuck, questioning both her intentions and her credibility. I enjoyed ""The Secret Life of Dogs"" much more, years ago -- written by, basically, a curious dog stalker. This scientist needs to get out from behind her computer and hang out with some real live dogs.I did think her barely veiled contempt for ""The Dog Whisperer"" tenents was interesting. But there is no arguing with the results Milan achieves. I have no doubt Horowitz had a great time writing this.But ultimately I felt taken by this book -- seduced by the cover. (Grrrrr!) And, of course, my love for my dog."
83,1416583408,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1419068-elaine,3,"I love dogs and have had at least two at a time for most of my life. During the rare spells when I haven't had a dog, I always felt somehow incomplete. To me, then this book is of great interest. Horowitz's shtick is what it feels like to be a dog, and that is what this book is about. The science is a bit uneven: usually well-researched, but some notable gaps. She neglects some of the most recent and startling studies of dog cognition and her incomplete understanding of how humans actually speak leads her to some questionable conclusions on how much laguage dogs really understand. (Hint: they understand a whole lot.) Where she shines is on her discussions of dogs' tactile sense and how important it is for a dog to snuggle, for instance, and how uncomfortable it is for a dog to have clothing put on him. She also waxes poetic about the world of smell a dog lives in and she tries to make a case for us to be as smelly as possible and for allowing our dogs to be equally odiferous. That is, dogs would be far happier if we didn't shower so often or subject them to baths so often. Dog lover that I am, that's where I draw the line. My poor dogs will just have to be olfactorily deprived. Daily showers for me and weekly baths for them are required for me to have a happy sense of smell."
84,1416583408,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63682256-allison-davis,4,"This is an informational chapter book suited for intermediate grade levels (3rd-6th grades) about how dogs see, smell and do certain things (from a dog’s perspective.) This book allows readers to understand dogs’ cognitive abilities and draw an image of what it might be like through a dog’s eye. The text illustrates what it’s like for a dog to see, smell, and understand things like a human’s behavior and another dogs’ behavior. All of these topics are why I found this book informational to read.After finding this book, it reminded me of a fiction book that I read while I was in late elementary school titled Because of Winn-Dixie by Kate DiCamillo. It is the story of a ten-year-old girl who one day comes home with a dog and starts to take more chances because of her dog, Win-Dixie. Both books listed share examples of how dogs affect humans and interact daily. Both of these books include advanced vocabulary and longer text with little illustration. They fit well together because Inside of a Dog: What Dogs See, Smell and Know is about the science of dogs, while Because of Winn-Dixie is a story of how a human and her dog learn from one another, and how this dog interacts with her. Students will learn realistic knowledge from the nonfiction book and be touched from Because of Winn-Dixie."
85,1416583408,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92860560-lauren-hammonds,5,I enjoyed this book very much and above all others so far. 
86,1416583408,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2277259-stephanie,3,"Granted this is the first book written by an animal psychologist regarding dogs that I have read. I picked it up as a result of having heard the author present some of her observations during a panel discussion at Columbia University entitled ""Dog Days: A Scientific Look at Man's Best Friend"" (which was not that scientific at all ...). I liked what I was reading at first, but then found parts of the book tiresome in an incomprehensible way, given the dog devotee that I am. I certainly recognized that going for ""smell walks"" are important to doggies, and perhaps I've slowed down my pace somewhat so that I, too, could enjoy the outdoors, but much of the book presents material that is not new to me. So ... I tired of the book about halfway into it and opted to put it down, then just read bits and pieces of it when I had a few minutes to get through a chapter or so. Dunno if I reacted this way because of my medical background and my frequent reading of veterinary medicine research (which after all is at the forefront of medical breakthroughs for human medicine), but I found some of the back-and-forth between the author's discussion of canine behavior transposed with comments regarding her own dogs a bit pretentious and mawkish. "
87,1416583408,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4268136-bubba61909,5,"I actually really liked this book because it not only reinforces what i already knew about dogs but it gave me more insight into many aspects of a dog. How they smell, what it is like for them to smell how they act and so on. If you own a dog and are a little puzzled about some of the things your dog does, then you need to read this book. I own two dogs and some of the things that both of them do has been explained now. For example, when the two of them play it almost looks extremely aggressive but now I watch them and can notice some of the signs that they use for play. Also when they put their noses to the ground and are off and running, instead of worrying I let them go. Another good tip from this book is to take different types of walks, such as smell walks, fast walks, slow walks, let your dog take you for a walk (not literally but let them lead you along). This actually works when taking them around the block, let you r dog smell everything and they will let you know how happy that makes them feel. I wish that more people had dogs in their lives because there is no better joy in my life then waking up and having my best buddies there with me. Please read this book for your dogs sake, they will thank you in the end."
88,1416583408,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1270256-stacey,1,"I'm not sure if my rating is the most fair, but whatever... I wasn't able to finish the book. And that is saying something because I'm working on getting over my moral obligation to read every book that I start-this book seemed to help me make another step in the right direction. But this book put me to sleep every night, I just couldn't continue on. It is not fictional. I do occasionally read non-fiction, and most of them I do not mind-so that's not the reason why I didn't like it. I was expecting a dog story, but its not. Its just a compilation of information that a scientist learned while studying dogs. She includes small excerpts about her dog, but none of the ones I read were very entertaining. I guess it reads more like a textbook than anything else. It did make me think about my dog a little more, and why he does the things that he does. But I didn't learn a whole lot because I only managed to make it a little less than halfway through. I read purely for relaxation and my own interests. I guess if I was really interested in dogs and their behavior this would be a good selection. But for someone looking for a good and entertaining book, this is not it. Sorry..."
89,1416583408,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3341355-kevin,5,"Great book! Exactly what I expected it to be, a subtle glimpse into the hows and whys of dog behavior. While not a 300 page article in a scholarly journal, it offers an excellent level of insight for the lay person trying to understand what's going on in Fido's head. While some have complained that the book is too dry and not what they expected, what were they expecting? The book is not ""Marley and Me"", nor is it a book on how to train your dog. It seems many who read (or tried to read) the book were looking for something it never promised to be; ""Marley and Me 2"", a 300 page pat on the back for the way in which they raised their dogs, or confirmations of their beliefs on dog behavior. Unfortunately for the latter, the author is a Ethologist (Animal Behaviorist) and Psychologist, so she might know what she's talking about. Even if it contradicts one's preconceived notions of dog training and behavior. If you're open minded and interested in what's probably going on inside of a dogs head it's a fascinating read. If you're look for something more in depth check out the author's references in the ""Notes and Sources"". A great book though."
