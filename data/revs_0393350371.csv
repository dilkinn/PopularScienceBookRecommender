0,0393350371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,3,"This book is a collection of fascinating essays. Each essay is a gem; Tyson has excellent points of view about a number of subjects related to space exploration. The main theme of the book, is that NASA's funding should be increased, in order to allow manned space flights beyond low-Earth orbit. Tyson has some very good reasons for this; perhaps the chief reason is that only manned space flights will generate enthusiasm among young people, sufficient to encourage them to become scientists and engineers. And the missions need to go beyond low-Earth orbit, because satellites and manned missions in low-Earth orbit are ""old hat"". They have been done many times, and do not generate enthusiasm any longer. Tyson is a fantastic spokesperson for the space program, and his common-sense approach and his sense of humor come through on every page.So, why only three stars? There is no underlying structure to the book. The essays become very repetitive. Each essay discusses the space program from a slightly different point of view--over and over and over again. The last third of the book is an appendix containing the legislation that created NASA. Hmmmm....not that interesting, to tell the truth. There really isn't enough material here to make a book--the appendix seems like filler. This is disappointing, because Tyson's message is right on the mark, and his writing style is...fun!"

I listened to the book which worked out nicely with one or two magazine articles each commute trip direction. I confess I didn't retain much; but in reality, there isn't much meat here to digest. Superficial and a little repetitive; this was mildly educational, entertaining and amusing. A much needed primer and some well-earned cheer leading for NASA. Love de Grasse Tyson which inevitably influenced my rating.3.5 Stars rounded upListened to the audiobook. Mirron Willis narrated. At times he sounded like a text-to-speech application."
2,0393350371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,2,"I really struggled with this book. I love space and space travel - I have lived through and been thrilled by the entire space race and the development of space science. I expected to love a book by a great astronomer and science populariser, but instead I pretty well had to give up, part way through.There are two problems. The lesser one is the structure of the book. It consists of a collection of articles, interviews and such that Tyson has produced on the subject of space exploration. This inevitably means there is repetition. A lot of repetition. It's not that what he is saying is not interesting, but after you've heard it for the tenth time it loses its novelty. Perhaps the most interesting thing is the way Tyson is so obviously pulled in two directions. On the one hand he appreciates how superior unmanned satellites and explorers are from a bang-per-buck science viewpoint. On the other hand he believes manned missions are essential to raise interest levels. But of course manned missions are very expensive and almost purely political/military in role, so he really does have to go through some entertaining gymnastics to defend them.But the thing that made me give up was the sheer jingoism of the book. If you aren't an American, I can guarantee this book will irritate you. Here's one example, the words of an interviewer speaking to Tyson (who Tyson doesn't argue with): 'If we land on Mars, how are we going to know if USA is number one if an American astronaut is standing next to a French guy? Are we going to say, ""Go Earth!""? No, we're going to say, ""Go USA!"" Right?' So basically international cooperation like CERN is a waste of time and money - all that's important, all that space science is about, is knowing that USA is number one.An even better example, as it is purely Tyson's own remarks is when he is talking about the aerospace industry, bemoaning the loss of US control. He says 'In the fifties, sixties, seventies, part of the eighties, every plane that landed in your city was made in America. From Aerolineas Argentinas to Zambian Airways, everybody flew Boeings.' I'm sorry? I worked for an airline in the 1970s, and I can tell you this is total baloney (which is apparently American for bilge). Remind me, for example, who built the Comet, the first jet airliner. Which American company? Oh, no, it was British. Of course Boeing was the biggest player in the period he describes, but there were plenty of others. (There were even a couple of other US manufacturers. Remember Lockheed?) Could I just point out also who made the only supersonic airliner flying back then. And come to think of it, the only one to fly ever since. The UK and France. And what did the US contribute to this amazing advance? They tied it up with red tape and objections so it was almost impossible to fly it.This really made me angry, I'm afraid. In another article, Tyson tells off a judge for inaccuracy because he referred to 1,700 milligrams rather than 1.7 grams. Okay, it wasn't a particularly sensible convention, but at least it wasn't wrong. Saying 'all planes were (US) Boeings' is just factual inaccuracy to put across your political position. A book on space travel must cover politics, but once it is so hugely politically biased towards one country, however significant it may have been to the aerospace business, it loses credibility. This isn't a book about space science, it's a rallying cry for Americans. That's something that has its place. I'm not knocking America, and it's good that Tyson is proud of his country. But a science book isn't the place for such sentiments. Review first published on www.popularscience.co.uk and reproduced with permission"
3,0393350371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2201886-mike,3,"“Space Chronicles”.I like the topic. I like the author. I like his style, his insights, his humor (most of the time), and his enthusiasm for what lies beyond the wild blue yonder.This would have been a great book at one-quarter length. Why do I say that? Because there is so much repetition of themes: to the point where whole sentences and even passages are identical in multiple places. Not that the specific places where these statements get re-used are inappropriate or just “filler”. No, they are logically part of the “article” (i.e. chapter). But because this book is taken from a large number of short articles and interviews over a few years, the same topics are addressed and the same facts and issues are raised. It’s a by-product of how the book was created.If the author had set forth to write a book that touched on his experiences over the same time frame he could (and I’m sure would have) created an informative, amusing, and insightful look at the prospects of the US Manned and unmanned (i.e. robotic) Space Programs, NASA itself, the technology and it’s successes (e.g. Hubble Space Telescope) and failures (e.g. Challenger, Columbia, various probes), and the challenges ahead. It would have gotten at least a four-star rating.Taken individually, each article is very good. If I isolated a few key chapters in “Space Chronicles”, then I could write glowingly of this and that, but even 50 pages in I was getting annoyed by the repetition. Maybe I had expectations that were too high. In the past I read collections of columns from authors such as Isaac Asimov and I did not feel that way. Perhaps because the range of topics was more varied and there was less repetition.If you are a fan of space & space exploration, then there is good, frankly-reported material here. If you like Neil deGrasse Tyson from other writings or from seeing him on PBS (or other shows where he is a talking head, which I have not), then maybe you will not mind the recycling of his views. I like his appearances on PBS and I understand the way the book came about. I’m giving the book a moderate score only because I could not ignore the boredom of reading the same stuff. I still recommend it, though and I will keep looking for more original material from him."
4,0393350371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5667430-simon,4,"I'm starting to think and hope that Neil DeGrasse Tyson is our generation's version of Carl Sagan. In that he not only writes and speak about space with such energy and passion, but he shares Sagan's ability to explain the universe in humurous, elegant and easy to understand ways, that make his work accessible to the laymen, as well as the passionate science and space geeks out there.I watched Tyson give an interview the other night and he had me shouting ""yes!"" at the television as he systematically debunked superstious nonsense with such ease, and like all good scientists concentrated on revealing the beauty of the natural world and the process of evolution, from exploding stars through to the elements wich make up our beautiful planet and bodies. We are only star-matter after all :)This is the first book I've read of his, and I'm too early in to give any kind of critical review, but I can say that 50 pages in and I already love it. I'll write more about it layer, but as for Neil DeGrasse Tyson, he's already in my book of legends."
5,0393350371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5286233-j-p,4,"One has to be careful in writing about science. Dumb it down and you risk losing your main audience who'll think it was written for grade schoolers but make it too advanced and people tend to get bored with all the technical jargon.The author's approach is just right. What I liked best was he correctly points out that there are other reasons besides exploration for having a space program. There are scientific discoveries that can be applied for the benefit of all. It will interest kids so they might choose science or engineering as a career. As he says about the number of lawyers graduating college compared to scientists: "" It tells me we are going into the future fully prepared to litigate over the crumbling of our infrastructure."" He makes his points without getting redundant. Well, most of the time. Which brings us to the one little drawback in this book. This is a compilation of previous writings so there are places where points of view get repeated. (Just half a cent of the budget goes for space exploration folks, for those of you up there in the cheap seats that's right, half a cent.)This book raises valid questions and more importantly supplies workable answers and backs it up with data. A fun and informative read."
6,0393350371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13536962-amanda,2,"In short: a number of essays where deGrasse Tyson argues that America needs to spend more on NASA and its science and research. Many good arguments that people might not be thinking about. Some history on space travels and their impacts on science, culture, and more. He goes on arguing that America needs more space travels, but he's arguing that while space travels without humans (only robots) is cheaper, astronauts become symbols, almost celebrities and can cause the general population to take a greater interest in space travels, something robots won't. All in all, the arguments are all well and good, but with the endless repetition that comes out of the fact that this is just a collection of essays, many are repeated (often the ones with least impact), and they lose their ""punch"" after the third time they're are repeated.

7,0393350371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,5,"Space Chronicles: Facing The Ultimate Frontier by Neil deGrasse Tyson “Space Chronicles"" is the inspirational plea of why NASA matters to America and what space exploration means to our species. Renowned astrophysicist, Neil deGrasse Tyson dissects the politics of space and also enlightens the reader of the sense of awe that comes from space exploration and discovery. This book selections represent commentary, interviews, thought-provoking quotes reflecting a spectrum of fascinating topics from one of our icons of science. I share the love and awe of science that radiates from Mr. Tyson; this book arouses such emotions in witty, lucid fashion while stressing the importance of America retaining its global leadership in space. This 384-page book is composed of thirty-six chapters and broken it in three Parts: Part I. Why, Part II. How, and Part III. Why Not. The first part of the book (Why) has to do with why we want to explore space. It appeals to emotions and wonder and the politics involved. The second part of the book (How), is of more practical science. The last third of the book (Why Not) wraps everything together and is the most passionate. Positives:1.	A passionate, engaging prose that reflects the love of science of Mr. Tyson.2.	Fascinating topic in the hands of an icon of astrophysics.3.	Witty and humorous tone.4.

Practical appendices and charts.Negatives:1.	The book tends to be repetitive. A lot of the stories and interviews overlap so some concepts and thoughts are repeated. 2.	It is not an in depth look at the science of astrophysics. It is more about educating the public of why it's important to funds NASA appropriately. So those looking for an in depth look at the science of astrophysics will surely be disappointed.3.	This book is a plea to fund NASA. Politics is involved but the author treats the topic with utmost respect and care. He is clearly appreciated and respected by both parties as evidenced by being appointed by both parties to important position. That being said, he does make it clear that he is left of liberal.4.	No bibliography or extended notes of references. I would have been interested in reading some recommendations.5.	No colorful illustrations of space, so this is not a cocktail table book.6.	Having to wait for the author's next book and/or Cosmos series!In summary, I loved this book. It spoke to my love and passion for knowledge and the value to our culture of new voyages. No one makes a better case for the need of space exploration and the drive of discovery than Neil deGrasse Tyson. Space travel is not just an emotional frontier, it is the frontier of all sciences. That being said, some readers may be disappointed that the book focuses more the emotional appeal to fund NASA than the hardcore science. That aside, if you want to rekindle your love for space exploration and discovery by all means read this highly recommended book!"
8,0393350371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2665859-vicky-n,4,"Space Chronicles is a compilation of essays, interviews and even tweets by everyone's favorite astrophysicist, Neil deGrasse Tyson. They all discuss the history of space travel, how it came to be and what can be expected in the future. It is divided in three parts.Part one: Why It talks about why we are so fascinated with space. It discusses everything from what the requirements for life are to the probabilities of been killed by an asteroid (which, spoiler alert, is the same as dying on an airplane).Part two: How Talks about how space travel became possible. It discusses how the technology for space was invented, how flying was started and it talks about the evolution from the Space Race era and the Space Shuttle era.Part three: Why notNeil Tyson very candidly talks about the lack of progress during the past few decades, his disappointment and the reasons behind why there has been no progress. And how even other countries see space as a commercial enterprise and no longer look forward to space exploration.Neil Tyson initially wanted to name this book, Failure to Launch: The Dreams and Delusions of Space Enthusiasts, which is a way more fitting name than Space Chronicles. The purpose of this book is to educate people about space and how little progress there has been since NASA's budget nowadays doesn't allow much. It is a cry for people to remember how small we are compared to the rest of the universe and we need to do something or we will become extinguished. Space Chronicles' greatest fault is mainly that it is a bit repetitive since it is a compilation of works and they sometimes overlap. But it is very interesting and very important subject that everyone needs to be aware of.If you are a space enthusiast I would recommend you read this book because it will teach you a bit more of space.And if you're not that this is the perfect book for you to start!"
9,0393350371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22189980-belhor,1,"Can't do it man. Just can't keep reading this thing. It's not interesting. It's too disjointed for me to enjoy, and too much stuff about NASA's policy and things like that. I wanted to read something like ""packing for mars"" I guess. So, even though I love Neil and his mustache and everything, I will have to stop reading this book right here."
10,0393350371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52046098-edmund-young,5,"I never thought reading about science can be easy and fun. I like the style of Neil deGrasse Tyson. He is now officially my favorite author. I did not understand why the appendices at the end were added, but, apart from that, in my opinion this is a 5-star book."
11,0393350371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2110092-preeti,4,"I can't remember anymore how or where I first came across Neil deGrasse Tyson. What I do remember is taking an instant liking to the man. I first started reading one of his earlier books, Death by Black Hole: And Other Cosmic Quandaries, though I never got through the entire thing because I ended up giving it to my grandfather who took it back to India. With so many books on my reading list, I haven't had a chance to get another copy.Around that time, I also saw Dr. Tyson speak at an event at Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History in NYC. He has so much energy and so much passion that you just fall under the spell.This is me super excited to meet Dr. Tyson and he's just chillin', signing my book.When I first heard about this book, I knew I had to read it. This is probably more up my alley than Death by Black Hole, because I have trouble wrapping my mind around physics, especially astrophysics, and that book is much more physics-heavy. There is a bit of physics and such in this but definitely nothing too complicated. Bottom line is that anyone can read this.Space Chronicles outlines the past and present (and potential future) of space exploration and in particular, discusses why NASA is so important. The book is definitely focused on the United States and its place in this arena. In fact, it's very ""USA, USA!"" so that's something to keep in mind. I do see why he puts it in this light, because this is an appeal to the people of the US to not let our space program die.Another potential criticism is that there is a lot of repetitiveness throughout. This is because this book is composed of a variety of essays, speeches, interviews, etc. from various sources so you tend to see a lot of his ideas repeated. I didn't really mind this as much because it helped to cement the ideas in my head. However, I can see where this would become annoying for others.Other than these criticisms, I think this is a very important book and should be widely read. I learned so much, not just about space exploration but just how stuff works, especially politically. For example, why did we get to the moon? Because humans - Americans? - value exploration, dreaming, curiosity? No! It was because we were trying to beat the Soviet Union during the Cold War, to show our might. That's the only reason all that money could be justified. Were it not for the Sputnik and the subsequent ""firsts"" made by the Soviet Union, maybe we would never have reached the moon.I wasn't born during moon landings and I was barely 4 when the Challenger disaster happened. [Fun fact! The development I grew up in had streets named after the Challenger and all the people who died in it.] But growing up, I always had a deep interest in space and even wanted to be an astronaut at one point. (Although who didn't want to be an astronaut when they were little?) This book really opened my eyes and made me think - we did these huge things back in the 60s and 70s, but where are we now? How come humans are not going back into space anymore? (Dr. Tyson explains the different between low earth orbit (LEO) and actually going into space.)Another major discussion point in the book is the cost of going into space (often mentioned is that NASA's yearly budget is on average half a penny per dollar of the federal budget) vs. the benefits and justifications. I think his arguments are solid and make sense.One criticism I have about all the space cheerleading is this:Throughout the book, the viewpoint is that space is the only exciting thing left. This is how it comes off to me. That we - kids especially - need the lure of space travel to be excited about going into science. But there is still so much left on Earth to explore too. So much that we don't know. A big example is the oceans. I might be a bit biased here because I love the oceans and am really into marine biology but still. I absolutely understand that we need excitement about space to get our program (in the US) going again and get students willing to go in that direction. But that doesn't mean it's the only thing left or that there aren't compelling things left on Earth to explore.I could probably go on and on but I'll try to wrap it up. I really loved the characteristic humor infused throughout the book and there were places where I literally laughed out loud. Especially the chapter America and the Emergent Space Powers. This was the funniest in the book, in my opinion. I also liked the tweets from Dr. Tyson that were sprinkled throughout the book. Some of them added to the text and some of them were funny asides, like this one:""At a fine Italian restaurant this evening. Served grappa at meal's end. NASA should study it as a replacement rocket fuel""I would recommend this book to everyone!"
12,0393350371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1360862-bry,5,"Dr. Tyson is a genius. He is BRILLAINT. He is good hearted. He is observant. And he is a master of explaining anything and everything in an easy to understand manner. I mean seriously, he could be explaining how paint dries and I would be completely enthralled and fascinated by the process. This book is a collection of his wittings, speeches, and interviews over the years and revolves around man's journey into the universe. He talks about why we should make the effort to escape low orbit and how we should do it. Then he plays devils advocate and explains why we haven't, why it's difficult, and why we will never achieve sometimes at all. It is completely well rounded and bipartisan. He explains that space is not for one person versus another. It doesn't matter what color, race, religion, or political follower you are. Space is for everyone. Plus ep his explanation of the cosmos really makes you see just how small humans are in the gist of it all. Most would find that depressing. Me? I find it amazing. We are small in the context of the universe and as such we are so alike compared to everything else out there. Thus we should be celebrating our similarities instead of our differences. I don't see our smallness in the universe as a reason to be sad, but instead I see it as a reason to come together. To hate one another a little less. Because maybe if we did we could get our shit together and explore Mars. Seriously, do yourself a favor and read this book. Hell, read every book this man has written because he is a genius and it will better both your mind, your imagination, and you heart. Geeze this review is barely coherent, but I guess the point of it is that even though you may not be interested in space you should still read this book! Dr Tyson is bettering our world one lecture, book, tv show at a time, and we should all experience it. "
13,0393350371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1408078-david,2,"A collection of essays written by Tyson over the years. Essays describe America's history in space and our current aimlessness in space exploration. The essays are consistent: we went to Moon to beat the Russians - essentially a Cold War endeavor; a nation that does not dream and think about tomorrow is doomed; other nations will pass us by; with NASA's share of the US budget less than 1/2 of 1% we can do great things if only we'd look up and dream. As someone who once dreamed of being an astronaut and who even now spends time looking up at the stars and planets (check out Venus and Jupiter this week), this book ends up being a disappointment because it is both repetitive and rambling. Tyson could have taken a quarter of his essays and gotten the same point across in an even stronger way. Too bad because Tyson's message is right on the mark."
14,0393350371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3765278-rich,4,"My favorite part of the book was Tyson's keynote speech at the Goddard Memorial Dinner in 2005:""One day I was reading the newspaper--a dangerous thing to do, always--and I saw a headline complaining, 'HALF OF SCHOOLS IN DISTRICT SCORED BELOW AVERAGE.' Well, that's kind of what an average is! You get about half below and half above...I've got another example. It's often said that the state lottery is a tax on the poor, because people with low incomes spend a disproportionate amount of their money on lottery tickets. It is not a tax on the poor. It's a tax on the people who never studied mathematics."" -203-4""Some people want to put warning stickers on biology textbooks, saying that the theory of evolution is just one of many theories, take it or leave it. Now, religion long predates science; it'll be here forever. That's not the issue. The problem comes when religion enters the science classroom. There's no tradition of scientists knocking down the Sunday school door, telling preachers what to teach. Scientists don't picket churches. By and large--though it may not look this way today--science and religion have achieved peaceful coexistence for quite some time. In fact, the greatest conflicts in the world are not between religion and science; they're between religion and religion. This is not simply an academic point. Let's go back a millennium. Between A.D. 800 and A.D. 1200 the intellectual center of the Western world was Baghdad. Why? It's leaders were open to whoever wanted to think stuff up: Jews, Christians, Muslims, doubters. Everybody was granted a seat at the debating table, maximizing the exchange of ideas. Meanwhile, the written wisdom of the world was being acquired by the libraries of Baghdad and translated into Arabic. As a result, the Arabs made advances in farming, commerce, engineering, medicine, mathematics, astronomy, navigation. Do you realize that two-thirds of all the named stars in the night sky have Arabic names? If you do something first and best, you get naming rights. The Arabs got naming rights to the stars twelve hundred years ago because they charted them better than anybody had done before. They pioneered the fledgling system of Hindu numerals in the new field of algebra, itself an Arabic word--which is how the numerals came to be called 'Arabic numerals.' 'Algorithm,' another familiar word, derives from the name of the Baghdad-based mathematician who also gave us the basics of algebra. So what happened? Historians will say that with the sack of Baghdad by Mongols in the thirteenth century, the entire nonsectarian intellectual foundation of that enterprise collapsed, along with the libraries that supported it. But if you also track the cultural and religious forces at play, you find that the influential writings of the eleventh-century Muslim scholar and theologian Al-Ghazali shaped how Islam viewed the natural world. By declaring the manipulation of numbers to be the work of the devil, and by promoting the concept of Allah's will as the cause of all natural phenomena, Ghazali unwittingly quenched scientific endeavor in the Muslim world. And it has never recovered, even to this day. From 1901 to 2010, of the 543 Nobel Prize winners in the sciences, two were Muslim. Yet Muslims comprise nearly one-fourth of the world's population.Today among fundamentalist Christians as well as Hassidic Jews, there is a comparable absence. When societies and cultures are permeated by nonsecular philosophies, science and technology and medicine stagnate."" -205-6.He chides people who think science is about comfort with answers: ""But you can't be a scientist if you're uncomfortable with ignorance, because scientists live at the boundary between what is known and unknown in the cosmos. This is very different from the way journalists portray us. So many articles begin, 'Scientists now have to go back to the drawing board.' It's as though we're sitting in our offices, feet up on our desks--masters of the universe--and suddenly say, 'Oops, somebody discovered something!' No. We're always at the drawing board. If you're not at the drawing board, you're not making discoveries. You're not a scientist; you're something else."" -183UFOs: ""Do I believe in UFOs or extraterrestrial visitors? Where shall I begin? There's a fascinating frailty of the human mind that psychologists know all about, called 'argument from ignorance.' This is how it goes. Remember what the 'U' stands for in ""UFO""? . . . The 'U' stands for 'unidentified.' But then you say, 'I don't know what it is; it must be aliens from outer space, visiting from another planet.' The issue here is that if you don't know what something is, your interpretation of it should stop immediately. You don't then say it must be X or Y or Z. That's argument from ignorance. It's common. I'm not blaming anybody; it may relate to our burning need to manufacture answers because we feel uncomfortable about being steeped in ignorance."" -182. Of course, all scientific hypotheses start as ""arguments from ignorance"" -- you don't know why or how something is happening, so you make an educated guess, then test that guess. That is, I don't agree that we should stop interpreting stimulus immediately if we can't identify it. Unidentified lights in the sky could be lots of things, including an alien spacecraft -- it's just not the most likely hypothesis, and it's not terribly test-able. On the government misunderstanding the metric system, and Tyson's dislike of rhetoric/spin: ""A few years later, jury duty again. The judge states that the defendant is charged with possession of 1,700 milligrams of cocaine. It was found on his body, he was arrested, and he is now on trial. This time, after the Q&A is over, the judge asks us whether there are any questions we'd like to ask the court, and I say, 'Yes, Your Honor. Why did you say he was in possession of 1,700 milligrams of cocaine? That equals 1.7 grams. The 'thousand' cancels with the 'milli-' and you get 1.7 grams, which is less than the weight of a dime.' Again, I'm out on the street."" -204Early on, he dabbles with politics:""[N]obody, especially a Republican, wants to be thought of as someone who sees NASA as a government jobs program, although that comment has been made before--not by a politician, but by a comedian. ... 'NASA is a billion dollar welfare program for really smart dorks. Where else are they going to work? They're too smart to do anything else.'"" -17 (quoting Wanda Sykes)He writes about people who think we'll naturally get to the stars without investment or effort: ""A line of reasoning within the ranks of the hopeful might be: 'We invented flight when most people thought it was impossible. A mere sixty-five years later, we went to the Moon. It's high time we journeyed among the stars. People who say it isn't possible are ignoring history.' My rebuttal is borrowed from a legal disclaimer of the investment industry: 'Past performance is not an indicator of future returns.'"" -191"
15,0393350371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52152494-catalin-negru,4,"Target audience: Common people, anyone passionate about space, astronomy, the Universe and the future of space exploration.About the author: According to Wikipedia, Neil deGrasse Tyson is an American astrophysicist, cosmologist, author, and science communicator. Since 1996, he has been the Frederick P. Rose Director of the Hayden Planetarium at the Rose Center for Earth and Space in New York City. The center is part of the American Museum of Natural History, where Tyson founded the Department of Astrophysics in 1997 and has been a research associate in the department since 2003. Tyson's research has focused on observations in cosmology, stellar evolution, galactic astronomy, bulges, and stellar formation. He has held numerous positions at institutions including the University of Maryland, Princeton University, the American Museum of Natural History, and the Hayden Planetarium.Structure of the book: The book has 384 pages, divided in an Editor’s Note, Prologue, Part I – containing 12 chapters, Part II – containing 15 chapters, Part III – containing 9 chapters, Epilogue, Appendices from A to F, Acknowledgments, Index, Biographical Notes, Praise for Space Chronicles, and Praise for Neil deGrasse Tyson.Overview: Space Chronicles: Facing the Ultimate Frontier is not a book in the real sense of the word; it was not composed as a book. It is a collection of fascinating essays written by Tyson over the years and originally published separately.The primary theme of the book is the importance of space exploration. This is our future as a species, this is our destiny and this is what we must do, as quickly as possible. If we want to avoid a possible extinction, we must follow our multi-millenary dream, reach the stars and become a multi-planetary species. But, in order to achieve this, we must channel our efforts, energy and resources in the right way, both at individual level and collective level.So, the secondary theme of the book is a call for more funding and resources to be allocated for space exploration. But the call is not addressed to the leaders or experts of the developed countries of the world (mainly USA); the call is addressed to the common people, the voters who decide every 4 years the course of their country (and of the world) and the parents who educate and raise the future citizens of the Earth.Each essay presents America's history in space, covering the two themes from different points of view, with different examples and with different arguments. For example, Tyson condemns our indifference for space exploration given the opportunities we have compared to past generations. But he also says that manned space flights will generate enthusiasm among young people, sufficient to encourage them to become scientists and engineers. The world needs much more scientists and engineers, not entertainers. Science is the answer to all our problems, and new generations of scientists, more enlightened and more in number, must rise to lead humanity towards new heights of knowledge and prosperity. Unlike religions or myths, the language of science is universal. Science transcends all barriers and all over the world, no matter the language or cultural background, scientists manage to understand each other and work together for a common goal. Tyson illustrates very well throughout the essays how he traveled around the world and worked together with people from different countries, even USSR.Quote: You need to live in a nation whose government values the search to understand humanity’s place in the universe. You need a society in which intellectual pursuit can take you to the frontiers of discovery, and in which news of your discoveries can be routinely disseminated.Strong points: Space Chronicles: Facing the Ultimate Frontier follows the philosophy of the author. Neil deGrasse Tyson is one of my favorite scientists and I watched many of his public speeches on Youtube. Not only he, despite being one of the great thinkers of our time, manages to make himself understood to the masses, but he also makes complex things look simple and science look fun. His goal is not only to expand knowledge, but also to educate the public and keep them interested in science. And so far he is doing a fantastic job.Weak points: The essays become very repetitive and reading the same ideas over and over again in different forms is a little annoying. There is also no underlying structure to the book. The last third of the book is an appendix containing the legislation that created NASA, which is not interesting at all. I believe that there was no material left to make a book in the real sense of the word and the appendix plus the praises to the author and the book were added only to increase the number of the pages in order to look like a serious book. It is a little disappointing because Tyson’s style is fun._______________★★★ Follow us on Goodreads★★★ Visit our website www.reasonandreligion.org"

HA!). when i finished this read a little bit ago, i began reading some reviews here on GR, to see what people thought. two things jumped out at me:1) complaints about the repetition in the book. there was a bit of it, i agree. but it didn't bother me at all. in fact, when some things were mentioned a 2nd or 3rd time, it only served to help cement an idea in my brain. i am not a dumb-dumb...but NdGT is a super-smart guy and he could easily talk or write in a manner that would only work for people in his same field of work or other really, really smart people. i didn't feel like he dumbed anything down, just to be clear, but i think the repetition was helpful. i like the way he can take very complicated information and make it digestible and interesting!!2) complaints about this being very america-centric and an accusation of 'jingoism'. sigh. i am canadian. we just had a wonderful astronaut in space, in charge of the I.S.S - commander chris hadfield. WOOT! canada, though not a superpower on the space frontier has made some great contributions through technology, invention and its people. the fact we didn't get much notice in the book? WHO CARES? NdGT is american. NASA and the space program are solidly rooted american creations. the work NdGT does is in the efforts of american progress. he has a global understanding and respect for other nations and their space programs, this was obvious. but of course the perspective is going to be american and enthusiastic. NdGT also mentions often the idea that space is non-partisan and the future will be about international cooperation.i made a gushy post within a group i belong to, earlier today, so i am going to copy it here because there was a link i shared that i really liked:okay, so i mentioned i am reading Space Chronicles: Facing the Ultimate Frontier already. i am now about halfway through and i am really digging it. the book is a collection of essays and interviews Neil deGrasse Tyson has given over the years. this morning i sampled a few reviews and the one thing i noticed was that people complained about there being repetition. i did notice this while i was reading, but for me, when the repetition has happened, it only served to reinforce and idea or solidify information into my brain. it doesn't happen a lot (or hasn't to the point i am at, anyway).one of the ides NdGT touches on is the issue of manned space flight versus robots. he clearly states he doesn't see it as an either/or scenario and while the cost to send a person into space is up to 50 times more expensive than sending robotics...you cannot program for certain things. one being the quest to explore. i have loved the essays dealing with this subject.i also like one part where he weighs in on his personal experiences growing up. he was very interested in sciences and space from a young age, but being young and black in brooklyn in the 60s did not cry out ""PATH OF AN ASTROPHYSICIST!!"" to him. he pointed out issues that of course, we know about given what was going on in society at that time. but reading his thoughts and feelings on how the politics of race and segregation affected him...was really moving. (a letter was sent to NASA demanding they recruit black students from alabama and tuskageee into their programs, and bringing them onto staff, as one example.)so i was really interested when i came across this piece on brain pickings about how to be an explorer."
17,0393350371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5492198-annmarie,5,"Space Chronicles is not a tough read like A Brief History of Time, nor is it an amazing look at how science will improve our lives like Micho Kaku's Physics of the Future. It's a collection of brief passages, most reprinted material from Neil deGrasse Tyson's many newspaper columns, interviews, and even some of his more poignant tweets. This makes for an incredibly easy read, and one that I was almost finished with in only a few hours' time.And the more I read, the more I came to realize who this book was meant for: those busy, busy politicians who think that astrophysics, the science that connects us all to the universe, doesn't matter that much; in fact, it's worth less than half of one cent (the amount of money per taxpayer dollar that currently goes to NASA.) This book is a cry for help. With the funding to NASA cut, space exploration is being touted off to the private sector. Let Google run space, Congress tells us. In a barrage of quick, poignant passages, Neil deGrasse Tyson lays out the many good reasons why that's a really bad idea.I'm the first to tell you that I can get really, really touchy about politics. If someone would've told me that, yo, this book is just sort-of about politics, I wouldn't have touched it with a ten-foot pole. But the author is amazingly nonpartisan throughout, blaming no one, but instead passionately pushing for a restoration of the ol' American can-do attitude that started NASA in the first place. Of course, America has overarching problems amid NASA's budget crisis that were very much glossed over in this book. By the time I was done reading, however, I wondered why the heck it all matters so much. All our petty Earthling problems seem trifling when you remember that our planet is only a mote of dust in the vast expanse of space."
18,0393350371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7645507-jason-schneeberger,5,"Neil deGrasse Tyson has become one of my favorite people walking planet earth. His passion, intellect, knowledge, charisma and way with words is truly infectious!SPACE CHRONICLES is a collection of essays and magazine articles that Dr.Tyson has written over the years, where he lays out his arguments for the importance of space exploration. It's about more than visiting the moon, potentially visiting Mars etc.. Many of our greatest inventions and things we take for granted in our everyday life, comes from experiments and studies done for, or because of, the cosmos. I had no idea all of the inventions that came about from space exploration until I read this book!I have taken a huge interest in the cosmos, the origins of life etc. recently and this book has to be up there with the best I have read. If you have ever heard Neil talk, I think you can agree that his way with words and storytelling sucks you right into whatever subject he is discussing and that very tactic is present in this book. He very easily explains to you very hard subject matter for the lay person to understand and does it with such wit and charm that there is no way that you can't just love the guy! Space is the ultimate frontier for man; there are countless discoveries and journeys just waiting for us to grasp and we must not let the dream of space exploration become a thing of the past! Read this book!!!"
19,0393350371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4759747-ron,4,"I am a huge fan of NDT. I absolutely agree with basically everything I've heard him say on space and NASA. So I pretty much had to read this book just on general principle and in support of what he's doing. That being said, I felt a little disappointed emotionally when reading this. I guess my expectations were too high. I would have devoured this as a teen, before starting at NASA. It is definitely geared toward the layman. Which is really as it should be. At the same time I didn't enjoy reading a rehash of basic physics and astronomy, and it gets repetitive at times. All that being said, I think the content and overall message is fantastic. I found myself enjoying the very beginning and the final 3rd more than the other sections. (The book is organized into 3 parts: 1. How; 2. Why; 3. Why Not; and is largely a collection of NDT's previous writings and speeches regarding space). I would whole-heartedly recommend this to those who have an interest in space but don't live it on a daily basis. For those who are well versed in NASA and astrophysics, I would recommend it with reservations. "
20,0393350371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5999881-geoff,3,"This book tackles why space exploration is necessary now more than ever and the hurdles/triumphs of the ultimate frontier. The way Neil Degrasse Tyson writes is very readable to me. He has the ability to make some complicated subjects much more simple - which makes sense since he frequently calls himself an educator above all else.The 'problem' with this book is that he constantly repeats himself throughout the book. I get it Neil, the space race was a byproduct of the Cold War. But I think the main reason for this religion is because the book is really made up of articles he had published in various magazines or transcripts of TV interviews or transcripts of speeches. There's only so many different ways to get across the same point. There is also a lot of lament of the current state of the space program but this book is a few years old so a lot of the great things happening today are completely absent.The last 80 or so pages are appendices which cover things from funding data for different countries space programs and the complete NASA creation act from 1958. So this ends up being a very quick read."
21,0393350371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2209582-ross,2,Big stretch to give this 2 stars. I bought the book as I thought it would be about astronomy and astrophysics. It is not.The book is a collection of essays and interviews with huge amounts of material repeated over and over. The primary subjects are NASA and the author's interest in manned space flight.I was especially annoyed at the author's extreme exaggerations about consumer and health products we enjoy today that he asserts came from NASA research.His main interest is promoting manned space flight because he feels it gets inner city kids to try harder in school. I would prefer that the money not be spent on manned space flight and instead be spent directly on improving inner city schools.

23,0393350371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/635936-jeremy,5,"the great neil degrasse tyson, astrophysicist, director of the hayden planetarium, pbs/nova host, and ambassador to all sorts of interstellar and cosmic awesomeness, is also the author of nearly a dozen books. his newest, space chronicles: facing the ultimate frontier, is a collection of three dozen articles, speeches, and interviews (and even a poem!) previously published or delivered in public. divided into three main parts (""why,"" ""how,"" and ""why not""), space chronicles delves into a wide variety of topics and subtopics related to space exploration, the space program, and the science advanced by the two.tyson, with the trademark wit and humor that has made him so beloved, expounds upon the importance of reinvigorating our national space program and advocates for increasing nasa's budget (from it's current and paltry halfpence on the tax dollar). he seeks these goals, not merely for the sake of exploration and discovery (important pursuits be they may), but instead to (re)foster a culture that shares a common dream of the future; one that inevitably results in new technologies, greater understanding, and an overall amelioration of the human species. tyson decries the decline of scientific literacy so prevalent in today's american society and contrasts it with other countries, whose own space programs are growing ever more focused and robust (there are now more scientifically literate citizens in china than there are college graduates in the united states).
when you visit other countries that don't nurture these kinds of ambitions, you can feel the absence of hope. owing to all manner of politics, economics, and geography, people are reduced to worrying only about that day's shelter or the next day's meal. it's a shame, even a tragedy, how many people do not get to think about the future. technology coupled with wise leadership not only solves these problems but enables dreams of tomorrow.
space chronicles is accessible and digestible to anyone curious about recent astronomical developments, as tyson is adept at distilling the essence of even the most complex of subjects. this collection is rather light on the science (for those unnecessarily deterred by the often challenging nature of headier works), and instead finds tyson serving in his more familiar role of educator and diplomat to the stars. while there is some repetition to be found within these essays, articles, and speeches (as they were delivered to a range of audiences), it in no way detracts from the nature of tyson's message, and, in fact, only serves to reinforce the important points he attempts to convey. space chronicles also features eight fascinating appendices, six of which focus on the meager tax dollars apportioned to nasa each fiscal year (as percentage of gdp, as percentage of total government spending, in comparison to other nations, etc.) and two that offer the full texts of the nasa's policies as enacted by law (national aeronautics and space act of 1958 & selected statutory provisions applicable to nasa).neil degrasse tyson (host of the soon to be released sequel to carl sagan's epic miniseries cosmos) is a national galactic treasure. with infectious enthusiasm, reason, and humility, tyson is the epitome of the sort of teacher that every student deserves to have at the front of his or her science classroom. space chronicles, at the very least, will likely renew or strengthen the allure and enchantment of space exploration for its readers, and, perhaps, may just compel one to speak out as an advocate for bolstering the nasa budget, in the hopes of recommitting ourselves, as a nation, to the promise and wonder of the as yet uncharted frontiers overhead. 
during our brief stay on planet earth, we ourselves and our descendants the opportunity to explore- in part because it's fun to do. but there's a far nobler reason. the day our knowledge of the cosmos ceases to expand, we risk regressing to the childish view that universe figuratively and literally revolves around us. in that bleak world, arms-bearing, resource-hungry people and nations would be prone to act on their ""low contracted prejudices."" and that would be the last gasp of human enlightenment- until the rise of a visionary new culture that could once again embrace the cosmic perspective.
"
24,0393350371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2716255-andrew-breslin,2,"Let me state at the outset that Dr. Tyson is one of my favorite Neils of all time, second only to Neil Young, but coming in well ahead of Neils Sedaka, Diamond and “from the Young Ones.” My regular enjoyment of his podcast Star Talk will be in no way diminished by my disappointment in this book, because this isn’t actually a book.It looks like a book. It’s got a a bunch of pages between a pair of covers and it has an ISBN number and everything, so legally speaking, it probably IS a book. But it’s not a book in the sense that he developed a series of accreting concepts over the course of 200 pages to express a complex idea or set of ideas that those 200 pages all built toward. No, it’s a collection of essays and articles written for a variety of publications. Each one of those essays and articles is self-contained and does not build and expand upon the ideas expressed in the earlier chapters. And, much like me when I’ve been drinking or writing book reviews, they mostly just say the same thing over and over.And what he says over and over is kind of dull and, like most dull things, gets even duller upon repetition. Because this is not a book about science. It’s primarily about public policy and science funding, which is orders of magnitude less interesting than science. This is not akin to A Brief History of Time or Tyson’s own Cosmos reboot (or Carl Sagan’s original) in which a brilliant astrophysicist explains the fascinating details of how the universe works in terms that us regular folks can understand, even if we can’t do the math. It’s a little closer to sitting through a Congressional budget meeting. Tyson mostly makes a plea for increased funding of space exploration, specifically manned (or womanned) space missions, and particularly especially specifically, a mission to Mars. He also occasionally makes the case that we ought to invest in defending ourselves from meteors, because he knows a lot of people don’t give a lab rat’s ass about Mars and space but most of us would prefer to avoid a fiery armageddon at the hands of an errant comet.But while the potential consequences of a meteor strike are devastating, the probability of a really big one occurring any time in the next 1000 years are very very close to 0%. On the other hand, threats such as climate change and antibiotic resistant bacteria have just as much potential to end or severely disrupt human civilization, but, in contrast, have a nearly 100% chance of doing so some time in the next 1000 years if we do nothing to alter the course we are on. That’s not to say that we are necessarily doomed. I have some faith in human ingenuity. But they are effectively giant metaphoric meteors heading right for us, that we have already identified as being on a collision course. The clock is already ticking. This is not a drill. But Tyson would prefer to focus on hypothetical (but not metaphoric) meteors that are very unlikely to threaten us any time soon. There’s a reason he wants to focus on meteor detection and missions to Mars: He’s an astrophysicist. That’s precisely where his expertise lies. Addressing climate change doesn’t involve his particular brand of know-how. It requires brilliant economists and public policy experts, and the daunting, unsexy task of modifying the collective behavior of the human species. Implementing an internationally accepted carbon tax isn’t as exciting as building a humongous space laser to obliterate incoming giant rocks. When you are holding a hammer, every problem looks like a nail. When you are holding advanced degrees in astrophysics, the problems addressed by doing something with rockets are more obvious than the ones addressed by behavioral economics. If you haven’t done so already, you should immediately check out Star Talk. When Dr. Neil is talking about science and not science policy, it’s always a fascinating trip. Sit back and enjoy the ride."
25,0393350371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/101006348-ansove,5,The book is very awesome.
26,0393350371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78611-nitya-iyer,5,"Is there anything sexier in the world than an intelligent man who talks passionately about his work in a way that makes your feel more intelligent just for listening? If there is, please don't tell me, so I can continue to wallow in the wonder that is Neil deGrasse Tyson and his latest book, Space Chronicles: Facing the Ultimate Frontier. To be honest, not much of what Mr. Tyson bases his arguments on is news to me. After all, I consider myself to be very much part of the choir he sees himself preaching to, a liberal pacifist with a strong desire to see more focus and money spent on education and technology. Although I chose not to go to university to study engineering, I do believe strongly in the NASA and the work and research they do. And although I do believe that my tax money should be spent making life better on earth, like Mr. Tyson, I don't believe that precludes spending money on science! So as I began reading the book, I was not looking to be convinced that America needs to spend more money on exploring space. However, I WAS amazed when I realized how LITTLE is currently spent on research and technology towards space exploration and why that translates into some real problems down here on Earth.Perhaps if I had spread out my reading of Space over more time, I wouldn't have been so struck by how much he repeats himself. After all, this book is a collection of thoughts that he spread out over different articles, columns and speeches over a stretch of time. But once you get past what seems like him harping on and on about certain issues, his writing is so clear and concise that I found myself wanting to write down snippets to repeat in conversations when I need to convince others on the urgency of turning our eyes and hearts to returning to space. When you see your tax dollar broken down to less than half a penny for NASA, you have to wonder will that really be enough to make Star Trek a reality? And when you are able to make fun of the brick-like cellphones from the last decade, why are you still amazed by rockets from the 60s?Do yourself a favor. Read this book. And take notes!"
27,0393350371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6164554-nabila,3,"This is actually a collection of essays and interviews (and an ode). The essays were adapted from previous ones that were published somewhere else. That's probably why the book is a bit repetitive. While not necessarily a bad thing, it does get tiresome.Many of the things he said were not new or surprising. For example, the US started their own space program because the Soviets did it first. Who would have thought. And, apart from the moon landing, the Soviets were ahead of the Americans: first satellite, first man in space, first woman in space, first animal in space, etc. FYI, a dog, a guinea pig, and a mouse went to space before humans did.Another unsurprising point is that research will easily be funded if it (1) can make you rich, (2) can make you win the war, and/or (3) can make you be powerful. Other than that, expect your research proposal to be rejected because ""it's not applicable, and there's no money for that"". I wish I had known it sooner.NDT also talked a lot about how interests in STEM have been declining, at least in the US. China has more scientifically literate people than the US has college graduates. China has about half a million science/engineering graduates every year, while the US has seventy thousand. Well, at least, the US graduates half a million lawyers a year, so when infrastructure starts to crumble, they're fully prepared to litigate.NDT made an interesting point about old technology. We often laugh at big, old phones from the nineties. Or flip phones. Or basically any old gadgets. That means we've moved on. We have better phones, better gadgets. So how come we're still amazed when we see Saturn V (I know I am)? It was built in the sixties. Shouldn't we have moved on since then, built a better rocket? Yes, we should have. But, moved on or not, I know I'll be still amazed by Saturn V. How can you not be? It's majestic.And lastly, scientific illiteracy should not be celebrated. It's not something to be proud of. It's not something to be laughed at. Like NDT said, it's not the meek who will inherit the Earth; it's the geek."
28,0393350371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2222949-ken-bronsil,4,"I have heard Neil DeGrasse Tyson on various television shows and have been amazed at his energy, vitality, and imagination. It all comes through in this book, which is a collection of both his written work and his verbal presentations, interviews, and speeches. That means you read some ideas or expressions, or even stories, more than once. I didn't find that a problem because it's helpful to hear them again. There are a few chapters involving some advanced physics concepts; there are many other chapters--some humorous, some poetic, but all of them worthwhile.America's interest in exploring space grew out of a defense / military need brought on by the USSR's successful launch of, first, an artificial satellite, then of inhabited (by animals, then by humans) space capsules. Two nuclear powers, one with a space program and one without one. Eventually, the Cold War and even the USSR disappeared, so the military need for conquering space or establishing a base on the moon died down. So space exploration was redefined and, because there was no more crisis or big threat, de-emphasized. At rock bottom, this book is a impassioned call to renew the sport of exploring, innovating, and ""reaching for the stars"" that characterized the NASA missions leading up to landing on the moon. He laments the disappearance of America's spirit of daring and its technological inventiveness which made those missions so successful. He laments that America's people and its leaders are ignorant of the many advances in our daily life that came about because of space exploration (kidney dialysis machines, implantable pacemakers, GPS, LASIK surgery, collision-avoidance systems, hydroponics, etc.). I'm with him all the way.Other highlights:* Points of Lagrange: never heard of them before, but they're very, very useful in exploring space.* A great tribute to Star Trek.* An equally great critique of ""fuzzy thinking."""
29,0393350371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44540664-angela,3,"I started reading this right after having seen a live performance given by Neil DeGrasse Tyson on the ties between astrophysics and beloved movies and television shows. I laughed, I cried, and I loved it. And I really wanted to love Space Chronicles. However, I just didn't.Don't get me wrong - I love Neil, and I love learning about space and astrophysics and NASA. And this book had All Of Those Things. It just read to me as a book in which Neil was trying to make a buck. The book didn't read as a coherent piece. Instead, there were Neil's tweets thrown in among randomly organized stories about the inception of NASA, interviews Neil had given on television programs, where Neil thinks the future of space exploration is headed, and the like. Near the finale of the book, Neil talks about the idiocracy of our nation today. I had a bit of a sad aha moment at this point where I wondered if he assumed the audience of this very book would be that idiocratic sector. Is that why he scattered the same facts over and over throughout its pages? The first time he wrote that NASA's budget is only half of a penny of every US dollar, I was enlightened. I didn't know that before! But the second time he wrote it... well, I remembered it from the first time. By the third and fourth mention of the statistic, I was starting to think I was reading a book geared for a troglodyte. And no, Neil, I didn't have to look that word up to know what it means.But, like I said, I love Neil. I learned more about the Apollo missions, the Hubbel telescope, Saturn V, how the US stacks up against other countries in the race to space, and all kinds of fun tidbits like how space exploration lead to the invention of Tang. I just wish those learnings were written in a more organized and concise fashion.Oh!

31,0393350371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5882124-kevin-cecil,3,"A few years ago on Real Time with Bill Mahr, Ashton Kutcher asked why we waste money on NASA. His point was there there are so many problems down here on Earth that shooting money at the stars just seems wasteful. Someone needs to give Mr. Kutcher this book. In SPACE CHRONICLES Neil deGrasse Tyson explains the applicable scientific achievements brought to us through space exploration (including a Hubble inspired breast cancer detector), while also detailing the numerous cosmic queries answered over the last century. He also takes a look back at what we accomplished in space travel, then turns a somber eye on where we are vs. where we could be. Tyson points out NASA currently costs us just about half a penny for every tax dollar, and longs for a new space race that would up that to the levels enjoyed in the '60s - only this time fueled by the desire for discovery, rather than annihilation. SPACE CHRONICLES is consistently fascinating, but this collection of essays, speeches, and articles concerning space travel does turn a bit redundant after a few chapeters. The second time you anticipate a punch line it feels like learning; the fourth or fifth time it just feels repetitive. Also, this may be the first non teen lit book to contain a chapter comprised solely of tweets. Perhaps my problem is really that I'm already a convert. The message of Tyson's hammer has long been nailed into my skull. Perhaps Space Chronicles is not really intended for believers like me, but for the Ashton Kutchers out there. In which case...hammer away Dr. Tyson. "
32,0393350371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47054186-seth-hanson,5,"Space Chronicles: Facing the Ultimate Frontier is a thought provoking book by a leading astronomer making a case as to why space travel is so important to us, both as a nation, scientifically, economically, and diplomatically, and as individuals, inspiring us, pushing us, and giving us new opportunities. Along the way, the author gives us a front row seat to the history of NASA and America in space, and shares his own insights on the matter of space travel and space in general. The book is, in essence, an argument to keep us in space, touching on all the reasons, in all aspects. Why we as a nation must stick in the race to stay on top, and why we as a race must continue to explore.I like this book because not only because it is a passionate defense of investing in space, but also because it is full of factual information and is very well written. The author, Neil deGrasse Tyson, is very good at making difficult concepts easy to understand without compromising the facts or their interesting qualities.Finally, I liked how the book was filled with completely unrelated facts about space and the space program. Even though they don't really have anything to do with what the book is talking about, they are still very interesting.There really wasn't anything at all that I didn't like about the book, but if I had to pick something, it would be that the pacing seemed somewhat forced at times.I would recomend this book to anyone interested in space.

I guess it takes a Cold War to excite people about the space program these days, but I don't fully believe that. People are still a little awed by space and that gives me hope. If that doesn't do it, perhaps the asteroid barreling down on us threatening to take out all the pacific islands and California will. Now onto this book...I really like Tyson's style. He's humorous, he makes science very accessible to dummies like me, and I enjoy his geeky sense of humor. His passion for the cosmos is infectious. Since this is a collection of essays that may have appeared elsewhere there is A LOT of repetition here. After a short while it started to read only like a solicitation for NASA funding. There was just not enough cool space stuff, but I like Tyson's style so much I'm inspired to read his other books.

One I hate to concede is that people will not be excited enough by unmanned explorations to fund them consistently, even though it's dangerous (almost absurd) to put human beings in an environment that our 4.5 billion-year evolution has not prepared us for at all. They (no, not we) won't support manned ones, either, except in the belief/illusion that they are in a deadly competition with a rival. I hope he's right that we can be embarrassed or scared enough by noticing that the fastest trains in the world are built and used elsewhere while we can't even keep our highways functioning that we'll get back into research and development as we did in the '60s and then quit.

If not for these two then we regress by stagnating as happened ever since the Apollo programs stopped.

91,0393350371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5882124-kevin-cecil,3,"A few years ago on Real Time with Bill Mahr, Ashton Kutcher asked why we waste money on NASA. His point was there there are so many problems down here on Earth that shooting money at the stars just seems wasteful. Someone needs to give Mr. Kutcher this book. In SPACE CHRONICLES Neil deGrasse Tyson explains the applicable scientific achievements brought to us through space exploration (including a Hubble inspired breast cancer detector), while also detailing the numerous cosmic queries answered over the last century. He also takes a look back at what we accomplished in space travel, then turns a somber eye on where we are vs. where we could be. Tyson points out NASA currently costs us just about half a penny for every tax dollar, and longs for a new space race that would up that to the levels enjoyed in the '60s - only this time fueled by the desire for discovery, rather than annihilation. SPACE CHRONICLES is consistently fascinating, but this collection of essays, speeches, and articles concerning space travel does turn a bit redundant after a few chapeters. The second time you anticipate a punch line it feels like learning; the fourth or fifth time it just feels repetitive. Also, this may be the first non teen lit book to contain a chapter comprised solely of tweets. Perhaps my problem is really that I'm already a convert. The message of Tyson's hammer has long been nailed into my skull. Perhaps Space Chronicles is not really intended for believers like me, but for the Ashton Kutchers out there. In which case...hammer away Dr. Tyson. "
92,0393350371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47054186-seth-hanson,5,"Space Chronicles: Facing the Ultimate Frontier is a thought provoking book by a leading astronomer making a case as to why space travel is so important to us, both as a nation, scientifically, economically, and diplomatically, and as individuals, inspiring us, pushing us, and giving us new opportunities. Along the way, the author gives us a front row seat to the history of NASA and America in space, and shares his own insights on the matter of space travel and space in general. The book is, in essence, an argument to keep us in space, touching on all the reasons, in all aspects. Why we as a nation must stick in the race to stay on top, and why we as a race must continue to explore.I like this book because not only because it is a passionate defense of investing in space, but also because it is full of factual information and is very well written. The author, Neil deGrasse Tyson, is very good at making difficult concepts easy to understand without compromising the facts or their interesting qualities.Finally, I liked how the book was filled with completely unrelated facts about space and the space program. Even though they don't really have anything to do with what the book is talking about, they are still very interesting.There really wasn't anything at all that I didn't like about the book, but if I had to pick something, it would be that the pacing seemed somewhat forced at times.I would recomend this book to anyone interested in space.

I guess it takes a Cold War to excite people about the space program these days, but I don't fully believe that. People are still a little awed by space and that gives me hope. If that doesn't do it, perhaps the asteroid barreling down on us threatening to take out all the pacific islands and California will. Now onto this book...I really like Tyson's style. He's humorous, he makes science very accessible to dummies like me, and I enjoy his geeky sense of humor. His passion for the cosmos is infectious. Since this is a collection of essays that may have appeared elsewhere there is A LOT of repetition here. After a short while it started to read only like a solicitation for NASA funding. There was just not enough cool space stuff, but I like Tyson's style so much I'm inspired to read his other books.

One I hate to concede is that people will not be excited enough by unmanned explorations to fund them consistently, even though it's dangerous (almost absurd) to put human beings in an environment that our 4.5 billion-year evolution has not prepared us for at all. They (no, not we) won't support manned ones, either, except in the belief/illusion that they are in a deadly competition with a rival. I hope he's right that we can be embarrassed or scared enough by noticing that the fastest trains in the world are built and used elsewhere while we can't even keep our highways functioning that we'll get back into research and development as we did in the '60s and then quit.

He also has an engaging writing style, a great sense of humor, and well-honed arguments worth considering. So I strongly recommend reading this collection of essays and interviews.

But I did feel pretty bad when Tyson talked about how the children of the '60s, inspired by the moon race, became scientists and engineers, and the children of the '80s became useless professions like lawyers and investment bankers - and that's why we are falling behind China and other countries in technological innovation (he calls the Saturn V rocket the pinnacle of human engineering; the fastest vehicle ever created and it was designed over 50 years ago).All that said, I'd recommend it - space exploration is too important to ignore and NASA's budget is a fraction of what you think it is."

 from Tyson. It gets repetitive very fast, unfortunately, and is more focused on space advocacy, in the form illustratory histories of the space race, earnest all-American entreaties about soliloquies about destiny and exploration, half-formed economic points and entreaties to please study maths more, kids. All of which is fair enough, but not strictly terrible interesting. Here and there are occasional bits on science or various things that have been or will be sent into space and how they work or don't work, and that's pretty cool. More of that, please. "

The book is a collection of previously written op-eds, speeches, and essays about space travel, the space program, and the universe, and all have that well-known Tyson charm to them, at that.Tyson is probably our best scientific popularist out there currently, and this book is a great example of it. I'm not sure if he'll catch a lot of new eyes with it, but it's still a great primer, and one of those starting points for those who want to be amazed by the cosmos and amazed by someone who knows how to make it appropriately amazing."

There were parts of this book I read multiple times, just because they were so interesting! Tyson is not only passionate about the subject matter but brings some very fresh and humorous arguments to the table. This was an invaluable resource for me and I'm glad I read it. Although I don't agree with every little thing he said (I have different views on some of the biological and evolutionary standpoints) this was really great read that I learned a lot from! "
100,0393350371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,3,This isn't the most exciting book by Tyson. It dryly covers the history of space flight. The author expresses his dire hope that NASA will get the funding it needs to continue manned exploration. It's actually kind of a downer to read about the excitement leading up to the Apollo program and contrast this with the paucity of manned exploration into space since. Tyson is one of those guys who's really hard on the ISS. I can't quite tell if this is his sacred cow or if the ISS really is a waste of time. Whatever the case he makes a poor argument against it.

(Spoiler: half a penny). This fact gets repeated over and over, and not in new ways. That's about how it goes.I listened to the Audible version, and the Narrator was horrible.

DeGrasse Tyson proves a point in this collection of articles: astronomy and astrophysics are under-funded and have been for the majority of their history.I found interesting the point made by the author according to which sciences of the cosmos only achieve significant funding and support in two cases: war (cold or hot) and economic benefits. If not for these two then we regress by stagnating as happened ever since the Apollo programs stopped.
104,0393350371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9616369-jim,4,"Entertaining and thought provoking. I enjoyed the segments of his essays where he reviewed the history of our space program.

He also has an engaging writing style, a great sense of humor, and well-honed arguments worth considering. So I strongly recommend reading this collection of essays and interviews. On the lighter side, here is a blog piece I did that involves my copy of Dr. Tyson's book and, well...a cat. A Facebook Approach to Space Advocacy "

But I did feel pretty bad when Tyson talked about how the children of the '60s, inspired by the moon race, became scientists and engineers, and the children of the '80s became useless professions like lawyers and investment bankers - and that's why we are falling behind China and other countries in technological innovation (he calls the Saturn V rocket the pinnacle of human engineering; the fastest vehicle ever created and it was designed over 50 years ago).All that said, I'd recommend it - space exploration is too important to ignore and NASA's budget is a fraction of what you think it is."

tweets
 from Tyson. It gets repetitive very fast, unfortunately, and is more focused on space advocacy, in the form illustratory histories of the space race, earnest all-American entreaties about soliloquies about destiny and exploration, half-formed economic points and entreaties to please study maths more, kids. All of which is fair enough, but not strictly terrible interesting. Here and there are occasional bits on science or various things that have been or will be sent into space and how they work or don't work, and that's pretty cool. More of that, please. "

The book is a collection of previously written op-eds, speeches, and essays about space travel, the space program, and the universe, and all have that well-known Tyson charm to them, at that.Tyson is probably our best scientific popularist out there currently, and this book is a great example of it. I'm not sure if he'll catch a lot of new eyes with it, but it's still a great primer, and one of those starting points for those who want to be amazed by the cosmos and amazed by someone who knows how to make it appropriately amazing."

There were parts of this book I read multiple times, just because they were so interesting! Tyson is not only passionate about the subject matter but brings some very fresh and humorous arguments to the table. This was an invaluable resource for me and I'm glad I read it. Although I don't agree with every little thing he said (I have different views on some of the biological and evolutionary standpoints) this was really great read that I learned a lot from! "
130,0393350371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,3,This isn't the most exciting book by Tyson. It dryly covers the history of space flight. The author expresses his dire hope that NASA will get the funding it needs to continue manned exploration. It's actually kind of a downer to read about the excitement leading up to the Apollo program and contrast this with the paucity of manned exploration into space since. Tyson is one of those guys who's really hard on the ISS. I can't quite tell if this is his sacred cow or if the ISS really is a waste of time. Whatever the case he makes a poor argument against it.

(Spoiler: half a penny). This fact gets repeated over and over, and not in new ways. That's about how it goes.I listened to the Audible version, and the Narrator was horrible.

DeGrasse Tyson proves a point in this collection of articles: astronomy and astrophysics are under-funded and have been for the majority of their history.I found interesting the point made by the author according to which sciences of the cosmos only achieve significant funding and support in two cases: war (cold or hot) and economic benefits. If not for these two then we regress by stagnating as happened ever since the Apollo programs stopped.
134,0393350371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9616369-jim,4,"Entertaining and thought provoking. I enjoyed the segments of his essays where he reviewed the history of our space program. Tyson does tend to overstate his belief (although I agree) that we should increase funding for NASA and space exploration. I also share his concern with the United States becoming an ""idiocracy"" through our declining interest in science and math education. I like NDT, he is a very intelligent man who can also communicate to the layperson in a conversational style."

I loved it for the purpose of trying to motivate and inspire a nation to achieve greatness through the vision of space exploration.

Some parts of this was recycled in 'Astrophysics for people in a hurry' too. Maybe not the best format for people wanting to learn facts and explore science. On the other hand, Dr. Tyson has a knack for images (making the mind understand how large a number is) and his passion and arguments for the exploration of space couldn't possibly be missed, they'd been repeated over and over. :P"

150,0393350371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38830963-emily-streetman,2,"A collection of Tyson's speeches and writings over a short period, this book is near unreadable due to extreme repetative redundancy (see what I did there?). If you want more Neil de Grasse Tyson in your life, for heaven's sake, hie thee to YouTube - do not read this book."
151,0393350371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5882124-kevin-cecil,3,"A few years ago on Real Time with Bill Mahr, Ashton Kutcher asked why we waste money on NASA. His point was there there are so many problems down here on Earth that shooting money at the stars just seems wasteful. Someone needs to give Mr. Kutcher this book. In SPACE CHRONICLES Neil deGrasse Tyson explains the applicable scientific achievements brought to us through space exploration (including a Hubble inspired breast cancer detector), while also detailing the numerous cosmic queries answered over the last century. He also takes a look back at what we accomplished in space travel, then turns a somber eye on where we are vs. where we could be. Tyson points out NASA currently costs us just about half a penny for every tax dollar, and longs for a new space race that would up that to the levels enjoyed in the '60s - only this time fueled by the desire for discovery, rather than annihilation. SPACE CHRONICLES is consistently fascinating, but this collection of essays, speeches, and articles concerning space travel does turn a bit redundant after a few chapeters. The second time you anticipate a punch line it feels like learning; the fourth or fifth time it just feels repetitive. Also, this may be the first non teen lit book to contain a chapter comprised solely of tweets. Perhaps my problem is really that I'm already a convert. The message of Tyson's hammer has long been nailed into my skull. Perhaps Space Chronicles is not really intended for believers like me, but for the Ashton Kutchers out there. In which case...hammer away Dr. Tyson. "
152,0393350371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47054186-seth-hanson,5,"Space Chronicles: Facing the Ultimate Frontier is a thought provoking book by a leading astronomer making a case as to why space travel is so important to us, both as a nation, scientifically, economically, and diplomatically, and as individuals, inspiring us, pushing us, and giving us new opportunities. Along the way, the author gives us a front row seat to the history of NASA and America in space, and shares his own insights on the matter of space travel and space in general. The book is, in essence, an argument to keep us in space, touching on all the reasons, in all aspects. Why we as a nation must stick in the race to stay on top, and why we as a race must continue to explore.I like this book because not only because it is a passionate defense of investing in space, but also because it is full of factual information and is very well written. The author, Neil deGrasse Tyson, is very good at making difficult concepts easy to understand without compromising the facts or their interesting qualities.Finally, I liked how the book was filled with completely unrelated facts about space and the space program. Even though they don't really have anything to do with what the book is talking about, they are still very interesting.There really wasn't anything at all that I didn't like about the book, but if I had to pick something, it would be that the pacing seemed somewhat forced at times.I would recomend this book to anyone interested in space. NOT FINISHED"
153,0393350371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3371659-snem,3,"I get so excited about space it really thrills me. I want to see a human being land on Mars in my lifetime. I guess it takes a Cold War to excite people about the space program these days, but I don't fully believe that. People are still a little awed by space and that gives me hope. If that doesn't do it, perhaps the asteroid barreling down on us threatening to take out all the pacific islands and California will. Now onto this book...I really like Tyson's style. He's humorous, he makes science very accessible to dummies like me, and I enjoy his geeky sense of humor. His passion for the cosmos is infectious. Since this is a collection of essays that may have appeared elsewhere there is A LOT of repetition here. After a short while it started to read only like a solicitation for NASA funding. There was just not enough cool space stuff, but I like Tyson's style so much I'm inspired to read his other books. I don't recommend this if it's your first time reading Neil deGrasse Tyson, but do read if you're a big fan of his."

It's intelligent, funny, and energetic, but it isn't Cosmos. Expect some repetition of ideas. One I hate to concede is that people will not be excited enough by unmanned explorations to fund them consistently, even though it's dangerous (almost absurd) to put human beings in an environment that our 4.5 billion-year evolution has not prepared us for at all. They (no, not we) won't support manned ones, either, except in the belief/illusion that they are in a deadly competition with a rival. I hope he's right that we can be embarrassed or scared enough by noticing that the fastest trains in the world are built and used elsewhere while we can't even keep our highways functioning that we'll get back into research and development as we did in the '60s and then quit.

Some parts of this was recycled in 'Astrophysics for people in a hurry' too. Maybe not the best format for people wanting to learn facts and explore science. On the other hand, Dr. Tyson has a knack for images (making the mind understand how large a number is) and his passion and arguments for the exploration of space couldn't possibly be missed, they'd been repeated over and over. :P"

181,0393350371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5882124-kevin-cecil,3,"A few years ago on Real Time with Bill Mahr, Ashton Kutcher asked why we waste money on NASA. His point was there there are so many problems down here on Earth that shooting money at the stars just seems wasteful. Someone needs to give Mr. Kutcher this book. In SPACE CHRONICLES Neil deGrasse Tyson explains the applicable scientific achievements brought to us through space exploration (including a Hubble inspired breast cancer detector), while also detailing the numerous cosmic queries answered over the last century. He also takes a look back at what we accomplished in space travel, then turns a somber eye on where we are vs. where we could be. Tyson points out NASA currently costs us just about half a penny for every tax dollar, and longs for a new space race that would up that to the levels enjoyed in the '60s - only this time fueled by the desire for discovery, rather than annihilation. SPACE CHRONICLES is consistently fascinating, but this collection of essays, speeches, and articles concerning space travel does turn a bit redundant after a few chapeters. The second time you anticipate a punch line it feels like learning; the fourth or fifth time it just feels repetitive. Also, this may be the first non teen lit book to contain a chapter comprised solely of tweets. Perhaps my problem is really that I'm already a convert. The message of Tyson's hammer has long been nailed into my skull. Perhaps Space Chronicles is not really intended for believers like me, but for the Ashton Kutchers out there. In which case...hammer away Dr. Tyson. "
182,0393350371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47054186-seth-hanson,5,"Space Chronicles: Facing the Ultimate Frontier is a thought provoking book by a leading astronomer making a case as to why space travel is so important to us, both as a nation, scientifically, economically, and diplomatically, and as individuals, inspiring us, pushing us, and giving us new opportunities. Along the way, the author gives us a front row seat to the history of NASA and America in space, and shares his own insights on the matter of space travel and space in general. The book is, in essence, an argument to keep us in space, touching on all the reasons, in all aspects. Why we as a nation must stick in the race to stay on top, and why we as a race must continue to explore.I like this book because not only because it is a passionate defense of investing in space, but also because it is full of factual information and is very well written. The author, Neil deGrasse Tyson, is very good at making difficult concepts easy to understand without compromising the facts or their interesting qualities.Finally, I liked how the book was filled with completely unrelated facts about space and the space program. Even though they don't really have anything to do with what the book is talking about, they are still very interesting.There really wasn't anything at all that I didn't like about the book, but if I had to pick something, it would be that the pacing seemed somewhat forced at times.I would recomend this book to anyone interested in space.

I guess it takes a Cold War to excite people about the space program these days, but I don't fully believe that. People are still a little awed by space and that gives me hope. If that doesn't do it, perhaps the asteroid barreling down on us threatening to take out all the pacific islands and California will. Now onto this book...I really like Tyson's style. He's humorous, he makes science very accessible to dummies like me, and I enjoy his geeky sense of humor. His passion for the cosmos is infectious. Since this is a collection of essays that may have appeared elsewhere there is A LOT of repetition here. After a short while it started to read only like a solicitation for NASA funding. There was just not enough cool space stuff, but I like Tyson's style so much I'm inspired to read his other books.

It's intelligent, funny, and energetic, but it isn't Cosmos. Expect some repetition of ideas. One I hate to concede is that people will not be excited enough by unmanned explorations to fund them consistently, even though it's dangerous (almost absurd) to put human beings in an environment that our 4.5 billion-year evolution has not prepared us for at all. They (no, not we) won't support manned ones, either, except in the belief/illusion that they are in a deadly competition with a rival. I hope he's right that we can be embarrassed or scared enough by noticing that the fastest trains in the world are built and used elsewhere while we can't even keep our highways functioning that we'll get back into research and development as we did in the '60s and then quit.

He also has an engaging writing style, a great sense of humor, and well-honed arguments worth considering. So I strongly recommend reading this collection of essays and interviews.

But I did feel pretty bad when Tyson talked about how the children of the '60s, inspired by the moon race, became scientists and engineers, and the children of the '80s became useless professions like lawyers and investment bankers - and that's why we are falling behind China and other countries in technological innovation (he calls the Saturn V rocket the pinnacle of human engineering; the fastest vehicle ever created and it was designed over 50 years ago).All that said, I'd recommend it - space exploration is too important to ignore and NASA's budget is a fraction of what you think it is."

I'm not sure if he'll catch a lot of new eyes with it, but it's still a great primer, and one of those starting points for those who want to be amazed by the cosmos and amazed by someone who knows how to make it appropriately amazing."

There were parts of this book I read multiple times, just because they were so interesting! Tyson is not only passionate about the subject matter but brings some very fresh and humorous arguments to the table. This was an invaluable resource for me and I'm glad I read it.

The author expresses his dire hope that NASA will get the funding it needs to continue manned exploration. It's actually kind of a downer to read about the excitement leading up to the Apollo program and contrast this with the paucity of manned exploration into space since. Tyson is one of those guys who's really hard on the ISS. I can't quite tell if this is his sacred cow or if the ISS really is a waste of time. Whatever the case he makes a poor argument against it.

DeGrasse Tyson proves a point in this collection of articles: astronomy and astrophysics are under-funded and have been for the majority of their history.I found interesting the point made by the author according to which sciences of the cosmos only achieve significant funding and support in two cases: war (cold or hot) and economic benefits. If not for these two then we regress by stagnating as happened ever since the Apollo programs stopped.
194,0393350371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9616369-jim,4,"Entertaining and thought provoking. I enjoyed the segments of his essays where he reviewed the history of our space program. Tyson does tend to overstate his belief (although I agree) that we should increase funding for NASA and space exploration. I also share his concern with the United States becoming an ""idiocracy"" through our declining interest in science and math education. I like NDT, he is a very intelligent man who can also communicate to the layperson in a conversational style."

Tyson writes like he speaks, and I easily hear his voice as I was reading this book. His entire premise is that what made America great was our desire to explore and reach outward. Tyson thinks we are not doing that enough now, and that the result is other nations will leapfrog us technologically. Perhaps or perhaps not.

I loved it for the purpose of trying to motivate and inspire a nation to achieve greatness through the vision of space exploration.

It was like William Shatner doing a Christopher Walken impression. And not in a good way."
223,0393350371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29467608-serro,4,How much do you think is NASA getting off the tax dollar? If your answer is 10 cents you need to read this book immediately. DeGrasse Tyson proves a point in this collection of articles: astronomy and astrophysics are under-funded and have been for the majority of their history.I found interesting the point made by the author according to which sciences of the cosmos only achieve significant funding and support in two cases: war (cold or hot) and economic benefits. If not for these two then we regress by stagnating as happened ever since the Apollo programs stopped.
224,0393350371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9616369-jim,4,"Entertaining and thought provoking. I enjoyed the segments of his essays where he reviewed the history of our space program. Tyson does tend to overstate his belief (although I agree) that we should increase funding for NASA and space exploration. I also share his concern with the United States becoming an ""idiocracy"" through our declining interest in science and math education. I like NDT, he is a very intelligent man who can also communicate to the layperson in a conversational style."

I loved it for the purpose of trying to motivate and inspire a nation to achieve greatness through the vision of space exploration.

Some parts of this was recycled in 'Astrophysics for people in a hurry' too. Maybe not the best format for people wanting to learn facts and explore science. On the other hand, Dr. Tyson has a knack for images (making the mind understand how large a number is) and his passion and arguments for the exploration of space couldn't possibly be missed, they'd been repeated over and over. :P"

241,0393350371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5882124-kevin-cecil,3,"A few years ago on Real Time with Bill Mahr, Ashton Kutcher asked why we waste money on NASA. His point was there there are so many problems down here on Earth that shooting money at the stars just seems wasteful. Someone needs to give Mr. Kutcher this book. In SPACE CHRONICLES Neil deGrasse Tyson explains the applicable scientific achievements brought to us through space exploration (including a Hubble inspired breast cancer detector), while also detailing the numerous cosmic queries answered over the last century. He also takes a look back at what we accomplished in space travel, then turns a somber eye on where we are vs. where we could be. Tyson points out NASA currently costs us just about half a penny for every tax dollar, and longs for a new space race that would up that to the levels enjoyed in the '60s - only this time fueled by the desire for discovery, rather than annihilation. SPACE CHRONICLES is consistently fascinating, but this collection of essays, speeches, and articles concerning space travel does turn a bit redundant after a few chapeters. The second time you anticipate a punch line it feels like learning; the fourth or fifth time it just feels repetitive. Also, this may be the first non teen lit book to contain a chapter comprised solely of tweets. Perhaps my problem is really that I'm already a convert. The message of Tyson's hammer has long been nailed into my skull. Perhaps Space Chronicles is not really intended for believers like me, but for the Ashton Kutchers out there. In which case...hammer away Dr. Tyson. "
242,0393350371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47054186-seth-hanson,5,"Space Chronicles: Facing the Ultimate Frontier is a thought provoking book by a leading astronomer making a case as to why space travel is so important to us, both as a nation, scientifically, economically, and diplomatically, and as individuals, inspiring us, pushing us, and giving us new opportunities. Along the way, the author gives us a front row seat to the history of NASA and America in space, and shares his own insights on the matter of space travel and space in general. The book is, in essence, an argument to keep us in space, touching on all the reasons, in all aspects. Why we as a nation must stick in the race to stay on top, and why we as a race must continue to explore.I like this book because not only because it is a passionate defense of investing in space, but also because it is full of factual information and is very well written. The author, Neil deGrasse Tyson, is very good at making difficult concepts easy to understand without compromising the facts or their interesting qualities.Finally, I liked how the book was filled with completely unrelated facts about space and the space program. Even though they don't really have anything to do with what the book is talking about, they are still very interesting.There really wasn't anything at all that I didn't like about the book, but if I had to pick something, it would be that the pacing seemed somewhat forced at times.I would recomend this book to anyone interested in space.

243,0393350371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3371659-snem,3,"I get so excited about space it really thrills me. I want to see a human being land on Mars in my lifetime. I guess it takes a Cold War to excite people about the space program these days, but I don't fully believe that. People are still a little awed by space and that gives me hope. If that doesn't do it, perhaps the asteroid barreling down on us threatening to take out all the pacific islands and California will. Now onto this book...I really like Tyson's style. He's humorous, he makes science very accessible to dummies like me, and I enjoy his geeky sense of humor. His passion for the cosmos is infectious. Since this is a collection of essays that may have appeared elsewhere there is A LOT of repetition here. After a short while it started to read only like a solicitation for NASA funding. There was just not enough cool space stuff, but I like Tyson's style so much I'm inspired to read his other books. I don't recommend this if it's your first time reading Neil deGrasse Tyson, but do read if you're a big fan of his."
244,0393350371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8877615-jas,4,"Although this is very good, it's not exactly a book, or should I say, it wasn't composed as a book but in pieces originally published separately. It's intelligent, funny, and energetic, but it isn't Cosmos. Expect some repetition of ideas. One I hate to concede is that people will not be excited enough by unmanned explorations to fund them consistently, even though it's dangerous (almost absurd) to put human beings in an environment that our 4.5 billion-year evolution has not prepared us for at all. They (no, not we) won't support manned ones, either, except in the belief/illusion that they are in a deadly competition with a rival. I hope he's right that we can be embarrassed or scared enough by noticing that the fastest trains in the world are built and used elsewhere while we can't even keep our highways functioning that we'll get back into research and development as we did in the '60s and then quit.

As such, I'm not inclined to do a conventional review. Suffice it to say, Tyson is one of the preeminent voices advocating for space exploration. He also has an engaging writing style, a great sense of humor, and well-honed arguments worth considering. So I strongly recommend reading this collection of essays and interviews. On the lighter side, here is a blog piece I did that involves my copy of Dr. Tyson's book and, well...a cat. A Facebook Approach to Space Advocacy "
246,0393350371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1223288-jamie-weiss,4,"This is just a collection of essays originally published in other formats; for that reason there is some repetition from chapter to chapter which prevents me from giving it 5 stars. But I did feel pretty bad when Tyson talked about how the children of the '60s, inspired by the moon race, became scientists and engineers, and the children of the '80s became useless professions like lawyers and investment bankers - and that's why we are falling behind China and other countries in technological innovation (he calls the Saturn V rocket the pinnacle of human engineering; the fastest vehicle ever created and it was designed over 50 years ago).All that said, I'd recommend it - space exploration is too important to ignore and NASA's budget is a fraction of what you think it is."

tweets
 from Tyson. It gets repetitive very fast, unfortunately, and is more focused on space advocacy, in the form illustratory histories of the space race, earnest all-American entreaties about soliloquies about destiny and exploration, half-formed economic points and entreaties to please study maths more, kids. All of which is fair enough, but not strictly terrible interesting. Here and there are occasional bits on science or various things that have been or will be sent into space and how they work or don't work, and that's pretty cool. More of that, please. "

The book is a collection of previously written op-eds, speeches, and essays about space travel, the space program, and the universe, and all have that well-known Tyson charm to them, at that.Tyson is probably our best scientific popularist out there currently, and this book is a great example of it. I'm not sure if he'll catch a lot of new eyes with it, but it's still a great primer, and one of those starting points for those who want to be amazed by the cosmos and amazed by someone who knows how to make it appropriately amazing."

There were parts of this book I read multiple times, just because they were so interesting! Tyson is not only passionate about the subject matter but brings some very fresh and humorous arguments to the table. This was an invaluable resource for me and I'm glad I read it. Although I don't agree with every little thing he said (I have different views on some of the biological and evolutionary standpoints) this was really great read that I learned a lot from! "
250,0393350371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,3,This isn't the most exciting book by Tyson. It dryly covers the history of space flight. The author expresses his dire hope that NASA will get the funding it needs to continue manned exploration. It's actually kind of a downer to read about the excitement leading up to the Apollo program and contrast this with the paucity of manned exploration into space since. Tyson is one of those guys who's really hard on the ISS. I can't quite tell if this is his sacred cow or if the ISS really is a waste of time. Whatever the case he makes a poor argument against it.

I don't recommend this if it's your first time reading Neil deGrasse Tyson, but do read if you're a big fan of his."

It's intelligent, funny, and energetic, but it isn't Cosmos. Expect some repetition of ideas. One I hate to concede is that people will not be excited enough by unmanned explorations to fund them consistently, even though it's dangerous (almost absurd) to put human beings in an environment that our 4.5 billion-year evolution has not prepared us for at all. They (no, not we) won't support manned ones, either, except in the belief/illusion that they are in a deadly competition with a rival. I hope he's right that we can be embarrassed or scared enough by noticing that the fastest trains in the world are built and used elsewhere while we can't even keep our highways functioning that we'll get back into research and development as we did in the '60s and then quit.

275,0393350371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1995871-jake,4,"I am a big fan of Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson and his arguments for increasing NASA's budget to ramp up space exploration efforts. As such, I'm not inclined to do a conventional review. Suffice it to say, Tyson is one of the preeminent voices advocating for space exploration. He also has an engaging writing style, a great sense of humor, and well-honed arguments worth considering. So I strongly recommend reading this collection of essays and interviews. On the lighter side, here is a blog piece I did that involves my copy of Dr. Tyson's book and, well...a cat. A Facebook Approach to Space Advocacy "
276,0393350371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1223288-jamie-weiss,4,"This is just a collection of essays originally published in other formats; for that reason there is some repetition from chapter to chapter which prevents me from giving it 5 stars. But I did feel pretty bad when Tyson talked about how the children of the '60s, inspired by the moon race, became scientists and engineers, and the children of the '80s became useless professions like lawyers and investment bankers - and that's why we are falling behind China and other countries in technological innovation (he calls the Saturn V rocket the pinnacle of human engineering; the fastest vehicle ever created and it was designed over 50 years ago).All that said, I'd recommend it - space exploration is too important to ignore and NASA's budget is a fraction of what you think it is."
277,0393350371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4748847-tamara,0,"Slightly redundant. A collection of essays, speeches, columns, interview transcripts and, for the love of giant black hole at the center of the galaxy, 
tweets
 from Tyson. It gets repetitive very fast, unfortunately, and is more focused on space advocacy, in the form illustratory histories of the space race, earnest all-American entreaties about soliloquies about destiny and exploration, half-formed economic points and entreaties to please study maths more, kids. All of which is fair enough, but not strictly terrible interesting. Here and there are occasional bits on science or various things that have been or will be sent into space and how they work or don't work, and that's pretty cool. More of that, please. "
278,0393350371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32271-jeff-raymond,4,"I have an appropriate mancrush on Neil deGrasse Tyson, so grabbing his newest book was a no-brainer for me. The book is a collection of previously written op-eds, speeches, and essays about space travel, the space program, and the universe, and all have that well-known Tyson charm to them, at that.Tyson is probably our best scientific popularist out there currently, and this book is a great example of it. I'm not sure if he'll catch a lot of new eyes with it, but it's still a great primer, and one of those starting points for those who want to be amazed by the cosmos and amazed by someone who knows how to make it appropriately amazing."
279,0393350371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34785059-deborah,4,"I've been reading this book all semester while working on a project for a college course I'm taking; the project is an argumentative paper in favor of giving NASA greater funding. There were parts of this book I read multiple times, just because they were so interesting! Tyson is not only passionate about the subject matter but brings some very fresh and humorous arguments to the table. This was an invaluable resource for me and I'm glad I read it. Although I don't agree with every little thing he said (I have different views on some of the biological and evolutionary standpoints) this was really great read that I learned a lot from! "
280,0393350371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,3,This isn't the most exciting book by Tyson. It dryly covers the history of space flight. The author expresses his dire hope that NASA will get the funding it needs to continue manned exploration. It's actually kind of a downer to read about the excitement leading up to the Apollo program and contrast this with the paucity of manned exploration into space since. Tyson is one of those guys who's really hard on the ISS. I can't quite tell if this is his sacred cow or if the ISS really is a waste of time. Whatever the case he makes a poor argument against it.
281,0393350371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/617153-caitie,3,"I thought this would be more like ""woo! Mars!"" and I guess the first half was, but then it made me all woeful about our embarrassing and dated transportation networks, sewage systems, and electrical grid, our failing bridges and levees, our slow Internet, our flopping science and math education, and OMG OUR COUNTRY IS FALLING APART and we should be investing in fixing these problems rn when we need the jobs and borrowing cannot be cheaper, but instead we're just capping the debt and doing austerity and everything is depressing, p.s. global warming. "
282,0393350371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695351-brady,2,"I wanted to like this book, but I could not. This book seems to be a collection of essays and other musings from NDT, and boy did it get repetitive. You definitely won't leave the book not knowing how much of your tax dollar goes to NASA. (Spoiler: half a penny). This fact gets repeated over and over, and not in new ways. That's about how it goes.I listened to the Audible version, and the Narrator was horrible. It was like William Shatner doing a Christopher Walken impression. And not in a good way."
283,0393350371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29467608-serro,4,How much do you think is NASA getting off the tax dollar? If your answer is 10 cents you need to read this book immediately. DeGrasse Tyson proves a point in this collection of articles: astronomy and astrophysics are under-funded and have been for the majority of their history.I found interesting the point made by the author according to which sciences of the cosmos only achieve significant funding and support in two cases: war (cold or hot) and economic benefits. If not for these two then we regress by stagnating as happened ever since the Apollo programs stopped.
284,0393350371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9616369-jim,4,"Entertaining and thought provoking. I enjoyed the segments of his essays where he reviewed the history of our space program. Tyson does tend to overstate his belief (although I agree) that we should increase funding for NASA and space exploration. I also share his concern with the United States becoming an ""idiocracy"" through our declining interest in science and math education. I like NDT, he is a very intelligent man who can also communicate to the layperson in a conversational style."

286,0393350371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5895706-erica-barnes,4,"It had a lot of great information but was very redundant in places; almost down to the phrasing. He basically needs a better editor. The reading public isn't so stupid that you need to say the same thing twice. Especially since it was random stuff too, not like restating a thesis of some kind. If you ignore that part, the science was great, the politics were interesting and the anecdotes were quite amusing. "
287,0393350371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4156129-tom-blumer,4,"I found this book to be both informative and entertaining. Tyson writes like he speaks, and I easily hear his voice as I was reading this book. His entire premise is that what made America great was our desire to explore and reach outward. Tyson thinks we are not doing that enough now, and that the result is other nations will leapfrog us technologically. Perhaps or perhaps not. But his writing does cause one to think, which is always a good thing."
288,0393350371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71193520-griffin-sambrook,4,I found out about this book because I was interested in space and I liked Neil Degrassi Tyson. This book opened up many new things to me. I read one other space book which was really good but this one was also good cause presented new ideas and topics rather the the same ones. Definitely would recommend this book book to people interested in space. I liked this because of the section about black holes. I find them super interesting and cool since they are infinite.
289,0393350371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5121922-doug-garnett,2,"Love Neil's writing, passion, etc. But this is really just an article collection. And there's far too much repetition of ideas & even wording between articles. Wish they'd edited it better to make the articles flow like a book. Sorry, Neil, I'm only giving it 2 stars. But keep the faith with your arguments for a real NASA rather than a defunded shell. I'm with you on all that!"
290,0393350371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7864980-jesse-hall,5,"Outstanding. Renews excitement for NASA and space exploration. Excellent writing. Points out many misconceptions. Brings new and exciting information about what we know about the observable universe. Highly recommended reading material. Also, it's written in small sections (2-5 pages), so it's easy to pick up and read for five minutes and then come back to it later."
291,0393350371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10436527-jaron-roux,5,"I loved this book. I loved it for the purpose of trying to motivate and inspire a nation to achieve greatness through the vision of space exploration. Many will say this is a lost hope, but as Mr. Tyson relates it back to the 1960's and the race to the moon, I think his methodology is noteworthy! Humorous and inviting, I hope he writes another book soon!"
292,0393350371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20932108-ruben-farias,5,"There is nothing that interests me more than the cosmos. Neil deGrasse Tyson effortlessly simplifies the otherwise complex and sometimes paradoxical behaviors of the universe. In short, this book is loaded with fun facts that are sure to wreck your friends' minds, all while making you look like a bad ass at a party full of goons.. NdGS is a hoss! Done "
293,0393350371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8425766-christos,3,"So far... 3/5. This is not a bad book in any way but I expected more. It is more like a recap of things that even slightly interested in science people known already. Anyhow, if you havent heard of Neil deGrasse Tyson you should give it a try."
294,0393350371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7673333-susan-k,0,Just down-loaded on kindle because the author was so passionate on Jon Stewart's Daily Show. Hope it meets expectations!!

296,0393350371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20271487-zeynep,3,some of these essays are repetitive but NDT is hilarious & brilliant 
297,0393350371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23278117-joe,5,His passion for science and exploration comes through in his writing just as well as listening to him speak!
298,0393350371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35205135-alopexin,3,"Well written, but lacking in structure, which is only to be expected because this is a collection of the Dr. Tyson's various articles, interviews, and speech, and not a book of its own name. Some parts of this was recycled in 'Astrophysics for people in a hurry' too. Maybe not the best format for people wanting to learn facts and explore science. On the other hand, Dr. Tyson has a knack for images (making the mind understand how large a number is) and his passion and arguments for the exploration of space couldn't possibly be missed, they'd been repeated over and over. :P"
299,0393350371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41407616-jorge-rosas,2,"This book is complete focused in the USA Space Situation and at sometimes it screams “´Merica!”, it can also be depressing, with the anti-science tendency of modern days and we can easily end up missing the USSR with the glory of the space race. A huge part of this book is made by the Appendixes which are the legal acts of creation of NASA and other space entities."
