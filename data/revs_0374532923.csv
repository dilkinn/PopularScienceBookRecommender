0,0374532923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5448792-b-schrodinger,4,"Jesse Bering is an evolutionary psychologist. That means he asks things like why do we do that? And what could cause nature to select for that behaviour?Jesse Bering is an evolutionary psychologist who studies sexual behaviour. So what we end up with is a book that would make your mother blush and your grandmother to either faint or laugh uncontrollably and give awkward sepia -coloured sex stories.And while some part of me feels that I should give a warning that this isn't a book for everyone and that it does deal with very topical, abnormal and uncomfortable material, it does so in a very intelligent yet very witty way. So while there is a lot to learn here about why we do the things we do to the people we are hoping to get our rocks off with, there is also an intelligent look at the people who get their rocks off animals, vegetables and minerals. And while you may not like or condone or even think some behaviour is legal or even consensual, it's always great to hear about studies that have had the cajones to ask why. And it is always better to have an intelligent conversation rather than condemning because that is what cultural norms say.Jesse Bering is a hilarious guy. Not only did I get to experience his words, but he did read the audiobook. Audiobooks read by the author can only approach the epitome of seeming like you are in a lecture by the author and not having your suspension of disbelief shattered by the unnatural and stunted reading of what is obviously the author in a booth. Thankfully Jesse manages a close approximation of that seemingly off-the cuff, I'm-not-reading-a-script type of natural voice.So you'll learn about why the penis is shaped like that of course (don't want to give the game away but research on this question involved lots of moulded latex genitalia, manufactured ejaculate and a lot of elbow grease) and you'll learn about homophobes response to watching gay pornography. There's a smattering of female orgasm speculation between all the penile talk as part of a tokenistic 'female bits' chapter in an otherwise sausage-fest book.So, if you liked Mary Roach's 'Bonk' and even her hilarious writing style you should give this a try, It's a lot more scholarly, with Jesse talking about a multitude of research papers for every question or theme. But it is a lot more interesting and a lot more thought-provoking. I definitely did enjoy listening to ten hours of what comes down to dicking about."

For example, a few years ago my female neighbour tripped over my penis when she approached my lawn chair. I have learned from this painful experience to never recline sideways, always on my back with a warning flag attached so low flying aircraft will avoid it."
2,0374532923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33268479-alcoholbookscinema,4,"There's a book-cafe close to my house. It is owned by an old couple(the woman is 82 and her husband is 76. Yes, he is younger than her. I know this because she told me). It is a fifteen-minute walk, and sometimes I take my kindle and escape to this place for it's unbelievably calm and peaceful environment, in addition to that, it incorporates a heap of non-fiction books, particularly science. When I took a break from what I was reading, I detected this book on the shelf, initially, I believed the title must be 'why is the pencil shaped like that?' however I might've read it as 'penis'. I looked around, there were a couple of good-looking women who were relishing their coffee and seemed to be unaware of the events happening around them because of the book they were reading, therefore, I slowly got up, walked up to the shelf and lingered for quite a while as I was trying to absolutely make sure it was 'penis' and not 'pencil'. Ahoy! I noticed it was indeed 'penis' and not 'pencil'. So I got my hands on it and left the place as quickly as I could. Now, talking about the book. I went to the book-cafe to return the book, and the conversation with the 82-year-old-woman was She: ""So, what do you think about the book?""Me: ""Good.""She: ""Try to express it. Be punctilious. Don't be hesitant.""Me: ""All right. It was a fascinating and an informative book. There's a lot to analyze from the book. It shows the writer did a lot of research. I like science books with a smack of humor. So I enjoyed reading this.""She: ""True. I think, if people can knock off their fatuous religious views, they can enjoy such books.""Me: ""Couldn't agree more.""She: ""So, what are you having today?""Me: ""The usual.""She: ""Okay.""I went and sat at the place where I always sit and looked up for the meaning of the word punctilious.

3,0374532923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/792239-karli,3,"Eh. Some of the essays were fun and interesting. Others, not so much. I particularly picked up this book to read the essay on asexuality, and was pretty disappointed. Bering is really committed to an essentialist understanding of human sexuality, and that carries right over into his take on asexuality, and his essentialist stance directs the questions he finds most intriguing about the biological possibility of someone never experiencing sexual attraction. Bering works with an odd definition of ""sexual orientation"" which is strictly biologically based and possibly genetically heritable, so he automatically discounts life events or experiences with trauma as part of one's sexual development history; he also discounts pathologies and chromosomal differences, which may also be up for debate. The most troubling sentence that reflects this is in his essay on asexuality in particular: ""But if it exists as a distinct orientation, true asexuality would be due neither to genetic anomaly nor to environmental assault."" The phrase ""true asexuality"" is also cringe-worthy, and makes me wonder if Bering draws similar lines to demarcate ""true homosexuality,"" ""true heterosexuality,"" ""true bisexuality,"" and so on. Overall, I picked up some interesting bits from evolutionary biology, but otherwise, this book is kind of a queer theorist's nightmare. "
4,0374532923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1966542-rick,2,"I was going to leave this un-reviewed, but since I struggled between giving it a 2-star or 3-star rating...First...The Good: Interesting tidbits of science conveyed with a bit of humor, along with some thoughtful ponderings on what it all -- or at least, what some of it -- means. The essays are short, meaning you can easily pick it up for a quicky as time permits, which leads to...The Bad: This is a collection of previously-published essays. As such, there's a certain lack of narrative flow -- the whole comes across as a series of discreet thoughts bundled together under the guise of *reflections*, without much tying it together. This is especially true as the book progresses: the first sections focus on all things sex-related (as the title might suggest), but the latter portions veer off into Religion, Free Will, and Death.This, in turn, leads to a bit of repetition on two fronts, namely: Jesse Bering is Gay, and Jesse Bering is an Atheist, and he wants you to Know This. Or at least, that is how I perceive it. If you were to read these essays in their original forms/forums, it would likely be less apparent, but sardined together without much editing, these two identifiers repeatedly hit you over the head. The net effect, for me, is to make the fact that *Jesse Bering is a Gay Atheist* as much the center of attention as the topics he holds forth on. He seems especially keen to point out his godlessness, which leads to...The Ugly: Snarkiness. I've got nothing against Atheists -- even the non-heterosexual ones ;-). Being a PK, with gay friends and family members, who falls squarely in the midst of the dual-A camp (Atheists and Agnostics) I'm right there, for the most part. But True Unbelief requires the same amount of faith as True Belief, a fact that seems to evade many True Unbelievers, including, apparently, Jesse Bering. And while I appreciate a good mocking, here it seems contrived, as though he repeatedly brings the subject up just so he can make fun of it, even when it has only tangential bearing to the subject at hand.And so...This book was a disappointment for me. Given the title, and the fact that one of the back-cover reviewers christened Mr. Bering ""the Hunter S. Thompson of science [writing]"", I was expecting something at least as funny -- and focused on the naughty bits, if you will -- as Bonk, by Mary Roach, especially since I'm a huge HST fan. Instead, what I got was a disjointed, though still at times funny and thoughtful, glimpse at what keeps Jesse Bering awake at night. Honestly, were it not for *The Ugly*, I'd have given this 3 stars..."
5,0374532923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11788632-christine-glasser,5,"Okay so plain and simple: the book is AMAZING. Didn't want it to end. The title refers to just one of the 33 essays and I don't think does the book justice because it is in fact a work of intellectual breadth covering an incredible range of material. What I mean is that it's not as superficial as it probably sounds. It's one those books that I think readers will either love or hate (or maybe just completely not get?) because of the author's very unique style, the provocative subject matter and the sometimes really, REALLY uncomfortable points he makes. While I didn't agree with everything he says I found that so much of the fun in reading this book is the fact that you find yourself debating with him throughout, then usually coming to the conclusion after listening to him unpack his argument that, yeah, if you're being honest with yourself you know he's probably actually right. Bering is consistently almost preternaturally logical in his thinking but also weirdly playful and frankly kind of hard to explain. I got the distinct impression that he was teasing the reader just to drag out your headshaking for his own delight. And you enjoy his teasing in the process! I snorted--mind you not just laughed but SNORTED at some of his lines they were so funny. What this book did was make me think about things in totally new ways (actually about things that hadn't even occurred to me to wonder about) and I *love* when a book does that. I first heard about Bering on an NPR show (I think ""All Things Considered"" maybe?) where he was talking about his first book ""The Belief Instinct"" which I also read and while totally different (it was about God being a figment of the human mind) it had a similar effect on me. I'm hooked!"
6,0374532923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/369112-melody,2,"Wildly uneven book of essays. Some of them were very good and some of them were amusing. A couple rubbed me the wrong way entirely because they were so personal and Bering assumed that his feelings were universal (f'rinstance, polyamory can't ever work for anyone because Bering gets so jealous he throws up). The essays about suicide were especially interesting. Bering's corny jokes were cute at first but wore on me by the end. "
7,0374532923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,5,"Why is the Peni$ Shaped Like That? And Other Reflections on Being Human by Jesse Bering“Why is the Peni$ Shaped Like That?"" is the irreverent, thought-provoking and rather sensational book of essays on human sexuality. Dr. Jesse Bering takes us on a journey of surprising and even shocking peculiarities of being human. Using the latest of scientific research in psychology, neuroscience, biology and a naughty sense of humor Bering succeeds in enlightening the public on fascinating issues pertaining to human sexuality. This entertaining 320-page book is broken out into the following eight parts: Part I. Darwinizing What Dangles, Part II. Bountiful Bodies, Part III. Minds in the Gutter, Part IV. Strange Bedfellows, Part V. Ladie’s Night, Part VI. The Gayer Science: There’s Something Queer Here, Part VII. For the Bible Tells Me So and Part VIII. Into the Deep: Existential Lab Work. Positives:1.	A fun and informative book for the masses.2.	The fascinating topic of human sexuality in the irreverent hands of Jesse Bering.3.	A frank conversational tone. Bering holds nothing back to the point of being uncomfortable but when it is all said and done you are thankful that he did. 4.	This book is anything but boring. The pages turn themselves. The ability of Bering to immerse science, anecdotes, sound logic, personal experiences, pop culture and humor into an engaging narrative is what makes this work. 5.	This book will at times surprise, inform, disgust and educate you. In short, it’s thought provoking.6.	Understanding the male reproductive anatomy. The activation hypothesis and yes an evolutionary-based explanation for the title of the book.7.	Interesting facts and findings throughout the book. Let me share one because I can’t contain myself, “In fact, frequency of erotic fantasies correlates positively with intelligence”. 8.	Curious oddities of the human body. 9.	Cannibalism…bite me.10.	The correlation between brain damages and behavior. One of my favorite essays.11.	Dirty brain science. Some very uncomfortable topics…but I couldn’t look away. Fetishes…12.	Understanding the female anatomy. It’s the ladies turn.13.	Unflattering stereotypes…understanding straight women who gravitate toward gay men.14.	Interesting studies on homosexuality. The differences between men and women. The roles and preferences. Educational.15.	Wonderful use of evolution. “Right is irrelevant. There is only what works and what doesn’t work, within context, in biologically adaptive terms…”16.	Burial practices that need to change. A very interesting essay.17.	A hard look at suicide and a unique take regarding suicide as adaptive and from an evolutionary perspective.18.	A look at free will and one of the most thought-provoking statements, “If exposure to deterministic messages increases the likelihood of unethical actions, then identifying approaches for insulating the public against this danger becomes imperative”. In general, I disagree with the statement but talk about a conversation ice breaker. 19.	Comprehensive notes section.Negatives:1.	I didn’t like the title of this book. Sure, it reflects the author’s irreverent and humorous side but for one I can never remember the title. It’s like an entertaining commercial where you can never remember the product being promoted. Secondly, the title alone might keep some people from reading it and these are perhaps the ones who need to read it the most to begin with. How about a title like, “Naughty Science: Reflections on Human Sexuality”?2.	This is not so much a negative on the book but on the lack of scientific research on human sexuality. Such a fascinating topic yet it’s clear that for whatever the reasons the science of human sexuality is its infancy. 3.	A lot of the findings in the book are tentative. In truth, all science knowledge is tentative but it seems to me that the some of these studies require much further research. Enough there to whet the appetite but not enough to reach strong conclusions.4.	No direct links to notes on the kindle version, a real shame.5.	Some of the findings will cause cognitive dissonance. I don’t agree with everything in this wonderful, thought-provoking book. As an example, I disagree with the general notion that a person who believes in supernatural punishment may be more trustworthy than one who isn’t. In the fantastic book, “Society without God”, Phil Zuckerman makes the compelling case that those societies without religious beliefs (or less of) are more successful, better functioning and happier places to live in. As a personal example, if was looking for a babysitter and a member of the clergy were to ring my doorbell, I’d probably be more inclined to call a policeman. 6.	This book whets your appetite for more, more, more. 7.	No formal bibliography.In summary, what a trip this book was. First of all the topic of human sexuality is fascinating and rarely dealt with at the scientific level. I’m glad that for once an author has the guts in lieu of another word, to get a book like this out for the public. This book will make your cringe, laugh, disagree, concur, and ultimately think. The only thing that limits this book is the fact that the scientific research on human sexuality is still in its infancy. Be that as it may, I learned so much from this book while having fun with it. I highly recommend it!Further suggestions: “The Belief Instinct” by the same author, “Subliminal” by Leonard Mlodinow, “Society Without God” by Phil Zuckerman, ”The Believing Brain: From Ghosts and Gods to Politics and Conspiracies---How We Construct Beliefs and Reinforce Them as Truths..."" by Michael Shermer, ""The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature"" by Steven Pinker, “Who’s in Charge?” and ""Human: The Science Behind What Makes Us Unique, by Michael S.

8,0374532923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7387625-georgina-ortiz,4,"A few months ago, I noticed myself just looking at good-looking guys (some of whom used to make my heart palpitate a bit) and feeling nothing. Absolutely nothing. It was then that I realized that I must be getting old, since just a decade ago, butterflies in my chest and stomach were a constant whenever I would come face-to-face with a ""potential mate"" (in the Filipino language there is a word for this: kilig). And so I reflected on it. Maybe, I theorized, evolution has dictated that female thirty-somethings should have long concluded their ""mate-hunting"" phase and should instead focus on rearing healthy offspring (who would, in turn, ensure the health of the global population). Stomach butterflies, in this case, are only for those females who have yet to choose ""dependable and loyal"" mates destined to help them rear those little gene-passers. Okay, plausible answer.So this is the kind of mind I have (and I will not apologize for it), and the kind of mind I wish to encourage in my future offspring (a questioning, not salacious, mind, MIND YOU). This is also the kind of (nerdy) mind that would be intrigued with Dr. Jesse Bering's Why Is the Penis Shaped Like That: And Other Reflections on Being Human. Needless to say, I enjoyed his essays (and evidence-based theories) immensely.Now I must admit that there were some topics in the book that made me uncomfortable (I will not enumerate them here lest I be accused of prudery). They still make me uncomfortable now that I have finished the book. Nevertheless, I think Bering was right in saying that ""the great thing about good science is that it's amoral and objective and doesn't cater to the court of public opinion."" He further pointed out (and rightly so): ""Data don't cringe; people do.""Some of the concepts that Bering introduced(I don't know and can't verify at the moment if these are new, by the way), such as ""green burial"" and ""animal laughter,"" were really thought-provoking (I am now seriously considering of someday having myself buried, not with a non-biodegradable coffin, but with a shroud—and a special acacia tree planted above me). I was also interested in Bering's scientific examination of the suicide phenomenon and his reflections thereafter: ""If there is one thing I've learned since those very dark days of my suicidal years, it's that scientific knowledge changes perspective. And perspective changes everything. Everything. And, as I alluded to at the start, always remember: you're going to die soon anyway; even if it's a hundred years from now, that's still a blink of a cosmic eye. In the meantime, live like a scientist—even a controversial one with only a colleague or two in all the world—and treat life as a grand experiment, blood, sweat, tears, and all. Bear in mind that there's no such thing as a failed experiment—only data.""This book is definitely not for the moralists and the faint of heart. But for those who are open to learn about (and subsequently discuss) usually ""icky"" topics, Dr. Bering's book is one hell of a joyride. "
9,0374532923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1201123-iz,3,"Funny and informative, full of puns and dad jokes, which was the best thing about this collection of essays. But I couldn't help but see a few issues with how he frames the research. Early in the book, when talking about how sperm contains antidepressants, he gave this as the reason why gay men engage in ""barebacking"". He went on to criticize authors of a study who explained this predilection with social reasons, ""promoting closeness"" etc, by saying, well, come on, don't we think it's obviously more likely biological evolutionary reasons than the ""postmodern"" reasons given by the authors? Wellll.. that's problematic. These a priori arguments don't really work in science like that. It kind of set the tone for how he framed other research, especially all the stuff on gender differences. Hey, haven't neuroscientists been telling everyone for decades to stop using brain differences as evidence of biological determinism because the brain is shaped by a person's history and experiences? Another thing that made me take pause was his insistence that hebephilia is only a problem in a moralistic society, that it's perfectly accepted in many societies in the world, and a person can be a hebephile and an upstanding member of society, just look at Roman Polanski... well, let's look at Roman Polanski, because I don't think anyone really has ever said that the problem with him is that he is a hebephile. The problem with him is that he acted on his attraction by drugging a child and raping her, and the problem with that is the lifelong emotional and maybe physical trauma that such a deep violation of body integrity early in life can cause. (Tbh this sounds just like those anthropologists who claimed there was no rape in certain societies, only for it to be discovered by a woman that they just didn't have a word for ""rape"" because women mattered so little that their consent wasn't even on the radar). How thorough is this science, how complete is this data, if we completely ignore an entire side of the story, if we only center our perspective on men's desire? How accurate are you if you say women are biologically less prone to physical violence, if you ignore an entire lifetime of being told certain kinds of behavior are inappropriate?I enjoyed reading this book because it was funny and there were some laugh out loud moments, but as for the science I think it left quite a bit to be desired.

10,0374532923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25611710-aryeh,5,"This is the second of Jesse Berring's books that have read, and i am likely to read all of them. I'm still binging on evolutionary psychology- it just explains so damn much- and Jesse's willingness not to shy away from uncomfortable weird, macabre, 'disturbing' material is rare and badly needed. It's very hard to get bored while reading about autofellatio, how finger length can reliably predict sexual orientation and even preference of sexual positions, the neurochemistry of heartbreak, superior alternative burial techniques, and even the evolutionary adaptiveness of suicide. Just one fascinating essay after the other here."
11,0374532923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11041497-scott,3,"This was not an easy rating to arrive at. On the one hand, the book is full of interesting and at times valuable information presented in readable prose, fully accessible to a general audience. It was for the most part fun to read and edifying which generally earns a book at least four stars.On the other hand, the book reads like a collection of previously published pieces, cobbled together under more or less logical headings, then sent off to the binder with a perfunctory introduction and little else. It does not appear that Bering attempted to edit the pieces to prevent repetition, and certainly he does nothing to create a narrative flow.It's a rare writer who can write about sex and be funny without being juvenile. Dan Savage usually succeeds. Mary Roach and Jesse Bering do not. Too many jokes have the effect of an off-color line delivered too loudly in a slightly slurred voice at a black tie party. Everything stops suddenly, then you try to act like that didn't just happen.Finally, I have a real problem with some of the early chapters. The piece on pedophilia in particular hit some wrong notes for me. I suppose the big problem is he talks about the legal implications of, for instance, classifying ephebophilia as a mental disorder, without bothering to actually research those implications (if he had, he would have discovered that it would avail a defendant of an insanity defense.In a few other places he drifts from science to discussing law, ethics or morality, none of which he does well.I'm glad I read the book and would recommend it to anyone interested in pop evolutionary psychology. But with a little work it could have been so much more."
12,0374532923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14428846-sparrow,5,"I saw this book on display in a used book shop in Oregon. I loved the title and knew I would have to read it. I loved it. I knew I loved learning about evolutionary psychology, but this book reminded me on a constant basis how FASCINATING the whole subject is and how much more we have to learn!I loved all of the subjects for this book. Penises, bodies, the brain and sex, sexual preferences, homosexuality, suicide, and religion. This book was by no means an easy read, nor did I zoom through it, but it made me think. It forced me to remain objective in my thinking and abandon morality to consider the science and the facts. I rarely read books that force my brain to do such strenuous exercises!I have to say, I was disappointed that the women section was so lacking. I do understand that a lot of women's studies in science, like on their orgasms etc. is lacking research, but seriously, like 4 chapters and each one 2 pages? It was kind of ridiculous. I think he could have found more to talk about.Also, the first chapter in the religion section was absolutely maddening. His so called ""data"" and analysis of explaining why religious folks are more trustworthy was bogus. The experiments detailed and reasoning presented was faulty. Clearly, religious people are only more trustworthy because they are like-minded with a majority of already religious people, not because they actually are. What nonsense. The rest of the section was pretty awesome, especially the section on green funerals.I learned so much from this book, and I would love to learn even more of the subjects presented. I hate to drop it back at the library - maybe I'll buy it one day! On with science!"
13,0374532923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6865942-claire,4,"If you do not feel that you are not particularly interested in the shape of penises, don't let the title of this book put you off. The subtitle is “... and other reflections on being human” which is a more helpful description of the collection of essays within. Bering is a professor of evolutionary psychology, or something equally as fascinating and beyond the reaches of my full understanding. The book begins with a chapter where he does tackle the male genitalia in some detail (pun intended) but many people either have their own penis or live with someone who has one, so may find all this of at least some interest. Many of the essays are about sexuality or our privates, but from the perspective of someone who knows a lot about human nature and our evolution. Much of these facts could be used to populate polite conversation at the family dinner table. He also has a section on homosexuality, religious belief (which he went on to write a whole book about) and suicide. The book is peppered with references to his own life. Bering basically gets to read about stuff he is interested in, writes a paper about it, and gets paid to publish it in a journal, then gets paid again to publish it all together in this book. What a lucky guy. There are over thirty essays in this book, all on various subjects relating to being human, so it is a great read for any humans you may know with a very short attention span.click here to read the rest of my reviews"
14,0374532923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/325227-jan-bednarczuk,1,"I was hoping this book would be an informative and fun read, but the author's irritating voice kept me from enjoying the material. I could never really get into the topic he was writing about, due to his constant efforts to draw attention to himself in the form of ""humorous"" asides and digressions, often seemingly intended to shock the reader with how outré he is. Can we just assume that someone who is willing to pick up a book titled ""Why is the penis shaped like that?"" is someone who is reasonably open-minded and who won't dissolve into tittering blushes every time the word ""semen"" is mentioned?I just couldn't get past the style on this one."
15,0374532923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13389636-deby-depreta,2,"This book's aim was to titillate, rather than educate. I found it immature at best and rather spare on its actual science reportage.Annoyingly, the author seemed to think the reader needed to know how much he loathed the idea of having intercourse with a woman. He mentioned it a few times in the book.This book was more about the author's opinions and predilections than factual information.I was deeply disappointed given I looked forward to a good non-fiction read."
16,0374532923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6979712-leah,3,This is the second Jesse Bering book I read. The first one was 'Perv. The sexual deviant in all of us'. I must say that Jesse has a great way of engaging the reader and keeping things (even difficult topics) easy to read through. He has a way with puns that I can appreciate and laugh at. The book title though is a bit of a ''click bait'' as only one chapter actually reviews this particular question [penis shape]. However this read does give you great insights in all things sex(uality) and life. I do recommend it to folk curious and open minded enough to explore the many topics it tackles.
17,0374532923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1281530-james,4,"Overall an interesting read that will give you a lot of information around how we function as sexual beings, as well as a smattering of psychological topics, backed by some interesting research. I agree with other reviews here that the book lacks a flow and that the various essays just feel bundled together. Individually, though, most are quite excellent. Some sections also felt particularly weak, but others are very enlightening and interesting. An informative book that is somewhat disjointed and at times a vapid read. "

LIKE LITERALLY, EXTREMELY, AND TOTALLY INTO DUDES"" in each paragraph only so many times before you want to scream, ""I F*CKING GET IT, OKAY! I WANT TO READ ABOUT ZOOPHILES NOW--BACK OFF."" The author's constant referring back to his sexual orientation (and generally in a conspicuous manner too, such as, ""...and that's why our fingers are shaped as such. And I'd know this from experience, because I am a homosexual"") was REALLY distracting, and took away from the main body of each essay in this book. (I get it. You're gay. You're happy about it. I'm happy for you. But I got it the first time, in the first paragraph, in the introduction. We don't need to hear it eight more times per essay--calm down, Buckaroo. We got it. Really.)Overall, though? If you like weird science in regard to evolutionary theories, read it--it's a good one. :D"
20,0374532923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11672712-susan,4,"How could you not want to read a book with this title? The book is a fast, enjoyable read: It's a series of short, clever and often funny, essays most them taking on a sexual topic (an ode to human seman, the female ejaculation) but, not exclusively (death, free will, suicide and animal laughter). All are science-based, AND it's science made user-friendly. Dr. Bering is gay, so unsurprisingly a few essays (5 of 33) deal with the science of homosexuality: repressed homosexuality; can you detect sexual orientation in children; and can you ask a gay man for directions. As to the latter, see what I mean by humor? He fearlessly writes where many tremble to read -- zoophiles, pedophilia, the nature of fetishes, asexuality -- and these topics are where he uses the scientific approach to best effect. As Dr. Bering is also a neuroanatomist, he uses ""brain science"" as the lens to view these subjects and thereby -- at least for me -- elicits understanding if not compassion. None of choose our brain structure or the life experiences that mold us. Without directly stating this fact, he gently illuminates the humanity of the poor souls condemned in this life to the judgments from those of us born with socially-acceptable brains. Bravo Dr. Bering. You are gifted in oh, so many ways. "
21,0374532923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1046533-hadassah,5,I enjoyed this book tremendously. The author covered a very large range of hot button issues and was clear about not over stepping what the scientific evidence is for various theories. It is a great introduction to so many topics in Evolutionary Psychology. Jesse Bering has a great sense of humor.I was tickled to revisit the work of many evolutionists that I have worked with through my involvement in the Evolutionary Studies (EvoS) program at Binghamton University (evolution.binghamton.edu/evos/) and as managing editor of Evolution: This View of Life(www.thisviewoflife.com).He covered work of two ETVOL editors work including Michael Blume (Religion editor) and Dominic Johnson (Politics editor). He writes about Gordon Gallup's work on semen (for a youtube interview on ETVOL of Gordon Gallup see http://www.thisviewoflife.com/index.p...) He also references many people I have interacted with through EvoS including Anne Clark a participating EvoS faculty member at Binghamton University and Jaak Panksepp who will be speaking at the EvoS seminar at some point this fall. 
22,0374532923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14371340-yeedle,4,"Humorous and entertaining. I'm not a big fan of evolutionary psychology, and as the author calls it, it's ""backwards engineering"", using what we know to explain it from an evolutionary perspective, a process that is highly speculative at best and downright absurd at worst. Another problem with evolutionary psychology is that one can probably do the same while taking the creationist perspective. I admit, though, that in some instances such explanations only work within an evolutionary framework and don't go well from a creationist perspective. For example, on the question why the penis is shaped liked that, the answer that God created it so it should flush out the sperm of a competition, is absurd because it means that God allowed for promiscuity, and he cares who one will win the impregnation war, an absurd position. But from an evolutionary perspective, it makes sense that natural selection should favor a design that helps you wash out the competition's sperm when you insert yours. "
23,0374532923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11221501-roger-blakesley,3,"It was certainly educational. Even about parts I've owned for 51 years. Written entirely, almost, from the perspective of an evolutionary psychologist who was oddly biased towards Darwinian evolution, but who was honest enough to know its limitations. He, of course, in keeping with the presumption of evolution's truth broadly acknowledges dipping his toes deeply into speculation.And the book lacks the traditional visceral hatred of religion and traditional morality one might expect. The essays in the book are broadly adapted versions of essays he's published in Scientific American and elsewhere.The book is full of humour, anecdotes, interesting facts and wild speculations. An entertaining read and also a deep exposure of the author's inner self that I found refreshingly honest."
24,0374532923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8385280-charity-becker,5,"I'm getting a huge kick out of this book. It's funny and informative, and the author is just so darn adorable. I'm a big science and psychology buff, and I have always been interested in human sexuality; this book covers all of that, and more. I'm about halfway through, and I'm almost dreading the end, yet I find it hard to put down so I can get some actual work done on my OWN books! Not for the squeamish or prudish--you have been warned. "
25,0374532923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28900628-spacebear,4,"A funny and informative collection of essays from Jesse Bering, mostly on the subject of human sexuality, though some wander from that topic. His approach is to view all paraphilia as fundamentally normal and natural, focussing instead on societal's reactions to such paraphilia as the problem. His well thought out arguments, and genuinely funny tone, make all his books interesting and entertaining."
26,0374532923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20662564-joli-hamilton,2,"While the book was told in an entertaining style, I found the gender essentialism to be incredibly overbearing. Bering relies on evolutionary biology to explain absolutely everything he observes in humans, seemingly unable to conceive of the effect our culture and family systems have upon us, much less the effect of our unconscious aspects! Good for a laugh, but take the whole thing with a large block of salt."

30,0374532923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11364493-sarah,2,"Aside from the clever cover, this book was a little disappointing. Its main fault isn't a crime against writing like some of the books I've read, it's just that...I didn't laugh. But more on that later, because there are more objective issues to address first. The main problem, which it can't overcome, is that it's pretty much just a collection of previously published articles. Even arranged and revised, it's tough to escape from the fact that each chapter was meant to be a standalone piece. The humor is concentrated and intense--when you've got a column's worth of space, you need to tell your story, present your evidence, make a point, and get a laugh, which is a tall order even in a full book. Bering definitely does it well one by one, but when you pile them all on top of each other, it's a bit of a mishmash. The strangest thing about this mishmash is the mismatch of topics. From the front cover (admittedly the title is there to provoke) it sounds as though the essays will be mostly about the physical quirks of humanity. And there is a fair bit of that. The first two parts of the book focus specifically on the human body. Then we transition to sex and, eventually, sexuality. It's a bit of a wide range, but the thematic blu-tack holds things in place enough. But then we dive completely aside in Part 7, ""For the Bible Tells Me So"", and Part 8, ""Into the Deep: Existential Lab Work."" What are these sections doing here? The only chapter in here sort of related to the rest of the book is ""God's Little Rabbits.""I think my issue is that many of the essays come down on just one side of Bering's specialty--evolutionary or psychology, with just a smattering of the other. Most of the book focuses on the evolutionary with a side of psychology, but these last two sections heavily favor the psychological over the evolutionary, and the transition is a bit abrupt.At this point I should make a disclaimer: I started with Part 8. I was interested to read Bering's comments on whether suicide might be an adaptive trait, but I didn't want to end what looked like a funny book on a sour note. (Reading those chapters would have carried my mood through the next two, deliberately more lighthearted, chapters). I know I'm not actively editing at a trade level, but my instinct in this case would be to divide the chapters by mood, or to create a thematic gradient, rather than chopping the chapters up by topic. Or maybe even arrange them anatomically, from the feet to the head! You could have the chapters in the table of contents arranged around an anatomy drawing like labels--that'd be awesome! I guess my feeling is that, if you're going to publish a collection of previously published material, even revised, you shouldn't try to bury the fact in topical organization that just draws attention to how disparate the topics are. Heck, you could even acknowledge the fact! Yeah, there will be some people who grouse about being sold repackaged material, but there will be more people who know and appreciate Bering, his profession, his personality, and his style. We're not all pack rats who cut out and hoard our favorite articles (ahem). Actually talking in the introduction about how he found themes emerging from some of the most popular pieces of his work and/or the pieces he liked most would be more up front but also show the evolution of the author's own thinking. (Admittedly, I'm not feeling inspired to reread the introduction right now. Sorry.) (Also admittedly, the author's thinking about the book’s structure could very well be heavily influenced by his editor's thinking.) As a writer, I would be more inspired to revise chapters in ways that allowed me to discuss the changes I was making, the new things I'd discovered since writing the original article, and how the revised pieces fit together. But it's impossible to know how much of the motivation for this book came from Bering versus his editor.Okay, so aside from the structural issues, how was the book? To be honest, I barely laughed. Maybe this isn't a problem with the book but with my expectations: I thought I would be snickering like a stereotypical middle-school boy on every other page. And when you expect to laugh but don't, well, there are few more frustrating things. With that said, I did find the information in the book fascinating, if not completely engaging: I read quickly and with interest in most cases, and it was incredibly refreshing to have a scientific guide who wasn't your standard straight older male. If he'd written the book from scratch, I would have liked to see him be a bit more objective in the chapters on women rather than issuing his (witty, honest, and practically unique) disclaimer that his authority can only be limited, but I think that's entirely a symptom of the fact that the book is a collection of articles. Again, there's just not space to be all-inclusive in 500 words or fewer.My advice, if you want an engaging, funny look at the science of sex that masterfully combines objectivity and the author's non-standard personality (not a man!): go read Mary Roach's Bonk. But if Bering were to write a full popular science book, I would definitely be interested in reading it. 
The Belief Instinct
 doesn't sound like my cup of tea, but I did enjoy Bering's engaging narrative voice, written non-standard personality (not straight!), and quirky approach to taboo topics. This is a good book to read while reading other books at the same time.Quote Roundup245) When compared with control groups, suicidal participants significantly overestimated the passage of experimentally controlled intervals of time by a large amount. Baumeister surmises, “Thus suicidal people resemble acutely bored people: The present seems endless and vaguely unpleasant, and whenever one checks the clock, one is surprised at how little time has actually elapsed.” Evidence also suggests that suicidal individuals have a difficult time thinking about the future … This temporal narrowing, Baumeister believes, is actually a defensive mechanism that helps the person to withdraw cognitively from thinking about past failures and the anxiety of an intolerable, hopeless future. So often, when I read about things supposedly relevant to me, I don’t really see myself in them. This chapter on what it feels like to be suicidal, though, was pretty well aligned with my own experience last year. (Not really a surprise, since it sounds from the previous chapter like Bering’s been there himself.) Even though I felt like a zombie for about half the year while I was stuck in the temporal rut described above, I’m very fortunate that I never made it to the final step, disinhibition. I was too stuck in that apathetic state where I couldn’t think about the past or future, and while pretty much all of the rest of my symptoms are gone, I’m still having trouble getting that one back on track. Still, never thought I’d be a little grateful for that awful feeling of being an exhausted hamster on a rusty wheel.91) If you’re like most, you’ve seen the impossibility of . . . masturbating successfully [to orgasm] without casting some erotic representational target in your mind’s eye. . . This is one of the reasons, incidentally, why I find it so hard to believe that self-proclaimed asexuals who admit to masturbating to orgasm are really and truly asexual. They must be picturing something, and whatever that something is gives away their sexuality.I found this shockingly insensitive compared to most of the rest of the essays. It just seems odd that someone who takes seriously the idea that some people might be sexually attracted to animals, or objects, or even children (not that he condones or condemns any, just that he looks for the possible evolutionary origin of these orientations) should be so dismissive of people self-reporting something intensely personal. How is this much different from the people who might have learned he was gay and said, “You just haven’t found the right woman yet”? Strangely, the chapter specifically about asexuality wasn’t as bluntly dismissive as these two sentences were. Maybe doing the research for the full article gave him a bit more perspective--though that only works if it turns out that this chapter was written before “Asexuals Among Us.”125-126) Okay, I take it back, because I forgot about this bit. “Asexuals Among Us” does still have one especially grotesque last word:Unless psychological scientists ever gather a group of willing, self-identified asexuals and, systematically and under controlled conditions, expose them to an array of erotic stimuli while measuring their physical arousal (penile erection or vaginal lubrication), the truth of the matter will lie forever hidden away in the asexuals’ pants.Is it really so impossible that someone who genuinely is one orientation might be physically aroused by something even if they’re not personally aroused by it? I guess I just figure arousal should relate, in humans, to mental readiness as well as--heck, more than! --physical readiness. Bering actually describes in another place how some men get partial erections when facing a phobia. Surely no one believes that they’re actually turned on by something that terrifies them! Maybe there’s just a disconnect here, maybe we (okay, I) need a bit more clarity about how Bering and the researchers he’s discussing define arousal. Our bodies do so many weird things we really, really don’t want them to do. Who’s to say physical arousal can’t be one of them?167) The more we understand about the evolved pressures underlying our behaviors, the more we can get a grip on them and evaluate our own motives. One of my favorite thinkers, the feminist cultural constructivist Simone de Beauvoir, wrote famously that, “one isn’t born a woman, but becomes one.” While it’s true that culture exerts strong pressures shaping expressions of gender disparities, it also helps to know the biological mold that society must contend with. This little aside put some ice on my bruised feminist heart. Bering reminds readers that we’re not all either evolution or psychology--science and society are mixed in self-reflective humans more intensely than they are for any other animal. We’re not doomed to remain at the mercy of our biology--understanding it doesn’t have to be the end point. Also, how does one become a feminist cultural constructivist? Because it sounds like a cool career."
31,0374532923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3078602-peacegal,3,"Fans of Mary Roach will enjoy this pop-sci look at a variety of aspects of the human condition, including anatomy, sex, death, religion/ethics, and the brain.Like any good scientist, Bering keeps an open mind. He describes a wide variety of human behaviors with fascination, even those he knows that readers are likely to cringe at.Do I think the author was a little too soft on people who sexually abuse animals (and that’s what it is—because contact like this is by definition nonconsensual)? Yes, I do. Yet this is just one of the seemingly unending ways in which humans use other beings’ bodies for their own gratification—and indeed, a  sizeable section of animal agriculture  relies on this deeply taboo contact. On the other hand, unlike much of Roach’s writing, which looks at animal experimentation with a detached, unsympathetic eye, Bering frequently makes asides about the cruelty or pain caused by a certain experiment…so he does seem to possess a sense of ethics regarding animals.Which brings us to the author’s gag about how “dead pigs taste so good.” Normally, I wouldn’t focus on one throwaway line, but since it was literally the last sentence in the book…the author’s parting words to his reader, I am going to. Bering went into detail about an experiment that showed that rats actually laugh when tickled, indicating that these most humble of animals may be more complex and emotional than we’d like to give them credit for. The author admitted that reading about this research had him reconsidering his abandoned vegetarianism, but then does a dumb 180 to soothe his readers and most likely, himself. Subjecting a sentient creature to a life of living hell for a moment of pleasure is hard to argue for in any rational or ethical way. So instead, smart, thoughtful people resort to dumb jokes and defensiveness. Meanwhile, the factory farming industry continues on its merry, ruinous path. "
32,0374532923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12912425-danielle,2,"This one is going to have to be a ""Did Not Finish"" for me—both because it's due at the library and because I genuinely just wasn't that into it. It was, unfortunately, one of those books where you read the synopsis and it sounds really intriguing, but then you actually read it and it doesn't quite live up in practice. I think A LOT of this had to do with the way it was written, which just wasn't engaging or accessible enough for me. It can be hard sometimes with nonfiction, for an author to make the subject they're writing about both educational and equally fun to read without boring/losing their audience. For me, this was not one of those times. I think a lot of it also has to do with the fact that a lot of the essays in this book go into the evolutionary science and theories behind various topics, and that's just not something I'm very interested in. Like, I don't give a flying crap what the evolutionary significance of pubic hair was to caveman, and I feel like a lot of evidence and theories for possible evolutionary purposes is very reaching. But maybe that's just me and my own personal thoughts on the matter.One of the big reasons I wanted to read this was also because there's a chapter on asexuality, and being one myself (hi! *waves) I really wanted to read it. Unfortunately, I found it to be pretty disappointing. Even though the author made it clear that many asexual are perfectly normal, healthy human beings (DUH), he still mixed it in with sexual dysfunctions and chromosomal abnormalities and a bunch of other reasons why a person may potentially be asexual, which I think only perpetuates the notion that there's something inherently wrong with asexuals that needs to be figured out, as opposed to just accepting asexuals as they are and letting them be. And, you know, placing the asexual chapter into the ""Strange Bedfellows"" section alongside chapters about pedophiles and beastiality definitely does not feel great..."

New York: Scientific American/Farrar, Straus and Giroux. 2012. ISBN 9781429955102. Pagine 319. 8,78 €Due critiche principali a questo libro: Si tratta sostanzialmente di una raccolta di articoli già apparsi sulla rubrica che Jesse Bering (sì, afferma di essere un discendente del noto esploratore artico Vitus Jonassen Bering). Niente di male, naturalmente (anche se confesso di non amare questo tipo di raccolte: ma è una questione di gusto personale), a patto che tu abbia un buon editor. Questo prezioso aiuto a Bering è mancato, sicché il connettivo tra i capitoli è pressoché inesistente e alcuni sono decisamente meno riusciti di altri. In più, ho avuto la spiacevole impressione che la casa editrice avesse imposto una traguardo minimo in termini di numero di pagine e che questo abbia indotto a Bering a inserire capitoli che hanno ben poco a che fare con la tematica principale del libro (un’esplorazione della sessualità umana da una prospettiva di psicologia evoluzionistica). Per esempio, non ho proprio capito che c’azzecchi (per parafrasare Tonino Di Pietro) il capitolo Planting Roots with my Dead Mother, che – senza alcuna analisi scientifica – propone un nuovo tipo di cimitero alberato (proposta peraltro non particolarmente originale, come testimonia L’albero ed io, vecchia canzone di Francesco Guccini). Quando il mio ultimo giorno verrà dopo il mio ultimo sguardo sul mondo, non voglio pietra su questo mio corpo, perché pesante mi sembrerà. Cercate un albero giovane e forte, quello sarà il posto mio; voglio tornare anche dopo la morte sotto quel cielo che chiaman di Dio.Ed in inverno nel lungo riposo, ancora vivo, alla pianta vicino, come dormendo, starò fiducioso nel mio risveglio in un qualche mattino. E a primavera, fra mille richiami, ancora vivi saremo di nuovo e innalzerò le mie dita di rami verso quel cielo così misterioso. Ed in estate, se il vento raccoglie l’invito fatto da ogni gemma fiorita, sventoleremo bandiere di foglie e canteremo canzoni di vita. E così, assieme, vivremo in eterno qua sulla terra, l’albero e io sempre svettanti, in estate e in inverno contro quel cielo che dicon di Dio. Il tono di Bering, che vuole essere scherzoso, a volte è un po’ irritante. Per sua sfortuna, proprio in questi giorni è dilagata (insomma, sto esagerando…) una polemica su Science writing: lite and wrong sul blog di Jerry Coyne e, qualche giorno prima con Jonah Lehrer, Malcolm Gladwell and our thirst for non-threatening answers sul blog di Eric Garland. Coyne distingue, in bella sostanza, opere come The Better Angels of Our Nature, effettivi contribuiti alla comprensione pubblica della scienza, dai libri di “science-lite” che offrono analisi e soluzioni superficiali a problemi sociali o resoconti approssimativi di ricerche scientifiche. Forse Bering non è del tutto light, ma fatevi un’idea da soli:Se volete leggere altre recensioni ho preparato una pagina su Storify.* * *Come al solito, le mie annotazioni, che non siete obbligati a leggere. Riferimenti numerici all’edizione Kindle. According to a 2009 report in Medical Hypotheses by the anatomist Stany Lobo and his colleagues, each testicle continuously migrates in its own orbit as a way of maximizing the available scrotal surface area that is subjected to heat dissipation and cooling. Like ambient heat generated by individual solar panels, when it comes to spermatic temperatures, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. With a keen enough eye, presumably one could master the art of “reading” testicle alignment, using the scrotum as a makeshift room thermometer. But that’s just me speculating. [163] Evolution does not occur by design. The best way to think about most adaptations is in terms of cost/benefit ratios. I suspect that the foreskin provided protection of the glans and what you see is the result of a statistical compromise of sorts. [445] […] 76 percent of a sample of 235 female undergraduates from Australia reported having removed their pubic hair at some point in their lives. Sixty-one percent currently did so, and half of this sample said that they routinely removed all traces of their pubic hair. The current trend for men appears to be no different. [746] Gerard David, a prolific religious iconographer based in Bruges, Belgium, was merely painting a scene of starvation cannibalism. [765] Gerard David oceansbridge.com Better this evolutionary account than pimples by intelligent design, in any event. What a heartless God indeed that would wind up the clock so that our sebaceous glands might overindulge in sebum production precisely at the time in human development when we’d become most acutely aware of our appearance. [874] […] hindsight is twenty-twenty […] [2695] In many courtrooms across the Western world, for instance, defendants and witnesses must place their hand on the Bible and volunteer to respond to the religious oath “Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?” And in the ancient Hebrew world, there was the similar “oath by the thigh”—where “thigh” was the polite term for one’s dangling bits—since touching the sex organs before giving testimony was said to invoke one’s family spirits (who had a vested interest in the seeds sprung from these particular loins) and ensured that the witness wouldn’t perjure himself. [2779] “I love Humanity; but I hate people.” [2792: è una citazione di Edna St. Vincent Millay] […] there’s no such thing as a failed experiment—only data. [3290] Vohs and Schooler write: “If exposure to deterministic messages increases the likelihood of unethical actions, then identifying approaches for insulating the public against this danger becomes imperative.” Perhaps you missed it on your first reading too, but the authors are making an extraordinary suggestion. They seem to be claiming that the public “can’t handle the truth” and that we should somehow be protecting them (lying to them?) about the true causes of human social behaviors. [3355] The self is only a deluded creature that thinks it is participating in a moral game when in fact it is just an emotionally invested audience member. [3372]"
34,0374532923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43571237-mark-syron,3,"While the book was interesting, the essay is both filled with humor and fact, I found some parts odd and not fitting in. To start with, the essays didn't follow a flow. They just sucked together as each chapter goes in. Some things seem one-sided, like polyamory, which I personally can't get by for myself but don't care if others engage in it as long as concent goes all around in that type of relationship. Then there was the section on atheists. As one my self (and hell the author is one as he states) he rather trusts the theist rather than the atheist cause the theist has a sky daddy who watches over the theist. But then again theist are known to be cheaters just like atheists. Religion is just one factor. SOme atheist and theist have no morals, others do.Overall I liked the style of the book (I listened to this through the audiobook) and the narrator was a good voice. Full of tone and interest in the topic that is being presented (the narrator also happens to be the author so it is interesting to hear the voice and think that this is the guy who wrote the book)"

I purchased, and read, this on my Kobo, and now intend to purchase a paper copy so I can underline and write notes in the margins!Such a fun book.I have to admit that I skipped the chapter on cannibalism. I discovered I am simply not dispassionate enough about that particular subject to read it without frequent rises of acute nausea. (More colloquially, ""it made me want to hurl"". ) With that one notable exception, it's a delight to read. The book has some laugh-out-loud lines to which I gleefully subjected husband and any other innocent bystanders, and is at all times beautifully written. I love how he handles the language.And I loved the information. My magpie mind loved picking up all those shiny new bits of quirky things. So yes, off I go to the bookstore to get me a paper copy! And one for my son, who will also love it. Oh, and a couple of friends ... Five or more sales to one person, Mr. Bering. Well done!"
36,0374532923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69313297-jina,4,"I legitimately didn’t realize how much of the content was going to be about our human “bits”. Sure, you could point at the title, but I figured it was just a marketing tactic (and I mean, it worked) and that the book was more about the “other reflections on being human.” Granted, it does have “other” stuff, but the bulk of its content is definitely about human gonads in one way or another. However, that didn't keep its content from being really, really interesting! This is the stuff they don’t teach you in school (at least I wasn’t) and science is fascinating. I love learning “why” and Jesse Bering does a great job presenting the odd ends of being human. Jesse’s overall message about the main content of his book is: “People haven't any say whatsoever about what they respond to. But people do have considerably more control over what exactly they do”"

What does it feel like to want to kill yourself? Does ""free will"" really exist? And why is the penis shaped like that anyway?In Why Is the Penis Shaped Like That?, the research psychologist and award-winning columnist Jesse Bering features more than thirty of his most popular essays from Scientific American and Slate , as well as two new pieces, that take readers on a bold and captivating journey through some of the most taboo issues related to evolution and human behavior. Exploring the history of cannibalism, the neurology of people who are sexually attracted to animals, the evolution of human body fluids, the science of homosexuality, and serious questions about life and death, Bering astutely covers a generous expanse of our kaleidoscope of quirks and origins. With his characteristic irreverence and trademark cheekiness, Bering leaves no topic unturned or curiosity unexamined, and he does it all with an audaciously original voice. Whether you're interested in the psychological history behind the many facets of sexual desire or the evolutionary patterns that have dictated our current mystique and phallic physique, Why Is the Penis Shaped Like That? is bound to create lively discussion and debate for years to come.**"
39,0374532923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3941555-carlos,4,I couldn’t help but chuckle at the title of this book yet after reading a few of the essays I was hooked onto Bering’s irreverent but insightful style. His completely lay-friendly style also helped the reader follow his train of thought through quite counterintuitive arguments on everything from zoophilia to suicides. While clearly using humor to his advantage Bering also seeks to genuinely get the reader to think like an evolutionary psychologist and get them to question all the quirks of human behavior. In the end this was the most entertaining and illuminating approach to human sexuality that I’ve ever read.

That is, provided you have the stomach for a slimy journey into the raunchiest explorations of humankind. For example, did you know that human sperm is rich in happy hormones? The book is satisfyingly scientific and concludes with a somewhat out of place but still engrossing study of suicide. Did you know suicide is more common among people from better-off backgrounds who experience a fall from their pedestals? Guess we should watch out for our rich and famous friends."
41,0374532923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79427093-robin,2,"Initially, I wanted to read “Perv: The Sexual Deviant In All Of Us” by Jesse Bering, but this was the only book by him in stock. Like Bering, my mind is salacious so I expected to connect with him more than I did. In fact, I would say his pretentious vernacular and dull storytelling were the reasons I felt a sense of disconnection from his writing. 2.5 stars because there were some fun facts that were interesting enough, but not interesting enough to recommend this unnecessarily long (especially for a short book) read. "
42,0374532923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9206369-drew,3,"I enjoyed the topics and the humor with which Bering writes, but I couldn’t get over the form. These too-short articles were cobbled together from many different publications and at the end of the day they’re just too short for such interesting and juicy topics. Every time we’d start to get somewhere, I turned the page and the chapter was over. I look forward to reading Perv by this same author, as I think he’ll have the space and time to fully develop his ideas AND keep the audience at taut attention. "
43,0374532923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33733698-danni,3,"This was an entertaining set of essays intended to help bring the most intriguing set of scientific studies to the applied interests of readers. The book begins with mostly essays about sex, gender, and sexual preferences. This was followed by essays about death, suicide, and joy. The first essays were by far the most enjoyable. Sadly, the book begins to suffer towards the end. The essays were short and easy to understand. The author's sense of humor is endearing at the beginning but becomes tiresome after a while. I found myself losing interest in the topics and hearing the author mock himself as I went a long. It was an easy book to learn something from, just not my favorite title ever. I would say that this was an interesting book for book club, though. It sparked a great many hilarious and entertaining conversations. "
44,0374532923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5995202-isil-arican,3,"Some interesting information but most of it is highly dubious like every other evolutionary psychology claim.I thought this book would be funny, informative and thought provoking. Instead I read a book with some dry humor that tries to be funny ( because it is about penises ""teeeheeee!""), lot of wild claims about how a certain sexual behavior evolved and an erratically organized chapters that doesn't make too much sense. ( it jumped to coffins and death right after bunch of sexual evo-psych.)Overall not too terrible, some interesting information that you should read with a lot of grain of salt, and bad sense of humor. I read better books on the same subject, so three stars."
45,0374532923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4952272-kelly-whitt,4,"Continuing in my quest to listen to all the science audiobooks my library has, I came upon this one. I thought it would be like Why Do Men Have Nipples? but it was (not surprisingly) more sex based. Did you know a woman could conceivably (pun intended) get pregnant by a man she hasn’t had sex with? There’s plenty of interesting food for thought here, including how forests of the future could be the new graveyards. "
46,0374532923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61493922-eduardo-bello,5,"“As soon as the umbilical cord is cut, after all, we’re attached to another made of red tape, and that one grows longer with each passing year, so that we die tangled up in it in the end.”Jesse’s eloquence and wittiness is palpable in every paragraph. Such an interesting read for those who want to dive in in matters of human psychology (despite the tittle, topics do not surround sexuality exclusively)."
47,0374532923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7727416-christian-moore,2,"While funny and interesting, some of the topics may have been a bit taboo for my palate. If you’re interested at looking at the topic of sexuality from an evolutionary point of view, this might for you. But if slightly normalizing pedophilia and other taboo sexual preferences will bother you, skip this one."
48,0374532923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19258748-feng-ouyang,2,"I read the first two parts. The book purports to discuss interesting and little known science about the human body, especially those related to sex and reproduction. However, I found that those “little known” factoids are not interesting and, more importantly, do not offer larger scientific lessons such as research methodology. So I stopped reading."
49,0374532923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9107767-katie,2,"I had never heard of the term evolutionary psychology before and I found the ideas interesting. But the author's organization and sense of hum0r were annoying. He would reference research as a counter point before explaining what it was, instead simply saying we'll talk more about that later. I'd rather you explain the research first and then make your argument."
50,0374532923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3787227-jeremy-cox,4,"This book was pretty interesting, but I was hoping for something like The Vagina Bible with regards to the penis. The author is an evolutionary psychologist and not an MD so it makes sense. The topics seemed to vary considerably, and I was honestly hoping for a more functional description than a psychological understanding of sexual relations."
51,0374532923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7399130-lowrie,4,"I liked it! i think i liked Perv better, but it was more in depth so that makes sense. I liked the essay topic, and found myself surprised by a few chapters/essays - especially the one about green burial - not a topic i'd expect, but it made sense w/ the overall focus of the book!"
52,0374532923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/664207-lisa,4,"The author surely had a fun time inserting puns and phrases with multiple meanings through the text. This book was interesting, and it's easy to read a chapter or two when you have small bits of time. "
53,0374532923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1272470-sophie-rayton,2,"I thought this would be about other fun and interesting questions as well as talk about genitalia, but really it was all about sex and anatomy and when I got to the part about paedophiles I'd had enough."
54,0374532923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/106150965-mariah-pelletier,5,"It was a great comical approach to a lot of generally taboo subjects in science, specifically with the human body. It’s overall a good read, and i would suggest reading the scientific literature he pulls i formation from for subjects you are interested in. "
55,0374532923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/113890267-lenny,4,"If you are ""interested"" in the weird questions proposed in the title you probably already know a good lot of the information in it but it's nice to have a refresher. The flow is a bit awkward but otherwise an interesting light read."
56,0374532923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6054670-april,5,"Audiobook narrated by the author, hilarious! Loved the humor, loved the science. Some topics were far less interesting to me, but overall I thoroughly enjoyed this book. "
57,0374532923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5984598-jessica-lave,3,"Interesting essays, but the topics were too numerous for the author to delve too deep into, so I was left with more questions instead of giving a sort of trivia-style knowledge. "
58,0374532923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51600176-rachelle,3,Didn't finish it more so about sexuality rather than the functions of male sex organs
59,0374532923,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5446617-mounir-bashour,3,An interesting book written from an evolutionary psychology biology stance. Humorous and good.
