In this book Mlodinow talks about the major leaps of mankind and how they came about.Primitive humans were hunter-gatherers/Modern humans are tech savvyMlodinow focuses on three areas: evolution of the human mind; discoveries related to astronomy, physics, chemistry, and biology; and the revolutionary field of quantum mechanics. The book, which covers a wide array of topics, can't be summarized in a short review...and I won't try. I'd just strongly encourage anyone interested in the topic of human advancement to read the book themselves. It's exceptionally well written, has loads of fascinating information, and (against all odds) is VERY funny. The author has a great sense of humor and includes lots of humorous quips and examples throughout the book.Just for fun, I'll mention a few things in the book that I found particularly memorable.One of the most important human discoveries occurred when some cavewoman (or man) - banging a couple of rocks together - accidently produced a shard with a sharp edge....the first knife! This helped early humans, who were mostly vegetarians, expand their diet to include more meat. It made a good weapon as well. In any case, these sharpened rocks apparently helped us get much more clever.I was surprised to learn that Sir Isaac Newton, who discovered the laws of motion, wasn't a nice guy at all. He worked constantly, shunned human interaction, and was very vengeful toward people who disagreed with him or criticized his research. If someone angered Newton he would write lots of nasty letters and viciously criticize them in scientific journals. You wouldn't want to get on the wrong side of this genius!Charles Darwin, who at the age of 22 bravely undertook his extensive voyage on the Beagle, was a physical wreck by the age of 30. Poor Darwin was so sick that he sometimes couldn't work for months at a time. The biologist visited many doctors and tried innumerable remedies, but nothing helped. (My own theory is that Darwin picked up a parasite on his trip.) Still Darwin married and had lots of children. He also carried on (through the pain) for many years to develop his theory of evolution. (Yay!)The book's author, Leonard Mlodinow, specializes in theoretical physics but had to learn some applied physics as well. For one such class young Mlodinow had to build a radio from scratch. As the author describes it, the radio only got one unpopular station.... and only worked when he held it upside down and shook it. (Ha ha ha.)Leonard MlodinowI completely enjoyed the book and highly recommend it to anyone interested in science. You can follow my reviews at http://reviewsbybarbsaffer.blogspot.com/"
1,0307908232,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,4,"This is an engaging book by an excellent author. I've read a few of his books and they have all been excellent. This book is sort of a history of science. Not a complete history--there is no attempt to make it comprehensive.The book covers physics, chemistry, biology, and quantum mechanics. It is filled with anecdotes and interesting stories that help make the scientists come alive. The book is also about Mlodinow's father, a holocaust survivor. When his father was in a concentration camp, he had conversations with another prisoner, a mathematician. The mathematician gave Mlodinow's father puzzles to solve. He couldn't solve one puzzle, so he asked the mathematician for the answer. But in return for the solution to the puzzle, the mathematician demanded a crust of bread--the daily ration in a place where prisoners were starving to death! And Mlodinow's father gave his bread in return for the solution, a tribute to man's curiosity and thirst for knowledge! I listened to this book as an audiobook, narrated by the author. Unfortunately, Mlodinow reads his book in a stilted manner--it would have been better if a professional actor had read it."
2,0307908232,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3897817-morgan-blackledge,4,"Upright Thinkers by Leonard Moldinow is in part, an attempt to explain the history of science to his father, a holocaust survivor with a 7th grade education (see page 1).Moldinow is particularly good at explaining science in a way that is fun and engaging.He's essentially writing to his beloved father. He's making it so his dad could get it. Not in a condescending way. Not at all. Moldinow's writing is smart and he clearly relates to his audience as if we're smart too. But just perhaps lacking the rich education a professional scientist gets as part of their training. So that's what this book is. He's making the world of science accessible to an ordinary audience. And it's a wonderful thing.The book begins with a story of Moldinow's father in a Nazi concentration camp. Apparently his father was approached by a fellow inmate, an accomplished mathematician, and given a mathematical riddle to solve.Moldinow's father labored over the riddle for days but couldn't solve it. He finally resorted to bribing the mathematician for the answer with a crust of bread (a days food ration).The mathematician accepted the food (a total dick move) in exchange for the answer to the riddle (which incidentally was Pi).Considering that Moldinow's father was quite literally starving to death, the willingness to trade food for knowledge speaks volumes about what actually motivates us humans. The anecdote also foreshadows the subtext of the book. That great scientists can be total dicks, or at least eccentric and ballsy enough to ask questions that others just don't or simply won't.Upright Thinkers tracks the history of science, reaching all the way back to our pre human ancestry. After we meet Aristotle in Ancient Greece, the story subdivides into brief histories of early physics, chemistry, biology and quantum mechanics.The story of each sub-field is told via biographical vignettes of some of the more prominent characters who contributed to each sub-field. Incidentally, they tend to be total dicks (with some notable exceptions). Moldinow puts it nicely when he says ""we tend to shun people who do not blend well with others. But it is those who are different who often see what others do not"".And that's pretty much what the book is about. It's the story of science, and the eccentric, oftentimes course people who advanced it.Physics:Moldinow breezes through the history of physics, from Pythagoras to Aristotle, Copernicus And the to the set up with Galileo, and finally to the spike with Isaac Newton (who was a total dick).Newton was a total outcast nerd, and a total dick to boot. He worked almost exclusively in solitude. Apparently he had invented the calculus and it was just sitting in his papers. One day one of his bros, sir Edmond Haley (of Haley's comet fame) asked him about a problem he was having understanding the orbit of planets, and Newton said oh yeah, I already solved that one, it's in my desk somewhere, I'll have to dig it up. And like four months later Haley gets a letter in the mail, and not only did it explain the orbit of planets in perfect mathematical detail, but it was an entirely new form of mathematics that could be used to understand motion and change more generally i.e. a little piece of intellectual property called the Calculus (you may have heard of it).So Haley shits his pants and says hey Newton, can I publish this? And Newton shot back that he needed to make a few corrections, and the result was the three volume Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Latin for ""Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy"") or simply The Principia for short.The Principia states Newton's laws of motion, forming the foundation of classical mechanics, also Newton's law of universal gravitation, and a derivation of Kepler's laws of planetary motion.Basically, The Principia rocked the scientific establishment from the basement to the attic. Pincipia was so fucking good that Newton's bitter (and I mean BITTER) arch rival Robert Hooke called it ""the most important discovery in nature since the world's creation"".That's like Fox News admitting that Barak Obama was the single greatest man in human history.That's how utterly overwhelmingly fucking good Principia was.Newton's laws remained the fundamental organizing principals of physics until Einstein dropped Special Relativity over 250 years later. But more like when Heisenberg dropped his uncertainty principle a little after that. You get the picture. Newton's shit was dominant for like over two and a half centuries.For those aware of the halflife of most scientific ""truths"", that is for all intents and proposes an eternity.Chemistry:Moldinow begins his history of chemistry with a brief tour of alchemy, then on to Paracelsus (who was a total dick too).Paracelsus:Born Philippus Aureolus Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim, was a Swiss German Renaissance doctor, botanist, alchemist, astrologer, and general occultist. He took the name Para-Celsus because the greatest physician of the time was named Celsus, and Para (meaning ""close to"" or in this case ""better than"") Celsus was his way of saying I'm better than Celsus.Ballsy!That's like calling your band Better Than Led Zepplin. That's hella gangster right?Your shit better be really fucking good if your going to call for the ball like that. And basically, Paracelsus's shit was really fucking good. So the name stuck. He invented a bunch of rad stuff but his big deal was that he invented Laudanum, a tincture of opium i.e. morphine.That's right, Paracelsus invented smack (and the Junky in one foul swoop) Or para-smack (in this case para meaning not quite as good but close enough).Anyway. Laudanum was a HUGE hit (no pun intended) and basically revolutionized pain management (including existential pain management if you catch my drift). Anyway, Paracelsus was also known as a revolutionary for insisting upon observing nature via experiments and shit rather than just looking to ancient Galenic texts. This made him a fuck ton of enemies in the conservative establishment and he caught hella shit for his progressive beliefs. The more push back he got, the more stubborn and independent (dickish) he became. Until his name essentially became synonymous with progressive reform (righteous dickishness).But Paracelsus wasn't the real father of modern chemistry, another total dick was.Dmitri Mendeleev:He was writing a text book on chemistry, and he wanted to make it really really good. So he was trying to figure out how to arrange the chapters. But that lead to a more fundamental question of how to arrange chemicals in general. This problem bugged the shit out of him. So he just kept fucking around with the arrangement of the known chemicals of his day, and he pretty much stumbled upon arranging them by atomic weight.He knew he was on to something, but there were these huge gaps in the matrix that made the whole table look fucked up and wrong. But he was such a dick that he insisted that these were undiscovered chemical elements. He even predicted what the missing elements would weigh and what they would look like. And he turned out to be right. Wow!Some other dude discovered one of the missing elements but it was a different atomic weight than Mendeleev had predicted. So Mendeleev wrote the guy an angry missive demanding that he redo his analysis, so the guy did just to shut Mendeleev up, and Mendeleev turned out to be right. FUCK!That's fucking AWESOME right?The periodic table became the organizing principal of chemistry. Still is.....Word!Biology:Moldinow somewhat apologetically explains that biology lagged behind the other sciences because:""for biology to grow [as a science] it had to overcome the natural human tendencies to feel that we are special and that deities and/or magic govern the world"".So true. As it turns out, the real dicks in this case were not the biologists, but the naysayers e.g. the theologians, clergy and the old school scholars etc. Anyway. The obvious Newton or Mendeleev of biology is Charles Darwin. His theory of Evolution via Natural Selection is (like Newtons laws, and Mendeleev's periodic table) the organizing principal of biology (and now, increasingly psychology, which is in my humble opinion, simply a sub-discipline of biology any way).While Darwin wasn't quite a dick, in fact, he was supposed to be pretty fuckin' cool, he did almost do a total dick thing to this guy Wallis who almost scooped Darwin with the theory. Anyway, they talked it out and Wallis conceded the theory to Darwin and they actually agreed to share the credit and Darwin got all the credit but they were still friends. Not really that dickish. I guess biologists tend to be pretty nice guys. Apparently biology didn't produce its first authentic total dick till Richard Dawkins, but he's not really mentioned in the book. Quantum Mechanics:Okay. Not everyone in science is a dick or an eccentric. According to Moldinow, ""there are plenty of ordinary people asking ordinary questions, and most of them will do just fine. But the most successful researchers are often the ones who ask the odd questions. For their trouble, they will be considered crazy until the time comes when they're considered geniuses"".Certainly the post classical physics era is defined by these oddball types. Max Plank and Albert Einstein come to mind. But the book focuses on Niels Bohr (who was much more of an eccentric thinker than a dick).Bohr:Discovered the structure of the atom, which turned out to be much weirder than anyone has previously thought, and completely outside of Newtonian conventions. Based on his discoveries of atomic structure, he reworked Mendeleev's periodic table of elements from ordering by atomic weight to ordering by atomic number. Based on his new system, in the tradition on Mendeleev, Bohr predicted the existence of yet more undiscovered elements, and also discovered that Mendeleev had been wrong about a couple of his calculations of elements. Bohr got Mendeleev at his own game. Zing! In 2015 It's easy to be flip about all of this quantum stuff, but if you think about it. The concepts and mathematics of all of this are extremely difficult to learn, even after it's all been figured out and laid out in a textbook, with an instructor telling you how to do it, not to mention with calculators, computers, and the internet, and YouTube and all of that stuff.The dudes who discovered this shit did it from scratch, with fucking pencils and paper and some shitty experiments.It's really astounding.No wonder pretty much only extreme characters make the cut. That's obviously what it takes to do this kind of work. Heisenberg:It's not that Heisenberg had a particularly off center character. But the man conceived of an entirely unintuitive, entirely novel conception of reality. And it turned out to be spot on. Actually true. Think about that for a second.If you don't think that's boss, tell me.What the fuck have you done? I think my personal greatest invention was the word ""lezbro"". It is a name for guys who befriend and generally prefer the company of lesbians. Nearly 10 years after it's inception, It has been mentioned on Ellen Degeneres's web sight, and I think you can google it.Can I prove that I invented the word. No. So that's my contribution to society.Anyway Heisenberg pretty much discovered a strange, new, complexly alien, sub atomic world. Using math. Before he was 30. Heisenberg's thing was so way the fuck out, that even Einstein was like fuck it. I can't deal with this. And he pretty much never recovered. He basically quit working at the cutting edge of physics from that moment on. Heisenberg's work transformed Einstein into an old fart. Like poof!But Heisenberg's thing was right. It was so right that it blew Newton's thing into the basement. It was a radical new frontier.Drop the mic.....errrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.But more importantly, was Heisenberg a dick?The answer is, kind of, yes.He was at least a Nazi tolerator, if not supporter, if not the full blown real deal.But he rocked a pencil, and the iPhone that I'm writing this on is a direct result of his work.In Conclusion:This was an intensely pleasurable summer read. I highly recommend it. And I highly recommend all of Moldinow's other books. There all great fun. You can't go wrong with this guy. Get it. Read it. You'll love it.."
3,0307908232,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5237420-ana,5,"Big science book that goes over important points in our human development, starting with prehistory and ending with Heisenberg. I was a little bit dumbfounded that almost nothing was mentioned of the big thinkers in astrophysics, but hey, maybe it wasn't planned all along. It goes through early astronomy, mathematics, chemistry, biology and physics and its huge forwarders, but has almost no mention of modern astronomy - which is a loss, in my opinion. Still, it gets 5 stars - not only is it concisely written, this author is one of the funny ones, and I laughed out loud many times during this book. Recommended for geeks. This shit is like cocaine to us."
4,0307908232,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1701553-carlos,4,"I loved this book. The Science was explained in easy language, anyone can benefit from this book. The humor of the author translates into the book and makes it more palatable . The first half of the book is more easy to understand than the last one tough, This book enters murky waters when it start dealing with quantum physics (its approach is a little advanced), but other than that the book is very approachable and written in layman terms. I recommend it to anyone to who has an interest in science, biology, physics or mathematics."
5,0307908232,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18669840-aziz-alkattan,5,"One of the most inspirational books I've read in my life. The book outlines the lives and achievements of various scientists, from Aristotle and Galileo to Schrodinger and Einstein. ‏ what all these scientists and creative thinkers have in common is that even in the face of unsurmountable obstacles, they worked hard to achieve their goals. Even when people told them that they were crazy and that their ideas were ridiculous, they perseveredI'm so happy to be in the scientific field, and I love that I'm able to call myself a scientist. To be part of such a privilege group of people that look at the world and try to decipher it's mysteries is an honor and a privilege. I truly recommend this book, not just to nerds like me, but anyone who needs a little inspiration"
6,0307908232,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32717494-venky,4,"I sincerely wish Leonard Mlodinow comes out with a students' edition of this remarkable book. This is a book that needs to be made prescribed, if not compulsory reading for every student who has taken up Science and every other student who wished he had taken up the subject. Covering within its sweep themes such as evolutionary biology, theoretical and quantum physics and chemistry, Mlodinow's magnificent tour de force traces the cultural, social, sociological, and scientific evolution of man. The journey covering millions and millions of years introduces the awe-inspired reader to pioneering personalities who have changed the course of the world with their stupendous inventions and discoveries. These colossal figures beginning with the prodigious Aristotle and concluding with maestros such as Stephen Hawking demonstrated to the world in their own fundamentally simple fashion that all it takes to alter the course of history is an unfettered curiosity to question. Uprooting the conventional and debating the stereotypical is what fosters genuine progress in most of the social as well as physical sciences.The astounding examples of Dmitri Mendeleev, Charles Darwin, Werner Heisenberg et al furnished ample testimony to the qualities of patience and perseverance. Their exploits undoubtedly serve as irresistible inspiration to every aspiring individual striving to make a mark in his chosen field of profession. Mlodinow himself is a theoretical physicist of some repute. The deft and dexterity with which he manages to condense the import of esoteric subjects into extraordinarily lucid and conceptual language is the biggest highlight of the book. The moving tribute paid by the author to his late father (a survivor of Nazi atrocities) makes for a memorably moving passage that begs re-reading. ""The Upright Thinkers"" - has the potential to be an enduring Masterpiece!"
7,0307908232,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4177031-troy-blackford,5,"This was a remarkable book synthesizing many fields and filtering its analysis through the very human perspective and voice of its author. An incredible journey filled with interest both human and scientific. A profound and vital series of discoveries. I strongly recommend this book, even to those who are already familiar (as I was) with most of the scientific ground covered. The perspective it gives you on the evolution of human understanding is both humbling and empowering."
8,0307908232,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1533440-al-bit,5,"An amiable and quite readable excursion into a kind of explanatory history of the development of certain types of thinking is presented here for your reading pleasure!Mlodinow is a gentle guide: he uses the trope of providing an explanation of his fascination with physics as if he were talking to his (now deceased) father — by trying to “explain” to a non-physicist how and why he considers physics so important for humanity’s understanding of our physical world. Thus, for me, the intention of this book is to open up insights into what might be a vague subject for the ordinary reader, and in my opinion, the author does a pretty good job of it.Mlodinow’s journey takes us from just about the year dot — or at least from the time of Homo habilis — right up to the beginning of the 21st-c CE, and all in less than 300 pages… so it is rather obvious that some serious selection process is required as to what to include and what to exclude. The originating place is the human race’s curiosity about the world it inhabits, and how it initially reacted and responded to that world. The main “anchoring” device, of course, confines it as much as is possible to the physical world, so as a rule, anything which is not directly or indirectly relatable to this aspect of our intellectual development is gently (but ruthlessly) relegated as surplus to requirements. Some readers might find this problematic, especially if they are expecting a more holistic history. But then I would suggest that their concerns might not be really fair to the author or his work.The technique used for the grand narrative of this book can be considered as a type of “just-so” story, and as such its main concern is to explain more or less precisely just how our thinking about physics developed to what it is today. As such it becomes a rather exciting and thrilling tale. That’s what makes it a great read!By the same token, “just-so” stories, especially when they are tied in with history, should give the reader cause for concern as to the basic assumptions that underlie such “histories”.One such assumption is that time progresses purely linearly [it may well be that in certain circumstances it is cyclical, for example; a consequence of the linear approach tends to make one think that “earlier” attempts at dealing with the world are considered “wrong”— when perhaps a better phrase would be “no longer appropriate”] ; another is that our advances are, in fact, progressive [or are we going the “wrong” way? — and maybe we won’t know if or when another “more appropriate” approach might occur]. Nor, perhaps, is adequate consideration given to human, social, religious and other historical accidents and/or events at certain periods of time, which either accelerated or hindered “progress” along certain lines… Furthermore, the parallel lines of development of many other technologies and mathematical devices which permitted us to advance in certain ways in the past, may themselves be subject to re-consideration of “more appropriate” technologies and mathematics to give us a completely different picture and a new world-view. And so it goes.The problem with these “problems” is that addressing each will result with different “just-so” narratives, each of which might be just as valid and as exciting — stimulating! — as this work is. So, bearing in mind the above caveats, accept and appreciate it for what it is, rather than what it is not. You won’t be disappointed."
9,0307908232,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,3,"Leonard Mlodinow is probably best known as co-author of a pair of books with Stephen Hawking (for example, The Grand Design), so it was interesting to see his writing away from the great man's shadow. Generally his style is light, slick and enjoyable, though he sometimes tries too hard to be witty, peppering the book with a jokiness that gets wearing. I could do with a little less of remarks likeThe first cities did not arise suddenly as if nomads one day decided to band together and the next thing they knew they were hunting and gathering chicken thighs wrapped in Styrofoam and cellophane.However, what we have here is an easy reading and a sometimes inspiring gallop through the development of human thought and science. As the subtitle puts it 'The human journey from living in trees to understanding the cosmos.'It's interesting to compare this book with Steven Weinberg's To Explain the World, which has related aims, though without the first part about the development of humans. Without doubt Mlodinow's book is by far the more readable. And Weinberg has been slated in some sources for being unforgiving of the lack of modern insights in the likes of Aristotle, where arguably they should be allowed to be people of their time. But for me, Weinberg delivers a more challenging and stimulating read. Even so, Mlodinow's book is certainly more of a natural read for a popular science audience.The Upright Thinkers is divided into three sections, and for me the beginning and end work far better than the middle. As an author, I can see the sense behind the low point being the middle section, but the worry might be that some could give up part way through. The first part shone brightest for me. This is the most original section, with really interesting consideration of the very early development of maths and culture. Despite that intrusive Styrofoam, I challenge anyone not to find this section genuinely fascinating. In the middle we plod rather heavy handedly through the likes of Galileo and Newton. Then things liven up with quantum theory (oddly there is very little about understanding the cosmos per se). There isn't a huge opportunity to gain insights into quantum physics itself, but there is plenty of context and a good feel for the way that modern science has moved away from hands on science to the indirect and theoretical. Like Weinberg, one of Mlodinow's failings is not putting across the best understanding of history of science. He doesn't seem to realise, for instance, that Newton's 'If I have seen further' comment in a letter to Robert Hooke was not supposed to be a compliment. And, yes, there's the hackneyed old claim that Giordano Bruno was burned at the stake for the heresy of declaring 'that the earth revolved around the sun.' (He wasn't, it was common or garden religious heresy.) And, for that matter, the family of Gilbert Lewis will be surprised to discover that Max Born introduced the term 'photon'.Overall then, a solid overview with some interesting novelties on early civilisation, but probably more a book for those who don't generally read popular science than those who do - and that's not a bad thing. "
10,0307908232,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3289008-steven,4,"A very readable and fascinating history of humankind's relationship with science and the long path of discovery which has lead to the understanding of the universe we now possess. Split into 3 sections - the thousands of years of pre-history and early civilization leading to the scientific revolution; the hundreds of years in which science came of age; and the more recent past in which our world has been altered unimaginably by quantum physics and high technology - Mlodinow shows how our world is built on an accumulation of knowledge (""standing on the shoulders of giants"") which has accelerated exponentially during humanity's brief reign on Earth.Having read quite a lot of science history type books, there wasn't too much which I found new in The Upright Thinkers (compared to, for example, Yuval Noah Harari's Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind), but I would heartily recommended to anyone with an interest in the subject. Essentially, this is what I call a meze book - a variety of delicious bite size pieces from which you might find a love of olives or an addiction to houmous or, in this case, reading more in-depth books about Socratic thought or Newton's discoveries or Darwinian theory."
11,0307908232,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8530205-marty-fried,3,"I thought this started off interesting, talking about what makes humans different from other animals - about our ability to ask questions and seek answers about why things are the way they are. But eventually, I felt it got too bogged down in science, especially about the many obscure and known scientists and how they contributed to the subjects. I don't have a lot of formal education in most of the sciences he discussed, and I didn't really learn much, just a lot of details about how various things were discovered. Perhaps with more formal science education, I might have enjoyed reading about the people who made it all happen.The author did do a good job of making some of the things interesting, and adding some humor here and there. Perhaps it would have been better to have read the actual hardcopy book instead of electronic version, so I could skim over material easier. But as it was, the more I read, the more I just wanted to finish the book and get on to something more interesting."
12,0307908232,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5130906-mikael-lind,4,"A very enthralling read! This is the book on natural science and physics that I've always wanted to read. It's extremely engaging, and despite dealing with ideas too grand for my own knowledge, Mlodinow manages to present them in such a way that you as a reader get a glimpse of what they're about anyway. It's a great resource to be able to explain difficult ideas with simple language.The book is an exposé of human thinking. It goes back to the earliest humans, and tries to explain how our fascination with knowing how everything works came about. It's a real page-turner, which is not common for books dealing with these subjects. (Some books that are not page-turners are of course also good, in their own right, but take more time to get through.)Two things that I feel are lacking in this book are perhaps these: 1) More of an analysis of why scientific breakthrough often originate in some countries and not others, and whether this is about to change or not. 2) An attempt to try to discuss the gender issue here, i.e. why so many scientists still are men. There's a small section on one female scientist, with some discussion, but I would have wanted more, since men constitute only 50% of the human race.The personal side of the book, where Leonard Mlodinow retells discussions on physics and more that he had with his father, are great. When he connects the story to Hitler and human evil (the holocaust and persecution of the Jews), you start thinking that, yeah, humans can be great thinkers, but they can be absolute scum as well. So now I feel I want to read something on sociology, dealing with questions of human evil. Or perhaps I should read Pinker's The Better Angels of our Nature, to try to start thinking positively again."
13,0307908232,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8351117-justin-powell,4,"Good book, but would have been more enjoyable if more of the ""story"" was new information to me. Would be a great introduction to many people, though. "
14,0307908232,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4276871-anders-brabaek,4,"This is basically a science history book starting from the early humanoids, and ending with modern day science. When it comes to modern times, Mlodinow focuses predominantly on physics. As that, it is an excellent, and wonderful book (just as the other books by Mlodinow). At the end of the book, Mlodinow promotes a rather weak argument for why physics is where the most explosive issues are to be found. In this case he probably should had emphasized “remember who is talking – a physicist”. Mlodinow adds spice to the history by putting it in perspective to his father’s live and his father’s perspective to this history of science. Mlodinow succeeds in making this work but he is walking a thin line, where you may find it more for the writer’s sake than the reader. This book could also be described as what happens when a physicist rewrites Bill Brysons ""A Short History of Nearly Everything"", and appears mildly inspired by Bertrand Russells' ""A History of Western Philosophy"". Compared to Brysons’ bestseller, Mlodinow does a better job on the science part, and is sharper when he occasionally dwells deeper on philosophy of science. But in its genre, “A Short History of Nearly Everything” is a difficult book to compete with, and even though Mlodinow is an excellent author according to my taste, it is all but impossible not to compare the two books, and here Brysons writing style makes the difference. Even if this book has a very close relative in “A Short History of Nearly Everything”, it is still, in my opinion a nice addition worth reading."
15,0307908232,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19008054-lukas-dufka,3,"An enjoyable primer on the history of science. Particularly strong in its meticulous tracing of how our minds changed in response to new inventions and discoveries, and illustrating how these came about by initially haphazard process of accumulation, which grew only ever so slightly more systematic with the passing of centuries, until we reached the point where modern science is today. The methodical approach by which this is achieved is, nevertheless, often at the expense of the sense of awe and adventure, that one finds on the pages of Sagan or Tyson. On the other hand, Mlodinow does have a keen eye for interesting anectodes and sounds more like a witty friend, than a professor, which makes his prose amusing and easy to read. Gets quite heavy on physics in the final third of the book, though, so don't expect much discussion of DNA or space exploration; nevertheless I'd say that Mlodinow deals most adeptly with the areas he chooses to address. "
16,0307908232,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45472407-julia,5,"I think that this is a book that everyone in high school should read. Mlodinow writes in a way that even a middleschooler could understand a comprehensive history of physics, biology, and chemistry. I think it's super important that we take advantage of all of this knowledge that's in easy reach. This book is fun to read and uses humor in a way that I would never expect from a book about the history of science. And I think I could easily read this book again and come away with new things that I didn't pick up the first time. I think it's super exciting to be able to read a book knowing that I've just learned in 300pages what took thousands of years to discover. What I find as highschool physics you couldn't possibly explain to the top scientists of the 1800s and I think that's the most amazing thing ever. "
17,0307908232,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4605502-david-melbie,5,"This is easily the most readable book on the history of science one could ever find. And funny, too. I admire the way the author interjects and blends his own story into the whole, especially how he shared his father's wisdom, such as it was, to help the story further."
18,0307908232,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27613955-ashley-reid,2,"This was an interesting book to begin with, but unfortunately it couldn't keep my attention for long. After the first few chapters I didn't want to keep reading, but continued hoping that it would improve. It didn't."

20,0307908232,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,4,"The Upright Thinkers: The Human Journey from Living in Trees to Understanding the Cosmos by Leonard Mlodinow“The Upright Thinkers"" is an enjoyable tour through the history of science. Best-selling author and a physicist, Leonard Mlodinow takes the reader on a fun journey that begins with the evolution of the human brain and ends with our excursion into quantum mechanics. This excellent 352-page book is divided into the following three majors parts: I. The Upright Thinkers, II. The Sciences, and III. Beyond the Human Senses. Positives:1.	A well-written, high-quality effort. 2.	Enjoyable and accessible book for the masses. Mlodinow’s engaging style is warm and inviting. 3.	An excellent topic, a journey through science history. “This book is an effort to describe the development of science in that spirit—as an intellectual as well as a culturally determined enterprise, whose ideas can best be understood by an examination of the personal, psychological, historical, and social situations that molded them.”4.	Good format, the book is broken out into three time periods: millions of years ago with the evolution of our brains, centuries ago to the hard sciences, and finally decades ago to the new realm of existence known as quantum physics. 5.	The fascinating look at the evolution of our brains. “No one knows exactly how our ancestors’ brains were organized into functional components, but even in the modern human brain, far more than half the neurons are devoted to motor control and the five senses. That part of our brain that sets us apart from “lower” animals, on the other hand, is relatively small, and was late in coming.”6.	A tour of major discoveries. “And so it happened that roughly two million years ago, a Homo habilis Einstein, or a Madame Curie, or—perhaps more likely—several ancient geniuses working independently of one another, made humankind’s first momentous discovery: if you smash one stone into another at an oblique angle, you can flake off a sharp, knife-edged shard of rock.”7.	Fun facts spruced throughout the book. “…brains, which account for only about 2 percent of our body weight, consume about 20 percent of our calorie intake.”8.	A look at culture and related topics. “‘Culture’ is defined as behavior, knowledge, ideas, and values that you acquire from those who live around you, and it is different in different places.” 9.	 The first cities of our species. “Perhaps the most prominent of those cities, and an important force in the trend toward urbanization, was the great walled city of Uruk, in what is today southeastern Iraq, near the city of Basra.”10.	The interaction between religion and state. “Mesopotamians did not make the distinction we do between church and state—in Mesopotamia, they were inseparable.” “And so religion became not just the belief system that held society together, but the executive power that enforced rules. What’s more, due to the fear of the gods, religion was a useful tool in motivating obedience.”11.	Find out when and where the first written word occurred. The evolution of language and mathematics.12.	A look at the origins of law. “That set of human civil and criminal laws is called the Code of Hammurabi. It is named for the reigning Babylonian king, whom the great god Marduk commanded to ‘bring about the rule of righteousness in the land, to destroy the wicked and evildoers.’” “The Code of Hammurabi was issued about a year before Hammurabi’s death, in 1750 B.C.”13.	A look at a new rational approach to knowledge. “But the greatest aspect of the Greek culture that Alexander brought with him had nothing to do with arts or administration. It was what he had learned firsthand from Aristotle: a new, rational approach to the struggle to know our world, a magnificent turning point in the history of human ideas. And Aristotle himself was building on the ideas of several generations’ worth of scientists and philosophers who had begun to challenge the old verities about the universe.”14.	The great Isaac Newton, “In fact, one might say that Isaac Newton’s central contribution in creating physics as we know it today was his invention of a unified mathematical approach that could be used to describe all change, whatever its nature.”15.	Scientific progress. “That characteristic of Aristotle’s analysis—his search for purpose—had a huge influence on later human thought. It would endear him to many Christian philosophers through the ages, but it impeded scientific progress for nearly two thousand years, for it was completely incompatible with the powerful principles of science that guide our research today. When two billiard balls collide, the laws that were first set forth by Newton—not a grand underlying purpose—determine what happens next.”16.	The Renaissance. “It was the inventors and engineers who transformed European society and culture in late medieval Europe, a period concurrent with the first stirrings of the Renaissance, which spanned roughly from the fourteenth to the seventeenth centuries.” 17.	 The industrial revolution. “The direct results of the collaborations of science and industry include the steam engine, advances in the harnessing of water power for use in factories, the development of machine tools, and, later, the appearance of railroads, the telegraph and the telephone, electricity, and the lightbulb.”18.	A look at the development and discovery of scientific laws. “Lavoisier later turned his observations into one of the most famous laws in science, the law of conservation of mass: the total mass of products produced in a chemical reaction must be the same as the mass of the initial reactants. This was perhaps the greatest milestone in the journey from alchemy to modern chemistry: the identification of chemical change as the combining and recombining of elements.”19.	Scientific pioneers and much more.20.	The quantum world.21.	Notes included.Negatives:1.	One of the most difficult challenges of writing such an ambitious book is keeping an even flow. The book is a bit uneven, spending much more time in some areas while less in others. 2.	Limited number of illustrations and diagrams that would have complemented the excellent narrative.3.	Surprisingly, very little on the cosmos.4.	Some good scientific tidbits but not as much as expected.5.	No formal bibliography.6.	I’m a big fan of Mlodinow but let’s face it this very good book does not live up to his superior Subliminal.In summary, I enjoyed this book. Mlodinow is a great author that brings complex scientific topics to the masses. He succeeds in providing the public with a fun journey of the history of science. I look forward to more books like this. I recommend it! Further recommendations: “""The Grand Design"" and ""War of the Worldviews: Science Vs. Spirituality"" coauthored by this same author were excellent, “Farewell to Reality: How Modern Physics Has Betrayed the Search for Scientific Truth” by Jim Baggott, “Spectrums” by David Blatner, “The Elegant Universe” and “Hidden Reality” by Brian Greene, “A Universe From Nothing” by Lawrence M. Krauss, “About Time” by Adam Frank, “Higgs Discovery” and “Warped Passages” by Lisa Randall, “The Quantum Universe” by Brian Cox, “The Blind Spot” by William Byers, and “The Fallacy of Fine-Tuning” and “God and the Atom” by Victor Stenger.

21,0307908232,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13776613-tanvir-sady,4,"Its another book on the history of science and scientific protagonists throughout the ages. The writer is a born storyteller. While reading the book, it would seem to you that you and the writer is having a lively conversation about such a topic over a cups of coffee and cigarettes.The writer, a well-known physicist, informs us that the developments in science are initiated each time by an initially strange seemed idea which neither gets social recognition nor gets support to grow further. Sometimes in the history of science, the most unorthodox, the out-of-box idea changed the course of the mindset of people. Another interesting idea stroke me in this book is that 'a Truth does not possess only one version rather it has different versions of its own depending on the circumstances'. This idea was enumerated by a puzzle at the end of the book. I would like to quote it here from the book......""There is an old brainteaser about a monk who one day leaves hismonastery at sunrise to hike up to a temple at the summit of a tallmountain. The mountain has just one path, quite narrow and winding,and he takes it slow at times, as sections of it are rather steep, but hereaches the temple shortly before sunset. The next morning, he descendsalong the path, again beginning at sunrise, and reaches his monasteryagain at sunset. The question is: Is there a spot along the path that hewill come to at exactly the same time on both days? The point is not toidentify the spot, only to say whether there is one—or not. ""I hope anyone having a bit of curiosity and love for lucid storytelling about ideas, will definitely appreciate the book."
22,0307908232,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3321431-kadri,5,"I liked this book a lot. There's a lot of history of physics, a lot of it modern, some Newtonian. There's also bits of history of chemistry. Just a little bit though, probably to make sure that the reader wouldn't get too excited about chemistry and forget about physics. And then there's also the beginning of the book that is about evolution. All in all it's a nice mixture, although it's in most parts physics :). I find it interesting how Mlodinow went into great lengths in writing about the different approaches that Heisenberg, Schrödinger and others took to quantum mechanics....More here"
23,0307908232,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52290871-jeremy,5,"This book has to be one of the most interesting, inspiring and illuminating I have ever read. A history of how we got from there to here; it explains all the necessary scientific and intellectual advances that occurred on the way in a manner that is easily accessible, no matter how complex the actual science or the theories behind it. I also loved how he tied it all in together as a paean to his father and his father's eventful life. Brilliant"
24,0307908232,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6489740-lloyd-downey,3,"This is a slightly strange book to review. I'm still not exactly sure what the author is trying to achieve. I was reading the book at a local cafe when some friends stopped to say hi! They asked me what was I reading ..and what was it about. I hesitated for a moment thinking ....""how can i summarise this in a sentence"". And then, rather lamely, I fear, I simply said "" It's kind-of a history of science"". They seemed satisfied by that but I'm not. At the start Mlodinow (who has co-authored books with Stephen Hawking and Deepak Chopra and has a degree in theoretical physics) says something about humankind's insatiable curiosity...and in a way, this book is an exploration of that kind of curiosity. The will to know. He starts with an investigation of the roots of our culture and an investigation into Gobekli Tepe in Turkey, which dates back 11,500 years ago and appears to have been some sort of religious site rather than a city. And it was constructed by people who were still hunter gatherers.Mlodinow makes the observation that what sets humankind apart (from other animals) is that we seem to be able to build upon the knowledge and inventions of the past. He has a chapter about the development of civilisation and the role of language and writing in holding the structure of cities and empires together. And a rational approach to nature started to emerge (around the Mediterranean)....that the universe was ordered not chaos. (Thales b.624BC, Pythagoras, 570-490BC). Both had travelled and Mlodinow makes the point, several times, that travel broadens the mind. Their work, leading on to Aristotle (D 322 BC) who was the first to write like a professional teacher rather than as an inspired prophet. Though his work tended to be qualitative rather than quantitative.Then came the Romans and then Christianity and the the fall of the Roman Empire and stultifying hand of Christianity on science for 1000 years or so. Fortunately, the Islamic world maintained an interest in science during this period and kept alive the books of Aristotle and others.....though Islamic science seemed to have fallen into the same trap as Christianity. New Ideas were frozen. Education became via the madrasas where religion was studied and the Koran learned by heart. (Though never subject to critical study on its origins, structure, content etc).Mlodinow mentions a group called the Merton scholars at Oxford who laid some of the mathematical foundations for Newton. Their work was taken up by Nicole Oresme (1320-1382) in France who developed a geometric style proof. Mlodinow suggests that the scientific revolution was driven primarily by innovation with water mills, windmills etc. not in terms of scientific knowledge but in terms of the prosperity that permitted specialisation in theoretical science. Then came printing and the moveable type. (In 1483 to set up a book for printing the Ripoli press would charge 3x what it cost for scribe to copy it....but Ripoli could produce a thousand copies whilst the scribe had produced one. Mlodinow runs through the familiar catalog of the renaissance: Leonardo da Vinci, Galilelo....who disproved Aristotle),......he hardly mentions Kepler. But we get quite a lot about Newton which is quite interesting. Apparently he was pretty much a solitary curmudgeon.He had a pretty lonel,y awful, life as a kid and this seemed to translate into his adult life. He was at the bottom of the pecking order in his undergraduate days in Cambridge...but worked 18 hrs a day x 7 days per week....and kept this up for decades.I like his section on Newton. He appreciates the incredible contributions that Newton made to science but is also alive to his flaws: ""Yes he invented calculus, but he also thought the floor plan of the lost temple of King Solomon, in Jerusalem, contained hints regarding the end of the world"". ""And, even in 1684, Newton's insights about gravity and motion were not the sudden epiphanies suggested by the story of the falling apple. Instead the momentous idea that gravity is a universal seems to have dawned on Newton gradually as he worked on revisions of the early draft of his Principia.""He runs through a series of pen portraits (quite well done) of Paracelsus, Boyle, Hooke, Priestly, Lavoisier.....who were all instrumental in the development of chemistry and the discovery of elements like oxygen. This let to Dalton and atomic weights and eventually to Mendeleev and the periodic table. (There is nice biographical data on Mendeleev....had a tough life. (I like his mum's dying words to him: ""Refrain from illusions, insist on work and not on words"".)Mlodinow then moves onto biology with the work of Hooke and Leeuwenhoek under the microscope..and then with a bit of a jump (of around 100 years to Charles Darwin). Again, we have a rather nice pen portrait of Darwin...who ""ended the voyage (of the Beagle) as he had begun it---with no doubts regarding the moral authority of the Bible"". I hadn't realised that Darwin had given some of his collections to various experts....and it was the experts who corrected Darwin's misinterpretation of the finch specimens from the Galapagos Island. It was about a year after the Beagle returned ....in the summer of 1837 that Darwin had become a convert to the idea of evolution. And it was actually Malthus's essay (read by Darwin in Sept 1838) that gave Darwin the glimmering of an idea for a mechanism for evolution. (He claimed in his autobiography that this was an epiphany for him though his notebooks show it took several years before he perceived the mechanism clearly enough to put it down on paper). And there is an interesting summary of Darwin's hesitancy to publish and the shock or Wallace's letter which precipitated ""On the origin of species"".Mlodinow then moves into a review about the atom and the contribution of Planck. Like a lot of the prior pen portraits ...he gives a great essay about Planck and his formula for black body radiation. ""When he proposed the quantum idea, no-one realised that it was a fundamental principle of nature"". And thence to Einstein ... and ""in 1901, no-one was sufficiently impressed with Einstein's intellect to give him a job that was in any way suited to his abilities"". It was his mate (Marcel Grossman's) father who introduced him to the director of the patent office in 1902. (I've always rather loved the idea of Einstein ...as a third class patent clerk...turning out scientific papers on the job...and eventually turning out three revolutionary papers in 1905 that propelled him into a first rate physicist. He considered the paper on relativity the least important. His paper on atoms (or molecules) and brownian motion was an immediate sensation. And his paper on the photo electric effect (and photons) was actually what got him the Nobel prize in 1921 ...though as late as 1913 Planck et al were writing that Einstein had missed the target with his speculations. But again a great pen portrait of Einstein and his difficulties...he was expelled from high school.Thence to Rontgen (X rays), Thompson (discovery of the electron), Rutherford (Radiation and the nucleus....though it was Hans Geiger who did the hard yards...And an undergraduate (Marsden) who actually measured the large deflections of alpha particles), and Niels Bohr. Again another nice profile for Niels Bohr.....who developed the idea of quantitised orbits for electrons. He got the idea from a friend who mentioned spectroscopy lines. Rutherford criticised the idea on the grounds that the was no mechanism for the electron jump ...what did it consist of and what caused it? Great questions, but no answers. Apparently such questions have no answers.And thence to Heisenberg....who ignored the pictures of atoms and just focused on the mathematical relationships between measurable properties such as frequencies of light and amplitude emitted by atoms and position and velocity. Apparently it was Born and Jordan who translated the ideas into matrix algebra. And then came Schrodinger in 1926 with his equation (which he soon showed was mathematically equivalent to Heisenberg's matrix). ....and 20 years later Feynman's theory was also equivalent. But it was Paul Dirac who gave the definitive explanation connecting the theories....(though there is no discussion of the mechanism by Mlodinow). A bit of a diversion here into WWII and the roles of the physicists in developing the atom bomb. And then the story sort of falls into a heap and Mlodonow is reminiscing about the death of his dad who was a holocaust survivor. And musing about the fact that the standard model which unifies electromagnetism and two of the nuclear forces...but doesn't account for gravity...so it can't be the whole story. And then of course there is dark matter and dark energy making up the other 95 percent of the universe. So still plenty for scientists to do. And there it ends. A bit lame to my way of thinking ....but he does have those delightful and insightful portraits of some of the key figures in his book. (Not all...and I wondered why some were chosen and others left out .....what about Dirac fo example?) Overall, as I said at the start, a rather strange book. I give it 3.5 stars."
25,0307908232,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23428788-john-kaufmann,4,"Hard to categorize. It's written by a scientist (Mlodinow is a physicist in real life), and traces several key scientific developments - but it's not about science per se. While he gives a lot of examples from the fields of physics and chemistry, that's not the aim of the book; one can find more detailed explanations of those discoveries and theories elsewhere. What this book is about is the developments in the human brain and human culture that lead to the scientific worldview. It began 40,000-140,000 years ago, after the ""bottleneck"" when our species almost went extinct, with changes in the brain that enabled consciousness and the ability to ask ""Why?"" Eventually it led to the existential questions, ""Who am I?"" and ""Who is in charge of the cosmos?"" Eventually came the Neolithic Revolution, which brought the motivation to try understand the rules of nature, and the development of settlements, rulers, organization and bureaucracy (for irrigation projects, defensive walls, pyramids, etc.), religion, and - quite importantly - the concept of laws (ethical laws, laws of nature, etc.) and the attempt to bring Order out of Chaos. Mlodinow's thesis is that these kind of developments in thinking were necessary for the eventual development of the mindset out of which science was able to emerge.As societies and wealth grew, a privileged class had time to begin to think and explore, and we come to the Greeks. Aristotle (following some pre-Socratics) gave us the concept of change; everything is subject to change. That thread inevitably led to trying to understand the nature of that change, and was a necessary component of the scientific toolkit. Mlodinow skips through Roman culture, the medieval church, the Renaissance, the printing press, and the Enlightenment to highlight various structural developments, both within the brain and within western culture, that fostered learning, curiosity, and a secular worldview. He also touches on reasons why such a mindset did not develop in the Arab, world, China, or India.The second part of the book is more scientific, but always with a bent toward illuminating some of the mental and cultural underpinnings. For example, he talks about Boyle's discovery of the gas laws, but also how it led to the establishment of the Royal Society which provided a forum for scientists and gave official sanction to the cross-fertilization of ideas. He uses key developments in each of the sciences as a venue to also present some of the developments in our thinking processes that enabled or resulted from them. In such a manner does he cover luminaries like Newton, Robert Hooke, Leeuwenhoek, Mendeleev, Darwin; physics, chemistry, biology, quantum mechanics. Along the way one also learns a lot about the actual sciences.For example, he talks about how universities in medieval Europe did more than just pass on knowledge; they were gathering places for people to share and test ideas, something that is critical for the scientific worldview to prosper. He talks of how Newton's self-imposed isolation also lead to some of his extreme beliefs in religion and alchemy."
26,0307908232,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12025885-ronnie,4,"In the authors own words, this book ""imparted an appreciation of the roots of human thought about the physical world, the kinds of questions those who study it concern themselves with, the nature of theories and research, and the ways in which culture and belief systems affect human inquiry. ...much of this book has also been about the way scientists and other innovators think."" I found it fascinating, but it was not an easy read. At times I got lost in the minutiae of theoretical physics and I still don't understand quantum theory, but I do now understand more about why this is true for me, and it's okay. I learned a lot, but this is definitely not a book for everyone. If you're not interested in science, don't even think about reading this book. The author made it as simple as he possibly could, considering the material, and he had a good sense of humor that lightened and informed it. Without that, I don't think I would have made it through. On the other hand, if you have an interest in the history of scientific theory and discovery, this is a book for you. "
27,0307908232,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41943547-greg,3,"Leonard Mlodinow believes that upright thinkers are often odd, always tenacious, frequently iconoclastic, and definitely bold. His aim in this book is to follow the evolution of scientific thought from the cavemen to the present by characterizing several of these thinkers. His intent is to describe scientific thought in a way that any reasonably intelligent and inquisitive layperson might easily understand it. He uses his father as a stand-in for that person. This choice is admirable since it incorporates a homespun humorous element to a narrative that could otherwise be pretty dry. Mlodinow’s dad once gave up food when he was in the Nazi camps just to learn the solution to a scientific puzzle. It would not be too surprising to suggest that most of the scientists Mlodinow characterizes in his book would do likewise.The three sections of the book emphasize several important concepts. First, that the evolution of scientific thought has been accelerating, with progress starting slowly over thousands of years but rapidly moving to today where new findings seem to arise almost daily. Second, that progress does not come in flashes of brilliance but actually takes much effort and is often accompanied by blind alleys and false starts. Third, that the traditional scientific disciplines actually have considerable overlap and this will only increase in the future. Fourth, that mankind tends to accept concepts that are prevalent and is highly resistant to ideas that seem to contradict conventional thinking.The writing is engaging for lay readers, although probably old news for most scientists. Mlodinow avoids scientific jargon and the acronyms that seem so prevalent today. He injects humorous anecdotes into the stories he tells and definitely conveys a high level of excitement and wonder for the progress we have made in understanding the natural world."
28,0307908232,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19366647-kristi-richardson,5,"“If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.” Isaac NewtonI received this book as part of the Goodreads First to read program for an honest review.“The Upright Thinkers” by Leonard Mlodinow is so much more than I thought this book was going to be about. I thought it was more on primitive man and how they learned and grew. Instead to my delight, it was the history of the different sciences and their discoveries, from biology, chemistry, astronomy, physics and quantum theory. Mr. Mlodinow writes difficult theories in an easy to understand way and I was entranced by the pioneers of science and the difficulties they had to overcome to prove their theories validity. Among my favorites were Dmitri Mendeleev, the Russian scientist who discovered the Periodic Table in Chemistry even before some of the elements had been discovered. He had faith that they would be discovered and they would have the characteristics that would place them in the spots he left blank on the table. Another part of the book that was special to me was Mr. Mlodinow’s father, a holocaust survivor and his take on the different sciences and theories that Leonard would tell him about. It made the book so much more real to me and helped in my understanding of the concepts the author was explaining. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and felt I gained a better knowledge of the early scientists and the newer sciences and their importance to humanities survival and growth. It also showed me that tenure is an important asset to a scientist because they need the opportunity to fail before they can succeed. "
29,0307908232,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2428551-mark,5,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. While it was easy to read, fun and entertaining, I also found it to be a very informative and enlightening examination of the history of science and how our current systems evolved from the time hominids began to be curious to the quantum age Mlodinow touched on all the major scientists and the fundamental contributions they have made to our current understandings and practice of science today. It was the most thorough compilation of these figures I have read, with interesting insights into their lives and the experiences that shaped their viewpoints.Not realizing that I had read it previously, I picked this up again (now own it) and started in on it on Dec. 23, 2017, again thoroughly enjoying it. Going to record it in Goodreads on Dec. 24, I realized I had read it previously. I don't do a lot of re-reading because I have so many books in my attacks but as enjoying this one as I was, I decided to continue on. I'm not sure how Goodreads will handle the dates because I switched its status back to ""Reading"" so for good measure, I want to note that my first reading was June 5 to June 20, 2015.Finished re-reading 3/22/18. Upon re-reading I still think it was a 5 star! Thoroughly enjoyed it. I overwhelmingly enjoy Mlodinow's style."
30,0307908232,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39535668-ian-james,4,"There's a lot to like about this book and a little to be annoyed by.Mlodinow's overview of our species' arc of intellectual evolution can be a bit fluffy and aims painfully at lowest common denominator-type comedy to make science ""fun!"" (if I'd read one more time about how teenagers don't listen to their parents, I would've shut the book forever). However:He hits on some truly meaningful and insightful moments in human history that force us (or at least me) to change the way we think of human intelligence and evolution.As an introduction to these important thinkers and these crucial intellectual milestones and watersheds, I would highly recommend The Upright Thinkers. It's a great place to start and it's a very entertaining read (if you can ignore the ""science can be FUN!!!!"" nonsense). Anyone already familiar with these concepts will grow bored quickly.And I assume everyone will wince at the lame attempts at humor (I know from funny)."
31,0307908232,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11673245-peter-gelfan,4,"This book presents the intellectual history of the branch of human discovery and thought that today thrives as science. Mlodinow tells it as an episodic story of the major experimental and theoretical upheavals leading from ignorance and superstition to string theory. (Okay, pause here for snide jokes about what’s the difference. Well, Mlodinow will tell you.)If you’ve kept up with modern science, The Upright Thinkers will contain few surprises (if you haven’t, the book is a godsend). But he puts it all together in new and thought-provoking ways that make it a very worthwhile read.Mlodinow writes well. His clear, easygoing prose makes even the most abstruse concepts understandable to nonscientists. The flashes of humor and brief bits of poignant reminiscence keep the human element alive while steering clear of extended digression."
32,0307908232,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5469227-d-l-morrese,4,"This overview of humanity's quest to understand the physical world is broad in scope, not overly detailed, and engaging. It's not defending any particular position or arguing any specific theory. It simply summarizes key events that have advanced our species' knowledge of nature. There's probably not much in here that people with a casual interest in science isn't already familiar with from similar books. This one is organized chronologically, showing how one discovery led to another, how theories were often resisted and then accepted, and how they changed how people viewed the world. It's an account of iterative progress, but an exceptionally well presented one. I can recommend it to readers with an interest in the history of human understanding."

Some parts were quite entertaining, with behind-the-scenes looks at the lives of famous scientists. Others part felt rushed and incomplete. Interesting personal anecdotes from the lives of the author and his Holocaust-survivor father broke up the monotony throughout the book.Verdict: An OK read, which doesn't surpass my favorite book from the author: The Drunkard's Walk: How Randomness Rules Our Lives"

35,0307908232,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4939550-amantha,1,"I didn't actually finish this. It started out interesting, but then devolved into an extended biography of Isaac Newton who, it turns out, isn't that interesting and I've already read about multiple times in other books. I was hoping to learn new information."
36,0307908232,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3010400-ameya-warde,3,"I did like the book overall, but having read this just after reading bios of Galileo & Newton means that I noticed he got a chunk of facts wrong about Galileo, and then when he talks about Newton he discusses at length how weird, ""like an alien"" ""not understanding socialization"" ""tragically alone,"" and ""socially inept"" he was and then shared stories of how well ""socially clueless"" people do in science--giving personal examples of scientists he's known who [insert super stereotypically autistic behavior here.] With one guy, even, he said how when he first met him, he stood too close to the guy and tried to force eye contact and a handshake and followed the guy as he tried to back away, making the guy almost fall over a chair. I find it super problematic to think that autism (or any Neurodiversity) is considered a negative thing so that rather than state the obvious (and Newton is on pretty much every single list of famous historic autistics because it IS super very obvious) he instead just pokes fun (even good-natured) at him and others for their autistic behaviors?? That was super off-putting.I read this during April, which is Autism Acceptance/Awareness month, and this felt to me like a good example of why we need both #AutismAwarenessMonth and #AutismAwarenessMonth. If this physicist, author, and star trek writer dude (so, assuming geek/nerd (like myself), writing mini bios of scientists truly is clueless about newton's stereotypically presenting autism, then we still need a lot more awareness of how ASD can present because wow. It seems super hard to miss. But, if he knew and just avoided mentioning it even as a possibility/likely truth, but still poked fun (again, even good naturedly) at him and the others for their ""social ineptness"" and ~being incapable of succeeding in any job other than a research professor where their awkwardness is acepted~ (tho that's certainly my dream job) and other weird ableist things, then that shows how very much we need Acceptance. But, again. I do love books that are compilations of historical/biographical vignettes like this, so I did like it. The chapter on newton just felt rather... micro-aggressiony, I guess."

The time came and I finally understood that the optimism was warranted.Mlodinow (or the simpler Leonard) set himself a lofty task as the title shows and I feel he lived up to it. He starts from the turning of the tide when the Greeks shifted the order of thought from chaos (mostly controlled by the gods) to cosmos (nature controlled by ordinary physical laws). We owe a lot of our present world state of knowledge to the Ionian school that pioneered rational thought. This provided the backbone for big names such as Galileo, Einstein, Newton, Dalton, Hooke, Mendeleev and many other epoch changing thinkers to advance their thoughts unconstrained by the gods and bring us to where we are today. How lucky we are to live in this era.I had early reservations in that the book was touted as Leonard trying to explain physics to his father, I had pictured a homespun version but turns out when he includes his father, it's the normal conversation we have with our parents about our work, or when you are trying to explain quantum computing to your mother and realise that you also didnt understand it that well.This was a good book, strike that, an awesome book and thank you Leonard Mlodinow. "
38,0307908232,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6067468-abner-rosenweig,5,"Mlodinow. A daunting name. A name you'd expect to see on an inscrutable graduate physics textbook. A name that, at a quick glance, appears to have category 2 rotational symmetry. The name itself might intimidate a general reader from picking up this book, though it shouldn't. Mlodinow's text is one of the great histories of science in the modern age along with Sagan's Cosmos, Bryson's A Short History of Nearly Everything, and Ferris's Coming of Age in the Cosmos. Mlodinow puts his spin on this history by interweaving stories of his father, who narrowly escaped the holocaust, and by sprinkling in general advice on how to be a revolutionary scientist -- dare to think differently, focus, choose the right problems, etc. These idiosyncrasies help the book stand out, and Mlodinow's personal stories add poignancy, though the exposition doesn't need any extra help: Mlodinow covers the whole epic sweep of scientific inquiry in an accessible, entertaining way that keeps the reader hooked throughout. Like Bertrand Russell does with great philosophers in his History of Western Civilization, Mlodinow personalizes the great scientists and places them in social context, giving the grand human quest for ideas a feeling of, well, humanity. While the book glosses over relativity and doesn't go into as much depth on the implications of quantum mechanics as I'd hoped, this is an enjoyable, readable chronicle of the scientific endeavor which I expect to return to more than once.Far from inscrutable, Mlodinow is an engaging scientist and storyteller. I look forward to reading his other works."
39,0307908232,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33599214-suha,4,"Main heavy dish: beef with rice on the side with heavy mushroom sauce.This book is basically about the history of science, it tackles physics , biology, and chemistry. Some parts flow, especially with the brief biographies of scientists, whereas the concise description of the science (theories) is sort of heavy and takes time to understand and ponder on especially that my background in science is limited. Overall, this is a great book, the writing style is very straightforward with a touch of humor and feelings.My favorite parts were about Darwin, I was amazed by his personal life and the process of him reaching his theories. I also loved the civilizations part, and the beginning of time; there are many things I have learned in this book. I quote: “We progressed from perceiving the tides as being governed by a goddess to understanding them as the result of the gravitational pull of the moon, and we graduated from thinking of the stars as gods floating in the heavens to identifying them as nuclear furnaces that send photons our way. Today we understand the inner workings of our sun, a hundred million miles away, and the structure of an atom more than a billion times smaller than ourselves. That we have been able to decode these and other natural phenomena is not just a marvel. It also makes a gripping tale, and an epic one.” ♥️"
40,0307908232,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11623680-lenka,3,"I had high hopes for this book, and unfortunately I was a bit disappointed. It might have been my own fault, as I had expected it to be something different to what it actually was. I thought it was going to be a thought-provoking take on how human knowledge has developed and changed over thousands of years, and what prompted those changes. Instead, the book is more of a history of the most influential ideas in science, mostly physics, combined with the biographies of the thinkers behind them and some personal anecdotes from Mlodinow. Which would not be a problem, but I did not find the book to be very thought-provoking or original, although it did present some interesting ideas. You can read about these ideas in any other book or textbook and they are not explained in a lot of detail so I do not feel like I’ve gained a deeper understanding of physics after reading it. At times I found the book to be a bit slow and tedious, and I feel like a lot of the detail could have been cut down without affecting the story as a whole. Overall, the book is a summary of some scientific thought over time but it does not come close to capturing how has the collective knowledge of humanity progressed over time, as it has quite a narrow focus. Sadly, I not find what I was looking for in this book and I did not take so much from it, but I’d be inclined to read another one of Mlodinow’s books."
41,0307908232,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35364873-lisa-lynch,2,"I picked this audiobook up from the library in an effort to broaden my horizons and to step out of my comfort zone. I haven't read much non-fiction but I do read it occasionally when the topic is interesting. While the title was interesting and the information was impressive, fascinating, and well-researched, I just didn't like this book. My main problem with the book is that it is read by the author, Leonard Mlodinow, who has a dull, sleep-inducing voice. I found it difficult to focus on the book towards the middle and end and it was a struggle for me to not skip whole sections entirely. Mlodinow tells the occasional joke and they fall truly and utterly flat due to his slightly nasally, droning voice. It was kind of cringy in all honesty. I really think that I would have had a different experience with this book if I had read it physically instead of listening to the audiobook.I settled on 2 stars because I understand that most of my dislike for the book was due to the form in which I consumed it. I can't help feeling that this low of a rating is unfair to the author, who presented some really great information here. However, I just can't bring myself to give it any more than 2 little stars."
42,0307908232,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40150383-shelby-beavers,4,"I don't normally read nonfiction but this book is fantastic. It covers the highlights of scientific revolutions in each major field, with a focus on how each discovery (or invention) impacted how the world thinks about and observes natural occurrences and how each new idea was a stone for the next generation of great thinkers. There is a good balance between breadth and depth into each subject, along with humor and common terms that keeps the novel engaging, while not losing any of the academic integrity of the subject matter. This novel illustrates each scientific hero in a more realistic light, showing that even the greatest minds make mistakes and no one is perfect. I definitely learned a lot about science history, and gained a different perspective on how common world view shapes an individual's reality."

It's packed with fascinating information, but, like my tax filings, kept going back on the shelf to be finished later. This time I stuck with it and am glad I did - a really smart, enlightening, and, at times, personal journey of man's role as underdog four million years ago to where we are now (an aside, will we work our way toward underdog status again?). Mlodinow reminds me of one of my favorite broad knowledge authors, Alan Lightman, a scientist and author of Einstein's Dreams and, my favorite, The Diagnosis. I recommend both authors as a source of entertainment and scientific insight. "

The stories of different people and their contribution from 17th Century onwards were particularly very gripping. Sometimes, the struggle is primarily internal (i.e) to break free from the prevailing conventions and to become brave enough to pursue unconventional ideas at that time. This book humanizes the legends and it also talks about their ideas that proved wrong in the end. Overall, I am very satisfied with the book. "

To put this book a quantum stage: I can only imagine the difference for science it would be if only some of the writings between scientists could be changed for spoken words, as we can do today!Could psychology bring scientists to a higher level and take away shame and pride?Or, could this take away the meaning of life as a scientist?As I tried to put scientists on a timeline with their work it was a hard book to crack in the start.Then, reading between those lines made me see the bigger picture that I was looking for.Glad I made it to the end."
