0,0062374346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6243880-gary-beauregard-bottomley,3,"This book was a lot like the TED conferences. While you're watching them you think they're the most brilliant thing you've ever seen and just wonder why you didn't come up with thinking about the problem that way on your own. But, when it's over you start to think maybe that wasn't worth my time after all. This book was fun while doing it, but I strongly suspect it wasn't worth my time.Some essays were very good. I really liked Alan Alda's on why true and false should not be how we look at things. Richard Dawkin's (and a host of others) also thinks Essentianism should be retired. It just muddles our way of thinking since nature doesn't always fall into neat categories (Darwin dances around what a species is for a very good reason). When the theme of the essay was on the real nature of science being particular to the data available, and contingent to the current understanding of nature that we have and science is never absolute (back to Alan Alda's essay, e.g.), the essay would work nicely and would fit into an overall narrative. Overall, I would recommend skipping this book and reading Marcelo Gleiser's ""Island of Knowledge"", who did give the second essay presented in this book and will give the listener a more coherent sense on the limitations of science than this book does.

This took nearly 2 years to finish - why? Perhaps because it suffered from being too long with too many voices saying the same thing (two essays have the exact same title and subject matter as well as opinion).That said, when the essays were good, they were VERY good. I can't seem to find any off the top of my head, but they were there. Unfortunately, due to the format, the good essays could only be a max of 4 pages, leading to a truncated discussion of a fascinating topic - another detriment to the book, being too long and yet not long enough.Note: saying that a figure of speech such as ""knowing is half the battle"", ""people are sheep"" and ""beauty is in the eye of the beholder"" should die makes you sound like an elitist prick. You DO realize they are FIGURES OF SPEECH not scientific principles, RIGHT?!???!If you read, I would be judicious with skipping any essay you aren't enjoying. Enjoy the 10 or 15 of the 18 jillion the book has."
2,0062374346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1019174-terence,2,"The problem with books of this nature is that either the ""death of an idea"" is such a no-brainer that it doesn't deserve an essay or it's the bete noire of the author. For example, in this volume one can find essays that call for the final interment of String Theory alongside others that as vigorously defend it. Or materialists who deny that consciousness persists after death alongside others who argue for the opposite.The best essay in the collection - and what makes it worth reading - is Ian McEwan's, ""Beware of Arrogance! Retire Nothing!""A great and rich scientific tradition should hang onto everything it has. Truth is not the only measure. There are ways of being wrong that help others to be right. Some are wrong, but brilliantly so. Some are wrong but contribute to method. Some are wrong but help found a discipline....We need to remember how we got to where we are, and we'd like the future not to retire us. Science should look to literature and maintain a vibrant living history as a monument to ingenuity and persistence. We won't retire Shakespeare. Nor should we Bacon. (pp. 256-7)"

4,0062374346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,1,"This book is a collection of essays; answers to the question What scientific idea is ready for retirement? This format is like placing a soap box in the middle of a town full of cranks, quacks, sophists, pseudo-intellectuals, and contrarians. The result is not really a book so much as a colossus of nonsense hewn from contradictory essays.I can't fault John Brockman his choice in ordering these essays, however. They flow together smoothly as a river of lingual effluent filled with the mangled corpses of battered straw men.Of course there are some few decent authors who contributed poignant, reasonable essays (Richard Dawkins, Daniel C. Dennett, Steven Pinker, Hugo Mercier, Richard H. Thaler, Michael Shermer).Others were just plain wrong. Some so reprehensibly wrong that I screamed out loud from anger and merely typing their names now causes me hypertension (Douglas Rushkoff, Geoffrey West, Marcelo Gleiser, David Deutsch, Susan Blackmore, Nicholas G. Carr, W. Daniel Hillis, Gary Klein, Beatrice Golomb, Tania Lombrozo). Their responses constitute nothing more than denials of physics, neurology, human nature, and even the scientific method its self. Its a crime against reason that these lies were published.Most of the rest suffer from fervent accusation that everyone in the world but themselves are drooling idiots who can't begin to comprehend whichever corner of their field the author happens to be expert. If only they'd take a short break from clobbering their straw men to search PubMed or the arXiv, they'd find their dismal fears of universal incompetence totally unfounded. There were also a ton of shameless false dichotomies.It's not all their fault, really. They were after all provoked by that pesky soap box."
5,0062374346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4177031-troy-blackford,4,"Another Brockman-curated sampling of thought from his roster of scientists, this collection explores scientific ideas that are blocking progress. Interestingly, many of the contributors to this book are opposed to research that is championed by other contributors, and the counterpoints were often striking. This one kind of grated on me at times, because some of the essays were arguing against things that interest me, but it was nevertheless interesting to hear the arguments, either way. A gripping read."
6,0062374346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43477226-todd-stockslager,4,"Review title: Death Wish VIThe Death Wish movie franchise was a series of movies (up to V) where Charles Bronson's wife/daugter/mother/girlfriend would be attacked/kidnapped/tortured/raped/murdered by a lone psycho/gang/cult where upon Bronson would exact revenge. Kind of like Taken without Liam Neeson's voice. I have entitled my review as the next in the franchise because this collection of essays by scientists talks a lot about death and involves a strong wish to see many ideas be done away in various painful and cringe worthy ways. These scientists are all responding to a question on the website edge. org, and you will recognize many of their names: Dawkins, Dyson, Diamond and dozens of others whose names do not begin with D--like Alan Alda, so obviously the definition of ""scientist"" is a little fluid here. It is interesting and worth the time to note the writer's title, role and institution and publication listed. Clearly they were only allowed to list one, as for example I have read several of Jared Diamond's books but not the one listed; I wonder if this is the most recent publication, the one the author is most proud of or the one that best suits the topic? There was also clearly an upper limit to length (about 5 printed pages in this paperback) but no lower, as some essays are less than a page. The editor has done a nice job arranging them in a logical flow that isn't reflected in any kind of hierarchy or table of contents structure, but becomes clear if you read from front to back as I did. The first topic on the death wish list is the Theory of Everything, which because of scope (unhelpful overreach, most say) is on a lot of respondents' lists. Then come the big cosmological ideas like the universe, multiverse, and quantum physics. Eventually we get down to man himself: mind, human exceptionalism, free will, emotion (just a brain state) all have to go under Bronson's gun. After that things kind of scatter about depending on the specialty of the writer. A few of the ideas get quite specific, but most are explicable to the layman and applicable to multiple disciplines. My big conclusions:1. Pretty much every idea in science is on someone's list to eliminate. 2. Science can be arrogant about what it thinks is certain and ignorant of what it might not know. 3. There are a vast number of roles and institutions which perform and pay for science, and those factors clearly do influence the writers, though in what ways are not obvious from this level. My response to the radical materialism and certitude of so many of the writers is that I believe that while science is advancing in so many areas, in the big areas (quantum physics, cosmology, human nature and mind) the science is defining representations of reality not reality itself, and that in these ideas there will be decades and centuries of redefinition, rethinking, and revolution before science defines reality. I agree with the writer of the final essay who says : ""privately every scientist knows that what science really does is discover the profundity of our ignorance."" "
7,0062374346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,4,"This Idea Must Die: Scientific Theories That Are Blocking Progress (Edge Question Series) by John Brockman “This Idea Must Die"" is the thought-provocative book of scientific essays brought to you by The Edge. The Edge is an organization that presents original ideas by today's leading thinkers from a wide spectrum of scientific fields. The 2014 Edge question is, “What scientific idea is ready for retirement?” This interesting 592-page book provides over 175 short essays that address the question. The quality of the essays in this book range from a few one-star duds to a handful of outstanding 5-star essays. For my sake, I created a spreadsheet of all the essays and graded them from zero to five stars based on overall quality. A quality essay to me is well written, interesting, addresses the topic and either teaches me something new or uses the best of our current knowledge effectively. On the other hand, those receiving two or fewer stars represent essays that were not worthy of this book. Of course, this is just one reviewer's personal opinion.Positives:1.	Generally well-written, succinct essays. High quality-value. I’m a fan of the Edge Series.2.	An excellent question, “What established scientific idea is ready to be moved aside so that science can advance?”3.	You don’t have to read the essays in order. 4.	This is well-balanced book, covers the question from many scientific angles and perspectives. 5.	There were a number of outstanding essays. The following fifteen outstanding essays met my aforementioned standards and are worthy of five stars, starting with: “The Big Bang was the first moment of time” by Lee Smolin. “The hypothesis that there was a first moment of time is remarkably generic and unconstraining, as it’s consistent with an infinite number of possible states in which the universe might have begun.”6.	“Entropy” by Bruce Parker. “…we shouldn’t retire entropy, but perhaps we should treat it with a little less importance and recognize the paradox it creates.”7.	“Race” by Nina Jablonski. Makes the persuasive case that race has no place in science. 8.	“Hardwired = Permanent” by Michael Shermer. “It’s time for scientists to retire the theory that God and religion are hardwired into our brains.”9.	“Cognitive agency” by Thomas Metzinger. A great essay. “As it turns out, most of our conscious thoughts are actually the product of subpersonal processes, like breathing or the peristaltic movements in our gastrointestinal tract.”10.	“Free will” by Jerry Coyne. One of the best essays of this book. “Whether or not we can “choose” is a matter for science, not philosophy, and science tells us that we’re complex marionettes dancing to the strings of our genes and environments.”11.	“Fully random mutations” by Kevin Kelly. Fascinating essay. “The evidence shows that chance plays a primary role in mutations, and there would be no natural selection without chance. But it’s not random chance. It’s loaded chance, with multiple constraints, multipoint biases, numerous clustering effects, and skewed distributions.”12.	“Robot companions” by Sherry Turkle. Did someone say robots? “We’re drawn to the robotic because it offers the illusion of companionship without the demands of friendship.”13.	“The grand analogy” by David Gelernter. Artificial intelligence. “Until we understand how to make digital computers feel (or experience phenomenal consciousness), we have no business talking up a supposed analogy between mind:brain and software:computer.”14.	“Stationarity” by Giulio Boccaletti. “Accelerating changes in climate, coupled with a more sensitive global economy, in which more people and more value is at stake, reveal that we don’t live in a world as stationary as we thought. And infrastructure designed for that world and intended to last for decades is proving increasingly inadequate.”15.	“The scientific method” by Melanie Swan. “A new improved scientific method for today. We can no longer rely exclusively on the traditional scientific method in the new era of science emerging in areas like Big Data, crowd- sourcing, and synthetic biology.”16.	“Romantic love and addiction” by Helen fisher. Compelling. “The sooner we embrace what brain science is telling us— and use this information to upgrade the concept of addiction— the better we’ll understand ourselves and the billions of others on this planet who revel in the ecstasy and struggle with the sorrow of this profoundly powerful, natural, often positive addiction: romantic love.”17.	“Anthropocentricity” by Satyajit Das. “Transcending anthropocentricity may allow new frames of reference, expanding the boundary of human knowledge.”18.	“Essentialist views of the mind” by Lisa Barrett. “Essentialism leads to simplistic “single cause” thinking, whereas the world is a complex place. Research suggests that children are born essentialists (what irony!) and must learn to overcome it. It’s time for scientists to overcome it as well.”19.	“Mental illness is nothing but brain illness” by Joel Gold. “In understanding, preventing, and treating mental illness, we will rightly continue to look into the neurons and DNA of the afflicted and unafflicted. To ignore the world around them would be not only bad medicine but bad science.” 20.	Quite a few 4.5 star essays as well. It’s a matter of opinion.Negatives:1.	Require an investment of your time to get through.2.	There are just a few essays that were not worthy of this book, but just a few.3.	I would have liked to have seen more hot-button topics addressed. Controversy is not bad for a book like this.4.	Having more essays in a book is not necessarily better but at least you can be the judge of that.In summary, I’m a big fan of The Edge and these types of books. They’re fun to read and provide many different perspectives on a given question. Philosophy is asking the right questions and good science is providing the answers based on the best of our current knowledge. There are many bad scientific ideas that are ready for retirement but seeking the truths about our world based on good science is not one of them. These kinds of books are always fun and stimulating to read, enjoy, I recommend it. Further recommendations: “This Explains Everything” and “This Will Make You Smarter” and “This Will Change Everything” by the same author. "
8,0062374346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38005-runa,2,"For a book seeking to dispel common scientific misconceptions, this book is startlingly inaccessible to the average every-day reader. Like, if you want to reach the masses, maybe consider *not* starting your book with sections on quantum physics? So it was really difficult to slog through all the scientific jargon that's not meant for the average reader, which is sad, because I really loved the concept and enjoyed reading the few sections that were reader-friendly. I understand wanting to publish a work aimed at a specific community, but again, due to the subject matter, this really feels like something that should be more accessible."
9,0062374346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44661992-michael,2,"This book was a chore to plow through. The title and the concept intrigued me, yet I was disappointed in the overall outcome. Some of the contributors used the question as an opportunity to rant on their own personal pet peeve, such as the lady who went off on the phrase ""It doesn't take a rocket scientist to ....""One of my greatest disappointments with the book was that so many of the contributors took it upon themselves to ridicule a belief in a Supreme Creator.While they are all brilliant individuals in their respective fields. It is clear that there is much they yet don't understand. For example there were back to back essays both calling for string theory to be retired, and another singing its praises. Yet despite their inability to agree on areas in which they are specialists, they all seem to agree that it would be ""foolish"" to believe in a higher power.While they ridicule a belief in God because of a lack of proof. I would ask what proof they have that there is no God? I maintain that they have none save it be their word only. While to me all things denote there is a God. Including the testimony of the prophets contained in scripture. The earth and all things that are upon the face of it. And to the dismay of many of the contributors of this book, their own work. Such as those that point out how sub atomic particles relate to each other, and that if they weren't the precise size that they are in relation to others life on this Earth could not exist. Or the one who talked about how random mutations in evolution aren't as ""random"" as we once thought. Of course he was quick to point out that they must be careful how they discuss that ""lest Creationists get the wrong idea.""What I fail to understand is why it is so unreasonable to believe that a Supreme Creator, who has a a perfect understanding of nature's laws (that we are so striving to comprehend), could not use those laws to bring about all the marvels we see around us. And why it is so important for those who do not believe in a Supreme Creator to so militantly attack those that do. What does it hurt them if someone else chooses to believe in a higher power?"
10,0062374346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35399024-emerson-banez,4,"It took a while to get through this book - the sum of 175 essays to answer the question ""What scientific idea needs to be put aside in order to make room for new ideas to advance?""I've always had an acute professional and intellectual envy of those working in the hard sciences - their fields seem to be so put together. So it's guilty pleasure to find out that things aren't as neat as they seem from the outside:* String theory (or 'M' theory) is a dead end* The falsifiability requirement is under siege* The Big Bang, that staple of science textbooks, is showing a lot of cracksI am starting to get the impression that Big Science is headed into another intellectual crisis (but that's good thing, considering the clarification that happened the last time).Even the soft sciences (always in shaky empirical grounds to begin with) is not spared from the brutal accounting of what no longer works:* The appeal to 'Culture' is essentially a reference to ""phlogiston"" or ""protoplasm""* Multiple regression as causation is demolished* The null-hypothesis method is characterized as empty ""ritual""Even with my conceptual idols dashed, I can't help but admire the institutional processes and culture that makes this soul-searching possible. There is an openness here, the recognition that ""the possibility of correction is a strength, not a weakness.""The legal enterprise is built on some of the ""retire-able"" ideas dissected in this book:* The discreteness of mind, the unity of behavioral intent (and therefore of human agency) is an axiom for our system of assigning liability.* Our rules of evidence systematize (now faulty) assumptions about cause and effect, the reliability of perception and our own capacity for reason.We have over-invested in comfortable truths. Perhaps it's time for a similar accounting of doctrines that need to die. "
11,0062374346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18942380-william-schram,2,"Meh. This book is one that I should not have bought, but you know what they say about fools and money I guess. I really should have looked through it beforehand, but I was charmed by the title. What is even more aggravating is the fact that I was in the bookstore when I bought this and could have looked through the physical copy I was holding.This book is a collection of essays with a common theme; ""What Ideas should be shelved to aid progress?"" With some of them it's almost like the author just needed a topic to write on so they could get published. Now a lot of them are educated people, I assume, since they list their credentials ahead of all of the essays, but I don't really think they understand what they are saying. Perhaps I am the one in the wrong.As an example to illustrate my point, some people in the statistics section of the book want to do away with the average, the statistical deviation, and other things. Of course, this is all to stir up controversy since they say that they don't want to get rid of the idea per se, but rather some elements of the subject that aren't pertinent to their own fields. Sometimes they write only one page on the subject that they have and that is that. They say something terrible for about three paragraphs and they change over to another author. It's like each essay was left slightly unfinished.Finally, they have a few cases where the subject is repeated. I am glad that two neuroscientists agree that the idea of Left Brain/ Right Brain should be retired, but do we need to hear from both of them?The editor did his best, but this just wasn't an enjoyable collection. It certainly did stir up some controversy in my brain, just not the type that was intended."
12,0062374346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19094894-beverly-hollandbeck,2,"I think I got the recommendation to read this book from a magazine review, but I can't remember which one. Maybe Smithsonian. The idea is a question put forth to scientists: Which scientific idea is ready for retirement? The book is 555 pages of 2-4 page essays answering this question, each essay from a different scientist. Unfortunately, the editor put the answers from the physicists first, so quantum mechanics, string theory, and the like made heavy, mostly (to me) incomprehensible reading, and I almost stopped reading the book. Then suddenly it switched to biologists, whose answers were readible, then to the social scientists, so I made it all the way through the book. However, the last essays were just as difficult to understand, for the last group was the statisticians. I even had a course on statistics in graduate school, a course which kept me from pursuing a doctorate, since I didn't understand what any of the math meant, and I thought that I'd have to do original research and statistically analyze the data to get a doctorate. I'd recommend this book to a theoretical psychologist with a degree in physics and a love of biology. Or anyone with an immense science vocabulary."
13,0062374346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49020869-benjamin,2,"This was a grind. 175 contributors given one to three pages to air their favorite complaint in what I would call chapterlets. Like an anthology of short stories, you're probably going to find some that are worthwhile. But I found there was too high a spoil to nuggets ratio for me. The better contributions stressed the concept not semantics. Try ""Large Randomized Controlled Trials"" or ""Mouse Models"" as examples. ""Altruism"" made the interesting argument that real egoists share. Others had value in what they introduced to me, your mileage may vary. For me, genetic mosaicism in ""One Genome Per Individual"" and the Turing test Loebner Prize mentioned in ""Artificial Intelligence"" made them memorable. Regretfully too many were undone by too much jargon. ""Intelligence as a Property"" and ""The Continuity of Time"" come to mind. But I also understand why many of the authors relied on it, given such a small word count in each piece.Most of the blame rests in the editing with too many feeling like filler. Several made weak and/or somewhat pointless arguments. Check out ""Big Data"", ""The Habitable-Zone Concept"" or ""Companion Robots"" to see if you agree. ""Malthusianism"" disputed the theory's validity. It only made me think, ""who out there is still claiming that Malthusianism is still valid?"" I've saved what I think is the worst for last. ""Cartesian Hydraulicism"" contends that Descartes' theory of how the nervous system works is past its prime. No kidding. I had to Google that one. The only relevant hits came from two sites: philosophypages.com and edge.org - the editor's website. Then there is the overall tone. Each chapterlet, good or bad, felt like a bundle of rushed negativity. I found this commensurate to catching snippets of conversations while sitting in the middle of a room full of speed daters who are unimpressed with each other and would rather be somewhere else. My best advice to you is to scan the chapterlet titles and sample those that sound intriguing to you. There's no reason to slog through the whole thing like I did. I only made it by switching to the audio book whenever my eyes glazed over. But then I'd have to switch back when it seemed my ears wanted to fold down the way my cats do when she's pissed off. I get that the editor was aiming for a 'science sampler'. I believe the idea would be better served with more aggressive weeding giving the surviving entries more space to make their points. "

Brain plasticity, godlessness, Malthusian notions - all should go according to the responses to John Brockman's latest question.“Science advances by a series of funerals,” writes Brockman, founder of the online discussion forum Edge.org. Sometimes, he says, old ideas have to be put to bed before new ones can flourish. With that in mind, he asked researchers, journalists and other science enthusiasts to weigh in on which established theories need to go. From the replies, Brockman compiled This Idea Must Die, a fascinating smorgasbord of 175 short essays about every field and facet of research.Many of the responses offer tweaks to theories to better fit new discoveries. A psychologist points out that sadness and other “negative” emotions are not inherently bad, that they can help sharpen analytical thinking and enhance memory. Other essays call for more radical changes. Laboratory mice make lousy stand-ins for people when developing new drugs, argues an oncologist. It’s time to stop using them as furry human surrogates, she says. And a number of physicists would be happy to toss out string theory for good. “What we've learned is that this is an empty idea,” one physicist writes. “It predicts nothing about anything.”Some of the essays tackle broader subjects, suggesting ways scientists can improve how they design experiments, crunch numbers and publish papers. Other writers lament poor communication between scientists and the general public, especially when misconceptions allow old theories to linger in the media long after they've been debunked. Take, for example, the notion of nature versus nurture — it still crops up in politics and the press, even though biologists have long known that genetics and environment are inextricably intertwined. A few of the arguments are bound to be controversial. For example, a journalist asserts that the information gleaned from massive particle accelerators isn’t worth their equally massive price tags. And while Brockman’s question inspired some thought-provoking responses, the short essays can provide only a brief overview of complex problems. Readers will want to do some research of their own before deciding which, if any, of these ideas really requires a funeral."

This book contains over 170 short, concise essays covering a wide range of topics and disciplines. In general, the essays are well written, interesting, and easy to understand; although, I think it is best suited to those who already have a strong interest and background in science. Naturally, there is some overlap and disagreement amongst the essays, but I liked how this showcased the scientific process at work. My one complaint, and my reason for giving this book three stars, is that this was a very slow read. Although the essays are short and well organized, it was hard to read more than one or two essays at a time."

It was an interesting read but I will admit it isn't a book I would pick up and buy by myself. I was happy to have received this book for free through goodreads. The writing in this book is good and the book had a good flow to it. I will say this book was engaging and thoughtful. I can see many people finding this book interesting.

19,0062374346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29100314-dschreiber,5,"This Idea Must Die: Scientific Theories that are Blocking ProgressJohn Brockman, ed.In 1948 physicist Max Planck described the progress of science as a battle between newly discovered truths and old ideas championed by senior scientists who fight stubborn, rear-guard actions until they die. It has been summed up in the memorable phrase, “Science advances one funeral at a time.” This Idea Must Die attempts to rectify the process, if not by speeding up the death of old scientists, then at least by killing off some old ideas. In a series of brief essays, most only a few pages in length, 175 leading scientists pack their pet peeves into tumbrels and head them to the guillotine. It makes wonderful reading for those odd moments when you want to engage with something substantial but are short of the time or energy to tackle a major paper or book.Some topics, not surprisingly, are aimed at specialists. As general readers we probably don’t care much about causal entropic forcing, stationarity, inclusive fitness, the somatic mutation theory, or string theory. And most of us, because our minds are boggled, are insulated from concern about an eleven-dimension theory of the universe. More accessible, if not entirely riveting, are essays which twist the knife into subjects which few people have little deep allegiance to any more, such as IQ, the concept of race, the absolute distinction between nature and nurture, lab mice as valid models for humans, and common sense. Some essays are useful in clarifying issues, such as Richard Dawkins’s piece debunking “essentialism,” that is, the search for “essences,” the unwillingness to accept continuities. This has impeded progress in biology, as anti-evolutionists hoot about “missing link” species, failing to understand that organisms evolve continuously, not jumping from type to type, and that in fact what we call species are simply samples picked out of a continuous stream. Essentialism, the “dead hand of Plato,” as Dawkins calls it, corrupts our thinking on many other fronts, too, falsely splitting continuities into segments, as, for example, when we ask at what point life begins in the development of an embryo, or when a person on life support is truly dead. Some essays suggests science may be of two minds about humanity. On the one hand there are defenses of our species against common aspersions. The popular notion in psychology, for example, that we are sheep, easily led to surrender our consciences to authorities, is repudiated as simplistic and a misinterpretion of the data. Sci-fi dreams about robot companions get their comeuppance by an MIT professor who reminds us why machines designed as companions, not mere performers of simple functions but elder-care-bots, nanny-bots, teacher-bots, sex-bots, are poor, empty fictions. As non-living entities, robots are by definition incapable of sharing with us what it means to be alive and human. An artificial intelligence theorist suggests throwing out AI as a title for his field and replacing it more accurately with “the attempt to get computers to do really cool stuff.” Machine intelligence is so fundamentally different from human intelligence, and so much thinner, he says, that no one has even attempted to reproduce real human intelligence yet. On the other hand, there are thinkers who are much less impressed by humanity. The old philosophical chestnut about determinism is dusted off by a professor who argues that, since everything we think and do is produced by our physical brains, it follows that all our thoughts and actions are locked into the laws of physics, making us, in theory, as predictable as the motions of the planets. There is no free will for us any more than there is free will for a planet, there are no real choices, everything we do is done under inescapable compulsion. Because criminals could not help being what they are, he believes, they should be given the kind of consideration that we now give to the mentally ill. A psychologist agrees there is no free will but goes a step further, arguing there is no such thing as the self, on the grounds that no evidence of it has been found in the lab. And, kicking the corpse, a philosopher discloses that we barely have cognitive agency at all. Only for a small fraction of time are we in charge of our thoughts; most occur independent of us as, for example, spontaneous responses to stimuli, sleeping, daydreaming, zoning out, and Mind Wandering (his capitals), not to speak of mental dysfunctions that involve loss of cognitive control, such as illness, intoxication, and various kinds of obsessive thinking. Even more, he suggests that our sense of identity, the feeling that we are the same person over time, is an illusion, an adaptive form of self-deception designed by the organism to achieve its goals. In reality, we are only cognitive systems, complex processes without an identity. Some writers cleverly take exception to the premise of the book, refuting Max Planck with historical examples, insisting that new ideas do not triumph by replacing old ones, urging “Beware of arrogance! Retire nothing!” and “Don’t Discard Wrong Theories, Just Don’t Treat Them as True,” or calling scientific progress an illusion. What other ideas must die? Spacetime, brain plasticity, carbon footprint, left-brain-right-brain, information overload, standard deviation, universal grammar, Moore’s Law, altruism, innateness—the list goes on. Who would have imagined it even possible to doubt, never mind call for the end of, ideas such as cause and effect, geometry, the scientific method, culture, or the universe? We are assured that beauty is not in the eye of the beholder, that humans are not social animals, that bias is not always bad, that sadness is not always bad and happiness is not always good. Glancing over the table of contents, the eyebrow rises again and again—but in a good way, as a sign that the mind is being pried open and that a moment of enlightenment might ensue."

I find it is too much science and physics but there are some really good essays being curated that will make you think twice about using formulae for theorems and other philosophical stuff. I think it will appeal to people who are in the science field more than the general readers but if you want a different perspective, why not? It does force you to look at things in a more granular way and from another perspective. I have never Googled for so much information on physics in my life till this book!"

24,0062374346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1275149-cheryl,2,"The premise: Max Planck (founder of quantum theory) noted, “A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it.” The essayists in the book answer the question of what ideas in their disciplines need to die/be forgotten to speed along human progress. I expected a chorus of innovative, revolutionary, inspirational opinions, and I am certain that did not happen. I love to learn something new and think differently about the world, life, science, people but did not find much here. I was dying to know, what belief do we hold so dear that should be retired?Nothing was too exciting; many were very confusing, and at the end, you are left with a huge gap thinking, what now? Did anyone really say anything in the book worth remembering, and did it happen, now 6 years later? I think the book could have been whittled down into categories or some coherence. Like the scientists in the same discipline were given the top ten submitted and they had to choose one. I enjoyed reading them, I liked they were fairly short, some sour, and it was a great window into the different disciplines as an outsider. I agreed with some, had no opinion on most of them, and disagreed with a few, and not sure this book accomplished anything. Just that people have a lot of opinions?The I did find interesting is below, in the order they were in the book with the idea bolded. Italics are for the inspirational ideas/lines. I spent some time researching the last one, out of order, because I disagreed, and had a fun one sided argument against it. MARCELO GLEISERThe trouble starts when we take this idea too far and search for the Über-unification, the Theory of Everything, the arch-reductionist notion that all forces of nature are merely manifestations of a single force. We explain the world the way we think about it. There’s no way out of our minds. Why do so many insist in finding the One in Nature while Nature keeps telling us that it’s really about the Many?VICTORIA WYATSo much of our society still operates on a paradigm of simplification, compartmentalization, and boundaries, when we need a paradigm of diversity, complexity, relationships, and process. NINA JABLONSKIWhy did the scientific racism of Hume and Kant prevail in the face of the logical and thoughtful opposition of Johann Gottfried von Herder and others? Perhaps because Kant was recognized as a great philosopher in his own time, and his status rose in the 19th century as copies of his major philosophical works were widely distributed and read. Some of his supporters agreed with his racist views; some apologized for them.Skin color, as the most noticeable racial characteristic, was associated with a nebulous assemblage of opinions and hearsay about the inherent natures of the various races. Skin color stood for morality, character, and the capacity for civilization.Before long, influential scientists were denouncing studies of “race” because races themselves could not be scientifically defined. Where scientists looked for sharp boundaries between groups, none could be found. The shared experiences of members of such groups create powerful social bonds. For many people, including many scholars, the concept of race, while no longer biological, has become a mélange of social categories of class and ethnicity.Inventing new vocabularies to deal with human diversity and inequity won’t be easy, but it must be done.  PETER RICHERSON The concept of human nature has considerable currency among evolutionists who are interested in humans. Yet when examined closely, it’s vacuous. Worse, it confuses the thought processes of those who attempt to use it. Useful concepts are those that cut nature at its joints. Human nature smashes bones. Human nature implies that our species is characterized by a common core of features that define us If the dim window that stone tools give us doesn’t lie, culture and cultural variation have been fundamental adaptations of our lineage perhaps going back to late australopiths.  We have clear examples of cultural changes driving genetic evolution, such as the evolution of dairying driving the evolution of adult lactase persistence.The human capacity for social learning develops so early in the first year of life that developmentalists have had to design very clever experiments to probe what infants are learning months before language starts.Human culture is best conceived of as a part of human biology, like our bipedal locomotion. It’s a source of variation we’ve used to adapt to most of the world’s terrestrial and amphibious habitats. The human-nature concept, like essentialism more generally, makes it impossible to think straight about human evolution. KURT GRAY NUMBERING NATUREEvolution, however, destroyed the sanctity of species. Species were not created whole from the Beginning but instead emerged over time, through the repetition of a simple algorithm: heredity, mutation, and selection. Biology has realized that species are not reflections of eternal Divine order but simply a useful way to intuitively organize the world. Unfortunately, psychology lags behind.Many psychologists believe that the mental world is fixed and countable, that the appearance of mental states reflects a deeper essence. Introductory psychology textbooks contain numbered lists of psychological species—five kinds of human needs, six basic emotions, three moral concerns, three kinds of love, three parts of the mind—with these lists depending primarily upon the intuitions of whoever is doing the counting.HARDWIRED = PERMANENT MICHAEL SHERMERIt’s time for scientists to retire the theory that God and religion are hardwired into our brains. Like everyone else, scientists are subject to cognitive biases that tilt their thinking toward trying to explain common beliefs, so it’s good for us to take the long view and compare today with, say, half a millennium ago, when God beliefs were virtually 100 percent, or with the hunter-gatherer tribes of our Paleolithic ancestors who, while employing any number of superstitious rituals, didn’t believe in a God or practice a religion that even remotely resembles the deities or religions of modern life.This indicates that religious faith and belief in God is a by-product of other cognitive processes (for example, agency detection) and cultural propensities (the need to affiliate) that, while hardwired, can be expunged through reason and science in the same manner as any number of other superstitious rituals and supernatural beliefs once held by the most learned scholars and scientists of Europe five centuries ago. THE CARBON FOOTPRINT DANIEL GOLEMANEnter the “handprint,” the sum total of all the ways we lower our footprint. To calculate a handprint, take the footprint as the baseline and then go a step further: Assess the amount ameliorated by the good things we do—recycle, reuse, bike instead of drive. Convince other people to do likewise. Or invent a replacement for a high-footprint technology, like the Styrofoam subsititute made from rice hulls and mycelium rather than petroleum. The handprint calculation applies the same methodology as for footprints but reframes the total as a positive value: Keep growing your handprint.SADNESS IS ALWAYS BAD, HAPPINESS IS ALWAYS GOOD JUNE GRUBERWhether or not an emotion is “good” or “bad” seems to have surprisingly little to do with the emotion itself but rather with how mindfully we ride the ebbing and flowing tides of our rich emotional life.REPRESSION DAVID G. MYERSActually, say today’s memory researchers, there’s little evidence of such repression and much evidence of its opposite. Traumatic experiences—witnessing a loved one’s murder, being terrorized by a hijacker or a rapist, losing everything in a natural disaster—rarely get banished into the unconscious, like a ghost in a closet. Traumas more commonly are etched on the mind as persistent, haunting memories. Moreover, extreme stress and its associated hormones enhance memory, producing unwanted flashbacks that plague survivors. “You see the babies,” said one Holocaust survivor. BEAUTY IS IN THE EYES OF THE BEHOLDER DAVID M. BUSS “...physical appearance typically matters greatly. It conveys critical reproductively valuable qualities such as health, fertility, dominance, and “good genes.” Are humans a bizarre exception to all other sexually reproducing species?Both genders, these include cues to health—symmetrical features and absence of sores and lesions, for example. Since fertility is sharply age-graded in women, more so than in men, cues to youth should figure prominently in gender-specific standards of attractiveness. Clear skin, full lips, an unclouded sclera, feminine estrogen-dependent features, a low waist-to-hip ratio, and many other cues to female fertility are now known to be pieces of the puzzle of universal standards of female beauty. Women’s judgments of men’s attractiveness are more dependent on multiple contexts.There’s far less consensus among women about which men are attractive than among men about which women are attractive. The theory that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, in the sense of being superficial, arbitrary, and infinitely culturally variable, can safely be discarded. I regard it as one of the great myths perpetrated by social scientists in the 20th century. Its scientific replacement—that beauty is in “the adaptations of the beholder,” as anthropologist Donald Symons phrases it—continues to be disturbing to some. It violates some of our most cherished beliefs and values. But then so did the notion that the Earth was not flat or the center of the universe.” Evolutionary Psychology is a love/hate proposition with me; I love the idea of Better Angels of our Nature from Stephen Pinker, which posits that we are not hardwired for selfish nihilism and evil, but wired for good. And I think there is something about our hunter gatherer past still present in our lives such as our metabolism; not that I promote a paleo diet, but one drowning in fast food can lead to the health disparities many marginalized communities face in food deserts. What I most disagree with is that the theory that needs to die is the one the essayist says. He says we all have to accept that there is a universal standard for beauty but never explains how that is holding back his field. I think we all do believe there is a universal standard of beauty, whether wired into us, or brainwashed by culture. And I think that is the basis of my distaste for EP. What the studies say, or the common wisdom says, and what real people on the street say on surveys but really feel, it is fairly nebulous and while valuable to study what it means to be human, it is never going to be concrete and immutable.Too much of EP is sexist and misogynistic reductionism that perpetuates the patriarchy. This NYT mag article I include below is far more articulate than I could be, but I also read a defense of EP and found 2 examples that discredit it immediately. One was when they included a study of mail order brides in order to prove the reliability of EP.Yes. Mail order brides. Mail order brides that are bought and paid for. Yes. That is right. They included that in a study of real world women. Women from Third World or repressive countries willing to sell their bodies and lives to a man. The author was trying to ‘test real world women’s mate preferences for status in a mate.’ I can’t make it up. “In a study of mail order brides from Colombia, Russia, and the Philippines, women universally listed ambition, status, and wealth as among their most desired attributes in a future husband[55].So the “real world” women did not want a poor, uneducated, high school drop out alcoholic in a trailer park for a husband? Not even to become a US citizen? Not one of them? 100% of them preferred a rich guy that could support them as them tried to adapt to a new country, learn the language, start a family, try to find work? Wow. That right there proves everything EP says about anything, I would say. The next one looked at whether a woman would give her number to a good looking man in an expensive, mid price and cheap car. Sounds super reasonable, right? I am no expert in reading studies, but the glaring, neon, honking fact they overlooked was that even when a good looking guy in an expensive car asked for a number, only 23% of women would give it at all, no matter how good looking or how rich they seemed. 23%. Not even a quarter of these women were stupid enough to give a random man their number. And then the researchers think they have found a gold standard truth about all women based on what less than a quarter did. Oh no, no way. What the study showed was than over 75% of women are smart enough to be safe. Since it is a universal fact that when a women goes on a date, she chooses a public place so she won’t be raped or killed, and the man hopes she didn’t use a old photo and turns out to be ugly; if he doesn’t think that, he at least does not have to worry about being raped or killed. I can’t make this up: “In another real-world test of women’s mate preferences for status, Guéguen and Lamy[56] conducted a naturalistic experiment to evaluate whether women’s reactions to a request for their phone number are affected by men’s apparent status (in this case, driving different types of cars). Women approached by a man driving an expensive Audi A5 Ambition Luxury gave their number 23% of the time. Women approached by a man driving a mid-priced Renault Mégane gave their number 13% of the time. Women approached by a man driving a 15-year-old Renault 5 Super Campus (worth only a few hundred dollars) gave their number 8% of the time. Women’s preferences for resource-related cues appear to affect their real-world mating behavior.”You can read either below, and I will get off my soapbox, but the fact that the book included this makes me angry that it was included and depreciates the book’s value. I wish we could embrace a more holistic and encompassing view of beauty, but the pressure to fit into a beauty mold is real and destructive.https://evolution-institute.org/on-co...https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/21/ma..."
25,0062374346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12749187-greg-nigh,3,"This Idea Must Die gets a firmly ambiguous rating from me. It is a collection of short-ish responses from 50-or-so ""prominent thinkers"" in various fields who were asked, ""What scientific idea is ready for retirement?"" Answers to this question range from string theory and human nature, to universal grammar, ""artificial intelligence,"" evolutionary exceptionalism, and one physicist suggests retiring the idea that ""The Higgs Particle Closes a Chapter in Particle Physics."" In that latter essay, after cataloguing the long list of mysteries about atomic structure and forces left lying around the orthodox model, Dr. Haim Harari points out, ""The Higgs particle contributes absolutely nothing to the solution of these puzzles."" I think Unzicker would agree.I found most of the essays in the book to be interesting, and the editing was well-done. An essay by physicist Frank Tipler argues that string theory has been a colossal failure, still not producing anything like a set of experimental outcomes to confirm or deny it's veracity. This is followed immediately by physicist Gordon Kane's essay urging scientists to do away with the idea that there are only three dimensions. After all, string theory requires there to be several more, usually put at 10, most of which are coiled up into a space so tiny inside atoms that they are impossible to detect. Does that sound like an unscientific proposal since it can't be disproven by experiment?Fear not. An essay by theoretical physicist Sean Carroll argues that the very idea of falsifiability needs to be retired! Yes, we can't let annoying things like an inability to actually test a theory stand in the way of accepting that theory as true. Dr. Carroll, unsurprisingly, is a proponent of and popularizing writer on topics such as string theory, multiverses and the Higgs particle, all concepts immune from falsification.The range of subjects addressed is impressive. Strong cases are made for getting rid of multiple regression analyses, doing away with mouse models in medical research, trashing the input-output model of perception and action, and retiring the notion that only scientists can do important science. There are, to be sure, essays that I found poorly argued (e.g. that time is not continuous), and others difficult to understand how they even made it into the book (e.g. we apparently need to get rid of the idea of Cartesian hydraulicism; *now* they tell me...).The greatest value of this book is in showing that many ideas we simply accept by default are in fact contested. Many ideas addressed have probably not registered for most of us as worth seeking alternative opinions about in the first place, but even those ideas operate in the background, shaping us in ways we likely don't realize. Our understanding of the world is rarely built upon undisputed evidence. Instead, we slouch toward common understanding through consensus, even while those agreements often stand quite removed from an underlying set of ""scientific findings"" to support them."

27,0062374346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6544892-lance,4,"This Idea Must Die uses essays written by various experts explaining which scientific ideas each believes are holding humanity back. I love reading about stuff like this, even with my minuscule understanding of all things science, because it all bends and stretches my mind in ways it's not used to, forcing me to think about things I've never considered before.The book starts with 3 essays on killing The Theory of Everything. These scientists believe it to be a detrimental OVERsimplification of the complexities of, well, Everything. They take the nearly artistic viewpoint of saying, ""Maybe Everything can't be explained via math, numbers, and formulas."" As one essay put it, expecting some sort of mathematical “Perfection is too hard a burden to impose on nature.” It's monotheistically-tinged thinking. Nature is too vast and imperfect to fit into nice little boxes. Expecting Everything to fit into one singular, easy-to-explain box is not looking like a good use of resources (a similar stance is put forth regarding String Theory later on from 2 different experts and ""Culture"" from 3 experts as well). We should embrace complexity; it's everywhere we look. A different expert wants to retire the very similar idea of the rocket scientist cliche: science can be done by non-geniuses, shouldn't be done in utter isolation. All should embrace relationship and should NOT be all about silo-ing all the disciplines and areas in life. This is echoed again later by an expert discussing ""Indivi-duality,"" and how humans need to stop seeing themselves as individuals. We're both divisible (into cells and atoms and so on) and not a singular thing (since we have more bacterial cells than our own and we're also hugely interconnected with other beings). 1 expert wants to do away with ""the universe"" in favor of the multiverse, and a different expert favors each observer having their own ""universe"" via quantum mechanics. However, a 3rd expert wants to do away with the multiverse-oriented ""Theory of Anything"" because it's unproven, unprovable, untested, and untestable (the same critique of String Theory elsewhere); believing in such infinite infinities amounts to throwing up your hands and giving up. 1 expert wants to kill infinity: it makes much of physics less useful in predicting. Besides, our computers use finite resources and finite numbers to predict events like weather quite well, so maybe we need to stop accepting infinities.2 different experts want to kill the left-brain/right-brain BS, finally, although it's an annoyingly persistent social meme. Another wants to kill the myth of IQ (again, finally), saying it's like getting a Body Quotient and expecting that to say something useful about your physical health. After that comes a call to end talks of brain plasticity. The expert claims it's too vague of a term used too often to mean much anymore and has been more or less ruined by marketing. Another expert echoes this, saying our talk of ""changing the brain"" is meaningless, as everything does just that.On another brain-related note, one expert wants us to stop thinking bigger is better when it comes to brains. In fact, sometimes smaller is better as it may just be more efficient ""software"" (something our own brains do during adolescence in the social sector). Interestingly, the expert suggests our big brains give us reserves so we can stay intelligent much longer than other species, like after reproduction, suggesting that this mental endurance helped create culture and generational knowledge via grandparents and elders. This matches nicely with the idea of human physical endurance and cooperation being how our ancestors once hunted animals we have little hope of predating otherwise.However, computer scientist David Gelernter argues that we need to stop thinking of brains as meat computers. He admits it's helped some, but says it's nowhere near correct, and we've gotten all we're likely to get from the incorrect analogy. Another essay wants Cartesian hydraulicism (that our bodies/brains work like hydraulic pumps, which is false beyond engorging genitalia) to be fully buried, which is just a predecessor to our computational idea. Rodney A. Brooks makes this exact point. Philosopher Andy Clark even wants to kill the input-output model of perception, claiming we're ""proactive predictavores, forever trying to stay one step ahead"" of inputs that we, ourselves, choose and predict.A few wrote on ending our ideas of entropy, which stuck in my mind. They suggest this law of thermodynamics isn't quite what we assumed. 1 uses this to discuss how our universe's likely not uni-directional in time and is instead time-symmetric, in part meaning the universe cycles. The other uses it to suggest that perhaps we've mislabled it, and that things go not from ""order to disorder"" but from ""simple to complex"" in the 2nd law. This idea, especially, keeps rattling around in my skull. The suggestion's even made that perhaps entropy's like the first law, and if we could quantify complexity scales, we may find that in our infinite system entropy's constant, while constantly developing greater complexity in tiny areas to balance the simplicity of the vastness of empty space.1 expert writes that we need to stop letting our storytelling brains turn everything into cause and effect. Just as our observation of a particle doesn't ""cause"" its state, gene's don't cause cancer, markets here don't cause stock markets there to rise, etc.-such complex systems need to be viewed differently than simple cause and effects. This fits with the overall push in the collection to embrace complexity, as comes up later again in an essay on doing away with the fallacy of Moore's Law, which tries to predict the future and simplify progress while ignoring unpredictable social and political changes. Some psychologists agree with this a bit too, arguing mental illness isn't as simple as a brain illness.A biological anthropologist posits we need to kill the idea of race, since it's not at all scientific and basically meaningless. My worry about this is white people might end up doing the ""colorblind"" thing with racial issues. Even though race isn't real, it's real in people's minds, which matters on a day-to-day decision-making level. Perhaps doing away with it in science would help begin a positive shift away from it, but it's definitely an area that needs to be handled carefully.Richard Dawkins says we must retire essentialism. Stemming from Plato but possibly just human nature, we love to categorize and name, especially in black and white. So, considering black and white, we lump people into boxes by race, when it's a spectrum without borders. We have this same issue with abortion (when's a fetus a human?) and animals (when's it human enough to deserve rights?) and euthanasia (when's a person dead?) and psychology (when's it depression?) and even money (when's a person in poverty?). Like the calls to embrace complexity, Dawkins (and, later on, others including Alan Alda, in a way) calls to embrace the continuums of life.1 essay attacks a phrase I used just sentences before: human nature. This scientist says we all know some people are great, a few people suck, and most people are somewhere in between, that there's no real human nature, given the complexity and spectrum of our species. Another echoes this by explaining all ""hardwired"" traits are not permanent for the species. For example, we're not ""hardwired"" for violence as some have thought, science having shown the factors that increase and decrease the ""propensity"" for it. Multiple psychologists write on the complexity of human thought and emotion, including placing emotion as central to our thinking instead of an added flavor.One scientist wrote an interesting piece calling for an end to ""at all costs"" knowledge. The idea's that discovering the Higgs, for example, wasn't worth its price tag, especially when that same amount of money could've eradicated diseases through vaccines, as another example. He says, ""Some scientific knowledge is simply not worth the cost."" I think it's all about priorities, but it's also exceedingly difficult to measure the possible impact of any given research, let alone the direct and indirect impact of previous discoveries.There was a good point made in the destruction of our views of memory as ""immutable."" We've now found that remembering a long-term memory opens it up for reinterpretation and storage in its new form. This further ruins the already troubling issue of forgetting things. We use human memory for far too much, considering how inconsistent and unreliable it is.I also enjoyed the call to end our thinking of a free willing self, being a determinist. The essay makes the point that allowing choice/self creates an abrupt halt in ""causality when trying to understand thoughts and actions."" When we do this, we make it impossible ""to make progress in understanding how we really operate."" Another essay adds on that we now know all our choices come from meat, our brains, there's not some spirit guiding us. Second, the essay adds that brain scans show the meat deciding things before there's even awareness of having decided, suggesting our meat then slaps on a narrative that includes some semblance of a consistent character with agency. This second essay encourages the death of free will by making points that I've enjoyed about determinism as well: justice becomes a focus on rehabilitation as opposed to retribution, morality simplifies into an action's consequences without focus on the actor, and religions of choice begin to crumble. As the essay says, it's such a powerful trick our brains play, that we'll always act like we have free will, even if we know we don't. A psychologist later also questions our ideas of justice, as we see self-harm as mental illness but not other-harm.1 bit that blew my mind was an essay on how genetic mutation's not random. 1st of all, mutation increases under stress, such as predation, competition, environmental change, and so on. While there's an element of chaos here, it's cleaner and more efficient than I thought or was taught. It also nicely lines up with the entropy issue, as it seems that evolution trends toward complexity. This is all further complicated by a later essay on how we need to stop thinking of individuals as having 1 genome since we now have evidence of genetic mutations happening at any point in life. From this genetics section of the book, another essay tears down ""nature vs nurture"" using a combination of the ideas from other essays: that's too simple, environment and genetics are too interwoven to discern, epigenetics existing between the two, and so on. It's not one or the other ""side"" here, it's both. Even height, as the essay explains, is heritable only in the sense that genes and the environment you inherit (such as quality and quantity of food) impact it. The next essay goes so far as to say that EVERY gene expression depends on environment (relating to the stress mutations and such earlier). Furthermore, the essay after that goes into epigenetics and their heritability: mice taught to fear a neutral smell passed the fear on through genes and multiple generations. While we don't know what can be passed on in this manner, it means that people can possibly start/break genetic inheritance of some things like, perhaps, diabetes, obesity, addiction, and so on.Steven Pinker questions this in a cloudy essay. He makes the mistake of viewing the brain as a finished, final, unchanging product and of thinking of a phone as the same thing. He says inputs don't shape behavior, but they do in both cases. Everything you do on your phone's tracked and used by the software to better suck your time. Everything that happens around you changes your brain. He does make a good point about how everything isn't genes+environment, since there still appears to be randomness (such as the weighted randomness in gene mutation mentioned earlier).Some essays on science itself were also interesting. One pushed back on evidence-based medicine as the gold standard. Another questioned the strength of large randomized controlled trials. A psychology professor wants us to stop using multiple regression data analysis as science in and of itself and instead use it to suggest good experiments to run (which CAN find causal links) while others hate on other aspects and uses of statistics. A professor of medicine wants us to kill mouse models, not for ethical reasons but because they just don't work for most of medical research. Numerous experts dislike the institution of research publishing, longing for a modern technique to publish, revise, and refute. A few essays ask us to do away with anthropocentric science, as best we can given our human perception and such...An essay on doing away with the ""linear no-threshold radiation dose hypothesis"" points out that the hypothesis was a guess in the 1960s that stuck, and we now have evidence to believe that low levels of radiation are not at all harmful. As a fan of nuclear power, the essay points out how our unreasonable fear of radiation has increased costs of nuclear power and prevented it from helping lower pollution and/or slow climate change. The essay made me wonder how many more of these arbitrary guesses exist as untested fact in the world...A fun essay by Ian McEwan told us to ""beware of [our] arrogance"" and ""retire nothing!"" He makes the point that you learn from things other than the truth, that wrongness can contribute to methods, disciplines, and can come back around to ""rightness"" in some way after we learn more or apply it elsewhere. Thaler echoes this too. He wants us to keep ""wrong theories and hypotheses alive, but remember they're just hypotheses, not facts."" Another essay agrees, suggesting we lower the standards of correctness for publication.A mind-bending essay on killing the idea of continuous time explains how this ""Newtonian time"" is a fallacy, created by our brains so we can create coherent experiences of events that are ""atemporal"" - given speeds of light and sound as well as our brains' processing speeds of visual and auditory information, we're never in any sort of perception of a true ""present.""Another idea a few experts want to kill is economic growth (and its unlimited, eternal nature). Sadly, two experts want to kill stationarity, which is the idea that we can predict resources based on a big historical batch of data, thanks to things like climate change.A few different essays and experts want to do away with the idea of rational individuals. We're not rational. We're hardly individuals (as discussed previously). We're hugely irrational and impacted by social norms. (This idea shows up wonderfully in Ariely's Predictably Irrational.) It's complicated, as is everything.To finish, an essay wants to include the finding of new mysteries to our idea of ""progress."""
28,0062374346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8034370-grady,4,"Other books I've read in this series have not impressed me, but this year's question - what one idea is holding back progress and should be retired? - does well in this format. Editor John Brockman collects one to six page answers to the question from 174 academics, researchers, science writers, and a handful of non-scientist cultural figures. In general, the non-scientists' pieces are a little fuzzy and embarrassing. A handful of really well known scientists phone it in, and pieces in several of the disciplines break down on opposite sides of some predictable questions: is string theory misguided? Can we study consciousness in any meaningful way? But there are also some real gems in the collection, chapters that warrant putting the book down and walking away to go think about them.Some of my favorites, and the ideas they recommend ditching, included Nigel Goldenfeld (discrete individuality); Lee Smolin (that time started with the Big Bang0; Max Tegmark (infinity); Kevin Kelly (that genetic mutations are random); Eric Topol (that a person has a single genome); Richard Nesbitt (regression analysis as a means of discovering causality); Ernst Poppel (that time is continuous); and Neil Gershenfeld (that 'computer science' as currently taught is a real discipline). Some of these made arguments I've felt for a while without being able to articulate them; others are exactly opposite my intuitions, and have forced me to think my views through again. That's perhaps the best stimulation one can ask from a book like this. "
29,0062374346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39595324-jay-green,4,"I read the Edge books every year and always find something of interest. This year in particular - or rather, for the 2014 edition, I was pleasantly surprised to see so much scientific orthodoxy brought into question given the lay perception of science as close to completion and composed of immutable, universally agreed-upon laws. I only give four stars because the Edge community still appears unable to extend its philosophical community beyond a limited number of scientists-cum-philosophers who have a close-to-unanimous conception of consciousness that indicates either a failure of imagination or a familiarity with philosophy that does not extend to phenomenology and existentialism, as if these have nothing of value to say on the issue, despite themselves being materialist approaches to consciousness. A reading of Sartre's early works on the imagination and the imaginary would not go amiss. Of course, in saying this, I'm no different to the contributors to this book, harping on about their particular bugbear. :-)"

The reader to embark on edge book will benefit from gaining insight into every ""player's"" mind, insight into the source where new ideas about the future are emerging from (these Players are scientific disciplines). Every essay is a unique entity, usually written by renowned representative of that scientific discipline.For me, to the scientific reader, every EDGE book is a point of supply, the candle that is showing me, through ideas, book suggestions, where to sail on the oceans of knowledge!

For example whether left brain and right brain differences have any place in on going cognition research. I suggest that anyone who reads this book take it in small doses - a few chapters at a time as many of them take that long to digest and mull over.

47,0062374346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6093453-colin,4,"This Idea Must Die is a compilation of answers to a question posed by Edge magazine in 2014 to leading scientists and academics: what scientific idea is ready for retirement?The question is predicated on the often true assumption that new scientific ideas often gain traction at the expense of the old. Judging from the numbers, it seems that scientists in diverse disciplines, such as cosmology, theoretical physics, cognitive science, science studies, psychology, mathematics, biology, the social sciences, philosophy, and many others agree that their respective fields contain much antiquated cruft to be reconsidered.A broad summary of some controversial scientific ideas that were put forth for retirement include: 	 - The need for ""complete understanding"", leading to pushes for theories of everything, such as string/M-theory 	 - The idea of the anthropic principle - that the laws of physics are consistent, pre-ordained, or unique, and therefore tuned to support existence 	 - The idea that certain scientific precepts such as parsimony, falsifiability and replicability should be applied automatically to every scientific venture, especially in a causally complex world 	 - ""Essentialist"" analytical lenses that taxonomize based on ""innate"" criteria, such as race or gender 	 - Frameworks that rely on ""culture"" as the primary medium of memetic propagation, without explaining its mechanics (still quite controversial as the alternative is some form of evolutionary psychology) 	 - Essentializing differences between animals and humans, such as models of animal behavior that characterise them as mindless automata, or that humans are evolutionarily unique because of adaptations like language and tool-making 	 - Any distinction between ""nature"" and ""nurture"", or the idea that environmental factors can be taken in isolation from genetic ones when analysing traits and behaviors 	 - The idea that human intuition is consistent across culture, and can therefore be used as a basis for philosophical arguments (i.e. the ""intuition pump"") 	 - Current methodologies of scientific research, such as peer review, current ""results-oriented"" funding models, large randomised controlled trials, liberal application of arbitrary statistical rules like p-values, regression, standard deviations etc 	 - Taking statistical results from analysis of datasets as conclusive of a causal relation (such as in Big Data), rather than using those results as a starting point to conduct empirical studies to demonstrate causality  Many of these answers are not conclusive, and often, different answers may contradict each other in small or large ways. The cosmology section has scientists arguing for and against string theory, for example, with some using string theory's lack of options for empirical falsifiability as a basis for its rejection, with others declaiming the limits falsifiability when applied to this particular case.The anthology is rich, detailed, and the provocativeness of its question has allowed for a wide range and variety of answers across many fields. This quality makes it an often arresting read. If I had to suggest how to improve this book, however, I would say that it would benefit somewhat from a degree of curation. Not in the sense of content editing, because that would detract from the richness of the material, but in the sense of providing context and structure to the various answers.The book is already halfway there in that respect. There is a suggestion that the answers are roughly grouped by theme and discipline. Where this book could have done more would be to create explicit categories for certain groups of answers, in order to increase clarity for the reader. And in those categories, it might be beneficial to have a paragraph or two explaining the broad context and schools of thought underpinning those disciplines, in order to give a little bit more context to the layperson.Despite the above, however, I can see how more curated approach like the one I described might not be feasible from a process or person-oriented standpoint. Answerers may take issue with having their views categorized in ways that they do not like, or having their answers co-opted into a meta framework without their explicit consent. As it is, positioning without commentary may be the best that the editor can come up with to preserve the original texture and richness of his sources.I give this: 4 out of 5 wrong-but-useful ideas"

49,0062374346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4377693-pvw,2,"As in a previous edition of the Edge-question, it doesn't help that all the answers are arranged thematically, because you often get two or three essays in a row that basically carry the same message. But of course, nobody is forcing you to read this book from start to finish and maybe it was meant to skip through to the topics that interest you. It is Brockman's merit that he gets so many leading scientists in their field to write an answer to the challenging question he poses.The length of the essays varies from one to three pages. In this edition, I mostly liked these.Jerry Coyne on ""Free will"" - He neatly expresses the same views I had on this subject, and gets annoyed by the 'compatibilists' who desperately try to save some fringe of free will without succeeding. Furthermore, he examines the consequences of the non-existence of free will rather correctly I think, concluding that it is our moral duty to get as many people as possible convinced of the truth of determinism.Michael Norton, ""Markets are bad. Markets are good"" - The 99% will probably want you to believe that free markets are the origin of alle misery in the world. Neocapitalists will probably argue that only free enterprise can lead to prosperity. Norton claims they are both wrong. He says that markets are one of many products of humanity, and as such are both a little good and bad. The only option is accepting them and then trying to manage them in an intelligent and adult manner.Satyajit Das, ""Anthropocentricity"" - While we (well, some of us) know that most creation myths with man as their culmination are untrue fantasies created by man, we still tend to see most of history as having the survival of mankind as its ultimate goal. Satyajit Das pleads for some moderation of that view. He illustrates his point with a quote by the Cambridge professor Martin Rees, with which I'd like to conclude this review.""Most educated people are aware that we are the outcome of nearly 4 billion years of Darwinian selection, but many tend to think that humans are somehow the culmination. Our sun, however, is less than halfway through its life span. It will not be humans who watch the sun’s demise, 6 billion years from now. Any creatures that then exist will be as different from us as we are from bacteria or amoebae."""
50,0062374346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19428484-alex-passey,3,"Despite being an interesting and insightful book, this was mostly an indulgent rather than an educational read. While there were many provocative essays from brilliant minds, one couldn't help but often wish they were reading a more fully fleshed out manuscript by these authors, rather than reading a measly four pages, saying ""that's interesting"" before flipping on to the next essay where the last's content is mostly swept from your mind. Granted, this book does a fine job of encapsulating the nature of intellectual discourse, with all of its dissent, deviation and distractions. But at the same time, from the standpoint of myself as a layman on these topics, I would have rather read a full manuscript on any of these topics and be left with an at least semi-functional knowledge of one subject, rather than a mere fleeting glimpse of dozens of subjects. And I do say semi-functional, because one thing this book does a fine job exposing is that one can't sit down and a read a book by say Steven Pinker on psycho-linguistics or by Lawrence Krauss on astrophysics, and then presume that they have learned anything more than the perspective of a single mind on a topic that is awash in deviant perspectives from many equally brilliant minds. As unsatisfying as it may be to read in ""This Idea Must Die"" an essay that one finds quite poignant, only to turn the page and find an equally poignant essay that entirely negates the preceding essay, such is the aggravating nature of our sloppy epistemological evolution.So this was a fun and interesting book to read, but I think for the layman who just wants to find for themselves a working knowledge of these subjects so that they might at least educated themselves t the level of informed observer of these developments in intellectualism, there are definitely much better books out there."
51,0062374346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11673245-peter-gelfan,4,"I have become a big fan of Brockman’s Edge books, each of which provides a collection of brief, standalone descriptions of important and intriguing new ideas in science and philosophy. This one puts a twist on the process. It helps you decide which old ideas need to be tossed out. I learned some of these musty concepts decades ago in high school and college, and each time one disappears from my mental attic, I see how some of the remaining material fits together better and notice empty places calling for new ideas. The Zen of ignorance—learning by unlearning, knowing more by realizing I know less. How many times do I need to be reminded that false, assumed, pretended, or faithfully defended knowledge is worse than ignorance? Interestingly, and perhaps predictably or even inevitably, some of the contributors to the book commented on this subject as it relates to the strengths and weaknesses of science itself.Like many people, I suspect, I have tended to be a cognitive hoarder, jealously guarding my hard-won knowledge and trotting it out to amuse, amaze, and impress. This book suggests that instead, we should be cognitive curators, always reassessing, reevaluating, replacing, and not being too proud, stubborn, or invested to see the flaws in what we once bought into as a masterpiece."
52,0062374346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81884466-mendoza,3,"All these essays have one thing in common - they are too short to allow the exposition of a truly novel point of view. So the ideas being proposed for the chop are largely the ones you would expect. Still, some authors manage to put their point forward in a provocative manner, while others, amusingly, barely manage to disguise their spleen; surprisingly, few if any appear to be using the opportunity to hawk their latest book (watchful editor at work, maybe?)

I didnt realize at first, but essentially it is a composition of around 200 short chapters in which various authors of various fields independently answer a yearly question. Needless to say, most don't simply say what idea must die, but what also could replace it, either in terms of thinking paradigms, or genuine hypotheses. This book structure means that some authors attack the same problem, sometimes from the same side, others from opposite sides. Some will appeal more than others, but what I especially value is that this is literally thought provoking. I spent half the time staring into space digesting an idea to see if it made sense or not, or interupted the closest person to me to see what they thought. It's basically an exercise for the brain. "

The question is broad enough (this year: what theory is blocking scientific progress and must die?) that the responses are very wide ranging. Also, there isn't any collaboration between the authors so the answers are sometimes overlapping or completely contradictory, for better or worse. I did find one purpose that this book serves excellently. If you are in search of new books that pique your interest, I suggest reading this with the intent of finding potential authors. When you find an answer that resonates or intrigues you, take a look and see what books the author has written."

This is the book's greatest strength and worst weakness. With so many authors, the quality of each essay can vary widely. Some are beautifully and concisely written, and a few were almost incomprehensible. Most were in the middle. Some answers agree and some disagree, and comparing all of the different perspectives was fascinating. To get the most out of this book it should be read in chunks and mulled over.

The Idea Must Die is a compilation of over 150 separate articles, by different contributors, arguing that certain scientific concepts are blocking progress and should be put to rest. Its scope is very broad - at first I felt the book was concentrating on physics, but it later went on to include psychology, linguistics, genetics, criminology, economics and computer science. The title of each article comes from the concept that it is argued should be put to rest.There were plenty of articles I found interesting and learnt from, including: - “Long-term memory is immutable”, ""One genome per individual"", “Economic growth”, ""Intelligence as property"", ""Continuity of time"", Knowing is half the battle"" and ""Information overload"", “Essentialism”, ""Malthuanism"" (which is the idea that population will outstrip food supply). For the majority of the articles I agreed that the theory should be put to rest, and plenty that I thought it was good to see included. These included topics such as: race, nurture vs nature, reductionism. Cancer research theories were also addressed. There were several topics I was surprised to see argued against, such as evidence-based medicine, scientific method, evolution, carbon footprint, string theory, culture, science being self-correcting.It was refreshing to see ""We are stone age thinkers"" but I was disappointed to see the title ""Languages condition worldviews"". It was also a shame to see AI there, along with robot companions. Ideas in some chapters were disconcerting, claiming there's no self, no cognitive agency, and no free will. There was a potentially useful article entitled ""Scientific knowledge structured as literature"" suggesting how publication could move to a new updated method. With each article ranging in length from a mere 1 to 7 pages, it is an incredibly easy book to dip in and out of, or to fit around a busy week. At times there is a flow between one chapter and the next, but not always. Several of the articles proffer conflicting viewpoints, prompting the reader to reflect and wonder. Some articles are more-well written than others, and similarly some arguments are more strongly put forward. Usually only one argument is made per article, but at times there were several. I believe some of the articles were chosen for their brevity, which is a shame because some of the articles could use a stronger argument. Some articles are hard to get your head around. The language is not always accessible and often presumes reader already has some knowledge of the subject. Although intriguing to begin with, with so many articles it began to feel dry and laborious at about 60% through. Some articles I deliberately skipped, others I attempted but found impenetrable.It’s a refreshing read if you haven’t picked a science book in some time and it’s definitely a thought provoking read if you feel confident that you can get to grips with the material.For more of my reviews, check out www.bookblogbycari.com"
84,0062374346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/887347-uos-s,5,"2014's Edge.org question.I am trying to read one of these every year now - well, 2017's bled into 2018, but not by much. Anyway, why did this particular title stand out to me? I suppose most humans fear failure. Modern Western culture may have exascerbated this trend, especially for intellectuals, perhaps, because in school good performance is measured by how often you don't fail. But in the real world, there is alot of uncertainty. You can stick your head in the sand and never face it (this is not good science!), or you can go out and deal with it. The latter course will inevitably, sometimes, lead to failure. Physicist Frank Wilczek once said ""If you don't make mistakes, you're not working on hard enough problems. And that's a big mistake.""People don't like uncertainty. Voltaire once said: “Uncertainty is an uncomfortable position. But certainty is an absurd one.” Most people experience uncertainty as so profoundly uncomfortable, that they are constantly fleeing into the arms of illusions of certainty. It's a hard habit to break. Perhaps no one truly can remain vigilantly skeptical of everything. But, that's kind of what science is. And, by being willing to fail, and to identify failures and learn from them, that is how progress is made. But, most people don't see science in that light. They think sciece, or math, or experts, should be able to give them a final word of authority in any matter. So, when a previous scientific finding gives way to a newer, better one, the people who were expecting certainty feel let down, and give up on science, because they never really understood what it was about in the first place.I think alot of people who are ""anti-science"" would be drawn, in a gloating sort of fashion, towards a title like this. Well, in between the covers they would discover what scientific progress really is: lots of people trying their hardest and sometimes failing. But what's the alternative? To never try your hardest? To always fail? To remain convinced that all your failures have been successes and thus to live out your life in the comfortable dark of never feeling wrong?“Speak what you think today in hard words and tomorrow speak what tomorrow thinks in hard words again, though it contradict every thing you said today.” ― Ralph Waldo Emerson, Self-Reliance"

I thought the book would lend itself to my having a few minutes here and there in which to read. At the end of the trip, I was a little more than halfway through it. I figured that, with the trip over and with fewer distractions, I would be able to finish it in short order. Not so. It turns out that this is a book you can read only in small doses. That is in part due to the fact that each essay is a discrete thought - there is no extended argument or narrative to hold one's attention for more than a few minutes - and in part to the fact that the subject of each essay has some heft. As regards subject matter, I found occasional food for thought, although I suspect a professional scientist, which I am not, might find more. Ordinarily, when I finish reading a book like this, I find myself with at least a couple more books on my want-to-read list. Yet, despite the fact that a great many of the essayists were also published authors (two of whom wrote books I read previously), none of the essays inspired me to add new books to my list."

Others were informative, obvious, uninspired, flawed, straw-man attacks, semantic rants, or (in one case) loony. Most, however (even the loony one) were, in some way, thought provoking. (Although, to be honest, my first thought after reading the loony one was 'What fairy tale universe is this guy calling in from?') These, of course, are my personal, subjective impressions. Your opinions may vary. Regardless, the collection does provide insights into what some of the top experts in fields ranging from physics to psychology are thinking about, including issues on which they agree and disagree.

For example: - String theory is bad because it offers no disprovable hypotheses. / String theory *does* offer them. / Falsifiability is overrated/irrelevant anyway. - Two people both argue that X is bad, but for very different reasons. - And much more; I should have made notes.There were also plenty of interesting stand-alone essays.

Thematically, the collection moves from abstract and theoretical sciences to more tangible, anthropocentric sciences.

While the book skews heavily toward physics and neuroscience (not a bad thing), the inclusion of anthropology, statistics, and philosophy round out the ranks. The individual responses often inform other responses, with several topics being addressed both by proponents and opponents. Not the most thrilling read, but intellectually stimulating.

113,0062374346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45356441-cari-mayhew,3,"Book Review by Cari Mayhew.There’s nothing like reading a popular science book to make you feel more worldly wise! The Idea Must Die is a compilation of over 150 separate articles, by different contributors, arguing that certain scientific concepts are blocking progress and should be put to rest. Its scope is very broad - at first I felt the book was concentrating on physics, but it later went on to include psychology, linguistics, genetics, criminology, economics and computer science. The title of each article comes from the concept that it is argued should be put to rest.There were plenty of articles I found interesting and learnt from, including: - “Long-term memory is immutable”, ""One genome per individual"", “Economic growth”, ""Intelligence as property"", ""Continuity of time"", Knowing is half the battle"" and ""Information overload"", “Essentialism”, ""Malthuanism"" (which is the idea that population will outstrip food supply). For the majority of the articles I agreed that the theory should be put to rest, and plenty that I thought it was good to see included. These included topics such as: race, nurture vs nature, reductionism. Cancer research theories were also addressed. There were several topics I was surprised to see argued against, such as evidence-based medicine, scientific method, evolution, carbon footprint, string theory, culture, science being self-correcting.It was refreshing to see ""We are stone age thinkers"" but I was disappointed to see the title ""Languages condition worldviews"". It was also a shame to see AI there, along with robot companions. Ideas in some chapters were disconcerting, claiming there's no self, no cognitive agency, and no free will. There was a potentially useful article entitled ""Scientific knowledge structured as literature"" suggesting how publication could move to a new updated method. With each article ranging in length from a mere 1 to 7 pages, it is an incredibly easy book to dip in and out of, or to fit around a busy week. At times there is a flow between one chapter and the next, but not always. Several of the articles proffer conflicting viewpoints, prompting the reader to reflect and wonder. Some articles are more-well written than others, and similarly some arguments are more strongly put forward. Usually only one argument is made per article, but at times there were several. I believe some of the articles were chosen for their brevity, which is a shame because some of the articles could use a stronger argument. Some articles are hard to get your head around. The language is not always accessible and often presumes reader already has some knowledge of the subject. Although intriguing to begin with, with so many articles it began to feel dry and laborious at about 60% through. Some articles I deliberately skipped, others I attempted but found impenetrable.It’s a refreshing read if you haven’t picked a science book in some time and it’s definitely a thought provoking read if you feel confident that you can get to grips with the material.For more of my reviews, check out www.bookblogbycari.com"
114,0062374346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/887347-uos-s,5,"2014's Edge.org question.I am trying to read one of these every year now - well, 2017's bled into 2018, but not by much. Anyway, why did this particular title stand out to me? I suppose most humans fear failure. Modern Western culture may have exascerbated this trend, especially for intellectuals, perhaps, because in school good performance is measured by how often you don't fail. But in the real world, there is alot of uncertainty. You can stick your head in the sand and never face it (this is not good science!), or you can go out and deal with it. The latter course will inevitably, sometimes, lead to failure. Physicist Frank Wilczek once said ""If you don't make mistakes, you're not working on hard enough problems. And that's a big mistake.""People don't like uncertainty. Voltaire once said: “Uncertainty is an uncomfortable position. But certainty is an absurd one.” Most people experience uncertainty as so profoundly uncomfortable, that they are constantly fleeing into the arms of illusions of certainty. It's a hard habit to break. Perhaps no one truly can remain vigilantly skeptical of everything. But, that's kind of what science is. And, by being willing to fail, and to identify failures and learn from them, that is how progress is made. But, most people don't see science in that light. They think sciece, or math, or experts, should be able to give them a final word of authority in any matter. So, when a previous scientific finding gives way to a newer, better one, the people who were expecting certainty feel let down, and give up on science, because they never really understood what it was about in the first place.I think alot of people who are ""anti-science"" would be drawn, in a gloating sort of fashion, towards a title like this. Well, in between the covers they would discover what scientific progress really is: lots of people trying their hardest and sometimes failing. But what's the alternative? To never try your hardest? To always fail? To remain convinced that all your failures have been successes and thus to live out your life in the comfortable dark of never feeling wrong?“Speak what you think today in hard words and tomorrow speak what tomorrow thinks in hard words again, though it contradict every thing you said today.” ― Ralph Waldo Emerson, Self-Reliance"
115,0062374346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42769150-sparowhawke,3,"I took this book, a collection of essays averaging about three pages each, on a trip. I thought the book would lend itself to my having a few minutes here and there in which to read. At the end of the trip, I was a little more than halfway through it. I figured that, with the trip over and with fewer distractions, I would be able to finish it in short order. Not so. It turns out that this is a book you can read only in small doses. That is in part due to the fact that each essay is a discrete thought - there is no extended argument or narrative to hold one's attention for more than a few minutes - and in part to the fact that the subject of each essay has some heft. As regards subject matter, I found occasional food for thought, although I suspect a professional scientist, which I am not, might find more. Ordinarily, when I finish reading a book like this, I find myself with at least a couple more books on my want-to-read list. Yet, despite the fact that a great many of the essayists were also published authors (two of whom wrote books I read previously), none of the essays inspired me to add new books to my list."

Others were informative, obvious, uninspired, flawed, straw-man attacks, semantic rants, or (in one case) loony. Most, however (even the loony one) were, in some way, thought provoking. (Although, to be honest, my first thought after reading the loony one was 'What fairy tale universe is this guy calling in from?') These, of course, are my personal, subjective impressions. Your opinions may vary. Regardless, the collection does provide insights into what some of the top experts in fields ranging from physics to psychology are thinking about, including issues on which they agree and disagree.

The formula for many of the 200 mini op-eds in this book is as follows: take some popular scientific idea, claim it needs to be ""overturned"", proceed to argue against a very strawmanny, extreme version of that idea that is so unreasonable that no one actually holds it, conclude with a self congratulatory paragraph analyzing ""why people persist in believing X"". What's more, often the idea that advocate overturning isn't even wrong, it's just a truth that's accompanied by some other truths that the scientist would like to tell you about."

122,0062374346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50942504-jordan,3,"Don't come to this book looking for answers—many of the ideas presented to the chopping block are the proposed replacements of the ones that went before. About 20 pages are just people arguing about string theory, each one as convincing (or not, given that I can barely understand what they're talking about) as the last. That being said, it's still interesting to see the arguments play out, and I learned a thing or two. Weird that no one brought up information deficit theory though."

Sometimes this didn’t matter because people where speaking of their specific discipline and how the idea did or didn’t apply much anymore. I learned a lot and it made me think."

The Idea Must Die is a compilation of over 150 separate articles, by different contributors, arguing that certain scientific concepts are blocking progress and should be put to rest. Its scope is very broad - at first I felt the book was concentrating on physics, but it later went on to include psychology, linguistics, genetics, criminology, economics and computer science. The title of each article comes from the concept that it is argued should be put to rest.There were plenty of articles I found interesting and learnt from, including: - “Long-term memory is immutable”, ""One genome per individual"", “Economic growth”, ""Intelligence as property"", ""Continuity of time"", Knowing is half the battle"" and ""Information overload"", “Essentialism”, ""Malthuanism"" (which is the idea that population will outstrip food supply). For the majority of the articles I agreed that the theory should be put to rest, and plenty that I thought it was good to see included. These included topics such as: race, nurture vs nature, reductionism. Cancer research theories were also addressed. There were several topics I was surprised to see argued against, such as evidence-based medicine, scientific method, evolution, carbon footprint, string theory, culture, science being self-correcting.It was refreshing to see ""We are stone age thinkers"" but I was disappointed to see the title ""Languages condition worldviews"". It was also a shame to see AI there, along with robot companions. Ideas in some chapters were disconcerting, claiming there's no self, no cognitive agency, and no free will. There was a potentially useful article entitled ""Scientific knowledge structured as literature"" suggesting how publication could move to a new updated method. With each article ranging in length from a mere 1 to 7 pages, it is an incredibly easy book to dip in and out of, or to fit around a busy week. At times there is a flow between one chapter and the next, but not always. Several of the articles proffer conflicting viewpoints, prompting the reader to reflect and wonder. Some articles are more-well written than others, and similarly some arguments are more strongly put forward. Usually only one argument is made per article, but at times there were several. I believe some of the articles were chosen for their brevity, which is a shame because some of the articles could use a stronger argument. Some articles are hard to get your head around. The language is not always accessible and often presumes reader already has some knowledge of the subject. Although intriguing to begin with, with so many articles it began to feel dry and laborious at about 60% through. Some articles I deliberately skipped, others I attempted but found impenetrable.It’s a refreshing read if you haven’t picked a science book in some time and it’s definitely a thought provoking read if you feel confident that you can get to grips with the material.For more of my reviews, check out www.bookblogbycari.com"
174,0062374346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/887347-uos-s,5,"2014's Edge.org question.I am trying to read one of these every year now - well, 2017's bled into 2018, but not by much. Anyway, why did this particular title stand out to me? I suppose most humans fear failure. Modern Western culture may have exascerbated this trend, especially for intellectuals, perhaps, because in school good performance is measured by how often you don't fail. But in the real world, there is alot of uncertainty. You can stick your head in the sand and never face it (this is not good science!), or you can go out and deal with it. The latter course will inevitably, sometimes, lead to failure. Physicist Frank Wilczek once said ""If you don't make mistakes, you're not working on hard enough problems. And that's a big mistake.""People don't like uncertainty. Voltaire once said: “Uncertainty is an uncomfortable position. But certainty is an absurd one.” Most people experience uncertainty as so profoundly uncomfortable, that they are constantly fleeing into the arms of illusions of certainty. It's a hard habit to break. Perhaps no one truly can remain vigilantly skeptical of everything. But, that's kind of what science is. And, by being willing to fail, and to identify failures and learn from them, that is how progress is made. But, most people don't see science in that light. They think sciece, or math, or experts, should be able to give them a final word of authority in any matter. So, when a previous scientific finding gives way to a newer, better one, the people who were expecting certainty feel let down, and give up on science, because they never really understood what it was about in the first place.I think alot of people who are ""anti-science"" would be drawn, in a gloating sort of fashion, towards a title like this. Well, in between the covers they would discover what scientific progress really is: lots of people trying their hardest and sometimes failing. But what's the alternative? To never try your hardest? To always fail? To remain convinced that all your failures have been successes and thus to live out your life in the comfortable dark of never feeling wrong?“Speak what you think today in hard words and tomorrow speak what tomorrow thinks in hard words again, though it contradict every thing you said today.” ― Ralph Waldo Emerson, Self-Reliance"
175,0062374346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42769150-sparowhawke,3,"I took this book, a collection of essays averaging about three pages each, on a trip. I thought the book would lend itself to my having a few minutes here and there in which to read. At the end of the trip, I was a little more than halfway through it. I figured that, with the trip over and with fewer distractions, I would be able to finish it in short order. Not so. It turns out that this is a book you can read only in small doses. That is in part due to the fact that each essay is a discrete thought - there is no extended argument or narrative to hold one's attention for more than a few minutes - and in part to the fact that the subject of each essay has some heft. As regards subject matter, I found occasional food for thought, although I suspect a professional scientist, which I am not, might find more. Ordinarily, when I finish reading a book like this, I find myself with at least a couple more books on my want-to-read list. Yet, despite the fact that a great many of the essayists were also published authors (two of whom wrote books I read previously), none of the essays inspired me to add new books to my list."

This collection of short essays provides answers from ""175 of the world's most influential scientists, economists, artists, and philosophers"" (according to the blurb on the back cover). I found it to be a mixed bag, as you might expect. A few were insightful. Several were interesting. Others were informative, obvious, uninspired, flawed, straw-man attacks, semantic rants, or (in one case) loony. Most, however (even the loony one) were, in some way, thought provoking. (Although, to be honest, my first thought after reading the loony one was 'What fairy tale universe is this guy calling in from?') These, of course, are my personal, subjective impressions. Your opinions may vary. Regardless, the collection does provide insights into what some of the top experts in fields ranging from physics to psychology are thinking about, including issues on which they agree and disagree.

For example: - String theory is bad because it offers no disprovable hypotheses. / String theory *does* offer them. / Falsifiability is overrated/irrelevant anyway. - Two people both argue that X is bad, but for very different reasons. - And much more; I should have made notes.There were also plenty of interesting stand-alone essays.

While the book skews heavily toward physics and neuroscience (not a bad thing), the inclusion of anthropology, statistics, and philosophy round out the ranks. The individual responses often inform other responses, with several topics being addressed both by proponents and opponents. Not the most thrilling read, but intellectually stimulating.

Some articles are more-well written than others, and similarly some arguments are more strongly put forward. Usually only one argument is made per article, but at times there were several. I believe some of the articles were chosen for their brevity, which is a shame because some of the articles could use a stronger argument. Some articles are hard to get your head around. The language is not always accessible and often presumes reader already has some knowledge of the subject. Although intriguing to begin with, with so many articles it began to feel dry and laborious at about 60% through. Some articles I deliberately skipped, others I attempted but found impenetrable.It’s a refreshing read if you haven’t picked a science book in some time and it’s definitely a thought provoking read if you feel confident that you can get to grips with the material.For more of my reviews, check out www.bookblogbycari.com"
204,0062374346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/887347-uos-s,5,"2014's Edge.org question.I am trying to read one of these every year now - well, 2017's bled into 2018, but not by much. Anyway, why did this particular title stand out to me? I suppose most humans fear failure. Modern Western culture may have exascerbated this trend, especially for intellectuals, perhaps, because in school good performance is measured by how often you don't fail. But in the real world, there is alot of uncertainty. You can stick your head in the sand and never face it (this is not good science!), or you can go out and deal with it. The latter course will inevitably, sometimes, lead to failure. Physicist Frank Wilczek once said ""If you don't make mistakes, you're not working on hard enough problems. And that's a big mistake.""People don't like uncertainty. Voltaire once said: “Uncertainty is an uncomfortable position. But certainty is an absurd one.” Most people experience uncertainty as so profoundly uncomfortable, that they are constantly fleeing into the arms of illusions of certainty. It's a hard habit to break. Perhaps no one truly can remain vigilantly skeptical of everything. But, that's kind of what science is. And, by being willing to fail, and to identify failures and learn from them, that is how progress is made. But, most people don't see science in that light. They think sciece, or math, or experts, should be able to give them a final word of authority in any matter. So, when a previous scientific finding gives way to a newer, better one, the people who were expecting certainty feel let down, and give up on science, because they never really understood what it was about in the first place.I think alot of people who are ""anti-science"" would be drawn, in a gloating sort of fashion, towards a title like this. Well, in between the covers they would discover what scientific progress really is: lots of people trying their hardest and sometimes failing. But what's the alternative? To never try your hardest? To always fail? To remain convinced that all your failures have been successes and thus to live out your life in the comfortable dark of never feeling wrong?“Speak what you think today in hard words and tomorrow speak what tomorrow thinks in hard words again, though it contradict every thing you said today.” ― Ralph Waldo Emerson, Self-Reliance"

I thought the book would lend itself to my having a few minutes here and there in which to read. At the end of the trip, I was a little more than halfway through it. I figured that, with the trip over and with fewer distractions, I would be able to finish it in short order. Not so. It turns out that this is a book you can read only in small doses. That is in part due to the fact that each essay is a discrete thought - there is no extended argument or narrative to hold one's attention for more than a few minutes - and in part to the fact that the subject of each essay has some heft. As regards subject matter, I found occasional food for thought, although I suspect a professional scientist, which I am not, might find more. Ordinarily, when I finish reading a book like this, I find myself with at least a couple more books on my want-to-read list.

The Idea Must Die is a compilation of over 150 separate articles, by different contributors, arguing that certain scientific concepts are blocking progress and should be put to rest. Its scope is very broad - at first I felt the book was concentrating on physics, but it later went on to include psychology, linguistics, genetics, criminology, economics and computer science. The title of each article comes from the concept that it is argued should be put to rest.There were plenty of articles I found interesting and learnt from, including: - “Long-term memory is immutable”, ""One genome per individual"", “Economic growth”, ""Intelligence as property"", ""Continuity of time"", Knowing is half the battle"" and ""Information overload"", “Essentialism”, ""Malthuanism"" (which is the idea that population will outstrip food supply). For the majority of the articles I agreed that the theory should be put to rest, and plenty that I thought it was good to see included. These included topics such as: race, nurture vs nature, reductionism. Cancer research theories were also addressed. There were several topics I was surprised to see argued against, such as evidence-based medicine, scientific method, evolution, carbon footprint, string theory, culture, science being self-correcting.It was refreshing to see ""We are stone age thinkers"" but I was disappointed to see the title ""Languages condition worldviews"". It was also a shame to see AI there, along with robot companions. Ideas in some chapters were disconcerting, claiming there's no self, no cognitive agency, and no free will. There was a potentially useful article entitled ""Scientific knowledge structured as literature"" suggesting how publication could move to a new updated method. With each article ranging in length from a mere 1 to 7 pages, it is an incredibly easy book to dip in and out of, or to fit around a busy week. At times there is a flow between one chapter and the next, but not always. Several of the articles proffer conflicting viewpoints, prompting the reader to reflect and wonder. Some articles are more-well written than others, and similarly some arguments are more strongly put forward. Usually only one argument is made per article, but at times there were several.

263,0062374346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45356441-cari-mayhew,3,"Book Review by Cari Mayhew.There’s nothing like reading a popular science book to make you feel more worldly wise! The Idea Must Die is a compilation of over 150 separate articles, by different contributors, arguing that certain scientific concepts are blocking progress and should be put to rest. Its scope is very broad - at first I felt the book was concentrating on physics, but it later went on to include psychology, linguistics, genetics, criminology, economics and computer science. The title of each article comes from the concept that it is argued should be put to rest.There were plenty of articles I found interesting and learnt from, including: - “Long-term memory is immutable”, ""One genome per individual"", “Economic growth”, ""Intelligence as property"", ""Continuity of time"", Knowing is half the battle"" and ""Information overload"", “Essentialism”, ""Malthuanism"" (which is the idea that population will outstrip food supply). For the majority of the articles I agreed that the theory should be put to rest, and plenty that I thought it was good to see included. These included topics such as: race, nurture vs nature, reductionism. Cancer research theories were also addressed. There were several topics I was surprised to see argued against, such as evidence-based medicine, scientific method, evolution, carbon footprint, string theory, culture, science being self-correcting.It was refreshing to see ""We are stone age thinkers"" but I was disappointed to see the title ""Languages condition worldviews"". It was also a shame to see AI there, along with robot companions. Ideas in some chapters were disconcerting, claiming there's no self, no cognitive agency, and no free will. There was a potentially useful article entitled ""Scientific knowledge structured as literature"" suggesting how publication could move to a new updated method. With each article ranging in length from a mere 1 to 7 pages, it is an incredibly easy book to dip in and out of, or to fit around a busy week. At times there is a flow between one chapter and the next, but not always. Several of the articles proffer conflicting viewpoints, prompting the reader to reflect and wonder. Some articles are more-well written than others, and similarly some arguments are more strongly put forward. Usually only one argument is made per article, but at times there were several. I believe some of the articles were chosen for their brevity, which is a shame because some of the articles could use a stronger argument. Some articles are hard to get your head around. The language is not always accessible and often presumes reader already has some knowledge of the subject. Although intriguing to begin with, with so many articles it began to feel dry and laborious at about 60% through. Some articles I deliberately skipped, others I attempted but found impenetrable.It’s a refreshing read if you haven’t picked a science book in some time and it’s definitely a thought provoking read if you feel confident that you can get to grips with the material.For more of my reviews, check out www.bookblogbycari.com"
264,0062374346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/887347-uos-s,5,"2014's Edge.org question.I am trying to read one of these every year now - well, 2017's bled into 2018, but not by much. Anyway, why did this particular title stand out to me? I suppose most humans fear failure. Modern Western culture may have exascerbated this trend, especially for intellectuals, perhaps, because in school good performance is measured by how often you don't fail. But in the real world, there is alot of uncertainty. You can stick your head in the sand and never face it (this is not good science!), or you can go out and deal with it. The latter course will inevitably, sometimes, lead to failure. Physicist Frank Wilczek once said ""If you don't make mistakes, you're not working on hard enough problems. And that's a big mistake.""People don't like uncertainty. Voltaire once said: “Uncertainty is an uncomfortable position. But certainty is an absurd one.” Most people experience uncertainty as so profoundly uncomfortable, that they are constantly fleeing into the arms of illusions of certainty. It's a hard habit to break. Perhaps no one truly can remain vigilantly skeptical of everything. But, that's kind of what science is. And, by being willing to fail, and to identify failures and learn from them, that is how progress is made. But, most people don't see science in that light. They think sciece, or math, or experts, should be able to give them a final word of authority in any matter. So, when a previous scientific finding gives way to a newer, better one, the people who were expecting certainty feel let down, and give up on science, because they never really understood what it was about in the first place.I think alot of people who are ""anti-science"" would be drawn, in a gloating sort of fashion, towards a title like this. Well, in between the covers they would discover what scientific progress really is: lots of people trying their hardest and sometimes failing. But what's the alternative? To never try your hardest? To always fail? To remain convinced that all your failures have been successes and thus to live out your life in the comfortable dark of never feeling wrong?“Speak what you think today in hard words and tomorrow speak what tomorrow thinks in hard words again, though it contradict every thing you said today.” ― Ralph Waldo Emerson, Self-Reliance"
265,0062374346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42769150-sparowhawke,3,"I took this book, a collection of essays averaging about three pages each, on a trip. I thought the book would lend itself to my having a few minutes here and there in which to read. At the end of the trip, I was a little more than halfway through it. I figured that, with the trip over and with fewer distractions, I would be able to finish it in short order. Not so. It turns out that this is a book you can read only in small doses. That is in part due to the fact that each essay is a discrete thought - there is no extended argument or narrative to hold one's attention for more than a few minutes - and in part to the fact that the subject of each essay has some heft. As regards subject matter, I found occasional food for thought, although I suspect a professional scientist, which I am not, might find more. Ordinarily, when I finish reading a book like this, I find myself with at least a couple more books on my want-to-read list. Yet, despite the fact that a great many of the essayists were also published authors (two of whom wrote books I read previously), none of the essays inspired me to add new books to my list."

This collection of short essays provides answers from ""175 of the world's most influential scientists, economists, artists, and philosophers"" (according to the blurb on the back cover). I found it to be a mixed bag, as you might expect. A few were insightful. Several were interesting. Others were informative, obvious, uninspired, flawed, straw-man attacks, semantic rants, or (in one case) loony. Most, however (even the loony one) were, in some way, thought provoking. (Although, to be honest, my first thought after reading the loony one was 'What fairy tale universe is this guy calling in from?') These, of course, are my personal, subjective impressions. Your opinions may vary. Regardless, the collection does provide insights into what some of the top experts in fields ranging from physics to psychology are thinking about, including issues on which they agree and disagree. (I imagine there are some lively...discussions between physicists during breaks at conferences about String Theory)."

For example: - String theory is bad because it offers no disprovable hypotheses. / String theory *does* offer them. / Falsifiability is overrated/irrelevant anyway. - Two people both argue that X is bad, but for very different reasons. - And much more; I should have made notes.There were also plenty of interesting stand-alone essays. Example: I would never have guessed that Freeman Dyson would be writing about *that*. (Sorry for the click-bait.)I'll be checking out other books that John Brockman has compiled/edited."

Thematically, the collection moves from abstract and theoretical sciences to more tangible, anthropocentric sciences. Reading in a linear fashion delivers a smooth but vast breadth of leading opinions on controversial topics across many domains of inquiry. It also allows for easy rereading of particular topics. While the book skews heavily toward physics and neuroscience (not a bad thing), the inclusion of anthropology, statistics, and philosophy round out the ranks. The individual responses often inform other responses, with several topics being addressed both by proponents and opponents. Not the most thrilling read, but intellectually stimulating. It'll serve as a wonderful reference for sparking thought about hard issues in modern science and society."

The formula for many of the 200 mini op-eds in this book is as follows: take some popular scientific idea, claim it needs to be ""overturned"", proceed to argue against a very strawmanny, extreme version of that idea that is so unreasonable that no one actually holds it, conclude with a self congratulatory paragraph analyzing ""why people persist in believing X"". What's more, often the idea that advocate overturning isn't even wrong, it's just a truth that's accompanied by some other truths that the scientist would like to tell you about."

That being said, it's still interesting to see the arguments play out, and I learned a thing or two. Weird that no one brought up information deficit theory though."

Others were informative, obvious, uninspired, flawed, straw-man attacks, semantic rants, or (in one case) loony. Most, however (even the loony one) were, in some way, thought provoking. (Although, to be honest, my first thought after reading the loony one was 'What fairy tale universe is this guy calling in from?') These, of course, are my personal, subjective impressions. Your opinions may vary. Regardless, the collection does provide insights into what some of the top experts in fields ranging from physics to psychology are thinking about, including issues on which they agree and disagree. (I imagine there are some lively...discussions between physicists during breaks at conferences about String Theory)."

For example: - String theory is bad because it offers no disprovable hypotheses. / String theory *does* offer them. / Falsifiability is overrated/irrelevant anyway. - Two people both argue that X is bad, but for very different reasons. - And much more; I should have made notes.There were also plenty of interesting stand-alone essays. Example: I would never have guessed that Freeman Dyson would be writing about *that*. (Sorry for the click-bait.)I'll be checking out other books that John Brockman has compiled/edited."

Thematically, the collection moves from abstract and theoretical sciences to more tangible, anthropocentric sciences. Reading in a linear fashion delivers a smooth but vast breadth of leading opinions on controversial topics across many domains of inquiry. It also allows for easy rereading of particular topics. While the book skews heavily toward physics and neuroscience (not a bad thing), the inclusion of anthropology, statistics, and philosophy round out the ranks. The individual responses often inform other responses, with several topics being addressed both by proponents and opponents. Not the most thrilling read, but intellectually stimulating. It'll serve as a wonderful reference for sparking thought about hard issues in modern science and society."

The formula for many of the 200 mini op-eds in this book is as follows: take some popular scientific idea, claim it needs to be ""overturned"", proceed to argue against a very strawmanny, extreme version of that idea that is so unreasonable that no one actually holds it, conclude with a self congratulatory paragraph analyzing ""why people persist in believing X"". What's more, often the idea that advocate overturning isn't even wrong, it's just a truth that's accompanied by some other truths that the scientist would like to tell you about."
