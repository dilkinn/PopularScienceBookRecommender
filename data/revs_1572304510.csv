0,1572304510,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83582-bill-kerwin,5,"Since I keep obsessing about our American president, trying to decide if the man is indeed a psychopath or merely an elite narcissist, I thought I should seek out an authoritative book on the subject. Although it is too old to include cutting edge research (twenty-two years old, to be exact), I believe Without Conscience is as close as I will come to a definitive popular treatment. This is because it was written by Robert D. Hare.So who is Robert D. Hare? He is the Canadian psychology professor who, through many years of prison research, developed the Psychopathy Checklist (not without its critics, but still used extensively in prisons and maximum security psychiatric units). He was the first recipient of the lifetime achievement award of the Society for the Scientific Study of Psychopathy in 2005. And what was the name of the award he received? The Robert D. Hare Lifetime Achievement Award.Hare speaks with authority, and supports his list of psychopathic traits with chilling excerpts from researcher’s interviews with psychopaths and a host of illuminating anecdotes. I am sure you are familiar with the common psychopathic traits—or you wouldn’t be interested in reading this review—so I won’t bore you with listing them here. I will, however, mention a few things that struck me while reading Hare:1) The psychopath must always be examined by a trained clinical evaluator. You can never trust a psychopath to self-report on a survey, for they lie every time they open their mouths.2) A diagnosis of psychopathy should not be given lightly. Many people at certain times may exhibit psychopathic behaviors, but only the whole constellation of symptoms will be present in the genuine psychopath.3) One of the most remarkable things about the psychopath is that he can make contradictory claims within the same sentence, and not notice that there is a problem. For example, listen to this armed robber on trial, in an outburst against an eyewitness: “He’s lying. I wasn’t there. I should have blown his fucking head off.” (This is one of the characteristics that most reminded me of Trump.)4) Any treatment program designed to evoke empathy in the psychopath is doomed to failure. Instead, the purpose of treatment must be to convince him that he himself—the only one of course who matters—will be happier in the long run if he can modify his behavior, keep a job, and stay out of prison.5) Psychopaths hate other psychopaths, although they may occasionally team-up. After all, how can two people possibly get along when each one is the most important person in the world?6) Here is a cheery thought. The percentage of psychopaths in our society may be increasing. Part of psychopathy may be genetic, and psychopaths, being irresponsible, tend to reproduce at a higher rate than the rest of us. Ergo, more psychopaths!I will end with one of Hare’s anecdotes. It is a minor incident (compared to the serial killers, at least), but it sums up perfectly how the psychopathic mind operates:
One of our subjects, who scored high on the “Psychopathic Checklist,” said that while walking to a party he decided to buy a case of beer, but realized that he had left his wallet at home six or seven blocks away. Not wanting to walk back, he picked up a heavy piece of wood and robbed the nearest gas station, seriously injuring the attendant.
Oh...I almost forgot to tell you what I concluded about Donald Trump. Well, I will be cautious, as Hare advises, and not label our president a psychopath. He may not possess all of the traits, and my excessive, compulsive viewing of MSNBC certainly doesn't qualify as a clinical study. Besides, I have decided on a term I prefer. “Malignant narcissist. ” I like the sound of that."

2,1572304510,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1309716-sarah,3,"Dr. Robert Hare: This book is about psychopaths...Sarah: With hearts of gold?DRH: No, they're pretty heartless, actually.Sarah: Because they need love?DRH: No. They're clinical psychopaths.Sarah: Aw. They must be so sad.DRH: Not really.Sarah: So, basically, what you're saying here is...they'll change? I can change them?DRH: You're an unbelievable idiot.Sarah: I love you. Call me!But seriously...I do kinda wish this book had gone into a bit more depth: psychopathy as a neurological state, psychopathy as a psychological mechanism, psychopathy as a concept and world view, its role in our culture, and so forth. Instead of choosing his model and going with it, or examining the various dimensions in turn, the author seems to get bogged down in defining the term, itself. (I, myself, kinda prefer the term ""sociopath."")(Sounds less...murdery.)(But I digress.)One question Hare kept returning to was, ""Are they mad or are they bad?""They're bad. Obviously. But their ""badness"" appears to be rooted in a learning disability coupled with environmental factors.""Should they be held accountable?""Yes, of course. Culpable persons should most certainly be held accountable. But they're not accountable. They lack a sense of personal accountability. That's...kinda the whole thing. So...?To me, the real question is, ""In dealing with psychopaths, to what extent should we operate within the psychopath's own world paradigm?"" My personal opinion is, not at all.* We should not adopt a punitive world view; Nor should we enable them with kindness. Collectively, we should focus on the science and hold fast to our own nonnegotiable truths. Unfortunately, the science just isn't there. (Or wasn't at the time of this writing.) And there we are.Hare cautions us against diagnosing our loved ones, but since he gives us nothing more than a behavior cluster, diagnostics is all it is. Still, I think it's a useful book to have read.*Edited to add: There seems to be some confusion about this statement. When I said that we shouldn't operate within the psychopath's world paradigm, I meant that we should reject it in its entirety. That extends to playing a codependent role within the paradigm. As with anything, there's a danger in going to extremes: reacting rather than acting autonomously from a secure and healthy sense of self. In knowing your own mind, you can step outside the circle of fight vs. enable. Fear, itself, reinforces black and white thinking and locks you into the abuser's construct. Healthy compassion, by contrast, concedes no ground. Healthy assertiveness is not psychopathy.The Checklist:Factor 1: Personality ""Aggressive narcissism""Glibness/superficial charmGrandiose sense of self-worthPathological lyingConning/manipulativeLack of remorse or guiltShallow affect (genuine emotion is short-lived and egocentric)Callousness; lack of empathyFailure to accept responsibility for his or her own actionsFactor 2: Case history ""Socially deviant lifestyle.""Need for stimulation/proneness to boredomParasitic lifestylePoor behavioral controlLack of realistic long-term goalsImpulsivityIrresponsibilityJuvenile delinquencyEarly behavior problemsRevocation of conditional releaseTraits not correlated with either factorPromiscuous sexual behaviorMany short-term (marital) relationshipsCriminal versatilityAcquired behavioural sociopathy/sociological conditioning (i.e., a person relying on sociological strategies and tricks to deceive)"
3,1572304510,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12620745-debbie-dj,4,"I really enjoyed listening to this one. The author would make a statement, then provide numerous examples. Totally debunked my idea of a psychopath. Psychopaths lack empathy, but are experts at covering this flaw. While most are not killers, those that are, are the ones we hear most about as their lack of empathy leads to the most grizzly of murders. Most psychopaths are world class con artists tricking even the best psychiatrists. While there is no single test, what I found the most interesting is the vacant look in their eyes. If fact, it seems to be the only trait recognizable in all psychopaths...and there are a lot more than I ever realized. "
4,1572304510,http://goodreads.com/user/show/121445-n,4,"I was watching Doctor Who yesterday, and the Doctor, ever the optimist, said something like, “people are good, down in their bones”.Well.Nice thought.What about the psychopaths, though?In Without Conscience, Robert Hare posits that there are some 2million psychopaths in the United States (and approximately 20% of the prison population is comprised of psychopaths). It’s something that doesn’t necessarily correlate with childhood abuse; some people are just bad, down in their bones. Of course, there are the exceptional serial killer cases like Ted Bundy, but most psychopaths are more banal in their wrongdoing: they just lie and cheat their way through life remorselessly.There seem to be a good few books about psychopaths on the market, but I chose to read this one because it’s written by a psychologist, not a journalist. (Sniff, sniff.) Hare is occasionally guilty of slipping into dry academiaspeak, but for the most part, he presents an easy-to-read book. It’s no hyperbole to say that Without is GRIPPING. Most people – well, most people who watch pop culture crap like Criminal Minds, *ahem* – are familiar with the popular stereotypes of psychopathy, but the reality is almost creepier. Without is filled with chilling case studies of psychopaths that Hare has encountered.Recommended."
5,1572304510,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1180394-maureen,1,"Dr. Robert Hare has a theory he calls ""psychopathy,"" that he uses to describes anyone whose behavior doesn't conform to his standards. He has tried for years to get it into the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, the psychiatrists' and psychologists' main reference work. Its editors have rejected Dr. Hare's proposition as being too vague. Still, people will read this and think that their landlord or the guy next to them on the bus is a psychopath. I have read many useful psychological evaluation books. This is most decidedly not one of them."

7,1572304510,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57158143-bibliovoracious,5,"Psychopathy is NOT insanity. Psychopaths are not all criminals, nor in jail - they are in fact sprinkled throughout the population, and almost EVERYONE has interacted with at least one. There are far MORE of them rolling around than one might think. These are some of the revelations that overturned my preconceived notions. A diagnosis of psychopathy is actually an ironclad diagnosis of SANity- one who knows exactly what they are doing, but doesn't care how it affects another. Very chilling. The title rather sums it up. A psychopath acts as though they have no conscience, like they lack a piece that others share and take for granted in others- the ability to imagine how their actions might hurt someone or care about it. Those missing this piece are always a little apart from society and act accordingly, driven by a cold selfishness, and usually faking human, aka empathic relationships.Some psychopaths are rapists and serial killers, perfectly oblivious to their victims' pain, but some are blithely conducting non-criminal business, but still distributing pain and suffering, as ruthless executives, terrible roommates, miserable spouses or neighbours, and incomprehensibly mean, unfeeling children.There is no ""why"" in the research yet. Psychopathy can appear early, in children of model parents, and has no cure. It's a mystery why some people are psychopaths (or the synonymous sociopaths), and there's no way to help them. But there is a definition. Yay! Very uplifting! This is a very chilling book by the doctor who defined psychopathy and created the Hare checklist for diagnosing psychopaths. What there is, is relief for parents of children who mysteriously kill animals and are cruel to other children: it is not the parents fault. There is relief for people who cannot comprehend why someone is hurting them with a shocking absence of sympathy. If someone has done something truly incomprehensible to you, it might be worth reading this book. It may remain impossible to comprehend (like imagining a human who doesn't breathe), but it will provide a comfortable label and information. After all, statistically we are all probably going to interact with one at some point in our lives."
8,1572304510,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5237420-ana,5,"For anyone who ever studied Forensic Psychology, Hare is a God and nothing less. Him and Cleckley are the first ever mentioned in relation to psychopathy and its clinical measurement or diagnosis, as well as any treatment possibility. I loved every second of this book, not just because it provided me with so much insight into different psychopathic killers that I already knew of, but because it provides statistical data and studies of different crimes that can be done by psychopaths, how their minds tend to work and how difficult it actually is to spot one of them, or even to fully diagnose them. Totally recommend this to anyone with an interest in forensic psychology or ""errors"" of the mind."
9,1572304510,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3335664-david,3,"This was not a very good book. Having listened to several audiobooks about psychopaths, notably Martha Stout's The Sociopath Next Door and Jon Ronson's The Psychopath Test, I think the lesson learned here is that journalists are better writers than academics.Criminal psychologist Robert Hare is famous for having devised the Hare Psychopathy Checklist, which is referenced several times by Stout and Ronson. However, in this book he spends entirely too much time talking about how much research he's done and how clever he is to have formulated this unique way of studying and understanding psychopaths, yet the actual evidence he cites is largely anecdotal and even speculative at times. I started to doubt the doc's credibility about the third time he used fictional characters (e.g., Hannibal Lecter, Buffalo Bill) to make a point.He does this throughout Without Conscience: he will describe psychopathic behavior, and then use a sensationalist example, often from a movie! He talks about psychopaths as if they are monsters who are practically a separate species. Granted, many psychopaths, even those who aren't murderers, are monsters. But it hardly seems useful or truly serving the cause of truthful inquiry to dwell on how horrible psychopaths are, using serial killers as the primary examples, even though Hare himself admits that serial killers are an extreme minority of psychopaths, rather than addressing more interesting and informative questions like how to identify psychopaths and what to do about them.Martha Stout and Jon Ronson cover much the same ground, and while of course they talk about the most spectacular, cruel, and flamboyant psychopaths as well — serial killers, bigamists, con-men, etc. — they do both more entertainingly and with a little more sense of balance, addressing the fact that most psychopaths, while horrible people to deal with, live fairly ordinary lives (often miserable ones), doing as much damage to themselves as others. Whereas Hare seems to want everyone to hire a professional like himself and apply the Hare Psychopathy Checklist whenever you suspect you're dealing with a psychopath, which could be anyone who exhibits any psychopathic behaviors.Here is where Hare's book also seems to flounder: he uses many examples of psychopathic behavior, and conflates them with psychopaths. Rapists, for example, are ""often"" psychopaths, he says. Yet while noting that not all rapists are psychopaths and not all psychopaths are rapists, Hare then goes on to describe rape as a crime that is typical of a psychopathic mindset, the extreme lack of empathy for others, the lack of impulse control, etc. Okay, and? What does this actually tell us about the relationship between rape and psychopathy?He makes vague assertions about how various crimes, from stock market manipulation to government fraud and abuse to violent crime, ""may"" be the result of psychopaths, and that this is evident of the massive social and economic damage psychopaths do. Well, yes, I'm sure a lot of Wall Street predators and street-level grifters and conniving, bad people everywhere in-between are psychopaths, but not all of them, so just how many are and what is the measurable contribution of psychopaths to our social ills? It's impossible to say, but Hare just hints that psychopaths are becoming more common, as evidenced by how much ""worse"" society is getting - again, with no evidence.The few chapters that were interesting and informative were those that talked about what makes a psychopath's brain different — they seem to often have linguistic mannerisms like misusing words or inventing neologisms, and they also seem to often have poor impulse control, an inability to control themselves even when they may be very smart and quite capable of foreseeing the consequences of their actions. This would also explain why psychopaths tend to get caught out eventually, whether they are serial killers or just that lying manipulator in your office who's always telling stories behind people's back.Hare does not offer much hope for the treatment of psychopaths, since he points out the condition seems to start in childhood, if not at birth, and no form of behavioral therapy actually changes them: at best, you might convince a psychopath to ""play by the rules"" so long as they are convinced it's in their best interests.Overall, while there were some interesting bits and a very comprehensive description of psychopathy, Without Conscience appeared to me to be scientifically weak, too much a vehicle for Robert Hare to promote himself and his work, and not as good as other books that have covered the same subject."
10,1572304510,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19784576-shadowdenizen,4,"Ok, disclaimer first. I'm not a PHD or MD, I've not taken advanced classes in sociology, psychiatry, biology, or anything similar. I'm just a reader with an amateur interest in the various aspects of the human psyche.That said, ""Utterly Chilling"" is the best way I can describe this book. Take what you know about ""Psychopaths"", and add an extra level of creepiness, and you still haven't reached the zenith yet.A fascinating, engrossing read about a truly disturbing subject. While this book isn't quite so much about the genesis of psychopathy, it nonethless seems to presents a chilling (if unkowing) counterpoint to The Lucifer Effect: Understanding How Good People Turn Evil. In this book, the author (Robert Hare) gives us compelling overviews of some of these cases, culled from and backed by years of research in this arena. The book is clearly, cleanly organized, and each statement he makes is backed by copious examples from his research. (Meaning this book is quite readable to the layperson [IE someone like me], though I find that Mr. Hare does seem to have a slight tendency to go into ""Professor-Speak"" mode at times.)The author seems to be of the belief that psychopaths are born that way, and that there is ""no hope"" for them [hence the comparison to ""The Lucifer Effect"", which posits almost the exact opposite, that evil is situation rather than dispositional), and he does not seem to hold out much hope for redemption/rehabilitaton of these people; the best that he offers is advice is spotting/avoiding these people.As a fascinating read into the lives of truly disturbed individuals, this is truly gripping, though (despite his years of experience), I'm not sure I agree 100% with his point-of-view on the subject (just as I didn't agree 100% with the point-of-view of Dr. Zimbardo while reading ""The Lucifer Effect."". To my [admittedly untrained, amatuer eye], I think the truth is likely far more complex and somewhere between these 2 extremes."

A psychopath is born that way and will probably always be that way and will make your life hell. No hopeful treatment options offered. The best the author could do was offer advice on how to spot psychopathic behavior and avoid becoming ensnared in their manipulation.The author uses this book as a platform for promoting the Hare Psychopathy Checklist, a tool for diagnosing psychopathy. Setting aside the complexities of clinical definition and diagnosis, I did learn some interesting things:•	Psychopaths almost always display psychopathic behaviors in early childhood•	Psychopaths don't have normal physiological responses to fear (e.g. sweaty palms, nervous stomach)•	Psychopaths are probably born with the tendencies, but their environment and upbringing may influence just how awful they become•	Criminal activity by psychopaths often declines after age 40•	Psychopaths are generally satisfied with themselves and therefore are not receptive to treatment•	Group therapy settings such as those often found in prisons do nothing to improve symptoms, and often make them worse•	Very few psychopaths are actually serial killers, likely fewer than 100 in North America, compared to 2 million non-serial killer psychopathsSorry people, not a pretty picture.

13,1572304510,http://goodreads.com/user/show/589941-r-z,5,"Scary book, but one that may be of some help should we ever fall prey to a psychopath in our lives. Psychopaths are probably hard-wired that way from birth which is why treatment (at least so far) cannot change them. They have distinct characteristics in common with each other and Dr. Hare and his colleagues have created a test to determine whether or not any given individual is actually a psychopath, one of which is an amazing ability to ""read"" unsuspecting persons, discover their weaknesses and/or desires, and play into these to get what they want from them. They have learned to charm and lie, yet nevertheless may get caught in their lies as they twist truths to promote their own agendas. Parents of psychopathic children who recognize the disorder early enough may be able to teach socialization skills that will help them to stay out of serious trouble as they grow up and make their way in the world. Because one is a repeated criminal does not make him/her a psychopath, and this is important to note, because some of these can be rehabilitated whereas a psychopath cannot."
14,1572304510,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7668412-andrea,3,"The problem with this book can perhaps be blamed on Hare's acknowledgement in his preface:  i would like to thank (...) and Suzanne Lipsett for showing me how to convert technical material into readable prose. Yes, it's quite readable (thanks to Suzanne?) but altogether too anecdotal throughout 3/4 or more of the book. Hare is one of the leading experts on psychopathy, so the semi dumbed-down tone of the book and countless examples of psychopathic behavior taken from popular sources (true crime cases as well as the movies)would be more befitting to a bright young pop science writer than a mature researcher. To be fair, Hare does offer us a thought-provoking chapter (ch. 10, out of 13) ""The Roots of the Problem"". Finally, some theory and a(brief) presentation of viable biological models! Follows another rather interesting chapter (10)on the ethics of labeling, which is especially relevant in light of the broad use (and misuse) of his famously successful Psychopathy Checklist in the criminal justice sector. Ch.11,  Can Anything be Done? (nope) is brief but raises a few unavoidable issues. Then, back to practical matters, such as ch.13,  A Survival Guide (no, not for psychopaths, who seem to have little difficulty thriving and surviving in all climes, but for their past and future victims and family members, including, perhaps, the reader)Finally, published in 1993, this short volume could greatly benefit from being expanded and updated.

This book identifies the traits of psychopaths and explores their thinking. It's an early study, introducing us to the subject as it was understood by the 90's. It gives advice on how to recognize and protect oneself from a psychopath (or sociopath, as they’re also called). For example, one should deal with them, if one must, only in the presence of third parties. Psychopaths themselves are dazzling creatures to read about. But as interesting, and more disturbing, is a change in social values that increasingly exalts the cluster of traits and behaviors that psychopaths possess. More and more, the values (such as ""winner take all"") reflected in government and economic policy cater precisely to antisocial personalities. One wonders if the only reason the entire governmental and financial system hasn't already collapsed is merely that psychopaths don’t exist in large enough numbers to exploit every possible systemic loophole. After all, there are only three million of them in the United States at latest count.But aside from this ""camouflage society,"" the book mainly addresses the personal ramifications of an encounter with a psychopath. The world we actually live in makes much more sense when we learn about people who have no conscience and who exploit our trust. This book is a good starting point."

There was the sweet blonde hair blue eyed little girl who tried to Kill her baby brother. The prisoner who offered to service the authors car and then deliberately broke the brake cord. The mother who killed her baby who said its OK, I can have another one. The best one was the lady travelling around Europe alone who met an FBI undercover officer investigating a drug ring. The lady and this man travelled around Europe paid by her. He also allowed her to help in surveillance and other jobs.

Basically if it is too good to be true it probably is, the most interesting observation was that all psychopaths have vacant eyes. This book was originally written in 1993. The world has changed so much in 24 years I would like to see an updated version."
24,1572304510,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9540201-felix-felicis,4,"Robert D. Hare's book is well-written and elegantly structured, achieving a balance between being comprehensible and informative to the layman while still being enlightening to those with a depth of knowledge in the field of psychopathy -- largely because it gathers together a comprehensive look at this mysterious disorder.The first chapter, ""Experiencing the Psychopath,"" brings together anecdotes and excerpts from case studies about what it is like to encounter a psychopath, while chapter 2, ""Focusing the Picture,"" seeks to clarify the issues involved by what we mean when we use the term 'psychopath.' Together, these chapters frame the issue of what we are dealing with and the difficulties on trying to get a handle on it so that systematic research, response -- and treatment -- can begin to be possible.""The Profile: Feelings and Relationships"" describes the difference in how the psychopathic individual experiences emotion and relationship: notably, there is a lack of capacity for deep affect, mutual relationships, and what we might call real, unselfish love, as well as the presence of grandiosity, glib and smooth (or convincing) speech, deceitfulness, and manipulation of others. All of the criteria from this point forward are built around the 'psychopathy checklist' which Hare and his colleagues have developed, and which functions both as a rigorous diagnostic tool and as the philosophical-scientific scaffolding through which he understands the phenomenon (or construct) or psychopathy. Most pronounced among the emotional poverties of the psychopath is, of course, the inability to feel empathy; combined with impulsively and marked pleasure-seeking behavior, this helps to explain the extremely destructive behaviors that psychopaths inflict on the people and societies around them.""The Profile: The Lifestyle"" moves away from describing the inner lives and personality traits that define psychopathy toward characteristic behaviors which either flow from or reinforce the internal aspects of the syndrome (or, of course, a combination of both). The psychopathic individual is impulsive, displaying little capacity for long-term foresight or planning, has poor behavioural self-regulation (though displays of anger are shallow and short-lived), excitement-seeking (though not explicitly stated, you will likely not find an introverted psychopath as they consistently seek stimulation both in risk-taking and other behaviors) and displays little to no responsibility toward obligations or in their assessment of their own actions. Psychopathy is characterized by the early-onset of symptoms during childhood, including persistent lying, truancy, theft, violence, and (sometimes) cruelty to animals. Even at an early age, and especially apparent as a child ages, these traits are not typical of poor childhood impulse control or transient behavioral issues but, rather, pervasive and persistent inflexible traits. As adults, psychopaths are consistently unable to follow society's rules, whether that be in a lesser regard (as with lying) or the an extreme (as with serial murder).What this chapter makes clear is that socially deviant behavior alone does not define psychopathy, as a greater percentage of people engage in these behaviors than the percentage which can be properly understood as psychopathic: what distinguishes the psychopath among us is both the complex of behaviors and the characteristic lack of what we would consider the capacity for a full and normal emotional life.Chapter 5, ""Internal Controls: The Missing Piece,"" analyzes why psychopaths break social rules by positing that they lack the capacity for the internal controls normally developed by socialization. Not only do they lack compassion or a fear of punishment, and not only are they driven by self-gratification, they seem to lack the ability to project how their behavior will affect their ability to self-gratify in the future -- for example, by landing them in prison. They do not develop a conscience and lack the 'inner speech' that grounds behavioral self-regulation. By and large, this can be seen as the confluence of others traits such as impulsivity, lack of empathy and shallow emotions.Chapter Six describes the path to crime as a logical outcome for people with this cluster of traits, while chapter 7 expands the scope to include white-collar crime. The book goes on to explore characteristics of language-usage in psychopathy, how they suck people in, and how they distort reality; to expand on the phenomenon of psychopathy in youth and how its traits are, while 'shapped' to a slight degree, highly rigid. While I personally adhere to the stress-diathesis model in most cases, I have to admit that Hare paints a convincing picture of a complex of traits highly resistant to influence. It is in this light which we read of the ethics of labelling, possible future treatment courses, and how to protect ourselves. The early sections of this book really form the core around which the later sections are read, and they are, while informative, mainly elaborations on information in the earlier chapters. Hare makes clear that psychopathy as he understands it is distinct from Antisocial Personality Disorder (301.7) because this diagnostic tool ignores and emotional-inner-life aspects of psychopathy in its diagnostic criteria, favoring behavioral manifestations instead (though some of these things are mentioned in the section for Associated Features and Disorders in the DSM-IV-TR; that section of the DSM can be found on pp701-706 for those who are interested).As a layperson I found Hare's book interesting and accessible, and I recommend it as a way to get a more accurate view of what psychopathy is and is not and, as he finishes in the last sections of his book, find ways to protect ourselves from the psychopaths among us. "
25,1572304510,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12638278-payam,4,"I decided to step outside my typical reading pattern and read this book about Psychopaths. Overall, it provides a clear overview of Psychopathy, its symptoms, and its devastating impacts. Perhaps more interesting to me, were the implications psychopaths had on ethical theories, law, justice, and religious teachings. Psychopaths are not well in-tuned to their emotions. As such, their world of right and wrong is determined by what they can get away with and what they cannot. It has no ethical foundation. It is not emotionally bound and as such it operates on a selfish and rational mode of thought. Numerous ethical theories build on assumptions of mutual emotions and natural human inclinations to operate together. These theories are obliterated by psychopaths. As such, we must by necessity classify them as mentally ill in order to preserve our ethical theories and our notion of justice. Instead, perhaps we might want to devise theories of cooperation or revisit ethical theories and begin to accommodate for psychopaths. As such, perhaps we can understand to avoid such assumptions and create more universal ethical theories. Having said that, these are only fragmented thoughts of mine :)Since the book provide case studies to understand real-life examples of psychopathy, it acts as a teaching tool for self-protection. As you learn how the victims were victimized, you begin to self-introspect into your own behavior and identify your flaws. From this book, I will be taking away these core principals: 1. Do not trust without reason.2. Do not be fooled by words alone but instead consider the other person's entire body language3. Do not let optimism blind you from realityIn other words, do not let another individual distract you from establishing self-justice for yourself, whether that be by intimidating, seduction, or connivance. Utilize clear contracts and do not assume, that because you are a good person and those around you are good people, that all people are good. Do not let your guard down."
26,1572304510,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2731485-linda-branham-greenwell,4,"This book was written in 1993... I have seen some more recent research on psychopaths and how their brains actually process information and emotions differently on an MRI/CT scan. BUT... having said this this book really good description behavioral information about psychopathsI especially liked how Dr. Hare describes psychopaths as seeing themselves as the real victims, and their convoluted thinking mechanisms that they use to explain this belief to others.Near the end of the book he explains why therapy doesn't work - because they don't see that they have a problem. They are perfectly fine with themselves, Thank you very much... it is us normal people who are the problem. They feel they are just doing what people should do. Can they help it because we are so gullible and weak? - lolIf you are interested in reading about how the psychopath mind thinks - this is a good book to read"
27,1572304510,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1166179-elizabeth,2,"Although I am aware that this book was written for non-academic audiences, I still found it to be overly sensational, relying on a few fairly dramatic anecdotes to support Hare's view of psychopathy (essentially boiled down to ""They're everywhere, they are fundamentally unlike us, and you can never be safe!"")I would have valued a little more nuance and fewer examples of serial killers that Hare tries to generalize to the population at large."
28,1572304510,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7619789-leo-robertson,4,"Decent intro to the subject, certainly repeats the best advice and definitions I've now read hundreds of times, surely!"

30,1572304510,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73120065-robert-kearns,5,I loved reading this book.Recommended for anyone that's ever been affected by a psychopath.Extraordinarily insightful
31,1572304510,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2187043-mike-the-paladin,3,"Not the first book I've read on this subject. It probably won't be the last. When I first read the numbers on psychopaths and/or sociopaths among us I found it more than a little disturbing. This book (Professor Hare) does a good job of laying out the condition and describing ""what it is"". He is noted for developing the ""Psychopathy Checklist"", considered the surest way to diagnose a psychopath. He discusses the difference in Psychopathy and sociopathy (something I hadn't clearly grasped even though I thought I had.) There is of course (always) for me the frustrating question of ""why"" or ""how"". Why or how does a person with no conscious come about? Do these people realize that they are different? In case study after case study the fact that psychopaths are absolutely unable to see others as actual beings that exist for more than their purposes is so startling and truly frightening when you think of it (especially since the predominate thinking now is that a very high percentage of the population ""fits"" this diagnosis) that I don't think any of us can afford to be ignorant.So, why 3 stars? Because I do believe the book is an important one and the Professor is respected and highly honored....and I can't give it 2.5 stars. You see, it might not be as negative as it might seem, but there are a couple of places (one very minor one not so minor) where I know he misstated facts. The minor one...he misstated the plot and outcome of a movie to support a premise. Not necessarily a big deal, it's just a movie. But the second case is the example of a criminal proceeding. He assumes the guilt of a ""certain person"" to support an argument who, from what I've read almost everyone believes was not guilty. The ""person"" is profiled in John E. Douglas's book The Cases That Haunt Us and Douglas concludes the person is not guilty, he's not the only one. Now, the argument in this book is that the ""person in question"" was able due to her being a psychopath to fool ""everybody"". Possible. There are still two problems. The person was is free and has not re-offended. Of course ""the person in question"" could be, just that smart... there is one other thing. Professor Hare completely misstated a fact in the person's background and case. He went with a statement that had been made over and over in the media...but was untrue. With all this, at the least this might have been (putting the best face on it) a poor choice as an example. So, while I like the book and believe the subject matter to be of (actually) the highest importance... the misrepresentation in these things causes me a little concern about other things I don't ""already know about"".... So, interesting book, good accounts and discussion...2.5 stars if I could, round to 3. "
32,1572304510,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44019699-yadira-denisse,4,"Is an interesting book actually! The author suggest that psychopathy is actually a biological deficiency that affects the way you develop as a child in the womb and makes a faulty connection or something in the brain that affects the ability to understand human emotions. As he said it, as far as criminality and all of that, it depends on the way a child is raised A child who is poorly raise and lives in poverty and violence or has the same early life experiences as any other common criminal will also become a criminal. BUT if the child is raised in a normal family then they may become salesman, politicians, etc. They will still break the law but it'll be the difference of violent crime and white collar crime. They will still cause a lot of pain to people around them and con people and all that. Also let it be known that serial killers and rapist the way media depicts psychopaths are actually not as common. We live in a world where psychopaths are walking among us and it doesn't mean that we are one step away from being murdered by them! We are simply more aware of that sub-category of psychopaths because of the way movies and media portrait them. I was left with doubt about psychotherapy being ""treatable""...after all I understand that is not a mental disorder and by all means is not consider to be legally insane. It is more of an ""emotional disorder"" than a mental disorder. So this book provided a quick guideline to ""protect"" yourself against them if you suspect someone close is one. It also suggests to start ""treating"" children as soon as possible. By ""treating"" I understood meant teaching them how to socialize and live within the social rules of our culture. The problem is that they do not care to follow this rules...even as children!!! They deny hurting people and doing bad things if they do not think it was a bad thing, so HOW do you ""treat"" it? How do you shape little kids to act within social norm even when they don't agree with it, understand it, or even care for it? When they hate you? When they think they know better than you and are above you? How do you live with them as adults when you can't get away (when they are family)? Side note: so they say jails are full of innocent people. This book suggests that jails are full of psychopaths who continue to claim they are innocent because they don't are about what they did...that was a different take on it!! As a law enforcement officer, I really do see this insight going somewhere. It makes sense...."
33,1572304510,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1351623-richard,3,"I rated it three stars for liked it, because it was interesting, entertaining reading. What it was not was a serious psychology book.Hare tells some real life stories of his experience with psychopaths which are interesting and informative, but a large part of the book is speculation and conjecture. As noted in other reviews, he often references popular movies, many of them fictional, for discussion. When he's not referencing movies, he's referencing true crime literature. Granted, some of the better respected works of the true crime genre, but still...not exactly a primary source. Not a technique generally recommended for a serious academic work.He also mentions the ""Psychopathy Checklist""-a test he designed to diagnose pyschopaths, at least every five pages. That's not a reason to dismiss the entire book, but it's not insignificant that a large portion of the text equates to self-promotion.The real life stories are fascinating to read, but in the end the book doesn't accomplish much in the way of informing the reader. You probably know a psychopath, according to Hare, but you shouldn't try to diagnose them yourself. (Hare uses the statistics 2 million in the US and 20% of the prison population, but fails to provide any empirical evidence for these numbers). You need extensive training (in his test and his methods) to diagnose psychopahty. You can try to recognize them, but they are such good liars you'll fall for it anyway. You can try to cure psychopaths, but there is no treatment and therapy is useless. If you are unlucky enough to give birth to a psychopath, just give up now-you are doomed to a life of emotional and financial hell, taking care of this kid forever. Much of the ""science"" is wildly speculative and unfounded. Did you know it's possible that just about any social or political crisis of the late 20th century COULD have been the work of psychopaths? Robert Hare talks about psychopaths the way Rush Limbaugh talks about liberals, feminists, and Barack Obama. Just about any social or political ill can be attributed to them. It boils down to-good reading, but bad psychology, bad non-fiction, and bad science. I wouldn't say don't read it, but I will be reading more books on the subject to get a better understanding of it then I got from this one."
34,1572304510,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20527198-dany,2,"I didn't particularly enjoy this book. I found it very repetitive and at times I just wanted to skip pages in order to get to the salient part (desire that my professional ""reader’s sense of duty"" strongly forbids me every time unfortunately).Nevertheless I read it quickly through the tedious parts trying to get to that interesting streak that, unfortunately, never manifested itself... It might be that, as the book clearly shows in front page, this is a doctorate research for a PHD; clearly the author doesn’t have a very developed “novel” style, which is fine. But what I didn’t particularly appreciate is the endless list of speculative references and the use of fictional movies as empirical evidence. I don’t know, I am not an expert, but I found the topic very poorly substantiated by a sound academic research. It seemed to me that EVERY experience of callous people with low morale and a not humanitarian approach to life was the possible manifestation sign of the presence of a psychopath among us! Whilst reading this book I couldn’t help thinking:” Here we go, I bet my left hand that ¾ of the people reading this book will now start “scrutinizing “all the “suspiciously possible psychopaths” around them and feeling experts in recognizing it” ( thanks to the bloody Psychopath Checklist that the author didn’t forget to mention at least 20 times per chapter).This seems that classic book that a gullible mind would use for backing up a new Witch Hunt. And unfortunately half of the comments of the people who reviewed this book with 5 stars confirm my suspicions. I have found the same topic approached by Jon Ronson in his “The Psychopath test” a lot more informative, entertaining and also more “objective”… I wondered more than once if Robert Hare had some personal grudge against psychopaths, he really seems too morbid on the subject."

Sociopaths exhibit a wide variety of maladaptive behavior which makes the condition difficult to diagnose. Sociopathy is not one trait; it is a syndrome—a cluster of related symptoms.To help professionals accurately diagnose the sociopath (also called a psychopath), Robert D. Hare, Ph.D., developed the Psychopathy Checklist. This is not a quiz you can try at home; it is a tool designed to be used exclusively by trained mental health professionals.Dr. Hare has identified key symptoms of psychopathy. Excerpts from his descriptions of the symptoms appear below. (To be consistent with his work, Lovefraud has substituted the term ""psychopath"" for our usual use of ""sociopath."") Lovefraud strongly recommends that you read his entire book, Without Conscience. The examples of behavior he includes with each description are eye-opening and chilling.If you're dealing with a person who exhibits some of these traits, put your guard up.

36,1572304510,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2249126-h,3,"According to some light Googling, Dr. Hare appears to remain an authority on the subject of psychopathy along with having laid much of the framework, as presented in this 1993 work, for the way the syndrome is currently studied. His perspective is satisfyingly unsympathetic and clinical, the subject matter undeniably fascinating, and the style of writing decent and smooth. It reads like what I would imagine pop science from 15 years ago would--in tone it is not overly slick or full of buzz-words and terminology, but approachable, like a college professor's lecture in an undergrad course.Without Conscience's age also hurts it, most notably in that Hare only hints at the all the then-nascent hard science that has come in the past 15+ years, ground-breaking insight based on new technology such as types of brain-imaging that would really round out the many chapters ending with ""...we'll have to see"" or ""there is more work to be done."" Also, perhaps pop science wasn't as fully developed as an art at the time of publication and, though I appreciate the lack of slick, easy-reading patter, the meandering and repetative, essay-like style could be tighter and more in harmony with the book medium."
37,1572304510,http://goodreads.com/user/show/308912-tucker,3,"A good overview of what psychopathy is--basically, the lack of feeling and moral conscience--from a psychologist who worked with psychopathic offenders in prison and who developed the diagnostic tool that has since become the standard. The book is somewhat of a plug for his then-recently developed tool, called The Psychopathy Checklist. He makes it quite clear that he believes that psychopaths have freedom of choice, they're aware of social rules even if they don't feel the emotional force behind them, they choose to violate the rules, there's nothing wrong with their brains so they can't be fixed medically, they have no inherent interest in reforming their behavior, and the best hope that anyone can have for convincing them to change their behavior is to convince them that it's in their own best interest to do so. Meanwhile, he advises non-psychopaths not to fall into the traps these people set. The idea felt somewhat unfinished, probably because he admitted that the research was lacking, that he didn't have all the answers, and that the best first step was simply to be able to identify which offenders are psychopathic and which aren't. He has since come out with additional books that I have not read yet."
38,1572304510,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8531296-rebecca,1,"Was going to give it two stars because: - It's sensationalist (serves me right for reading a book on this topic, I guess). - It focuses almost entirely on convicted criminal psychopaths, when the vast majority are never convicted of any crime. - It is anecdote after anecdote with almost no enlightening statistics information about studies or evidence- He asserts things without offering proof, and sometimes the things are objectively wrong (e.g. saying that people are getting more violent) - He says a few things that make me think he really admires psychopaths and wishes he wasn't weighed down by conscienceSo that is all two stars... And then he said this: Some criminals learn to do crime. They are raised in families or social environments in which criminal behaviour [...] is the accepted norm. [...] Dramatic examples of these sub-cultures of criminals include [...] the brands of Gypsies common in some parts of Europe. You can't just make a sweeping statement about a race like that!

The author presents the subject of psychopathy in layman's terms so those of us without a Ph.D. in Psychology can easily follow. He comes across as the expert that he is, with decades of hands-on experience working with psychopaths and doing research into the disorder. While the subject matter is chilling, it's a necessary read for those who've been in contact with someone who fits the description. Although the book is a little repetitive (in terms of the descriptions of the personality traits and typical behaviors), the repetition was probably better left in to truly get across the sheer destructive nature of this personality disorder on people individually and society as a whole. Excellent book. Even though I bought it for research purposes (I'm a novelist), I'm glad I read it for my own edification. I highly recommend this book. "

I disagree that it makes you think ""x"" person in your life is a psychopath and more opens your eyes into how easily one can be led and manipulated by others. It would be foolish for us to automatically presume a person in our life is one but for me, it helped me be more aware and taught me a lot about being on guard and safe whilst dealing with new people and how to deal with a situation should I find myself in one. I ""enjoyed"" all the cases he discussed, as it really showed me the extent and the characteristics of these people and as a person who is interested and intrigued with psychology and psychopathy, I thought it was extremely insightful. Some cases made me squirm and shiver and that's what I want in a book like this. I want to know the truth and the dangers and I liked how he didn't dress things up to be more ""suitable"" or whatever. I think it's definitely worth 5 stars. "

While it appears to be about a mental illness, it's really to do with epistemology. In other words, when it comes to mental illness, how do we know? How do we judge?More than the limits of knowledge, the book also explores the uses of it. Hare proposes that psychopathy has so far not remitted to any sort of treatment, but not that it is untreatable. But he further proposes that the primary use of such a diagnostic system as less to do with reimbursement from insurance companies or even the creation of treatments, and more to do with risk assessment.As a student psychologist (I won't say how long ago) this book was transformative for me. It made me think outside the usual frames, out of ideologies and into practicalities. "

Hare does exactly what he set out to do in this book: inform the public about the nature and frequency of psychopathy in our current society. He does so without resorting to sensationalism or lurid details. The most eye opening aspect of the book was the careful explanation of the many non-murderous types of psychopaths (sociopaths) that are out there. It's not all sexually sadistic serial killers--there are a plethora of disturbed individuals out there with much less catchy M.O.s who can hurt you just as much.

If so, that individual might have been a psychopath.Most people regard psychopaths as cold-blooded, conscienceless murderers of the sort that increasingly star in movies, television programs, and news headlines. Names come to mind: Ted Bundy, John Wayne Gacy, and Jeff Dahmer, to name some of the most notorious and dramatic examples among them. Individuals with this personality disorder are usually fully aware of the likely consequences of their actions -- and don't care. They know the difference between right and wrong -- and consistently choose the wrong. They are terrifyingly, malignantly narcissistic, remorseless, and devoid of any concern about the feelings of others. But even more frightening, they often seem completely normal, even charming and attractive, to unsuspecting people that they have selected as targets.In Without Conscience: The Disturbing World of the Psychopaths Among Us (http://www.amazon.com/Without-Conscie...), Dr. Robert D. Hare, presenting a detailed portrait of such dangerous and, often, deadly men and women based on 25 years of distinguished scientific research, vividly describes a large population -- at least 70 million strong, globally -- of con artists, hustlers, rapists, and other predators who charm, lie, and manipulate their way through life. Are psychopaths mentally ill, or simply evil? How can they be recognized? How can we protect ourselves from them? In Without Conscience: The Disturbing World of the Psychopaths Among Us Dr. Hare answers these questions and many more.Dr. Hare created the Psychopathy Checklist (PCL) in the 1960s. This checklist, which has since been paired with a shorter checklist used for screening for people who are likely psychopaths and should be evaluated more deeply, includes the following symptoms:Emotional/interpersonal: glib and superficial; egocentric and grandiose; lack of remorse or guilt; lack of empathy; deceitful and manipulative; shallow emotions.Social deviance: impulsive; poor behavior controls; need for excitement; lack of responsibility; early behavior problems; adult antisocial behavior.Those who score high on this checklist -- 75% of the total possible score or higher -- are very likely psychopaths. But, as Dr. Hare points out, great care has to be taken to avoid labeling someone a psychopath who turns out to have other, different problems, such as those who, like Jared Loughner (who tried to assassinate Representative Gabby Giffords in 2011 and did succeed in murdering several others present that day, including a 9-year old girl), are mentally ill and don't know the difference between right and wrong at the time they commit their crimes. As he says, most criminals are not psychopaths, although the percentage of bona fide psychopaths among prison populations is higher than it is among non-criminals. Nor are most psychopaths violent criminals, though many of them have had run-ins with the law a number of times concerning non-violent misdemeanors and felonies.If you suspect that you are or have been the victim of a psychopath, you should seek out professional counseling that can help you sort out your experiences and learn how to avoid becoming victimized again by a psychopath and/or get out of a relationship with one with minimum physical and other risk to yourself. Psychopaths impact those they become involved with in terrible ways, leaving their victims confused and bewildered about why the mess their lives have become due to a psychopath has happened, whose fault it really is, and what to do about it. If the first counselor isn't helpful, keep looking until you find someone who can really help you sort things out and regain something of your sense of self-worth, which is one of the first casualties of an interaction with a psychopath. Be careful, though, especially if you enter counseling with the psychopath in question as a co-client -- psychopaths are capable of charming the scales off a snake and knots off a log, and can manipulate therapists and counselors into believing that they themselves are victims of the real victims, and that the latter are mentally ill or even psychopaths themselves. Above all else, if you are involved with a violent psychopath -- a spouse-beater or child abuser, say, or other physically violent individual -- strongly consider leaving that person and even finding a shelter to take you in and protect you from the one who has been victimizing you. Find safety first, if at all possible, then decide whether you want to involve the police and get counseling to help you deal with the trauma you have suffered.As for non-violent psychopaths, they, too, can wreak havoc on their victims, though the modus operandi they follow involves such things as fraud, identity theft, theft of their possessions, trolling (i.e., on the Internet, haunting people's blogs, Facebook pages, Twitter pages, and other avenues of expression and leaving their victims at their wits' end because of it; they may also use phishing schemes, spoof websites, loosing of Internet viruses, worms, trojans, and so on to get what they want), and other non-violent forms of crime and torment of innocent people. If you or someone you know have been a victim of such people, get help in getting them out of your life and cleaning up the mess, emotional as well as financial and otherwise. In either case -- whether you or someone you know has been victimized by someone who is likely a psychopath, research the condition and what its impact is on everyone around the psychopath. Reading Dr. Hare's book is a great start at just that. Another is Dean A. Haycock's Murderous Minds: Exploring the Criminal Psychopathic Brain: Neurological Imaging and the Manifestation of Evil (http://www.amazon.com/Murderous-Minds...).Somewhere between 1% and 4% of humanity -- 70 million to 280 million people, worldwide -- are bona fide psychopaths. Whether you have ever had to deal with psychopaths are not, learning as much as possible about them is a good idea for the rest of us. We need to learn how to spot and avoid them before they can invade and ruin our lives, or, if we have been victimized by them, how to rid ourselves of and protect ourselves against them. Almost all of us, at one time or another in our lives, will be impacted by psychopaths. If nothing else, many of those holding positions of real power in the world -- world leaders, legislators, senators, media titans, and others who are in a position to move and shake nations and the world as a whole -- are very likely psychopaths, since power attracts people, and the utterly unscrupulous have a strong drive to rise as high in life as they can by any means possible.The world needs to become familiar with the syndrome of psychopathy and apply the knowledge it gains about their behavior and personality structure in ways that can minimize the deleterious impact they have on all those around them and reduce the likelihood that they will invade people's lives and parasitize them as much as possible. Reading Without Conscience: The Disturbing World of the Psychopaths Among Us is a good start at that. Persuading others to read it is even better. We can't deal successfully with the problem and mystery of psychopathy unless we ;earn as much as possible about it from experts in the field. Dr. Hare has long been considered the Grand Old Man of the field of research into psychopathy. He is a superb writer, and Without Conscience: The Disturbing World of the Psychopaths Among Us is a real page-turner. I could hardly put it down. Rather than reading like a dull collection of facts and statistic, it closely holds one's attention to the very last page. Just don't read it late at night. :-)"

Through media, we always get the impression that psychopaths are extremely brutal criminals which anyone can detect easily by simply looking them in the face, and who always end up in jail, so you don't have to worry much about them. Sadly, while a considerable percentage of psychopaths are indeed physically violent and do end up in prison, not all of them are like that. In fact, many of them are people you meet anywhere at anytime. He could be a financial manager with a suit and tie, she could be a lawyer you think you are seeking help from, or they could even be a spouse or a family member. There is a good chance that through out your life, you might bump into a psychopath. Being aware of their behavior will help you avoid them in the first place, or at least reduce the damage they might bring to your life. Even if you (hopefully) are not going to meet a psychopath, the advices in this book are likely to help you with individuals who are not necessarily psychopath, but do employ, whether consciously or subconsciously, some of the tricks that psychopaths use to manipulate others.One thing to note about this book is that it is not one of those self-help book written by amateurs. The author is a psychologist who is a long experience in this field, and is very well aware of the wrong judgements made by some individuals who quickly rush into labeling someone a psychopath just being they experienced difficulty or got manipulated by someone; psychopathy is a serious condition that requires a lot of study and interviewing to judge someone as a psychopath, so while I advise you above to understand the behaviour of psychopaths in case you happen to meet one in your life, I also advise you to be careful about labeling anyone who is giving a hard time a psychopath.Hope this review helps."

The book is very well-organized and can serve as a great one for introduction to psychopathy. As Dr. Hare makes his point clear in here, the reality of this disorder is far from how the media portraits it to be with viscerally graphic crimes of murders and cannibalism. Most psychopaths in real life don't go around killing, cannibalizing, or raping to be diagnosed as one. They are actually smart and manipulative enough to live among normal people, conning and draining their victims' bank accounts, without getting caught. Perhaps the most disturbing of them, to me, are the white-collar criminals who do all it takes to climb quickly up the corporate ladders to achieve power and financial gains despite having to hurt and harm others. It's important to understand that and be aware as we might unfortunately come across a psychopath in our life. They are quick at figuring out our vulnerability and exploiting it to their advantage, so the earlier we can spot their signs, the better we can manage the risk and back off from them so we can save our peace of mind and our bank account from devastation. All things considered, I'm pretty disturbed but very glad to have learn a good deal from this book on this matter."
58,1572304510,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1678009-pat,4,"I read this after it was recommended by my prof at Marietta College at the end of our class: Serial Killers as Modern Day Evil Monsters! Why We Fear Them (More Thank We Should). We studied the myths surrounding them including a survey to begin the study with 90% of our beliefs being erroneous as research of them proves. Study is called psychopathy now and sociopaths have been incorporated into the term. Causes are now have gone from Nature vs. Nurture to Bio-Psycho-Social Factors. We watched interviews of the most famous serial killers, and I am now watching Mindhunters which he claims pretty much tells it like it is! This book addresses a larger population - psychopaths who are so scary with no empathy (zilch), no conscious, no regrets, etc. and are pretty much immune to therapy. Children can display psychotic characteristics early in life; parents and teachers alike can identify them as resistant to changing worrisome behavior. I love studying aberrant always looking for reason WHY, and this definitely helped me understand so much. I hope there are move psychology courses offered next term! Still love to LEARN!"
59,1572304510,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52216243-julia-leporace,4,"""Psychopaths don't feel they have psychological or emotional problems, and they see no reason to change their behavior to conform to societal standards with which they do not agree.To elaborate, psychopaths are generally well satisfied with themselves and with their inner landscape, bleak as it may seem to outside observers. They see nothing wrong with themselves, experience little personal distress, and find their behavior rational, rewarding, and satisfying; they never look back with regret or forward with concern. They perceive themselves as superior beings in a hostile, dog-eat-dog world in which others are competitors for power and resources. Psychopaths feel it is legitimate to manipulate and deceive others in order to obtain their ""rights"", and their social interactions are planned to outmaneuver the malevolence they see in others. Given these attitudes, it is not surprising that the purpose of most psychotherapeutic approaches is lost on psychopaths."""
