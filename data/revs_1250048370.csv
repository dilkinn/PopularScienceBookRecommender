0,1250048370,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25353295-carmen,5,"It is humbling to reflect that though a bumblebee has a brain smaller than a grain of rice, it has powers of perception and learning that often put us mammals to shame.Amazing book.For one thing, you will learn a ton of information about bees. Goulson focuses on bumblebees but you will learn a few things about honeybees as well.For another thing, Goulson is HILARIOUS. Oh my gosh, I was laughing like a maniac while reading this book. Everyone was looking at me strangely. Oftentimes people suspiciously asked me what was so funny. They probably thought I was cracked having laughing fits over a non-fiction book about bees. But Goulson is so funny! I can't compare him to Mary Roach, no one will ever be Mary Roach, but still, he is immensely charming and amusing. The only caveat I'd place on the book is that the prologue deals with Goulson's childhood and specifically his pets growing up. Many met gruesome and horrifying ends. Not because Goulson was a malicious serial-killer-in-training or anything, simply because he was too young to have pets and care for them without any adult supervision whatsoever. He describes his pets' deaths in funny ways that are designed to make you laugh, but for those whom animal deaths are never a laughing matter (especially when unnecessary and preventable) I thought I'd include this little warning. Animals die and they die horribly, often as a direct result of Goulson's neglect or his particular brand of 'caring.' Read the prologue at your own risk, you know your own tolerance levels.TL;DR - I'd recommend this to ANYONE, it is extremely funny and extremely educational. Who would ever have thought reading a non-fiction book about bees would be this much fun? :D"
1,1250048370,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca,4,"(Nearly 4.5) A wholly engaging tour through everything we know and are still trying to learn about bumblebees. I saw Goulson, founder of the UK’s Bumblebee Conservation Trust, speak at a nature conference in November and found him to be just as enthusiastic and well-informed in person. His occasional anthropomorphisms are unfailingly endearing: “gangs of males can often be seen clustered together, reminiscent of a group of men propping up the bar in a pub.” I also especially liked “Sex has always been difficult for plants, because they cannot move.”If you think bumblebees and their kin have very little to do with your daily life, think again: “If all mankind were to disappear, the world would regenerate back to the rich state of equilibrium that existed ten thousand years ago. If insects were to vanish, the environment would collapse into chaos.” (E. O. Wilson)Related reading:

2,1250048370,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935491-tanja-berg,4,"A marvelous little book about bumblebees! Non-fiction at its best, entertaining and thought provoking. I thought honey bees were important pollinators, but bumblebees are too. For example tomato plants are only pollinated by bumblebees. Until these were bred for commercial use in the 1990's or so, tomato plants were pollinated by hand - by humans! Sadly many bumblebees are on the verge of extinction due to invading species, disease and loss of habitat. The author knows his subject intimately and tells about it with a great deal of humor. I loved bumblebees even before I read this book. I am very mindful of having flowers on the terrace that they enjoy, and that I don't use insecticide on. I love watching them. Until next bumblebee season I must consider what else I can do to help the local population. You should too."
3,1250048370,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1289391-michael,3,"If this were only a book about British bumblebees, I imagine it would have a fairly limited audience. Fortunately, it offers much more and shares some important insights about the dangers of tampering with the environment without a proper understanding of how all of the parts work together. The author also provides fascinating examples of doing experimental biology in both lab and field and fears not to give accounts of experiments that went seriously wrong. His message is simple and amply illustrated:We have barely begun to understand the complexity of interactions between living creatures on earth, yet we often choose to squander the irreplaceable, to discard those things that both keep us alive and make life worth living. Perhaps if we save a bee today we can save the world tomorrow?Although written with clarity, erudition, and humor, the prose lacks sparkle. Some of the author's comments on his graduate students (although intended to be humorous) verge on bad taste. I would otherwise have given the book four stars. It is definitely worth reading if you have any interest in bumblebees, biology, or ecology, or if you want to know something of the life of a scientist who cares deeply about both his area of specialization and how to apply his knowledge in practical ways to make the world a better place for all its inhabitants."
4,1250048370,http://goodreads.com/user/show/87082395-andrew-howdle,4,"A lightly written book that makes the science of bees readable and enjoyable. The chapters on place-location and flower-sensing were intriguing. Much is still not known about bees, especially those outside the beekeeper's hive.It seems to be a trend among science writers to confuse their CVs with their subjects. This is the third book I have read in the past six months where the author has felt the urge to describe his academic history and turn the book into autobiography. Goulson writes well, no fuss, with an eye on the reader, not the scientific journal, and with a genuine wish to explain his passion. At times, however, the writing collapses into whimsy. Did I want to know that one female assistant was ""pretty, from Oxford""; or another female was a typical American with a ""very loud voice"" and a ""wad of cash"" for her Ph.D.; or that one male researcher was a ""bit of a charmer and a ladies' man""? Less of this and more of how some blue tits have evolved a taste for bee brains would have been welcome.All in all, a thoughtful look at the mysterious life of bees."
5,1250048370,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3482226-sarah,4,"Between 3.5/4An enlightening read about the nature and plight of (mostly) British bees and how important they are to us. Dave Goulson is clearly an expert on bees, and incredibly knowledgeable about a lot of other wildlife and insects, and this book is jam-packed with information he has garnered about bees and their behaviour throughout his academic career researching them across the UK and in New Zealand on various research trips with his PhD students. I have always been interested in bees, and have learnt more from this book than I ever thought I would know about them! My only criticisms of this book are minor ones - it is a tiny bit rambly at times, and I have to admit by the time I got to around 75% I was ready for it to finish, there is a lot of information about academic research projects. But for the most part this was an easy to read glimpse into the life and behaviour of these complex insects!"
6,1250048370,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5672051-brahm,5,"Would never have read this randomly, except I ran out of vacation books and Robyn had a copy out from the library.What a wonderful little book. Goulson writes about bumblebees with passion, clarity, and great humor. Entirely readable and enjoyable. I learned so much about bees! It has inspired me to queue a book about ants that the author referenced."
7,1250048370,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11951948-paul,4,"This is delightful little book about the bumblebee, written by Goulson, one of the few people who are experts on this amazing insect.In the book he explains about the different species that we have in this country, and outlines some of the research projects that he has been doing on the populations of these bees, re-introduction programmes and other projects that his students have undertaken. He writes about a property that he bought in France, that he is turning the brass back into a wildlife meadow, to disbelief from the locals. He founded the BBCT, and it has grown to have 11 staff and hundreds of members.The books is written with the authority that you get from someone who is a renowned expert in his field. But more than that, Goulson has rare wit and endless infectious enthusiasm for his little subjects, and this is what makes this such a good book."
8,1250048370,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3475211-basma,4,"Such a fascinating and interesting book about bumblebees. Learned new stuff that I hope will make me a bit less fearful from bees, because as mentioned in the book there are different types and they don't fly around looking for people to sting. I usually read a few lines from introductions/prologue and then skip it, but I highly enjoyed the prologue of this book. I think once we look at insects as creatures that aren't disgusting, we'll find that they're actually far more interesting than we think."
9,1250048370,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2085099-christine,5,"I was addicted to this lovely book! Thank You, Dave Goulson for writing this gem."
10,1250048370,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17951043-perri,4,"I love bumblebees, but I only liked this book. It was like listening to my dear old grandpop who would go off on tangents and while the asides were often amusing.... what were we talking about? The best thing about the book is Goulson's obvious passion about bees and wildlife. I did learn a lot, but some of what I learned was't what I was hoping for. My favorite chapter was how he bought some land in France and has been steadily refashioning it into a wildflower/ bee sanctuary. That's what I'm striving for. If you have time and patience for what feels like a leisurely stroll through a fanciful UK countryside, listening to an expert in love with his work, this is the book for you. Three and a half rounded up to 4 buzzing stars"
11,1250048370,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3242560-justin-green,4,"Super great and endearing science memoir - ""This book will make you bee-conscious"" in a fun and friendly way. Dave Goulson is both an expert and a charming author. The focus is Bumblebees (genus: Bombus) but a great many topics are traversed. Learned tangentially that ""Dumbledore"" is an old word for 'Bumblebee' (JK Rowling imagined him walking around humming to himself). Plus it sends the (relatively) simple message that we can help native species by shaping our gardens and farms and landscapes to support them e.g. by planting appropriate species that provide habitat and food sources. "
12,1250048370,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18326520-camilla,5,"This book is a good balance between entertaining and educational writing/story. Goulson describes an interesting start of his interest of bumblebees, and take you in both his and the different species of bumblebees history. I never thought how clever the bumblebees are, and how fragile they really are. I have learned a lot from this book and I hope I can do something to help the population to grow further more. I would recommend this book for those who have a genuine interest in them and wants to learn more of their biology, history and how to keep the population up and going for the sake of our future and the next generation to come. As dramatic as it sounds, it’s true. Haha"
13,1250048370,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,4,"I’m not a big fan of insects. If you know me personally, even a little, you’re probably laughing at the understatement there. So okay, the truth is that insects scare me silly. But so did disease at one point, and now look at me tearing through my degree and thinking of working in a lab to study infectious diseases… All through the power of reading enough about it to really pique my curiosity. So maybe I can do the same with insects, and hence this book. Not that bumblebees frighten me that dreadfully; they’re sort of endearing, at their best. But it’s a place to start, and Goulson’s enthusiasm really sold me on it. I even have another book potentially lined up about bees now…There’s a lot of personal reflection, including talking about what he did as a kid to get involved with bees, and his place in France where he’s rewilding a field to attract more wildlife. It’s not strictly scientific, by-the-book facts, that’s for sure; for me, that added to the appeal. I could almost get excited about bees, through the eyes of Dave Goulson — and I could definitely get excited about his conservation goals and hopes.Also, you get to learn fun things like the fact that bees have smelly feet…Recommended! Even if bees are not exactly your cup of honey-sweetened tea. (And yes, yes, I know, bumblebees do not actually make honey. I did pay attention to that much, I promise.)Reviewed for The Bibliophibian."
14,1250048370,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63362342-robyn,5,"So I finally got around to reading one of the books that had been on my ""to read"" shelf the longest! What a total delight. I sort of want to move to Scotland and do a PhD with this lab (I mean not really and I have zero biology background but perhaps in a different life.) I wish I'd read it sooner so I could have queued up all of Goulson's other books before the library closed.It is an underrated and extremely rare treat to read a book by a leading academic that is this well-written and engaging. And also maybe I only notice it now because I was a grad student myself, but it is so refreshing when academics write books and actually fully acknowledge their grad students BY NAME. I have read one other book about bees, regarding North American native bees, so I had a little bit of background on bumblebees before this. This one is mainly about British bumblebees but it doesn't make it any less enjoyable or inspiring for a reader across the pond. Plant native wildflowers! Put clover in your lawn! Leave a few dandelions around the yard! Stop fertilizing so much! Like Goulson says near the end of the book, it's really sad to hear about endangered mammals such as polar bears dying and also hard to know what to do about it, but bees are just as important and it's actually VERY easy for the average person to make a difference.Highly recommend!"
15,1250048370,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12235005-lex,4,"An approachable introduction to bumblebees and British wildlife conservation issues in general. Very charming and humorous at points. Written more like an autobiography than a science textbook, so if you're looking into reading something different this year, would recommend picking this book up."
16,1250048370,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10716214-margaret,4,One man's adventure's studying bumblebees.A lovely read. 
17,1250048370,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39987369-kate,3,did you know that dumbledore was the old english name for bumblebee?? cause i did NOT until i read this book.

19,1250048370,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2523878-andree-sanborn,5,"We live on the side of a mountain and have a brook running close to the back door. On the opposite side of the brook is a steep hill where blackberry, raspberry, native honeysuckle, birch, apple, tamarack and maple grow. What we didn't know was that there was a bumble bee nest in the hill, also. An animal dug up the nest two weeks ago, while I was reading this book. Whatever dug up our nest was not a bear (the excavation was too small and it was too close to the house), so we couldn't figure out what it was. Because of this book, we now think it was raccoon. Goulson talks of how UK badgers love to dig up bee nests, but there are no badgers here. Badgers are related to weasels so we surmised our digger was weasel, mink or fisher cat. But in another chapter, Goulson mentioned that UK weasels don't dig up nests. That left us with fisher cats, skunks or raccoons. Fisher cats won't come this close to the house unless desperate. Skunks have not lived here for years since the raccoons came. And talking to others, we have narrowed our thief down to raccoon.I have photographs of the ransacked nest but I hope the bees find a nest site there next year. Now I understand their life cycle and how delicate the balance is between the bumble bees and our wildflower fields. I have learned how to encourage the succession of more of our wildflowers. I will follow the early queens that I see on our back road next spring as they search for a nesting site. I will take more time to sit and observe the comings and goings of the three native species of bumble bees that we have here. I want to learn to find nests. Goulson is a skillful writer. His narrative and descriptive writing are very engaging. I laughed and even cried at one point. The forward to the book, describing Goulson's life when he was a boy, was the best part of the book. The saddest parts are those where he vividly compares that world to our world now, with devastated and fragmented habitats. I am so thankful to be able to live in a large rural area with bears, moose, bobcats, deer, turkeys and all manner of birds, fowl and invertebrates. I am blessed and will never take it for granted that this will last forever. It needs to be protected and cherished. There are already huge pressures on the land from development and a poor economy. Read this book. It isn't technical or boring. It is engaging and you will be sorry that you reach the end."
20,1250048370,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1108123-bettie,3," BOTWBBC BLURB: Dave Goulson has always been obsessed with wildlife, from his childhood menagerie of exotic pets and dabbling in experimental taxidermy to his groundbreaking research into the mysterious ways of the bumblebee and his mission to protect our rarest bees.Once commonly found in the marshes of Kent, the short-haired bumblebee now only exists in the wilds of New Zealand, the descendants of a few queen bees shipped over in the nineteenth century. Dave Goulson shares exclusive research into these curious creatures, looks at history's relationship with the bumblebee and offers advice on how to protect it for all time.We'll also hear about bumblebee sniffer dogs, how bees navigate their way home and why you should remember these tiny furry friends next time you pour ketchup on your fish and chips.One of the UK's most respected conservationists and the founder of the Bumblebee Conservation Trust, Goulson combines Gerald Durrell-esque tales of a child's growing passion for nature with a deep insight into the crucial importance of the bumblebee.He details the minutiae of life in their nests, sharing fascinating research into the effects intensive farming has had on our bee populations and on the potential dangers if we continue down this path.Read by Tim McInnernyProducer: Joanne Green A Pier production for BBC Radio 4."
21,1250048370,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91455-renee,4,"A lot of BUZZ about this really interesting book telling the evolution and history of bees. Goulson's enthusiasm for the natural world and the life of bees is contagious. The book is true science and fact but it is written in a way that is warm and delightful: I frequently found myself wanting to put it down to go bird and bee-watching.Example; when talking about the sheer amount of energy/calories that bees burn through (they move their wings 200 times per second), he gives this analogy: It would take an average sized man about one hour to burn through the calories if he consumed a Mars bar, if a bee were the size of an average man and ate the same Mars bar, it would take only 30 seconds to burn though those calories.I really enjoyed this author and his stinging wit (sorry; I couldn't resist)."
22,1250048370,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2501347-karatepop,4,"4.5/5I really, really liked this book! For some reason I was expecting it to be dry, but it wasn't. Dave Goulson is engaging, funny, and his love for bumblebees is contagious, probably.Bees are more related to their sisters than to their mums! WHAT. (Actual notes after I email my notes to myself.)"
23,1250048370,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-x,3,"3.5 stars. Goulson is not Bernd Heinrich and maybe I shouldn't compare one of my favourite authors with another naturalist writer, but I do, and A Sting in the Tale is good, but not superlative."

25,1250048370,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81350561-k-a-ashcomb,5,"This is a perfect summer reading. It is personal. It is informative. It is funny. It is sad. And it is engaging. I listened to the book while I took macro photographs outside of bugs, wasps, and bumblebees, and it took the experience into a whole new level. I don't think words do justice to this book, and the only thing I can say is to read it or listen to it. You will enjoy it.Okay, this might not be for you if you want to have a strictly scientific book about bumblebees but hear me out first before you dismiss it. The book contains a lot of information about their structure, living habits, social habits, and breeding habits. It is sprinkled throughout the book and enchanted with Goulson's personal experiences. He was a creepy child. In a good way. And what makes it wonderful is, he admits it.Now you might get the idea that this is a silly book with some facts in it, but that isn't the case. It is political as well if you like that sort of thing. Goulson goes over the reasons why the bee population has decreased, why it is dangerous to introduce them to somewhere they aren't native, and what it means to return the Queen back home (and where should the Queen be returned from.)You might have gathered as much that I loved this book. I did. I have nothing bad to say. Just smiling a happy smile and thinking of ordering the book as a physical copy. “The key to helping our rarer species to thrive is probably simply to add more flower patches to the landscape, making it a little easier for them to find food and keep their nests well provisioned.” P.S. If you want to help a bee population, plant lavender. "
26,1250048370,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26791640-rach-denholm,0,"This beautifully presented book was a gift from Dr Lucy, the researcher who assisted with the information collection. Before I met Lucy, I would have preferred to crawl over broken glass than to read a whole book about Bees. Goulson has a rare gift of combining outrageous humour, subtle wit, glorious detailed facts, and a remarkable literary ability, devising a highly entertaining and fascinating book, all about bees. I had a wonderful week in Oxford and purchased too many books from Blackwells. This is the second non-fiction I have been delighted with (see my reviews). As I work my way through my stack of books I am reminded of the wonderful holiday I had - my gift to myself that just keeps on giving."
27,1250048370,http://goodreads.com/user/show/142980-rachel,3,"I got about halfway through this book about bumblebees. I learned some really interesting things about bumblebees, like how sisters are genetically identical, how some insects mimic bumblebees and take over their nests, how bumblebees are different from honeybees, how queens rely on abandoned holes like mouse holes to make their nests in, how larger bumblebees are more often foragers and are actually better at foraging than smaller ones, maybe because they're smarter, etc. etc. Not sure if I'll finish it since I have some other books I want to read."

35,1250048370,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77388453-maartje,3,"The book opens with the story of the author travelling to New Zealand in search for a bumblebee now extinct in the UK. This makes for a compelling narrative in which the author navigates the reader through decades of research on bumblebees (and their recent dramatic decline) towards answering the question raised in the beginning of the book, i.e. can this short-haired bumblebee be successfully re-introduced to the British fields it came from? Although I am already very familiar with insect biology, I did enjoy the enthusiasm with which the author sets out to illuminate the reader. As this is obviously a topic the author is very knowledgeable and passionate about, I can even forgive him the anecdotal tone he strikes and the endless self-references. But this book indeed contained a sting in the tail, as we discover in the last chapter that the re-introduction is unsuccessful due to genetic erosion of the New Zealand population. Thank god there’s still a thriving Swedish population. Pardon?? Why on earth was that population not considered from the start? This would have circumvented the issues with synchronising the bumblebees to the seasons of the northern hemisphere and the poor genetic quality of a population founded by so few ancestors, not to mention prevented wasting research funding on senseless fieldwork on the other side of the planet. And why? Simply because the New Zealand retard-population felt more ‘British’… The whole operation was more about catering to the sentiment of ‘bringing our bumblebees home’ than about a successful reintroduction (not an innocent topic in itself). I would have expected a renowned ecologist like Dave Goulson to not let an alluring narrative dictate his actions. The only reason that this work gets three stars and not two is because it did spark an interest in bumblebees in a broad audience. With the fragile state that many bumblebee populations are in, that is still a decent cause."

37,1250048370,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3114089-niffer,5,"I received this book through a Goodreads First Reads giveaway.Toward the end of this book the author talks about how, even with a plethora of scientific studies showing the decline of bumblebees and the potential negative impact of that decline, simply doing scientific studies isn't enough. You need to get the word out. You need to reach the people who can make a difference. As a result he founded a bee conservation society in Great Britain.I believe this book is also part of his attempt to get the word out.This is not a scientific book. While the author talks about many studies he has been involved in, he does so in a manner that makes you feel as though he is a chance met stranger at the local pub, chatting with you about his pet hobby. Instead of using the scientific names for the various bumblebee species he uses their common names, with the result that by the end of the book you are excited to hear and carder bees expanding their territories and you're practically cheering when the short haired bumblebee is released again in Great Britain.The book starts out with the author's memories of collecting bird eggs and his many ill-fated attempts at saving injured wildlife or raising exotic pets. (Note: the author is apologetic about these tragedies, but they are still somewhat hard to read about. He is realistic about how these expeiences shaped his desire to study wildlife, especially insects, but also notes that modern conservationists would likely burn him at the stake if he did those things today.) Each chapter is peppered with fun little anecdotes about his obsession with pies, his mishaps with urine sample bottles, and other little gems that will caught you off guard and have you laughing along with him.But the author is also realistic about some of his findings. He talks about both the good and the bad aspects of honeybees. He is realistic about the potential impact if natural pollinators were to disappear. He recognizes that even our best efforts might not be enough to save some species of bumblebees.Really, I feel like this book should be required reading for anyone who is concerned about the environment, especially if you have been wondering ""What can I do to make a difference?"". I strongly suggest starting by reading this book. Then go plant a garden."

Did you know there are dogs who can sniff out bees? Did you know that in honeybees, mating takes place mid-air?. After the act, the male's genetalia ruptures, and the bee dies. The female flies away, with bits of the male bee's body still attached to her.The author's writing throughout the book builds the undeniable case that people, through use of pesticides and destroying natural habitats in favor of building, have long been having a deadly effect on bee populations.Bees are an important part of our fragile eco system. Bees pollinate flowers and crops, in addition to producing honey. Relocation of bees (through buying in bulk from ""bee producers"") has had, and will continue to have, adverse effects on the environment, by introducing a non-native species.For twenty years I've chosen my perennial flowers based on varieties that attract bees, hummingbirds and butterflies. For five years, I've provided water for the many bees in my yard (in shallow bowls, with large rocks and fresh flowers or greenery, to prevent drowning). The number of bees the last few years has prompted me to offer a second large water station.This excellent book has motivated me to make stronger efforts to protect the bees who visit, and offer more high nectar/high pollen flowers, and continue to resist any kind of pesticides."
39,1250048370,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63773-kelly-sedinger,4,"What a terrific, engaging book! I loved this one, after I checked it out of the library pretty much on a whim. Dave Goulson is a bumblebee expert and this book is basically an introduction to the amazing world of the bees. So often I've ignored bumblebees in the wild, usually only interacting with them to swat them away, but this book gives a tremendous amount of insight into the science of these amazing creatures and the essential role they play in our environment. One such anecdote involves the settling of New Zealand and the troubles they had with certain crops there, until they realized that the bumblebees back in Europe were pollenating them; thus began a long effort to literally transplant the native bumblebees to New Zealand. That story doesn't end there, though: two hundred years later, when the British began trying to reclaim their nation's natural countryside, they found themselves re-importing their own native, but lost, bumblebees FROM New Zealand back to Britain.Goulson's book also sounds the environmental alarm, as do most such books these days, but that's not a part of the story that can really be omitted, is it? The loss of bees, due to use of insecticides and the destruction of natural habitats and our long failure to really understand the degree to which bees in particular (and insects in general) are essential to our planet's biosphere, would be a catastrophe from which humans would be unlikely to recover.Goulson's writing style is conversational, and he shares a number of delightful anecdotes from his childhood as a budding naturalist. Well, perhaps ""delightful"" isn't the right word, as his stories often involve his own disastrous, if well-intended, efforts to be a good environmental steward as a boy. (One such example involves his effort to revive bees which have been soaked and are unable to fly, by heating them on a heat-pad.)"
40,1250048370,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81564-sarah,5,"A dangerous book to read over dinner, given how frequently I laughed -- which is not what you might expect from a non-fiction book about Britain's bumblebees. Goulson's style is so engaging, though, that I was as entertained as I was educated.Though the focus is on bumblebees in the UK, the underlying theme is universal: that habitat destruction damages populations of creatures great and small, including some we typically only think about when a careless barefoot stroll leads to a sting. I had no idea of the complexities and variations amongst bumblebee species. The bit on cuckoo bees, which mimic and hijack the nests of ordinary bumblebees, was particularly fascinating, as was the description of the very peculiar genetics of bees. Spoiler: female bees are diploid, as we are, but males are usually haploid, which means they grow just fine from an unfertilized egg.I also, as a scientist, particularly appreciated Goulson's recounting of his various experiments, which often didn't go as planned. They also involved a lot of hacking together of non-standard equipment (such as plastic hair curlers as temporary housing for queen bees), which was not surprising given Goulson and his teams are often running novel studies.The book both begins and ends with the tale of the short-haired bumblebee, a species native to Britain which was introduced to New Zealand in the late 1800's, subsequently went extinct in its native region, and is currently being reintroduced into Kent. The description of this project was enough to make me order red clover and wildflower seeds for planting this spring: it's a small effort, true, but this book shows that many little things can make a tremendous impact."

Since setting up the Bumblebee Conservation Trust, helping to trial the reintroduction of the short-haired bumblebee into the UK and planting his own wildflower garden at his chateau in France, Goulson has many interesting stories to tell in his near-perfect memoir of bees, flowers and agriculture of the UK and abroad.Although Goulson holds controversial views on pesticide use, he delivers enthralling accounts of how bumblebees form colonies, forage for nectar and pollen, and then reproduce to to leave a queen bumblebee to hibernate over the winter and begin the process all over again. Packed with moments of humour and levity, the writing in A Sting in the Tale is completely captivating and totally readable.Using bumblebees as a narrative tool, Goulson also expertly describes how and why Britain ruined it's biodiversity through intensifying agriculture, and why countries such as New Zealand ruined their native flora and fauna by introducing invasive plants. This is a must-read book for everyone!"
42,1250048370,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5925333-timothy-urban,4,"Wow. I really learned a lot about bumblebees and why they are disappearing. It's not mobile phone masts. They need wildflowers, apparently. Lupins, clover, lavender, that sort of thing. But the way we farm today seems to preclude meadows and hedgerows, and our gardens seem to have become parking spaces or expanses of decking.Dave Goulson comes across as an easy-going and very down to earth academic and guide, just as happy to talk about eating pies, buying a house and taxidermy as he is the bumblebee. For a good few chapters, this easy going manner bothered me a bit. I thought he ought to be angrier, more militant about his insect friends and their fight for survival. But his unshakably even temper and conciliatory outlook belies the huge and valuable contribution he's been making, not just in his attempt to save varieties of bumblebee from extinction but getting everyone to understand what we need to do next so they can flourish."
43,1250048370,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8990718-the-book,5,"Absolutely brilliant. Compelling. Enthralling. I didn't even LIKE bees before I read this, but Dave Goulson's passion for bees and everything to do with them is contagious - now I know if a bee were man-sized, it would burn off calories from a Mars Bar in under 30 seconds while flying. I know that bees are endangered because their natural habitats and foods are being systematically destroyed. I know about their life cycles. I know male bees can't sting. I know bee sisters are more closely related to each other than to their parents (!). I know dumbledore is an old English word for a bumblebee (I will be forever enchanted just by this fact). I know bees are crucial to pollination of a lot of modern crops we rely on, like tomatoes - I genuinely had no idea about this before. Anyway, I could go on, but in short this is a very amazing book and I recommend it whole heartedly. Right, now I'm off to join the Bumblebee Conservation Trust and to sign up for some bee watching..."
44,1250048370,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7027368-aaron-gertler,5,"Note: I received a free review copy of this book after interviewing the author for an article on colony collapse disorder (the scientific term for the terrifying downward trend in the bumblebee population). Recommended for: People who like science, nature, or memoirs. (Yes, that's a lot of people. They should all read it.)My knowing Dave personally might add half a star to my rating. But I was pleasantly surprised by the book: It's a colorful memoir that encapsulates an entire scientific career rather quickly, without skimping on the actual science. I learned a lot of neat things about the natural world, and I can't see a bee now without feeling somewhat honored to be in the presence of such a fascinating creature. For opening my eyes to a small, beautiful part of Earth's complexity, the author wins a fifth star. "
45,1250048370,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5861086-margaret-sankey,4,"This is a charming piece of natural history writing from a biologist who started out as a creepy kid with a taxidermy set and roadkill and advanced to academia studying bumblebees, including why they like to be transported in hair rollers, finding their hives with a military-trained Springer Spaniel sniffer dog, wearing a bee costume at garden shows and terrifying small children, rehabilitating a French meadow, investigating bee smuggling in Tasmania (for commercial tomato pollination) and attempting to reintroduce from New Zealand a bee that died out in Britain in the 1970s. "
46,1250048370,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5344627-sarah,4,Part cheerful memoir but with a solid core about bees and the wider ecology. I learnt a lot about bumblebees and by the end the cheerfulness was shadowed by the panic that is the collapse of the environment as we used to know it. I volunteered this summer and was trained to do the Bumblebee Conservation Trust Bee Walks (via the local Wildlife Trust) - and I can recommend them as really enjoyable as well as hopefully important if enough of us do them. The author set up the Trust and is someone who has actually made quite a difference in the bumblebee world.
47,1250048370,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17523782-mark-walker,4,"A great book. It focusses mainly on bumblebees, but the author is knowledgeable about a wide range of wildlife and nature. All sorts of fascinating facts about bees can be gleaned from this book. It is also well written. A great example of someone with a passion for a subject being able to communicate it with others. A great time of year, spring, to read this book as queen bumblebees have emerged from hibernation and can be seen foraging."

His book is fascinating on the topic of bees, and much else besides, written in a charming, accessible style. I learned a ton. Bumblebees in Tasmania! Commercial bee production! How bees find their way home! How modern farming practices have been dreadful for bees! Endlessly interesting."
49,1250048370,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15177356-cm-alsop,5,"I learned lots about bumble bees and their differences to honey bees. Their nests are very different, queens only mate once, and males have no stingers. Spoiler alert, I guess. My only complaint is that the author goes on tangents about his adventures with bumblebees. Like his PhD students, how much he likes meat pies, and his experience buying a house for his father. The entire book is well written but I don't particularly care about the other bits, I came here for bumble bees. "

53,1250048370,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10439337-andrew-blok,4,"This easy-to-read tome in a conversational tone was well worth the time it took to read. Dave Goulson, a professor in the United Kingdom and the founder of the Bumblebee Conversation Trust in the same country, discusses his life with bees (and other animals) and the life of and threats to the buzzing pollinators. Goulson covers the evolution, biology, and importance of bees to the landscape and agriculture. He discusses the politics that swirl around bumblebees and their spread across the globe (bumblebees were introduced to New Zealand to help grow clover for the colonizing British, but have since been barred from Australia (as the importing of any foreign animal is) where the tomato growers' lobby has been arguing that they should be allowed (because tomatoes pollinated by bumblebees grow better and tastier than those pollinated by humans)). He discusses the threats to bumblebees and the growing movement to undo the damage humans have done to their habitat (specifically in Britain, but elsewhere as well). He takes you through the bizarre world of bumblebee genetics and the reproductive year of a bumblebee nest, which is bonkers. I appreciate most about this book that, in clear and level terms, showed me something new and real about the world. I understand what bumblebees are doing better. I have a new kind of affection for the fat, furry insects that often visited my tomatoes, peppers, and eggplant this past summer and I have a goal to learn to identify them this summer. But mostly, it reaffirmed the truth of Aldo Leopold's warning, which struck me as true when I read them at the end of A Sting in the Tale: ""The last word in ignorance is the man who says of an animal or plant, 'What good is it?' If the biota, in the course of aeons, has built something we like but do not understand, then who but a fool would discard seemingly useless parts? To keep every cog and wheel is the first precaution of intelligent tinkering."" "
54,1250048370,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33485694-mark-mctague,4,"Bumblebees. Unless one is afraid of any flying insect, or is allergic to bee stings, what's not to like about them? They're chubby, hairy-fuzzy, fly rather slowly, and remind one of Bumblebee Man on the Simpsons. ""Ay, yai, yai, no me gusta!"" Mildly charming though they may be, why read a book about them? Five reasons come to mind:1. If you enjoy British understatement and tongue-in-cheek wit (the author, Dave Goulson, a British entomologist, founded the Bumblebee Conservation Trust, has mentored umpteen Ph.D. students, has spent most of his adult life researching bumblebees, and makes being a bit of a nerd seem rather cool);2. If you enjoy some of the gross absurdities of the animal kingdom (his brief description of the sex life of a honeybee drone should be required reading for every teenager or twenty-something who's beset with amorous woes);3. If you wonder whether this world is all enormously interconnected and whether we truly are all in this together - cautionary tales of the best-laid-plans-of-mice-and-men, aka the Law of Unintended Consequence;4. If you wonder whether little things matter, and whether humility has any value;5. And if you wonder whether any one person can make a difference in this mad world.By turns lyrical and coldly scientific, this book explains not only one man's lifelong affection and interest in the natural world but also why, if we have any sense of self-preservation, we will pay great heed to all the creatures around us. As Pogo famously said, ""We have met the enemy, and he is us."" Goulson's marvelous book also shows that though we can be our own worst enemy, as well as that of other species, we don't have to be, which may be the best part of this thoroughly enlightening and enjoyable journey into the world of bees."
55,1250048370,http://goodreads.com/user/show/108989152-loona-mets,5,"Absolutely beautifully crafted book filled with many many amazing facts about bumblebees. I got this book when I visited London but only now got around to reading it, and I couldn't be more glad I did. Goulson's avid fascination with bumblebees is simply contageous, I learnt so much from reading this book. I had never had an idea that 'dumbledore' is in fact an Old English word (originating most likely from Somerset or Sussex) for bumblebee (then again, I am not a native English speaker as well). I've always adored bumblebees, but only now realised how little I knew about them. Bumblebees and all sorts of bees (in fact there are around known 20,000 bee species in the world!) are far more interesting than I had actually anticipated. Bees have smelly feet in order to let other foragers know which flowers have been recently visited and therefore don't contain anymore nectar or pollen. Male bees don't have stings. Lots of bee species have been driven to the edge of going extinct, but there are in fact many things even individuals can do to help save the bees.""Conservation is not something that should be left to others. It is easy to get depressed and despondent at the impending extinction of the polar bear or the tiger, or at the horrific progress of deforestation in the tropics. Perhaps governments or scientists or organisations such as WWF can do something to address the situations, but as individual it is very hard to know where to start - it all seems remote and dauntingly complex. In contrast, conserving bumblebees is something anyone can do. /.../ Anyone with a garden can help enormously - plant some comfrey, viper's bugloss, foxgloves, chives, aquilegia and so on, and you will see the results almost immediately.""

56,1250048370,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1517100-andrew,4,"This is a lovely little book about all sorts of bees, written by a real expert, who founded the Bumblebee Conservation Trust.It starts off with tales of his childhood escapades, trying to help injured creatures – with mixed results, dissecting animals which had been killed on the road, and collecting eggs and butterflies for his collection.He then describes the bee’s year and what has caused them to become so endangered in this country. Essentially, since the days of Dig for Victory in the Second World War, when every last piece of land was used to grow food, there have become fewer and fewer patches left to grow wild, so bees have to travel further to find the nectar they need. Also, the use of fertilisers can cause wild grasses to grow tall very quickly, swamping any potential wild flowers on any fallow land that remains. And fewer flowers means fewer bees.The author is involved in researching the bees which we still have in this country and trying to reintroduce some of our former species. He has also bought a house with some land in France to develop a bee friendly habitat, and he encourages other people to do their bit by growing traditional flowers in their garden, on their farm or on roadside verges.I found this a fascinating read. It’s written in a chatty style and is very easy to understand. Although I was aware that bees were endangered, I didn’t really understand why – and I certainly didn’t know that they are now mass-produced to pollinate tomatoes, or that bees are happy to be transported inside a set of Carmen rollers."

I was researching bee images (for a crochet project) and I came across a mention of this book and then saw some of Goulson's tweets and intrigued, bought the book. It is SO good! I learned a lot about bumblebees - history of, habitat, research, etc. Goulson is a very witty guy - in that understated British way. He's incredibly passionate about his bees. Imagining him tying bits of silver or painting dots of bumblebees to follow them is mind-boggling. He's the kind of guy that you'd want to go to the pub with and have a good chat and laugh at his bucket-load of stories. Plus, he really loves pie and that's always a sign of good character.I think anyone with a soul who reads this book, and has any small bit of a garden, will be motivated to plant some bee-friendly plants. I'm no gardener, but already planted some red clover in my lawn this fall and am eyeing its growth like a proud mom.""So the solution may be a pet sniffer badger. Sadly for me, however, badgers do not domesticate well, remaining grumpy and rather dangerous."" ""Thomas Huxley, a great friend and supporter of Darwin, took this apparent logic even further by arguing that the power of the British Navy was attributable to spinsters, who keep cats, which eat mice, which therefore don't eat bumblebees, enabling the bumblebees to pollinate clover, which is fed to cattle, from which salted beef was derived, which was the staple food of the British Navy."""
58,1250048370,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2410849-juliet-wilson,5,"Dave Goulson has been obsessed with wildlife since his childhood dabbling in taxidermy. He is now a well respected academic with research interests in bumblebees and founder member of the charity the Bumblebee Conservation Trust.This book covers a lot of ground about UK bumblebees but is centred on the author's attempts to bring the short haired bumblebee back to the UK. This bumblebee was once found across the south of England but dwindled until it was only surviving in Kent. It became extinct in the UK in 1988 and the only descendents of those Kent bees are now found in the wilds of New Zealand, where a few queen bees were shipped over in the nineteenth century. The story of the attempted reintroduction of this species into the UK is a catalogue of scientific and practical problems but has had a positive impact on the amount of wildflower meadowland and the populations of a number of scarce bee species in the area. The book also covers a history of the human relationship with bumblebees, the biology and ecology of these fascinating insects and how we can help conserve them. A chapter is devoted to the author's recreation of wildflower meadows on an arable farm in France and another is devoted to bumblebee sniffer dogs, recruited to find bumblebee nests so that they can be studied and conserved. This is a fascinating book for anyone interested in insect ecology. It is full of interesting scientific facts but written in a very accessible and often humourous style. You may well look more closely at the next bumblebees you see! "

I also love coming across the big, fat, furry bumblebees climbing in and out of the flowers in my yard. I could watch them for hours! So, of course, when I saw the cover of this book I immediately picked it up. Bumblebees and England..two of my most favorite things!This book is entertaining even with all the science-y stuff thrown in. I learned a lot about bumblebees and the important role they play in the ecosystem. When people think of bees they think of honeybees, honey and the white stacked boxed hives you can see sitting on a farm. Although I understood that all bees are pollinators, I didn't realize that each bee species would be a different pollinator to different plants. Did you know bumblebees are raised and sold and they are the ones to pollinate tomato plants?Goulson does a great job telling his own story of bee fascination and how he came to love the humble bumblebee. He is entertaining and does a great job explaining the science and research findings to people who are not scientifically inclined. I was only a few chapters in when I looked up The Bumblebee Conservation Trust, the charity he founded and started following them. Although, I live in America and the buff-tail bumblebee is not local to my parts, this book did encourage me to reassess where and what plants I can put in my yard that will help bees flourish in my small part of the world."
