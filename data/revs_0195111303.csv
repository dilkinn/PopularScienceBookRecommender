0,0195111303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,2,"I look around the topography of the Geneva Botanical Garden's alpine section, a miniature mountain complete with grass, flowers, rocks and even tiny rivers, and pause, awe-stricken, to consider the marvel it represents. The DNA of species developed over 3.45 billion years has somehow coalesced into a form that is both a small ecosystem in its own right and a model of something larger. It contains information on two levels, which are different and yet somehow the same. Can we explain all of this through the blind forces of Darwinian selection? Maybe, and maybe not. I ford a stream with a single step, crossing as I do so from one region to another of the living three-dimensional graph the garden represents, and ponder how I will review Stuart Kauffman's book.By writing my review, I will combine short signs into longer ones in a dance eerily reminiscent of the bubbling, barely controlled interactions that enzymes are simultaneously following in my body's 256 different types of cell. When I have finished, I will release it through the medium of the Internet into the post-capitalistic abstract economy of Goodreads, where my labor will be exchanged for the notional currency of ""likes"". What is a ""like""? In comparison, a soap-bubble is excessively concrete. Yet desire for ""likes"" determines all my actions.Together with my gifted young colleagues Mei Dupp and Nosuč Persson, I have attempted to develop mathematical models that relate a review's structure to the number of likes it will receive. It is a complex optimization problem: the space of all possible reviews contains more elements than there are atoms in the universe. No chance of searching it exhaustively. Yet we have found ways to create reviews that are ""good enough"". By splitting each review randomly into independent sections of a few words, and optimizing each one individually, we can reach much higher maxima than if we brutally tried to improve the whole text at once. As so often, the key to the problem lies in the thin zone of controlled chaos between the two classical areas of sense and nonsense. The figure below illustrates. Are our algorithms sound? Will our plan work? Whence cometh the likes? We cannot answer these questions. We can only hope that people will vote."
1,0195111303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"This is the type of book I like best; the author, Stuart Kauffman, describes his own research into a new field called ""complexity theory"". Kauffman builds simulations of lattice networks, and explores their characteristics. He shows how the simulations are analogous to chemicals combining, and may shed light on the origin of life. He claims that the simulations show that the origin of life may not have been an improbable accident, but instead may have been almost inevitable. Auto-catalytic reactions may have driven chemicals to combine and ""reproduce"". In other simulations, Kauffman shows how evolution through natural selection may not have depended on improbable, random mutations. Genes may be ""self-organized"" in such a way as to make genetic improvements a very likely occurrence. Coevolution is also discussed in some detail. Kauffman also shows the parallels between biological and technological evolution. These parallels are quite impressive. The concepts are amazingly thought-provoking.This is not an easy-to-read book; it is filled with simple mathematics, though there are very few equations. Sometimes I had to read a page twice to really understand it, but was well worth the effort. Interestingly, the writing style alternates between straightforward technical writing, and lyrical. This alternation gives the book a nice change of pace."
2,0195111303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1944947-barnaby-thieme,5,"How is it possible in an entropic universe, in which natural systems progress inexorably toward disorder, that life should continually move in the opposite direction? History may well remember the science of complexity and self-organization as a greater revolution than quantum mechanics and relativity theory, and Stuart Kauffman is one of its most important voices. This book is a readable presentation of the ideas Kauffman explored in much greater detail in ""The Origins of Order"", a magnificent extension of evolutionary theory that explains the emergence of order by appeal to statistical mechanics, the study of dynamic systems, and the study of self-organization propounded by great luminaries like Nobel laureate Ilya Prigogine. True to its title, Kauffman offers a thrilling approach to empirical science that weaves humanity and human concerns back into the fabric of the cosmos. This is a vital book. "
3,0195111303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1284720-igor,4,"Rarely do I gain such insight from a book, but Kauffman was able to tie together all my interests in biology, economics, anthropology, into a single unified theory of spontaneous order/self-organization. Although the concept were world-view changing, the context, outside of some beautiful prose, is dull and teeth clenching dry/complex at times... at many times. The book itself was recommended to me by an MIT graduate student in Complex Systems Science, straight from his reading list, I believe. The arguments were much too specific and complex for me to follow all the way through. On the periphery of the density of the case for such a bold unified theory of origins, is a beautiful view of the universe as a mix of variables forming a complex system that has an innate and inevitable drive toward self-organization, increasing complexity, and life. The paradigm shift offered by this book is that life is not an unlikely, improbably chance occurrence; Jacques Monod's ""chance caught on a wing""; but rather an expected outcome from the interactions of a complex system with multiple inputs. It starts from an auto-catalytic process of molecular interactions, molecules acting on themselves, creating a disequilibrium. A molecular storm system, if you will, feeding on inputs and spitting outputs. All you need from there is to be able to maintain this disequilibrium that drives itself to supra-critical behavior. Where life begins from that point is a matter of definition, mere semantics. The most beautiful idea is that whatever it is that we are, is merely the refined outcome of a molecular storm that was started billions of years ago, and is still surging against entropy and equilibrium. Kauffman, himself, is a biologist, but he works in part of an interdisciplinary team of scientists -- and is seeking laws of self-organization applicable to any complex system, be it biological, economic, cultural, etc. This new theory attempts to patch up all the holes of natural selection, such as those early situations where the blind choreographer cannot make effective selections in a system which is too simple, too chaotic, and undeveloped for selection to begin to work its magic. It also provides ammunition for organization of corporate structures in such a way as to attempt to avoid the pitfalls of centralized predictive planning (which is increasingly futile in a world getting exponentially more complex) and harness the power of decentralization and co-evolution.Its an interesting idea presented in this book, which seems almost obvious, but has not been accepted in economics. The idea that diversity begets diversity, and in turn, diversity begets growth. This is a powerful idea in that the way growth is measured today does not take into account the diversity of products and ideas in the economy and marketplace of ideas. Such an economic ""law"" would most certainly favor a minimally regulated market system to any kind of centrally planned alternative.Finally, what this book offers, perhaps above all else, is a story of emergent order that can offer an awe and inspiration, perhaps even a spiritual experience, to those atheists and agnostics that have had their special central place under God's warm and steady gaze ripped asunder by the growth of scientific thought -- instead of giving us a creation story that is a cold, improbable, and haphazard mistake that arose from the swamps of a primordial earth, it gives us one in which humanity is an inevitable and expected outcome of the laws of this curious universe. What a wonderful theory! And what wonders yet remain eager to find us behind the ever settling fog of our ignorance?"
4,0195111303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,1,"Even for a popular science book, it's pretty terrible because there is so much wrong with the ""science"", which is mostly buried beneath mountains of jargon. Also, rhetorical arguments and hyperbolic, bogus claims pervade the meandering prose drenched in soft language and philosophy. The thesis is not very unclear, and the majority of claims are totally bogus. See my full review for (way more) details: http://thephysicspolice.blogspot.com/...Cool stuff: evolutionarily stable strategies, the red queen effect, genetic algorithms, self-modifying code, simulated annealing, the founder effect, game theory, the traveling salesman problem, the P vs. NP problem, auto-catalytic sets, strange attractors, fitness landscapes, and peptide chains."
5,0195111303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1355869-olivierco,3,"The book would have gained much clarity to be written in a classical scientific literature style. It should have been then an easy read as the concepts and maths involved in At Home with the Universe are not too complex.The ideas are interesting but some shortcuts didn't convince me, especially when a whole theory is supposed to be proved just because a mathematical model derived from it seems to be in adequation with it on a peculiar point.For instance, p 109:""Thus our prediction: a human with 100,000 genes should have about 317 cell types. And in fact, the number of known human cell types is 256. If our theory is right, we should be able to predict the scaling relation between the number of genes and the number of cell types. The latter should increase as the square root function of the former."" Then he presents a not so convincing graph (with only ten living species) which should prove that the whole model is right.I would draw a parallel with the representation of our solar system: When Copernic published his De Revolutionibus , it was clearly an improvement on the geocentric model, but even if his model gave clearly good and verified results (such as the fact that Venus presents phases), these results don't prove that the whole model is exact.So even if the graph were more convincing, it wouldn't in any way prove the validity of the whole theory."
6,0195111303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12807932-b-j-richardson,3,"Spontaneous generation makes a comeback. If you were to sum up this book in one sentence, that would be it. Stuart Kauffman, a specialist in the theory of complexity, asks a very legitimate question. In a world where nature's laws demand we move from order to disorder, why does all life evolve into ever more complex forms. He then attempts to demonstrate three things: 1) his work with autocatalytic reactions demonstrate that chemical combinations for the first generation of life was not some highly improbable event but rather a near certain inevitability (hence the first sentence), 2) there are parallels between natural biological and human technological evolution, 3) coevolution, thrives best at a specific balance between chaos and order. Even though he acknowledges that the theories behind a lot of this book are the minority view, it does sound awfully convincing to me, I am reminded of Proverbs 18:17 ""The first to speak in court sounds right - until the cross examination begins."" This is not an area in which I know enough about to be able to debate him in my own mind. So my interest is peaked enough to read further that I might be able to eventually do so."
7,0195111303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1572625-jesse,0,"As I read this book, it appeared to be a series of anecdotes about how certain chemical systems appear to spontaneously ""self-organize"", and then some anecdotes about simplistic computer models the author created to simulate the ""primordial soup"" where life may have begun. None of it was convincing, certainly not enough for his amazing reveal, ""Life started on earth just because really complex interconnected systems tend to manifest pseudo-organized behavior!"" of which I was completely unconvinced. I stopped reading the book halfway. Turns out I am a system complex enough to self-organize and return this book to the library before finishing it. "
8,0195111303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2092082-daniel,5,"This book is really good, though needs to be taken with a grain of salt since its super theoretical. Basically Kauffman is trying to simulate with mathematical models what occurs in evolution. He tries to simulate adaptive mutations and such (in genetic terms) with a mathematical formula/model. Its a nice thought, but doesnt work so well when you simply cannot make a model complex enough to include a reasonable amount of the variables we encounter in everyday life... oh well, still a very provocative and thought stimulating book. Id love to chat with anyone about this book if you ever read it... James/Nicole."
9,0195111303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2309246-cassandra-kay-silva,5,"Read David's Review. I think he captures the main points about this book that are important. It was an interesting proposal the way the author sets up complexity to reflect mathematical ideas, his proposition of the way of biological creation. I was very interested in his proposals and he was very clear on the work in this area and the basis that it is built on. I can't say that I have any way of checking his hypothesis. Only to say that it does seem quite sound and well put together. That the delivery was solid and the material well presented. An enjoyable read for sure. "
10,0195111303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1971718-b-rule,3,"This book was all over the dang place, and not really in a good way. The problem is a lack of intellectual discipline on behalf of the author. Kauffman is trying to serve several masters with this book, and it ends up a mash. Not only is he giving an excited account of his academic work modeling certain types of systems which might or might not have a bearing on evolutionary ecologies, but he's also trying to extend those models to areas where he admittedly has no expertise (like technology, politics, and law) and also stating grand ontological theories of our place in the world. His fundamental biological point is that life could be an emergent population of auto-catalyzing systems of molecular substrates and enzymes of sufficient diversity. His view is thus that life is actually almost inevitable given the mathematical likelihood of order emerging in such situations. He believes this despite the admitted failure of any laboratory to reproduce such an occurrence, but okay. He also thinks those models might, MIGHT, apply to political orders and to technological innovations, although he says over and over that he doesn't have any real basis for those views other than a hunch. His grand philosophical aim is creating a new secular sense of the sacred in which we marvel that we are meant to be here because life is so suited to the underlying math of the universe, and that somehow this emergent quality of math is better than blind chance and the atomism of DNA (I dunno man). I admire his attempt to find some meaning beyond the clockwork god, but frankly, I don't understand what he's on about. How is a firmer case for the anthropic principle evidence of a non-mystical sense of the sacred, whatever that is? On his view, we're still random, we're just more likely to arise. And how do we know that we're not in a vanishingly rare goldilocks universe in a multiverse of dead variants? I am not heartened that life was inevitable or slightly more likely than not, because life is a given at this point. Pushing the timetable back or weighting the dice in our favor doesn't have anything fundamental to say about ultimate purpose, because we're still either products of chance in a meaningless universe, or there is an unseen hand. He wants the math describing the universe to be that hand, but it's still just physics, not metaphysics. There's a lot of beard-stroking in this book, ultimately signifying little."

Once there, you are given some oversimplified puzzle, some solution that may or may not mean much in the original domain where the simplified puzzle is drawn. Even language and facts are loose. Case in point: when discussing simulated annealing, the author incorrectly point to quenching as “natural annealing”. There are also a non-trivial amount of grammatical errors to annoy you. This is not to say the author is a charlatan scientist. There are bits and pieces of info from other people’s works that are interesting pointers and his own work may have some scientific merit if you read all the related work and judge it from that context. But as a book, the writing is terrible and the content simply does not cohere. "

I feel that I have only scratched the surface of this book and come away with insights into catalysing organisational change, order within complexity under competing constraints and how interdependency and conflicting constraints result in rugged fitness landscapes and the resulting use of 'patches' to avoid chaos and local optimisations.

These principles may be employed to analyze all manner of highly-involved patterns, from molecular biology, the rise and fall of corporations, to the intricate workings of government. Kauffman outlines the characteristics and potential uses of complexity, simply delineating its meaning for the future of scientific thought. For general readers. Annotation copyright Book News, Inc. Portland, Or.Choice ReviewsThis engaging and baffling tale about biological evolution by someone who has been dubbed a ""visionary pioneer"" is based on decades of computer simulations, boundless enthusiasm, lots of imagination, and zealotry for the impossibility of defining complexity theory. Kauffman attempts to illuminate an enormous number of phenomena using his view of self-organization (""order for free""), and claims that ""complexity"" somehow catapults one beyond a Darwinian understanding of evolution by natural selection. Kauffman asserts that from cultural systems to ecosystems, the evolutionary dynamic follows similar laws, and spontaneous order plays a great role in all of them. The subjects covered range from the origins of life to development of individuals, and comparisons of organisms and artifacts. The large number of figures vary from cartoon-like to mesmerizing networks and puzzling graphs. The last chapter treats the reader to a hodgepodge on ""an emerging global civilization."" It is not difficult to see how chaos theory is one of the fountains of the science of complexity. Recommended for the general reader who likes to take an eclectic stab at everything.

You may find eight spirals winding up to the left and 13 spirals winding up to the right, or 13 left and 21 right spirals, or other pairs of numbers. The striking fact is that these pairs of numbers are adjacent numbers in the famous Fibonacci series: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21... Here, each term is the sum of the previous two terms. The phenomenon is well known and called phyllotaxis. Many are the efforts of biologists to understand why pinecones, sunflowers, and many other plants exhibit this remarkable pattern. Organisms do the strangest things, but all these odd things need not reflect selection or historical accident. Some of the best efforts to understand phyllotaxis appeal to a form of self-organization. Paul Green, at Stanford, has argued persuasively that the Fibonacci series is just what one would expects as the simplest self-repeating pattern that can be generated by the particular growth processes in the growing tips of the tissues that form sunflowers, pinecones, and so forth. Like a snowflake and its sixfold symmetry, the pinecone and its phyllotaxis may be part of order for free"
14,0195111303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34209361-michael,5,"This book takes a hard look at how life on earth came to be. Rather than buy into the idea that somehow life evolved via the ""blind watchmaker"" scenario (i.e., similar to the argument that an army of monkeys sitting at typewriters would eventually compose a great novel), Stuart Kauffman builds a terrific case that the ingredients essential to life are bound to the rules that govern complex adaptive systems. And the very presence of these rules send a strong signal that ""we the living"", are ""we the intended.""The author's conviction to both his argument and the science of complex systems is evident throughout the book. If you are coming to this book without much background in complex adaptive systems, you will not be short-changed here. In fact, Kauffman provides extremely rich examples with numerous simple diagrams to educate the reader as he builds his case. Considering the book was published some 19 years ago, I was surprised to see the concept of gene networks given so much attention in the text. Seeing how the latest trend in genomics research is looking at genes and proteins as a regulatory network and attempting to identify specific disease pathways, the science in this book is extremely relevant."

The mathematical approach was sometimes hard to follow, but in general I understood what was said and it made me see that life and autocatalytic sets of molecules or artifacts are not an accident but rather a logical result of how our universe works, which converges to an optimum on the edge of chaos and rigidness.The boolean networks and the NK-models that are described are a nice way of showing how all of this works and is, as Adam Smith said about market dynamics, governed by an invisible hand.Still, I have not found any tools that I can directly start using in my work, except for stressing organisation to decentralise in non overlapping patches of departments that are working autonomously on innovation, since this will optimise towards excellent solutions in bringing the organisation as a whole further. Also, I now have the arguments to stress that a little bit of chaos in organisations can help to get out of rigid situations where little improvement is done and go towards new paradigms of activities."

This is probably because the author has explained concepts like auto-catalytic sets in other contexts. After about three chapters, the work seems to peter out. There are repetitions, ideas are not so convincing and one drifts through rambly conversational text.After a strong start, the book was a bit disappointing."
32,0195111303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30180707-brett-williams,4,"Stuart Kaufman’s 1995 book in the second in a series of 6 (most resent, 2019) that carry on where D’Arcy Wentworth Thompson (1860-1948) with his 1917 book On Growth and Form began, and shares ideas with Michael Polanyi’s (1891-1976) “spontaneous order.” Though like Adam Smith’s (1723-1790) “invisible hands,” none provided the cause. Kaufmann does that. His topic is “complexity theory.” The idea that by physics alone, crazy but quite natural reactions in sufficiently nutrient rich environs with disequilibrium energy gradients making reactions run up or downhill will create complex, self-sustaining systems. Be they elaborate molecules, catalysts, cells, life, economies, technology or democracy, each conforms to its fitness landscape, dictated by its own constraints and that of others its interacts with. Blind nature pushes itself toward the boundary between order and chaos, crossing into the oblivion of runaway reactions, retreating into less orderly arrangements, or tempting fate at the door to one or the other in long term survival. That “order for free” occurs, resulting in such extreme complexity by relatively simple but rigorous laws is the shocker. Order for free moves the goal posts, once 100 yards away, 60 yards closer. In the arena of biology, evolution’s random mutations and deterministic selection take it from there. (Sorry, Creationists.) The first half of this book, part spirituality (See? We’re not an accident), part revelation (the “famous” Belosov-Zhabotinski reaction that I never heard of—kooky!) would be of interest to just about anybody. The second half is of such detailed nuance you could write your own code from it. And even though I was interested in doing just that, Kaufmann occasionally crossed my eyes with so much detail.

It fits in well with the invisible hand that spontaneously generates, Life, Economies, and Technology. It really seems like a book from another historical epoch. I read it in the nineties and loved the idea of good things coming naturally if you just let them play out. The book still has interesting ideas even if it is totally out of step with the current zeitgeist. Hazards of assuming the current historical moment is some kind of natural order that will endure. "

Complexity theory is pretty awesome and he lays out the scientific detail and metaphysical implications simply and readably. Topics include- autocatalysis (and the holistic emergence of life), spontaneous emergence of order in Boolean systems, and subcritical and supracritical diversity in systems and its application to evolution. I'm not sure how much of it is pure speculation, but in isolation, he builds a strong (very well-written.)"

Kaufman has great things to say but tries to be more of a writer and not enough of a scientist - flowery, overwritten passages and tangents - he doesnt have that science-writer's ability to boil maths and science ideas down to simple explanations... o well... "
37,0195111303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7180588-nick-gogerty,5,"Kaufman is simple brilliant. I had read this years ago and am glad to have read it again. The posited thesis of an expected ""us"" due to emerging complexity in form is compellingly put forward. Kaufman leaves out the hinted post ""US"" but shows his brilliant knowledge of complexity, biology and physics. He is also a very gifted writer."
38,0195111303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37481253-chad-tronetti,2,Interesting but unconvincing. Here we have some compelling evidence of Boolean logic creating auto-catalytic sets and ultimately Order-for-Free. It's pretty cool. It also doesn't do much to explain the things Kauffman likes to think it explains. Add one more impotent just-so story to psuedo-scientific mythological accounts of the origins of life.

41,0195111303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10839743-the-cambrian-cloud,5,Theoretical biologist Stuart Kauffman is one of the big thinkers and early pioneers of complexity thinking. A must read for anyone interested in complexity or how complex systems form and adapt. 
42,0195111303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49317086-michael-armstrong,5,I give 5 stars to books which change your life. At 71 it is bit late but it certainly incites you to investigate further. 
43,0195111303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61582216-makoto,4,Provides a great framework for understanding self organization in a huge variety of fields that I think is still very insightful today.
44,0195111303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25652344-paul-roman,5,I have learned a lot from this book.
