Look, I’m no speed reader, but neither am I a dullard. This book is so chock-full of compounding facts, so dense, that interpreting it takes devastating attention. This book must be paced like a thoroughbred. There’s not a picayune fact in 886 pages—and these pages are 7 x 9, small-bordered, 10 font, single-spaced, with substantial primary source quotation in 8 font. 60 pages of pictures are unnumbered.I don’t use these words often (on Goodreads, maybe 3 times in toto), but here they are, and all together at once. The Making of the Atomic Bomb is a tour de force, a magnum opus, a bible, a masterpiece, a work sui generis. Richard Rhodes has conducted a crusade to chronicle all things Atomic Bomb. In scope and scale this is Gibbon’s Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Tolstoy’s War and Peace, and David McCullough’s Truman.For his effort, especially during the Cold War when archives were classified, Rhodes received:1. The Pulitzer2. The National Book Award3. The National Book Critics Circle Award4. Jason’s 5 StarI can’t summarize this book. Doing so would be equal to reviewing the history of the papacy from Christ to present.But I’ll try. For you.The People. Rhodes introduces about 500 characters, but follows in essential detail the 50-70 scientists and military brass and politicians whose names are forever linked to the history of the atomic bomb. The construction of the A-bomb is as much the ultimate conflagration of personal fear and desire of Jewish and expat German scientists, as it is a story about physics. This overlay of humanity perfectly balances what would otherwise be a tough scientific read.The Science. Rhodes requires you not only to recognize your high school physics, but to remember it and manipulate it. The book is written well above the 10th grade level. To some this requirement will be a drawback and you’ll be lost on page 5. But for those of us comfortable with the basics of quantum mechanics, the book is a sweet payoff (and makes up for those missed parties in college studying Calculus III). Rhodes adroitly presents the physics, beginning in the late 19th century, that is fundamental to understanding the process that led scientists to discover and control spontaneous nuclear fission. This is where I mercifully abstain from enumerating key points of quantum mechanics.The Complex. You will learn that production of the atomic bomb was not merely resigned to the labs and acreage at Los Alamos. No. In fact, to produce Little Boy and Fat Man, US industry built unique facilities that, by war’s end, would equal the footprint, the employment, and the cost of the entire North American auto industry in 1945, and far exceed its complexity. It’s a wonder that secrecy was maintained across so many facilities and university labs, and with so many participating scientists around the world. Nuclear fission was first demonstrated in 1939, yet by 1945, culminating with Trinity, man had harnessed the power to break apart the atom.The War. Rhodes reveals the operations and battlefield maneuver of all three levels of warfare critical to the production of fissile nuclear material, and provides a bright interpretation of well known battles, that, if slightly different, would have drastically changed the timeline of production for components of the A-bomb, for Allies and Axis. He dovetails the history of WW II and the lock-step production of U235 and Pu239. He also respectfully underscores the ethical considerations of US policy toward the use of fission weapon on civilians. There is a great chapter about Hiroshima and Nagasaki from the Japanese civilian perspective, and, again, perfectly balances what would otherwise be a tough scientific read.Rhodes finely combines these topics in a galloping, well-rounded, and seamless story of the wonder of man’s intellect, the exigencies of fighting world domination, and the revelation of a new science pulled from the face of God."
1,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1232712-matt,5,"“Turning, diving, circling back to watch, the crew of the Enola Gay missed the early fireball; when they looked again, Hiroshima smothered under a pall…Jacob Beser, the electronic countermeasures officer, an engineering student at Johns Hopkins before he enlisted, found an image from the seashore for the turmoil he saw. ‘That city was burning for all she was worth. It looked like…well, did you ever go to the beach and stir up the sand in shallow water and see it all billow up? That’s what it looked like to me…’ Little Boy exploded at 8:16:02 Hiroshima time, 43 seconds after it left the Enola Gay, 1,900 feet above the courtyard of Shima Hospital, 550 feet southeast of Thomas Ferebee’s aiming point, Aioi Bridge, with a yield equivalent to 12,500 tons of TNT… ‘It was all impersonal,’ [Pilot] Paul Tibbets would come to say. It was not impersonal for [Copilot] Robert Lewis. ‘If I live a hundred years,’ he wrote in his journal, ‘I’ll never quite get these few minutes out of my mind.’ Nor would the people of Hiroshima…”-	Richard Rhodes, The Making of the Atomic Bomb In a book filled with thousands of deaths, many of them coming in the violent double-clap of light and heat from the world’s first atomic attacks, one of the most poignant is that of a young woman named Amelia Frank. Amelia was the wife of the Austrian physicist Eugene Wigner. Wigner had emigrated to the United States and eventually found a teaching job at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He and Amelia met, and shortly thereafter, were married. Then she got ill. As told to Richard Rhodes, author of The Making of the Atomic Bomb, Wigner recalled: I tried to conceal it from her that she had cancer and that there was no hope for her surviving. She was in a hospital in Madison and then she went to see her parents and I went with her but I didn't want to stay with her parents, of course, because I was, after all, a stranger to her parents. I went for a little while away to Michigan...and then I came back and saw her in her bed at her parents'. And she told me essentially that she knows that she is close to death. She said, 'Should I tell you where the suitcases are?' So she knew when she talked to me. I tried to conceal it from her because I felt that it would be better if a reasonably young person does not realize that she is doomed. Of course, we are all doomed.To me, this excerpt nicely encapsulates Rhodes' Pulitzer Prize-winning opus. It is a testament to Rhodes’s willingness to find the human dimensions of this tale of scientific discovery, to step away from plutonium cores, lithium-6 deuteride blankets, and boosted fission primaries, and acknowledge that the heart of the story is people, not just super-complex equations written on a chalkboard. In many ways, The Making of the Atomic Bomb is the most humanistic physics textbook you’ll ever read. Moreover, Wigner’s remark – “we are all doomed” – is thematically appropriate, because this is not simply a book about a scientific achievement, but about the terrible consequences of those achievements. The fruits of the Manhattan Project, gloriously covered in this tome, were two enormously powerful – though differently designed – nuclear bombs. Dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, they killed tens of thousands of people, and sickened many thousands more with radiation. The bombs ended the Second World War, but also pushed the world to a different kind of brink, where a series of cascading mistakes could potentially have ended in the human race turning earth into a charred and glowing wasteland. The Making of the Atomic Bomb is a history book rare in its excellence, marvelously combining the elements of narrative history, rigorous scholarship (including author interviews), and technical writing. Even if you were terrible in physics – and I was beyond terrible, as my high school physics teacher would mournfully agree – you will be able to understand the science behind this most controversial of all inventions. Beyond that, you will delve deep into the lives of the (mostly) men who dreamed it, designed it, built it, guarded it, dropped it, were saved by it, and were turned to dust by it. Rhodes allows them all their say: Leo Szilard, Edward Teller, Enrico Fermi, Ernest Lawrence, General Leslie Groves, Colonel Tibbets, and a grocer from Hiroshima who remembered the survivors: “I can still picture them in my mind - like walking ghosts...They didn't look like people of this world...They had a very special way of walking - very slowly...I myself was one of them.” The two towering characters of this story are Niels Bohr and J. Robert Oppenheimer. Bohr is featured heavily in the first third of this book, which traces a clear and clean history of physics, that somehow not only avoids being soporific, but is actually quite fascinating. Bohr's contributions to atomic research included the Bohr model of the atom, the liquid-drop model of the nucleus, and identification of Uranium 235, which are all things I now vaguely understand thanks to Rhodes’s explanatory abilities. The latter portions of the book are dominated – unsurprisingly – by the “American Prometheus” himself, Oppenheimer. He was a brilliant man in his own right, but his main contribution to the Manhattan Project was to manage the greatest collection of scientific minds perhaps ever gathered in one place. Oppenheimer was also a gift to future historians: a man acutely aware of his place in time, his position at the juncture of events; a man who understood what the scientists had done before anyone else. He was also, because of his classical education, always ready with a printable line. When the Trinity test took place at Alamogordo, it was Oppenheimer who famously quoted the ancient Hindu text of the Bhagavad Gita: “I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.” The subject matter of The Making of the Atomic Bomb is daunting, and its unfortunate title makes it sound like a how-to guide. Nonetheless, it is eminently readable, fast-paced, and well-structured. It's divided into three parts: part one covers the history of physics; part two takes care of the construction of the bomb, including General Leslie Groves’s efforts to keep the thing a secret (a task that ended in monumental failure); and part three tells of the woe unleashed upon Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It is this last part that will stick with you the longest. In telling of the bombings, Rhodes makes an effective stylistic decision: he steps almost completely out of the picture. He lets Tibbets and his crew talk about dropping Little Boy, and excerpts their impressions as the Enola Gay sped from the scene. Then he quotes the Manhattan Project Study on the bombing, observations that are no less chilling for their unaffected, technocratic presentation (“Because the heat in the flash comes in such a short time, there is not time for any cooling to take place and the temperature of a person's skin can be raised 120 degrees Fahrenheit in the first millisecond at a distance of 2.3 miles”). Finally, Rhodes lets the survivors speak in their own words, descriptions of grotesqueries that seem plucked from Stradano’s depiction of Dante's hell. For an author who knows how to handle prose, it was a bold choice, to let those who were there become the sole narrators. Every so often, one book or another appears to debate whether or not the bombs should have been dropped. Richard Frank’s Downfall, for instance, does a commendable job making a case for the bombings. Smartly, Rhodes doesn't make any judgments. Such a debate would not have fit well within these pages. Instead, he lets the Japanese survivors have their say, forcing you to acknowledge that in making utilitarian arguments about the greater good, we are not dealing with chess pieces on a board, but the lives of men and women and children. Yet Rhodes also tells the story of the American troops preparing for the potential invasion of Japan. He quotes one young American officer's remembrance: “We were going to live!” The destruction they'd wrought led many of the scientists involved to back away from their invention. Rhodes gives a taste of this in the epilogue, though you'll have to read his sequel Dark Sun to hear the moral debate that soon sprang up. It is Oppenheimer, always crafting sentences in his head, who sums it up, and provides this book its epitaph:Taken as a story of human achievement, and human blindness, the discoveries in the sciences are among the great epics.Rhodes’s The Making of the Atomic Bomb is more than equal to the task of capturing this sweeping, complex, and consequential event, attempting to do justice to all who were involved."
2,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"It was with some trepidation that I started to read this book. It is such a lengthy book, and I didn't anticipate enjoying it very much. I thought that it would be emphasize mundane details about the Manhattan Project. But, I was happily surprised by the scope of the book. The Manhattan Project actually takes up less than a third of its pages.The first third of the book is about the discovery of modern physics, and the lives of scientists who played a major part in the discovery. The book examines the peeling back of the onion of modern physics, much in the way of a detective story. Modern physics involves the structure of the atom, quantum mechanics, and relativity. Both the physics and the personal lives of the revolutionary scientists are described, in great detail. Richard Rhodes has a talent for weaving together the threads of a complex story. These threads follow lines of reasoning, experiments and theoretical work.The second third of the book describes how scientists came to the realization that fission is possible, using a chain reaction with neutrons. This portion of the book also describes the darkening of Europe due to the rise of the Nazis. Some of the book was devoted to the rise of Antisemitism in Germany, and the resultant flight of Jewish scientists out of the continent. This phase of the book is important, as it helps explain the number of Jewish scientists who worked on the atomic bomb.The last third of the book described the Manhattan Project; not so much the project itself, but the realization in Great Britain and the United States, that it was necessary to develop an atomic bomb. It was known that Germany and Japan were working on the bomb, and if either country beat the Allies to its development, that would spell out a very bad ending to the war.I learned a tremendous amount from this book, and there were several aspects of the book that truly stick in my mind. The role of serendipity played a part in the discovery of Enrico Fermi and his colleagues. The found that slow neutrons increase radioactivity more than fast ones, while doing an experiment on a wooden table. Then the repeated the experiment on a marble table and noticed a marked reduction in radioactivity! This led to a greater understanding that neutron speeds, inhibited by the presence of hydrogen in the wooden table, were an important factor in creating chain reactions.Several characters played a very central part in the book; of course, General Leslie Groves, Leo Szilard and Robert Oppenheimer played central roles in the story. But, the most interesting character was the Danish scientist Niels Bohr. He won the Nobel Prize for his work in understanding the strucutre of the atom and quantum mechanics. Besides this, he was politically active. He went to President Roosevelt and to Prime Minister Winston Churchill, to try to convince them to share the atomic bomb with the Soviet Union. He was concerned about the political balance of power after World War II. His ideas were dismissed by both leaders. He also played a key role in saving thousands of Jews in Denmark, by persuading the King of Sweden to allow them to escape into Sweden, to avoid capture by the Nazis.Some readers question why this book needs to be so long, so detailed, and sometimes describing events that appear to be so tangential to the main story. But this epic book brings the various threads together, and in retrospect these threads all seem vital to the story line. He weaves together the personalities of the scientists, their experiments and discoveries, and the politics on national and international scales, that were so important at the time. Richard Rhodes explains why both the United States and Great Britain found it necessary to develop, and finally to drop the atomic bombs on Japan.The book brings so many anecdotes with important messages to the main story line. The making of the atomic bomb did not occur in a single place at a single time. It evolved over continents and half a century. The technical problems were formidable, and the political issues perhaps equally difficult."
3,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49365462-w,2,"Finishing this Pulitzer Prize winning book turned out to be quite a slog.There is way too much detail about theoretical physics and technicalities involved in making the atomic bomb.It is almost a technical manual.In addition,there are details about the lives of the scientists who worked on the project,but those are not particularly compelling either.The liveliest portion of the book deals with the actual attack on Hiroshima.The tales of the victims are harrowing,but this portion is all too brief.The pilot who commanded the mission was Colonel Paul W.Tibbets,a name I remember with distaste.For him,the mission was ""impersonal."" He proudly named the plane,The Enola Gay,after his mother.A crew member of his wrote,however,that he could not get those few minutes of horror out of his mind,if he lived a hundred years.The attack on Nagasaki is dealt with even more quickly.The description of the fighting on the Pacific islands,prior to the dropping of the bombs is fairly interesting,however.Also,the part about the fire bombing of Tokyo and Dresden.Tokyo was already burnt out,otherwise it could have been a target for the atomic bomb.By and large,however,this felt like a theoretical physics textbook and I had to skim a great deal.And finally,the unease felt by some of the scientists including Oppenheimer,about what they had unleashed on the world.""I am become death,the destroyer of worlds."" Too little remorse,too late.This book could have done with a great deal of trimming and less tecnicalities to make it more interesting.I was also reminded of anxious days in February last year when the prospect of nuclear war between India and Pakistan seemed like a real possibility,once more.Not that it would be the last time."

It is overused. Abused even. It is a word that can easily lose its power if diffused into too many works by too many authors. However, I can say unabashedly that this book, this history, is a masterpiece of narrative history. It is powerful, inspirational, sad, detailed, thrilling, chilling. It has hundreds of characters. Some like the early physicists almost seem like lucky gods born at the right time. How can you not love Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr, Ernest Rutherford, Marie Curie? These giants seemed to fall into the right spot in history with all the brain cells needed. But on top of this, they were amazing men and women; kind and nobel. They seem to possess not just the smarts to deal with post-Newtonian physics, but a certain amount of poetry and philosophy. They seem like the Founding Fathers (and mothers) of the 20th century and the modern age. There are also the smaller gods. The gods of war. Oppenheimer, Fermi, Teller, etc. Richard Rhodes covers them all. He explores the development of nuclear physics without losing the reader, he follows the development of the bomb and the enrichment of uranium and production of plutonium. He details the work and the failures in Japan and German. He provides a fair assessment of the environment and the horror of World War 2. He literally leaves few stones unturned. The bombs when they come seem both anticipated and surprising. I felt a pressure in my shoulders and neck as I read about the Trinity tests and the dropping of the bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. But Rhodes doesn't let the reader off the hook. He spend almost 20 pages detailing the oral histories of those who saw the effects of the bombs first hand in Hiroshima. Those who lived to tell the horrible tale.If there are heroes in this tale, they are always heroes with a dark asterisk, or Quixotic heroes. Bohr trying to convince politicians to take risks with peace, to convince war leaders to think beyond the dropping of a bomb. Szilard trying desperately to convince scientists to remain quiet in the beginning to avoid Germany finding out, and later working to convince England and the US to include the Soviet Union to avoid an arms race. There is Oppenheimer and his struggles with the fate that his gifts provided for him to midwifing this rough beast into existence. It is a noble and a sad and a horrific and a beautiful book all at once and it deserved all of the awards (Pulitzer Prize, National Book Award, National Book Critics Circle Award) it won. I have read hundreds of nonfiction books and thousand of books, and only a dozen may be better....And I'm still not done. I want to add more... "

Oh, and John Wayne.If you want to impress a geeky engineer, read The Making of the Atomic Bomb. I can't imagine a more complete and authoritative work about one of mankind's most important inventions. When people speak of great human accomplishments in the 20th century, they invariably reference von Braun and the race to the moon. This book shows that the development of the atomic bomb was, while morally questionable, arguably just as amazing in its engineering and scientific prowess.Rhodes does not ignore any aspect of the process. This book is a scientific history, a political history, a biography, and a technical manual. He begins in the 19th century at the advent of nuclear physics, and walks through the lives of its significant contributors. He goes into (often excrutiating) details about the development of the first nuclear reactors, the early life of Oppenheimer, and the development of the amazing military-industrial complex required to create the small amount of material needed for the three atom bombs detonated during World War II (one test unit and the two used over Japan). Rhodes makes the people involved seem human and manages to mostly avoid social commentary, merely presenting the facts as they were.This is truly an amazing book. If you read it, I suggest keeping a running list of names: there are a LOT of people referenced. I plan on reading this book again sometime, although it did take me three months to get through it the first time."

It’s difficult to give a book like this on the mass murder of thousands of civilians a five star rating, but Rhodes did an impeccable job tying together all the threads that wove this dark tapestry in world history. From the men who discovered, and decided to build the atomic bomb—once set in motion the end was almost inescapable. Could the Allies have won WWII without it? Were the justifications sound? All we have is conjecture and opinion, the deed was done. This book lays out the entire surrounding history in a dry, matter of fact way devoid of judgement.

7,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13472185-andrej-karpathy,5,"For thousands of years man's capacity to destroy was limited to spears, arrows and fire. 120 years ago we learned to release chemical energy (e.g. TNT), and 70 years ago we learned to be 100 million times+ more efficient by harnessing the nuclear strong force energy with atomic weapons, first through fission and then fusion. We've also miniaturized these brilliant inventions and learned to mount them on ICBMs traveling at Mach 20. Unfortunately, we live in a universe where the laws of physics feature a strong asymmetry in how difficult it is to create and to destroy. This observation is also not reserved to nuclear weapons - more generally, technology monotonically increases the possible destructive damage per person per dollar. This is my favorite resolution to the Fermi paradox.But I digress. Rhodes' ""The Making of the Atomic Bomb"" is a wonderful and exhaustingly detailed case study of the development of a transformative technology - the atomic bomb. The book is very thorough and covers the initial discoveries in nuclear physics, the early experiments, the government's intervention, the massive Manhattan project and its parallels in 4 other world powers, the associated secrecy, diplomacy, sabotage and espionage, and finally culminates with death and destruction at Hiroshima/Nagasaki and the associated political and ethical dilemmas.I'll summarize the book to give an idea of what it's about and highlight some parts I found interesting.The story of the bomb begins circa 1938 against the backdrop of an imminent second world war with a series of rapid discoveries that showed that if you shoot a neutron into a Uranium 235 isotope atom, the atom rapidly becomes unstable, breaks up and gives off 1) a lot of energy and 2) an average of 2.5 more neutrons. A number of scientists immediately realized that if you ""chain"" this effect you'd make a bomb. Making an atomic bomb therefore amounts to 1) isolating the U-235 isotope from natural Uranium (which is mostly (99.3%) an un-fissionable U-238), and 2) shooting one handful of U-235 into another at a high speed with some conventional explosive. Alternatively, a completely separate path was discovered: you could transform Uranium to Plutonium (which is much easier to separate) and create a bomb using a more complex implosion mechanism. Not knowing which path to take, the US ended up pursuing both a U-235 bomb (""Little Boy"") and a Plutonium bomb (""Fat Man"") with their entirely separate industrial processes. Amusingly, both paths converged within 3 days of each other in the summer of 1945, and the bombs were dropped on Hiroshima/Nagasaki respectively. This terrifying display of technological superiority forced Japan to accept an unconditional surrender and ended the second world war.It was quite interesting to follow the political commitment of each world power in response to the scientific developments. The US established a committee in 1939 to investigate the potential of building a nuclear bomb but it crawled at a snail's speed for 3 years until almost half of the second world war was over, mostly due to the incompetence of key individuals (e.g. Lyman Briggs, who sat on the UK's MAUD report, or possibly Enrico Fermi who in an early meeting with Admiral Hopper cited the necessary critical mass as possibly being on the order of a small sun when he knew better). However, with the intervention of Oliphant et al. the US finally stirred in 1942 and started the Manhattan project. As for the other countries, paraphrasing, the UK was like: ""Here US, we did a lot of the theory work but we're kind of busy dealing with Germany over here."", Germany was like: ""This isn't going to be ready in 3-5 year time horizon and we're kind of in a lot of trouble, so we're going to poke at it a bit at most. Also, our anti-semitism cost us half of all nuclear physicists so that wasn't ideal."", Japan was like: ""We can try our best but we don't really have the resources"", and the Soviet Union was like: ""We're kind of behind here so we're going to go all out on espionage.""The Manhattan project was a spectacular display of national technical achievement. Niels Bohr has said that ""[building the bomb] can never be done unless you turn the United States into one huge factory"". Luckily, it wasn't nearly as bad. In a few years, The Manhattan Project took ~$50B 2016 dollars, which was about 0.4% of the US GDP in its peak or only about 9 days of the total war spending. In its peak it employed about 125,000 people (about 0.1% of all workforce) and grew to be about as large as the 1945 US automobile industry. Most of its complexity went into the laborious process of isolating U-235/Plutonium from natural Uranium. Once the infrastructure was in place it was possible to produce several atomic bombs per month.The bombs were not ready in time for the defeat of Germany in 1945, but Truman decided to use the bombs on Japan to 1) prevent further loss of American lives in face of Japan that was deeply dug in and clearly unwilling to surrender and, as is hinted at, 2) to justify the costs of the project. The Little Boy was dropped on Hiroshima and killed an estimated 70K people (eventually 200K by 5 years). The Fat Man was dropped on Nagasaki a few days later and caused 60% of that. What I did not realize was that these casualties were large but not astronomical. For example, a single day of bombing Tokyo with conventional explosives killed 100K people and injured 1M. What I also didn't know is that Liutenant General Leslie Groves (who was in charge of the Manhattan Project) was strongly in favor of dropping one of the bombs on Kyoto, the serene ""Rome of Japan"" established back in 793. Luckily, his plan was vetoed by the Secretary of War Stimson who refused to bomb the city due to its cultural significance. What the hell, Leslie? Unbelievable.As I am a scientist myself, I was particularly curious about the extent to which the nuclear scientists who conceived and designed the bomb influenced the ethical/political discussions. Unfortunately, it is clearly the case that the scientists were quickly marginalized and, in effect, told to shut up and just help build the bomb. From the very start, Roosevelt explicitly wanted policy considerations restricted to a small group that excluded any scientists. As some of the more prominent examples of scientists trying to influence policy, Bohr advocated for establishing an ""Open World Consortium"" and sharing information about the bomb with the Soviet Union, but this idea was promptly shut down by Churchill. In this case it's not clear what effect it would have had and, in any case, the Soviets already knew a lot through espionage. Bohr also held the seemingly naive notion that scientists should continue publishing all nuclear research during the second world war as he felt that science should be completely open and rise above national disputes. Szilard strongly opposed this openness internationally, but advocated for more openness within the Manhattan project for sake of efficiency. This outraged Groves who was obsessed with secrecy. In fact, Szilard was almost arrested, suspected to be a spy, and placed under a comical surveillance that mostly uncovered his frequent visits to a chocolate store.As a last curious historical note, World War 2 came at exactly the time when the very last conventional war could be fought. Given the advances in nuclear physics, starting a conflict a few years after 1939 would have been impossible due to the danger of all-out nuclear war in which everyone loses. I had also often thought about what would have happened if Germany did not execute Operation Barbarossa and open the Eastern front with the Soviet Union, which could have bought it extra time and resources to cause more havoc elsewhere in Europe/North Africa. This book provides the answer - the US nuclear weapon program was so far ahead of the German program that even if the war dragged on longer, Germany would have been reduced to irradiated ash.It is almost impossible to do justice to this tome, so let me conclude by saying that the story includes awesome nuclear physics, science superheros, fanatical supervillans, massive factories appearing in the desert, political intrigue, British commandos on secret missions, explosions, oh and - it all actually happened. Great read, 5/5.Additional Reading:- Operation Epsilon, Captured Nazi Scientists at Farm Hall learning about the US dropping the Atomic Bomb: transcripts http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/p... . Very interesting reading that features Heisenberg, Hahn et al. confronting the fact that US built and used nuclear weapons."

Rhodes divides the book into three parts; the first section exploring the history of nuclear physics from the discovery of radioactivity at the end of the nineteenth century. It also explores the background of the scientists, including Bohr, Fermi, Teller, Oppenheimer, Lawrence, and Szilard, who would later come to be an integral part of the Manhattan Project. The second section concentrated on the actual making of the atomic bomb as well as the scope of the Manhattan Project featuring Oppenheimer's unique talent directing the lab at Los Alamos. The third section explores the final steps in preparing the atomic bomb for delivery as well as exploring the fears of many of the scientists. This book ends with the devastation and utter destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in excruciating detail as well as in vivid photographs. This is an important book for all of us.""Robert Oppenheimer oversaw all this activity with self-evident competence and an outward composure that almost everyone came to depend on. 'Oppenheimer was probably the best lab director I have ever seen,' Teller repeats, 'because of the great mobility of his mind, because of his successful effort to know about practically everything important invented in the laboratory, and also because of his unusual psychological insight into other people which, in the company of physicists, was very much the exception.'""

There are biographies on many of the key figures involved in making the bomb. There are histories that talk about specific stories or events that occurred during the story. Scientific manuals talking about the technical aspect of making the bomb alone could fill a small library. This does not include the studies discussing the affects after the bomb was dropped.The challenge in writing a book on the bomb is trying to find the perfect match between the story and the details.Richard Rhodes book is a comprehensive book.The book is not about the Chicago Labs, or Los Alamos, or even Manhattan project. The book is about the global efforts to crack the secret of the atom. It does not begin with America's entry into WWII, but rather discusses the early study into the atom. It even delves into the discussion of other weapons of mass destruction---machine guns, chemical and biological weapons, and bombs. Did I mention that this is a comprehensive book?But therein lies the mastering of the English Language. A 900 page book on an Atomic Bomb could have become cumbersome and buried under the mass of information available and shared. But it does not.Over the past few months, in preparation for the 75th anniversary of the dropping of the bomb, I have read several books on the subject. This book is easily the best. It covers everything in an interesting and education way."

11,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1248986-evan,5,"Like most of you, I've heard and mulled over the arguments about whether America should or shouldn't have dropped the atomic bombs on Japan to hasten the end of World War II. Historians, scholars, philosophers, armchair know-it-alls, etc., have all had a go at it. It's not so easy a question to answer definitively, despite what would seem to be an open-and-shut case on the side of the moral and right thing to do.Consider you were a soldier, or the family of a soldier wondering if, at that moment, your son or daughter was alive and well, alive and suffering, or dead.Consider what had happened earlier, at Monte Cassino in Italy, when Allied commanders made one of the most controversial military decisions of the war and bombed a monastery perched resolutely like a fortress astride an impregnable mountain pass. There are good arguments that that historic monastery never had to be bombed; that, in fact, the whole pass could have been gotten around at a juncture to the east, thus avoiding the head-pounding frustration of trying to take the mountain. Whatever the case, day after day -- to the grunt on the ground -- that monastery was like an evil thing that tied them down, that glowered at them like a death stare. It symbolized a kind of fatal inertia and stasis, a frustrating and threatening obstacle that seemed never-ending. When the place was bombed, it was an instant morale booster to the soldier under siege. If it was the wrong thing to do, it was something to worry about later. At least now you might have a chance to get home alive.I thought about this when Richard Rhodes writes about the men who dropped the atom bomb on Hiroshima. One is quoted, and I paraphrase: ""At least this will get this thing over with and we can get home alive."" If I had been that man, or any of those men, would I not think the same thing and sigh with incredible relief? What was happening on the ground was just more of what had been suffered for the past half decade worldwide. There would be more pain before the relief could come; that is just the way of it.In 1987 , Richard Rhodes published this intricate, thoroughly impressive epic account of what happened when theoretical physics supercollided with the expediencies of war, politics and survival. Despite the ultimate horror of the implications of it all, there is an odd comfort in finding after reading this that there is one book that is the definitive history of its subject. Rhodes' account pretty much hits everything you would need to know about this epochal event in human history, and one of the good things about it is that it expects the reader to bring a little bit to the table. Some esoteric science is hashed out often in this, and it only a fraction of it makes sense, that's OK. This is a book about the process of scientific collaboration as much as it is about the particulars of problem-solving. The amount of information in it is staggering; the narrative pace is beautifully modulated and the feeling of being there in the labs, the dens, the homes, and the environs of the participants is vivid as hell. The book does a fine job of parsing out the ethical issues of what this episode has meant to the world, and explains beautifully the checks and balances of the scientific community and method of verification and discovery. Science deniers would do well to read it. Ultimately, if our government is misusing science, it's not necessarily the faults of scientists, but the ignorant malevolence of a large segment of the compliant, willfully ignorant or easily duped citizenry. This is one of the truly essential books, and nobody has an excuse for not reading it.kr/eg '20"
12,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1462364-kogiopsis,2,"This was the textbook for my freshman seminar at college. The class was titled 'The Manhattan Project: Studies in Science and Lessons for Mankind' and while it was not what I expected going in, it was generally pretty good; I liked my professor and my classmates and we had good discussions, so it was a positive experience. I was not, however, crazy about this as a textbook, at least for the class: Rhodes focuses a lot on the technical aspects of the bomb and only deals with the tremendous ethical issue it presents in the last one or two chapters, plus an epilogue. Similarly, the class spent more time than I wanted on technical physics, particularly in the beginning, and only had two conversations that even touched on the ethics of Truman's final decision. The text is also rather poorly organized: it starts at one period in time and then abruptly jumps backwards, working its way slowly forwards again - so slowly that when it reaches its original stopping point and becomes briefly entangled in Rhodes' struggling to highlight how this is The Moment all over again (even though it was the entire first chapter) it's honestly hard to tell what's going on. Add to this the vast number of names, some of them very similar to each other, and what you get is a book which often verges into the realm of 'unreadably esoteric'.Eventually, though, it got more readable. I still could have done with less technical physics bits, but... apparently that can't be helped. Oh well.Bottom line: not recommended for pleasure reading, unless you really like physics, but not a horrible textbook.One of the themes of this book, and one of the things which came up repeatedly in my class, was the idea that over time the definition of 'military target' grew and grew and grew until now anyone - you, me, the kids in that elementary school across the street - is an acceptable military target. I hadn't been thinking about this much until just yesterday, when this speech came up in my podcast feed. It chilled and depressed me, and what it made me think is this: we often say that we learned from Hiroshima and Nagasaki, that we wouldn't do something so horrible again, and maybe we wouldn't - in a single moment like that, at least. We wouldn't make a decision to kill hundreds of thousands of people and leave others in pure agony as the result of a single explosion, but we would and we do make decisions to allow bombing of noncombattants or to invade countries in order to ""get our way in the world"". We're still doing horrible things. We're still killing innocents for no reason at all other than flagrant disrespect for human life. We didn't really learn - if anything, we've gotten worse, because we're not really talking about it anymore. We live in a world where people argue that showing pictures of the victims at Hiroshima in a Smithsonian is 'treason', where the news doesn't cover American atrocities, where 'American lives' matter more than the lives of women and children and old people and innocent human beings going about their daily lives in other countries.I don't hate my country. I don't even really hate the people who let it become this way, or those who encouraged it. But I am very, very sad for all of us and to be honest, especially them. I'm sad for people who think that the value of a human life changes depending on where it is in relation to an arbitrary border. They've lost something valuable and I'm not sure if they can ever get it back. It is the responsibility of all Americans to ensure that our country doesn't lose that same thing: respect for people.EDIT: I almost forgot - there are a couple of quotes from the epilogue that I wanted to add.""The fireball,"" writes Leona Marshall Libby, ""expanded to three miles in diameter. Observers, all evacuated to 40 miles or more away, saw millions of gallons of [atoll] lagoon water, turned to steam, appear as a giant bubble. When the steam had evaporated, they saw that the island of Elugelab, where the bomb [building] had been, had vanished, vaporized also. In its place, a crater 1/2 mile deep and 2 miles wide had been torn in the reef.""(Describing the first H-bomb test)And, from notes taken on a talk about the future of atomic weapons:""If we are sure to get a Third World War, the later it ocmes the worse for us.Victor of next war will make a world government, even if that victor should be the United States, having lost 25 million dead."""
13,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53179837-george,5,"Incredibly thorough. This book features everything, the science, history of every single discovery and person related to nuclear physics, the politics, the Manhattan project, the dropping of the bomb, testimonies of the people it was dropped on (I compliment the author for adding this in, it makes sure to make the point that this is not just a bigger bomb), and polices after the A-bomb was dropped to the first test of the H-bomb. I have to say this book tested my capacity for retaining so much information, but I somehow succeeded and learned a great deal, but I admit I will have to reread the part about discovery and creation of plutonium... I see what the book Crystal Fire was inspired by, and the same warning I gave in that review still applies (even more so in this book). "
14,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29931726-joel,5,"Science history at this level of breadth and depth does more than just add to the details; it changes your fundamental understanding of science and history. Most science history tends to give the impression that science advances with giant leaps of inspiration by rare geniuses, but this book shows that science is a cumulative accretion of countless incremental insights. This book illustrates other profundities of science history, for example, that the role of the experimentalists, like Rutherford and Fermi, are often as crucial as that of the theorist. Another: that the familiar hypothetico-deductive method isn't exactly how science works in real life - often, experiments are done on a hunch, without a hypothesis to falsify, and often hunches persist long after they've been falsified. These points are only appreciated by delving into the details at the level this book does.With such profound insights into the philosophy of science available, it is a shame that the author chose instead to grasp at lofty sentiments about the nature of war and weapons of mass destruction. Of course, in a book about the atom bomb, such discussions are obligatory, and it's logical for this to be the focus of the philosophical discussions in the book. But the position that the author chose to argue - specifically, Bohr's conviction that the surest guarantee of peace in a post-nuclear world would have been for the USA to share its knowledge with Russia - is frankly nonsensical, and in historical hindsight, mistaken.The author is clearly deeply interested in the philosophy and psychology of the characters, and he's not afraid to take an opinionated position on such matters. The background about Bohr's existentialism was interesting but somewhat puzzling, and I found the parts about ""complementarity"" and the descriptions of the endless policy meetings, especially in the later chapters quite boring. He should have focused more on the science because that's where he excels. He is a master at explaining technical details of the science and technology, and I was able to follow the technical discussions and learn an enormous amount about nuclear physics and chemical processes.Another weakness of Rhodes is that his style unnecessarily difficult to follow. He gives quotes without attribution. He uses acronyms without defining them (I was sometimes able to deduce them from context, like HE - High Explosives). His sentence structure is often confusing - he likes to interrupt them with pairs of dashes. He'll use non-chronological narrative, and then specify dates without the year. He'll introduce a character briefly, and then not mention him until much later (lots of turning to the index to remind myself ""who was that person?""). All this makes for slow and difficult reading.Overall, the book works better as a history of science than a history of war and politics. It's exciting at times, but boring or confusing at others. A flawed masterpiece, but a classic, nonetheless."
15,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2168708-marta,5,"A great story of science, war, history, politics, a story that uniquely blends humanity’s greatest talents with its gravest errors. A triumphant scientific and industrial effort of the greatest minds racing to invent the way of humankind’s self-destruction.As soon as nuclear fission was discovered - only in December of 1938 - nuclear scientists all started frantic research projects, discovering a vast source of energy, new elements, and more potent radioactive sources. With this, the thought of an atomic bomb occurred to everyone - and Leo Szilard convinced the US to launch a secret program to get the bomb before Hitler did. The scientists new that the bomb was inevitable - but thought that governments would use it to end all wars, because they would realize that this could destroy the world.But no one knew just how terrible this new weapon was. Some scientists had an idea (particularly Bohr and Szilard) but preventing the use of it after completion was too late - politically, the US had to use it; and only after using it, and only after some time, did everyone understand what vast terror they unleashed.The book evolves: it starts with the nuclear research history from the late 1800s, through Rutherford, Einstein, Marie Curie, to Nils Bohr and Leo Szilard. It paints the background of antisemitic laws driving the best scientists of Germany, Eastern Europe and Italy to the United States. A frantic scientific surge is followed by the great Manhattan project, a marvel in itself - an entire industry built within three years that surpassed the size of the entire American auto industry. The challenges they overcame such a short time are fascinating. And then we come to the dropping of the bomb - humanity’s darkest hour. The suffering it created is beyond imaginable. The total destruction was instantanious, destroyed lives, buildings, and every remnant of social structure that would enable rebirth. The book devotes a large section to eyewitness reports, which are horrifying. It was just death, even months later. It is a fascinating book which necessarily ends on a horrible note. The bomb was dropped. At the same time, I wonder, that if it was not dropped, would we have learned how dangerous it was? Bohr was right: having the bomb created an escalating nuclear arms race. But it also has stopped large-scale wars and bids for world domination via military means. We still have wars - but the nuclear arsenal is a deterrent of large wars. But how dangerous is it, achieving peace while sitting on a pile of destruction?Highly educational, fascinating, and a book to ponder for a long time."
16,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,5," Rereading this classic on the atomic bomb written in the 1980s. It covers the science behind and politics and characters that lead to building and use of the atomic bomb in 1945. It picks up the thread at the turn of the twentieth century and developments in the field of physics and chemistry that lead to the idea of releasing the power locked in the nucleus of an atom. It also traces the politics of Europe throughout the early twentieth century such as the first world war and the spread on fascism and the race for the bomb once the second world war mobilized scientists and governments to develop these horrific weapons. It ends with the trinity test and graphic descriptions of the horrors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Definitely a first book to refer to when thinking about nuclear weapons, arms races and genies in bottles."
17,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2758455-katy,5,"A thick and dense book. Very well written and I learned so much more about the science of the bomb, WWII, the politics and the decision to use the bomb. Highly recommended. "
18,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38995237-nick,5,"I don't believe there are any histories of the Manhattan project that compare to that of Rhodes. It has been the definitive story of the building of the bomb for twenty-five years and is likely to remain so -- most of the engineers and scientists involved are no longer available for interview.The book lives up to its impressive reputation. It is a detailed and eloquent account—of the early years of almost incredible scientific productivity, of the machinations of committees that nearly killed the project before it started, and of the gargantuan industrial operation that was necessary to produce a few dozen kilograms of fissile material.But the most powerful aspect of this book—the one I suspect will stick with me long after I have forgotten the facts, figures, and chronologies—is Rhodes's thorough and balanced exploration of the moral ambiguities surrounding the use of the bomb.It is difficult for me—a child who grew up in a mostly peaceful world—to contemplate the social and political circumstances in which the dropping of the atomic bomb could be considered a conscionable act. But the perverse fact is that the very existence of the atomic bomb is in no small part responsible for the peace of my lifetime.I can't say I am convinced that Truman's decision was the right one. I don't know if I ever will be. But the horrors of the atomic bomb were dreamt up in a world that is almost entirely alien to me. A world in which saturation incendiary bombing of cities had become ""normal."" A world in which tens of thousands were dying in gruesome battles for Pacific islands every month. This book attempts to place the decision to drop nuclear weapons on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in an appropriate historical context, while also making clear that there might have been other ways to end the war short of a direct assault on the Japanese home islands.Rhodes has written a history of the atomic bomb that is neither dismissive nor breathless, neither fawning nor shrill. It is a remarkable, balanced, but ultimately ambiguous history of perhaps the most ambiguous scientific and engineering effort in history: the quest to create a weapon so horrifying that the only possible result was peace."
19,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57028413-abby,3,"OK EVERYONE. The moment we've all been waiting for. I have FINISHED this book.Considering how much I complained about this book, you're probably surprised I gave it 3 stars. So let me break it down:First off, I would have never EVER read this entire book without it being assigned reading for a class. So I don't think that justifies a poor rating. But I seriously cannot imagine reading this book for pleasure. It is SO dense, complex, detailed, and LONG. Also, had it not been for explanations in class, especially concerning the physics material, I highly doubt I would have fully understood what was going on. BUT I would like to acknowledge the detail, research, and precision this book holds. There is so much information - this must have taken forever to write. But unless you LOVE WWII/nuclear history/strategy/discussions AND nuclear physics, this book is going to be absolutely painful. But this would make a great book to use for a research paper or something. If you're along for the ride, get ready for a thousand different names of scientists.Also I actually enjoyed the last two chapters!"

I consider it one of the best history books I've ever read. Each chapter ends with a compelling paragraph that stunned me; almost like the last scene in an old serial movie. The books treats topics like, the rise of the Jewish scientists, the rise of modern warfare, the rise of the U.S. generals, the birth of modern nuclear physics, etc. It ends with the making of the bomb, not the war and it's aftermath as you would suppose. The writing is brilliant, compelling, and subject is fascinating, particularly to me who remembers the bombs and who would wake up early in the morning in the 1950' and watch the southern sky for the red flash as the bombs were tested in deserts south of Salt Lake City.The sequel, Black Sun: the making of the Hydrogen Bomb, is also good, but I found it much denser and harder to read, much like a complicated trial. It was more a story of the Soviets, espionage, and secrets."
21,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6721230-paula,3,"I feel both guilty and generous for giving the book 3 stars, becasue it is a full and complete authoritative, did I say complete- in every single detail- history of the making of Atomic bomb and therein lies the rub.Its too complete. The lead up is never ending. Its every detail of 50 years of geopolitical developments in America, Europe and USSR, every discovery (and many failed theories) in applied and theoretical physics post 1900, by whom, when, and how other people felt about it, every detail of the entire lives of everyone involved (their interests in literature, their formative years, etc). You have to have a lot of time on your hands and A LOT more interest than I did to get through this. "

My nuclear physics knowledge is basic university level from my days of studying engineering. This, however was beyond me and my patience. Plus I want to read for fun, this was turning more into a project."
23,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,5,"Richard Rhodes’ big dense book is detailed, focused and all-encompassing much like the Manhattan Project and the atomic bomb it describes. Rhodes’ history is a blend of physics, politics, war, diplomacy and personal relationships. It challenges both one’s intellect and moral judgment. It raises as many questions as it answers and some of the most important still remain after almost 70 years.Why did the U.S. get the atomic bomb ahead of Germany and other nations? The U. S. had the quantity and quality of scientists and the massive industrial and material resources required. Just as important was the signature American can-do and will-do attitude. Hitler’s 1933 expulsion of Jewish scientists from Germany’s universities and Mussolini’s anti-Semitic policies led to key talented nuclear physicists coming to the U. S. Driven by their personal experience and overwhelming fear of Hitler’s getting the bomb first, these scientists convinced the American government to take the bomb seriously. When their expertise was combined with existing U.S. scientific talent, a “critical mass” of ideas rebounded through this emergent physics community resulting in the atomic bomb. Germany’s remaining scientists, while talented, were too few, too isolated and had too few resources. Other nations had even less capability.The processes required to make a bomb required huge investments to construct the plants necessary to purify and enrich the uranium and create the isotopes and plutonium needed. No other nation’s economy could support this huge expenditure of resources while also fighting a war. Last but not least, once the decision was made America’s commitment was unwavering both from the military and scientific communities. The making of the atom bomb was a truly remarkable achievement of organization, leadership, persistence and cooperation.Unfortunately the discovery of the immense power of the atom leaves us in a much more dangerous world. The mechanization and application of science to war in WWI and WWII had already significantly increased war’s reach and destructiveness. Furthermore, these wars had already led to the acceptance of mass killing of civilians as standard policy before the bomb was developed. The atom bomb was merely the next step. Huge incendiary attacks that created firestorms killing tens of thousands at a time were regularly employed. Now a bomb could kill hundreds of thousands in a flash.But the atomic bomb is also an equalizer. We see it today. A small terrorist nation with atomic bombs is a power to be reckoned with. No longer can America confronting such countries go unscathed due to its overwhelming economic and industrial might. The calculus of war is forever changed.Rhodes book begs the question: How many nations or groups will ultimately get the bomb and when will it be used again. The genie is out of the bottle and even though it’s been a while since his power was unleashed, nothing indicates the genie will ever go back. The imbroglio over Iran’s bomb project is a current example, but probably far from the last, even if it is resolved short of war. Starting before the first bomb was detonated; international agreements aimed to control the bomb have been formulated. Sadly as Rhodes history of war and science recounts, effective controls of such a powerful weapon do not seem to be within the bounds of human nature.“The Making of the Atomic Bomb” is very highly recommended for so many reasons: Captivating history, fascinating science, great writing full of suspense and adventure (even though you know the end), but most of all as a reminder of the high stakes grim world of seventy years ago and the legacy it left to haunt us. "
24,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6696670-sonny,5,"The Making of the Atomic Bomb, by American journalist and historian Richard Rhodes, is a stunning achievement that takes us from early 20th century discoveries to the development of modern physics, and from there to the Manhattan Project and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Not surprisingly, the book won a Pulitzer Prize, a National Book Award, and a National Book Critics Circle Award. It has been praised both by historians and the former Manhattan Project scientists, which is understandable given Rhodes’ ability to communicate theoretical physics in a way that is both engaging and understandable, something I found lacking in Walter Isaacson’s biography of Einstein. It is Rhodes’ ability to describe the complex web of people and their ideas, the relevant political history, and the concepts of practical and theoretical physics, that sets his work apart. No person is mentioned without the essentials of his biography; the leading players have more detailed profiles.Rhodes begins with the discovery of radioactivity in 1896 by French scientist Henri Becquerel. From there, we are taken through the development of nuclear physics. From Becquerel, Rhodes moves to Hungarian physicist Leo Szilard’s realization in 1933 that the existence of the neutron (only recently discovered at the time) might make a chain reaction possible. Szilard theorized that there might be nuclei which, when struck by a neutron, would give up additional neutrons, releasing energy. These neutrons would strike other nuclei, resulting in a chain reaction. From there, Rhodes tracks the vital elements that led to the development of the atomic bomb: growing anti-Semitism, which led to the emigration of brilliant scientists to the United States, the movement of nuclear research from speculation to science, and the Manhattan Project—a costly research and development project undertaken during World War II. All of the great scientific achievements that led up to the invention of the atomic bomb are examined. His account of the dropping of the initial bomb (Thin Man) and the awful aftermath is unforgettable. Rhodes has provided readers a magnificent account of one of the key issues of our times. It is a superb accomplishment."
25,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1108123-bettie,4," wiki sourced - Leó Szilárd (Hungarian: Szilárd Leó, February 11, 1898 – May 30, 1964 German: Spitz, Leo until age 2) was an Austro-Hungarian physicist who conceived the nuclear chain reaction in 1933, patented the idea of a nuclear reactor with Enrico Fermi, and in late 1939 wrote the letter for Albert Einstein's signature that resulted in the Manhattan Project that built the atomic bomb.Max Karl Ernst Ludwig Planck (April 23, 1858 – October 4, 1947) was a German physicist who is regarded as the founder of the quantum theory, for which he received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1918"
26,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4384303-brad-lyerla,5,"THE MAKING OF THE ATOMIC BOMB is Richard Rhodes’ internationally acclaimed tour de force of science writing. It is an epic history of the seven decades that saw Max Planck, Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr and dozens of others lay the groundwork for the science that we now call Quantum Physics. It won several awards including the Pulitzer Prize for Non-fiction, the National Book Award and the National Book Critics Circle Award. I love non-fiction and I cannot think of another work of non-fiction that I consider better than THE MAKING OF THE ATOMIC BOMB.As the 19th Century came to a close, we had only a very dim understanding of the sub-molecular world. THE MAKING OF THE ATOMIC BOMB tells the story of the discovery of the atom and the development of a theory describing the structure and behavior of atoms. This theory enabled a group of scientists in the employ of the US government to build the most horrific weapon humankind had ever seen. The development of that theory was iterative. Many contributed to it. Rhodes does a wonderful job weaving together the contributions of different theorists working in different parts of the world. From New Zealand, to Japan, Hungary, Italy, Scandinavia, England, Germany and the US, scientists made discoveries and published their findings. Gradually, it became possible to understand critical features of the atom. A theory took shape. Some began to understand that the atom held enormous energy and that it might be possible to harness that energy. That insight inspired some scientists and terrified others.If that is not enough to whet your appetite for this magnificent book, then consider that much of the work performed by these scientists was performed by Jewish scientists in central Europe in the late 1920s and 30s. They lived and worked in the shadow of the growing menace of fascism and National Socialism. Part of their story – and Rhodes’ story – involves amazing acts of heroism, that enabled important contributors to avoid the terrors of the Nazi Death Camps. This is a panoramic story and Rhodes tells it brilliantly. He tackles the science, the geo-politics, the internal politics and the espionage that attended America’s project to build and deploy the bomb. He tells the stories of the individual scientists and politicians and their contributions. He tells it all with skill and understanding. THE MAKING OF THE ATOMIC BOMB is a great book. I hope that everyone reads it."
27,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5923433-susan-o,5,"Long and detailed, but very readable. It is filled with science, but also information about the people involved in the development of the atomic bomb. Some names may be familiar - Oppenheimer, Bohr, Lawrence, and Einstein - but others are included as well - including Teller, Wigner, Szilard, and Conant. I was also very glad to see Lise Meitner given her due, one of the very few women involved in the discovery. The book progresses chronologically from the early days of quantum theory through the development of the bomb. It covers the progress not only in the US, but also in Britain, Germany, Russia, and even Japan. I had no idea that Japan even considered the possibility. He also covers, not just Los Alamos, but the work at various universities as well as both Oak Ridge and Hanford. Of course a history of the bomb would not be complete without an account of the flights of the ""Enola Gay"" and ""Bock's Car"" and their crews. Eyewitness accounts of the aftermath of the bombing of Hiroshima were very difficult to read, but essential in understanding (as much as possible) the horrifying conclusion. I felt like Rhodes gave a balanced accounting of the reasons behind using the bomb, the effects of it, and the doubts that many had about the morality of it. Overall an excellent read. I highly recommend it. "
28,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10221670-anshuman,5,"The book starts off in London on a dull September morning in 1933 with Leo Szilard contemplating the shape of things to come. From this point on, the book is a history book. It is a nuclear physics textbook. It is a slow burning mystery. It is a World War II spy thriller. The narrative jumps between continents and historical figures with such finesse that it is quite easy to get lost within its pages and forget that it deals with the greatest issue of all : the annihilation of all mankind. It is quite a tough book to finish, courtesy its astonishing length and encyclopaedic array of characters. “Most experiences in life can be comprehended by prior experiences,” Norris Bradbury comments, “but the atom bomb did not fit into any preconceptions possessed by anybody.”The same can be said about the book about the atomic bomb"
29,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22126697-antonio-nunez,5,"It’s not easy to review this monumental work of history, cast in the same mold as Gibbon, Ranke and Mommsen. The author manages to cover 40 years of history of atomic physics, from Einstein’s annus mirabilis to the apocalyptic use of two atom bombs on civilians in August 1945. For this reader the technical sections were not smooth sailing, although I’ll grant the author is very thorough and pellucid in his descriptions of experiments, theories, equipment and impedimenta. These passages were lightened by the dramatis personae of an all star cast. One is surprised that Einstein, an avuncular presence looking on from the sidelines, was in fact muscular and an excellent swimmer. One is in awe of the genius of Enrico Fermi, who was both a brilliant theoretical AND a superb experimental physicist (and also a good husband, father and colleague, mostly free from the neuroses and hangups of everybody else). In this he was the opposite of Robert Oppenheimer, the archetypical tortured genius. One always feels one is in a Woody Allen movie when Leo Szilard, whose picture ought to be in the dictionary next to the definition of chutzpah, turns up. But he was entitled to that. Szilard was not only an exceptional theoretical physicist but a great inventor (he even had a joint patent with Einstein for a refrigeration process although it didn’t make them rich) and also was endowed with much practical intelligence and common sense. He picked up the idea for the atom bomb in a novella by HG Wells. Talk about life imitating art! When Niels Bohr or Marie Curie are in a scene one is in the presence of moral rectitude and thorough decency. Bohr’s behavior during the war was unimpeachable; which couldn’t be said about his disciple Heisenberg. Of John von Neumann, who was regarded as a genius by all the other geniuses one could only praise his exceptional, cold wit. A genius’ genius then. One sees that only brilliant, callous bastards like Arthur “Bomber” Harris or Curtis LeMay or Leslie Groves may actually bring complicated directives to fruition, although often at the price of their souls. In this book even throw-away names like Luis Álvarez and Richard Feynman are mind -blowing geniuses. This just brings home the miasmic mediocrity in which most of us live.The book gives good space to the moral quandaries everyone faced. The physicists who knew the terrifying implications of their work consoled themselves with the weak argument that what they were doing could also by done by the Soviets, the Japanese of the Nazis, al it made sense ensuring that America got there first. The Manhattan project was so complex and so expensive that only the US could carry it out, and only during wartime. Only Hitler’s asinine racial policies could drive out from Europe the greatest generation of scientific geniuses the continent had ever produced into the hands of his enemies. Had they stayed in Europe and chosen to collaborate with the regime, it is unlikely a bomb could have been built while Germany and its satellites were under wartime pressures. Had the war ended without nukes, I think it is unlikely they would have been developed later. Nukes have given most of us 70+years of peace ensured by MAD. That era may be ending. Trump’s baiting of Kim Jing Un (a thoroughly nasty costumer), his sabotage of Obama’s Iran agreement and his undermining of all multilateral institutions, from the UN to NATO, including NAFTA and the WTO, have brought the whole nuclear clock quite close to midnight. Can anyone imagine Trump in missile crisis scenario behaving with the skill and self-control of Kennedy? All thinking persons should shudder at these thoughts.I heartily recommend this book for anyone interested in the most important scientific discovery in history after the printing press. But be aware that it will require significant investment in your part. Like the Manhattan Project reading this book should not be undertaken lightly."
30,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63879552-sebastian,5,"BLUF:There are not many books I would recommend more whole-heartedly. Just read it.Details:This is the story of science, industry, and politics, and how humanity went from wondering about structure of the atom in 1910 to dropping exploding balls of plutonium over Japan in 1945.We begin with bunch of European physicists who in the 1920s and 30s, discover the nature of the atom: Rutherford in England discovering the nucleus in 1911, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle in 1926, the Bohr model, Chadwick's discovery of the neutron in 1932, Fermi's 1934 experiments with neutron bombardment in Rome, and finally Otto Hahn and Lise Meitner publishing on nuclear fission in 1938. Rhodes paints a picture of a world of perhaps 100 physicists who knew each other personally and moved around frequently to collaborate for short periods of time. I wonder how funding worked (when Oppenheimer does research at Cavendish, or similar -- were do the dollars come from?) but no-one seems to worry about grants. Another thing that struck me was how broad some of these scientists were. Einstein and Szilard take a couple years off particle physics to study refrigeration in the 1930s. It's interesting to thing about this period of rapid progress against the example of Bell Labs. Common elements seem to be freedom from funding and publishing concerns, and a degree of flexibility in field of study. Unlike Bell, they aren't as commercially-focused although there is a goal that everyone is working against at least implicitly to map the structure of the atom. Also, Bohr is this convener and hub for the physicists, and I'm not sure a similar figure existed at Bell Labs.1938 is a pivotal year. Hahn / Meitner's write up on fission makes it clear to everyone that a fission chain reaction could power a new source of energy -- or a powerful new weapon. All of the fun of science and discovery takes on new meaning when our science Bund discovers their knowledge could be used for destructive ends. Hitler's Anschluss absorbs Austria and persecution of Jews in Germany begins.* Bohr heroically rounds up as many Jewish scientists as he can and whisks them off to Denmark; Szilard in the UK helps get more to England and the US.The war begins and scientists relocate the United States. Szilard, Einstein, and others (""The Hungarian Conspiracy"") attempt to educate military leadership and Roosevelt himself of the destructive power of the bomb. Eventually they do succeed and the great INDUSTRIAL project of the atomic bomb begins. I went in to the book thinking that Los Alamos would be comparable to Bell Labs. It isn't. As alluded to earlier, most scientists who saw the Meitner/Hahn paper in 1938 could surmise a bomb was possible. What differentiated the US from other countries who were pursing nuclear weapons was that we had the industrial capacity and resources to set up Hanford in Oregon to produce plutonium, and enrich uranium in meaningful quantities at Oak Ridge. But the leap to a bomb wasn't one of great scientific innovation, but rather production.The book ends with about 100 pages describing the Japanese victims of the US nuclear attack. The contrast to the joyful early days of Fermi running up and down his hallway on Via Panisperna and taking measurements with his Geiger counter is stark. Sometimes history unfolds in unexpected ways.Far too much to say about the book than can put in writing. Just read it.*A crazy early anecdote talked about how Chaim Weizmann secured the Balfour Declaration in support of a Jewish homeland during WWI in exchange for supporting the government manufacture acetone which was badly needed for artillery. You can't make this stuff up."
31,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11476806-g-d-brennan,4,"I think this book is a touch overrated.Having said that, I couldn't put it down.""The Making of the Atomic Bomb"" is incredibly well-researched; it's thought-provoking and deep, yet lively and literary. And make no mistake, it is well worth your while; its greatest sections and passages are as absorbing and exciting as anything I've ever read. (As a precocious 4th grader prone to fleeing the world by burying my nose in books, I'd read eagerly about the incredible feats of engineering and physics that went into the atomic bombs; this book made me revert to my 4th-grade-self, walking around Chicago oblivious to the comparatively drab sights and sounds of the real world as I explored the livelier world within.) And given the primary research Rhodes has done, especially the interviews with many of the physicists and chemists who literally manufactured history in a hastily-assembled laboratory in the New Mexico desert, it seems impossible that anyone could put together even a comparably comprehensive history without copiously copping from this one. Nothing else compares; it is the ""War and Peace"" of our only nuclear war.And yet, this feels like a science experiment where one has settled on a hypothesis prior to doing the research, and has ignored or minimized those results that threatened the theory. Rhodes takes us through virtually all of 20th century atomic physics, but he's assembled it in a structure that resembles one of those black hole coin wells one sees at the science center; everything starts out slow and lazy and happy, but eventually things get more energetic and more frentic; valuable time is lost, and valuable money disappears into an abyss of war and militarism. Also, if it shares ""War and Peace's"" strengths, it also shares its flaws; rather than sticking around to observe things and let events speak for themselves, the author spends many of the closing pages on maddening flights of philosophical fancy centered around the potential for worldwide Armageddon that the atomic bomb unleashed. When Rhodes was writing and researching this book--from 1981 to 1986, according to the endnotes--such fears surely seemed lively and compelling, topical and true, matters of monumental import to the whole human race; now they feel quaint and outdated. (In these post 9/11 days of endless hot wars, one almost feels nostalgic for the Cold War. Armageddon clocks ticking down the minutes to midnight? ICBMs on alert in North Dakota, waiting for the launch signals that would send them off on flaming arcs over the polar ice cap, but held at bay only by the prospect of Mutual Assured Destruction? I'll take that over fanatical and resourceful terrorists with a divine mandate any day. Our current world makes MAD feel sane.) At any rate, one realizes at the end that Rhodes' musings are not mere detours at the end of a masterful narrative; they have also warped its course, for in between his excellent chronicling of the bomb's development, Rhodes gets pulled off by other vectors, particularly by Neils Bohr's utopian musings about making nuclear weapons research subject to the same standards of openness and free disclosure that prevail in the rest of scientific discourse.And it's a shame, because in the vast majority of the narrative Rhodes proves himself to be an incredibly talented writer and reporter, with a telling eye for facts and details, and an ease with complicated scientific concepts and analogies that, in turn, sets the reader at ease. I have read many other books on similar subjects and studied nuclear physics at the college level; still, I found myself learning new things from Rhodes' lucid and cogent descriptions of, say, the way a uranium atom fissions almost like a raindrop, or the way a cyclotron spins and separates atomic particles. And he weaves these descriptions into memorable scenes and stories; his descriptions of the construction and operation of the first nuclear reactor, a round-ish pile of graphite bricks and uranium trussed up by wooden scaffolding and nestled in a squash court at the University of Chicago, for instance, are lyrical and unforgettable. It is fascinating to read about the world's top nuclear physicists engaging in an experiment that was by turns precise and haphazard; it is engrossing to envision Enrico Fermi plotting neutron fluxes and calculating reaction coefficients while many of his staff members were wearing leftover raccoon coats to warm themselves against the Chicago winter because they had built the world's first nuclear reactor in an unheated building.Rhodes turns these dead physicists into live characters by keeping his eyes open for the characteristic anecdotes, and his ear tuned for the telling quotes. During the Manhattan Project, for instance, General Leslie Groves, frustrated at wartime copper shortages that threatened to derail the construction of uranium-separating cyclotrons, decided to borrow thousands of tons of silver from the Treasury to build them instead; his assistant was told: ""Colonel, in the Treasury we do not speak of tons of silver; our unit is the troy ounce."" Eventually they ended up with over 10,000 tons of silver, though; Rhodes judiciously uses this fact, and others, to convey the sheer magnitude of America's nuclear effort. Thanks to the Manhattan Project, a whole city sprung up in Tennessee to support the uranium processing efforts, a city with tens of thousands of people which nonetheless remained off the map. And meanwhile the government was establishing the Hanford reservation in Washington State--an area a third the size of Rhode Island. The upshot of all of these efforts, Rhodes tells us, was that the U.S. essentially constructed a nuclear industry from scratch and grew it, in three short years, to be the size of the automobile industry.And yet, of course, it was not about industry alone, but about dropping the product of that industry on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Here, too, I must take issue with the author; he expounds at length on Hiroshima, to the point that one almost becomes numb to its horrors, and yet he skimps on describing Nagasaki. The bomb used there was the more complicated and technically challenging of the two. (The tricky details of its construction end up taking far more space in the narrative than those for the relatively simple gun-type Hiroshima bomb; despite his revulsion at its use, Rhodes clearly admires the complicated engineering challenge it represented.) The mission which dropped it nearly ended up an unqualified and costly failure after it met with a string of bad luck. (Or good luck, at least, for the citizens of Kokura, the Japanese city which was saved from dubious immortality and near-total destruction thanks to unexpectedly cloudy weather that sent the second nuclear mission on to its secondary target; it is doubtful that bad weather has ever been more beneficial for a city and its populace.) And yet the last use of nuclear weapons in anger merits barely more than a page in this lengthy narrative, which is unfair to the reader, unfair to the story, and unfair to the hapless citizens of Nagasaki, whose fluke-filled fate deserves to be better remembered than as a glorified footnote.Short shrift, too, is given to the considerable efforts of Soviet spies at security-heavy Los Alamos; it is possible that much of this information was simply not known when Rhodes wrote, and he did cover this subject in his later ""Dark Sun;"" still, it means this feels somewhat incomplete.None of this is to say that one should avoid this book; it's massive enough and weighty enough that one simply can't avoid it if one is even tangentially interested in these topics. (Indeed, if one were to read only one book on the development and first use of the atomic bomb, this should probably be it.) Still, despite its lengthy word count, its thorough research, and its generally excellent writing, this is neither the last word nor the only word on its subject. "
32,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4828849-michael-burnam-fink,5,"""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.""Robert Oppenheimer, director of the Los Alamos lab, chief designer of the atomic bomb, and a polymath with mystic and leftist inclinations, had the perfect quote for the first artificial dawn of an atomic explosion. There are many ways in which we die: disease, age, accident, violence. And many ways in which we might all die; suddenly in the wake of some cosmological catastrophe or slowly starving on a dying planet. With the atom bomb, it was now possible for a single individual, at the top of a chain of technological and political commitments, to kill almost everyone in the space of an afternoon. The bombs were only used in anger twice, punctuation to end the global slaughter of the Second World War. Since then, history has existed under the shadow of a potential mushroom cloud. This book is the story of how we got there.Rhodes takes almost the first half of the book to establish the basic science and personalities of the atomic bomb. The first half of the 20th century was a golden age for physics which will likely never be equaled, as imaginative theorists and skilled experimenters probed the basic building blocks of the universe. Rutherford and Bohr nailed down, for the first time in evidence rather than speculation, the basic building blocks of matter. Atoms had most of their mass in a small nucleus, and owed their chemical properties to the quantum behavior of electron shells. The neutron was added to the list of fundamental particles. New elements were created by neutron bombardment, and by the late 1930s it was widely known that uranium would fission on bombardment, splitting into two lighter elements, and releasing a large deal of energy. There positive glee of work in this field, at this time, comes through in Rhodes' able biographical sketches of the scientists involved, particularly Bohr, Fermi, and Szilard.Szilard was the first to think of the potential of a fission chain reaction. If some substance, on absorbing a neutron split and released two or more neutrons, could produce a great deal of energy in millionths of a second. It would be a bomb of stupendous power, a city-smasher. Politically perceptive, Szilard had been helping Jewish physicists flee the Nazis for years. He had hoped for an H.G. Wells inspired international coalition to peacefully control this new power, but in 1939 if the bomb was too be invented, best by the Americans or British rather than Hitler.The next section, building the bomb, is less fun. Bohr predicted that you would need to turn all of America into a factory to build a bomb, and that is what the Manhattan project did, mobilizing thousands of scientists, $2 billion, and massive plants to do the hard work of separating fissile U-235 and Plutonium from natural uranium. Bureaucratic confusion and balky precision engineering made the task anything but easy. The other powers pursued the bomb. The British sent over their best to help with the Manhattan project. Germany's team, lead by Heisenberg, never had the necessary priority in the Reich, and were stalled by clever British-Norwegian sabotage directed at a heavy water production facility required for the Nazi reactor design. Japan never had access to the raw material to move beyond theory.The last section is grimmer yet. The design of the bomb was an exercise in precision, in delicately engineered explosive lenses to make the implosion to critical mass happen smoothly in nanoseconds. Tibbetts' B-29 bomber group trained to a razor's edge to accomplish the mission of deploying the 'gadget'. Roosevelt, on approving the Manhattan project, had instinctively reserved the bomb to himself as President. In 1945, Vice President Truman had not been read into the project until he succeeded to the presidency. The bomb was used on Hiroshima because it could be, because the Japanese still resisted, and because something had to be shown for the effort invested. It was a crime, a mass-murder in an instant. Rhodes does not flinch from the horror of Hiroshima.Personally, I think we need to distinguish between the bomb's use at the end of the Second World War, where it seems a matter of degree compared to area bombing rather than kind, and its use now, where that would signal breaking the nuclear taboo. This does not absolve the scientists who built the bomb of their responsibility. Nature's secrets were all around, and once fission had been theorized it was probably only a matter of time before someone figured out how to make it work, but these people made a choice to build Death a supersonic jet bomber to replicate his tired old horse. The Making of the Atomic Bomb is a penetrating look at the most consequential scientific and political moment of the 20th century. I'd give it six stars, if I could. It is also my 1000th review on Goodreads!"
33,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8511956-lance,5,"Probably the best book ever written on the atomic bomb, from the early science to the aftermath of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

35,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2209582-ross,3,"This is an exhaustive history of the bombs development., some 900 pages. The first half deals with the fundamental physics that makes nuclear weapons possible. The remainder deals with the actual development.My previous understanding of the bomb history stemmed from a movie some 20 years ago. In this film Albert Einstein perceives the potential for the bomb based on his famous equationE=MC squared. He quickly contacts President Roosevelt and FDR assigns a General Groves to develop the bomb ASAP in order to end the war.The actual truth is almost unbelievable.In the late 1930’s physicists in Europe realize that the fission of uranium can be used to make a bomb. Most of these scientists are Jews and they flee Hitler to the U.S. terrified that Germany will develop the bomb. Using what connections they can they approach officers separately in the U.S. army and navy. In both instances they are laughed at. Now more terrified than ever they approach Einstein, hoping his prestige can get word of the danger to someone in power. Einstein actually does have a contact that knows FDR and a letter from Einstein, actually written by our refugee physicists, is taken to the White House and read to FDR. The President seems impressed and says he will act on it. What he actually does is assign a bureaucrat in the Department of Standards to look into this thing. The bureaucrat now puts the letter in his safe and does nothing. It never occurs to FDR to follow-up on what is being done.Meanwhile the Germans and British are working on development and the British think the U.S. is also working on it A year later Churchill concerned about what the U.S. is doing sends a delegation over to discuss the project. They are horrified to find nothing is being done. A lot of screaming and yelling now takes place and finally General Groves is assigned.More than a year had been lost and we are very lucky today that we don’t have to speak German."
36,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7226831-josh-friedlander,5,"An epic topic, perhaps the epic topic, matched by a book epic in scope and detail. Rhodes starts off at the beginning of 20th century understanding of the atom, going into intricate detail about the lives of Bohr, Rutherford, Szilard, et al. He seems equally happy talking about Kierkegaard's Either/Or philosophy, the Pacific Theatre, or the intricacies of isolating Uranium-235. There's a lot of science in this book - I googled a lot but still felt like I missed enough to justify a second reading sometime - and some coverage of the effects of the bomb, the moral concerns of the scientists and politicians involved in its deployment, and the state of today's world. Rhodes wrote this book in the mid-1980s, but of course, the great, numbing, existential threat of the bomb still looms over us today; even if we think of it less."
37,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14945161-sandy-maguire,5,"Amazing book. The first act is a fantastic set of tableaus about the physicists and progression of science necessary to discover the capabilities of the atom. The second act is somewhat dry, regarding mostly the politicking necessary to have made the bomb happen, but there is some decent engineering spliced in here and there. The third is about the war effort, the Trinity test, and the eventual dropping of the bomb. The last chapter is horrifying and not something I'd describe as the feel-good read of the year, but it helps to drive home just how terrible these things are.I would strongly recommend this book to everyone."

It's 800+ pages of tiny text, but there's not a superfluous sentence to be found. Just a staggering amount of information. And no wonder - this book is a textbook of physics in the first half of the 20th century, a case study of the relationship between science and war (and scientists and soldiers), and a history of the rising tolerability of mass civilian slaughter, combined with multiple biographies of some of history's most characteristic scientists.The climax of the book from Trinity to Nagasaki is awesome, cinematic, and chilling. This is a serious investment, but well worth your time."

Like, uber. Not just an exhaustive regarding the scientific aspects, but the social, political and wartime factors that contributed and led up to the creation of the most destructive weapon ever conceived. Even ample knowledge of the personal lives of the scientists involved is conveyed. There is so much about the development of the bomb that I certainly wasn't aware of and I would venture to say that most people aren't. How close that the Nazi's were to developing their own nuclear device, and the fact that the Japanese were actively researching their own atomic bomb. Overall, its good. Very good. But if you're more broadly interested in the history of the nuke... this book might drive you insane. Its hardcore. Also this book stops directly after the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the surrender of Japan, which seems a shame. So much of interest happens in the next several years, including the development of thermonuclear bomb technology (which is conceptually covered in the book), USSR espionage contributing to their own bomb development and the first stages of the arms race."

While it didn't change my mind about nuclear weapons, it did a lot to deepen my thinking about them. Was reading about the successful Trinity test at the moment my wife's water broke and we went to the hospital to have our first baby, which was pretty timely. "
43,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6871223-aaron-million,4,"Richard Rhodes' monumental undertaking here is both admirable and daunting at the same time. As one might expect, the story of the development of the atomic bomb, and of atomic power in general, does not occur overnight and does not involved just a few individuals. It evolves over decades of often pain-staking work done by scientists who span a wide range of nationalities, specialties, opinions, and motivations. As such, a thorough job requires a lot of work – both for Rhodes and for the reader. Not being well-versed in science, and especially in physics, the sections containing detailed discussions of neutrons, electrons, atomic elements, chain reactions, volts, etc... were not the easiest for me to absorb. But that is due to my limited capacity to understand those things, not to Rhodes' writing or researching skills. In fact, he is not just writing for a scientific audience, but for a general audience. Thus, he cannot delve too far into the weeds of nuclear physics without losing quite a few people. But he cannot, at the same time, brush past very important discoveries and experiments. He does an admirable job of finding middle ground: not too detailed to discourage readers, but not superficial enough to upset scientists who understand these advanced topics. Almost as much of a struggle as the scientific aspect, is the difficulty in keeping all of the main characters (and there is no shortage of these) straight. So many people provided significant contributions to the development of the bomb: scientifically, politically, militarily, economically, that the names start to run together at a certain point. In addition, especially throughout the first half of the book, the scientists are from several different (mainly European) countries, and thus their work is taking place in many different laboratories in different cities. Just remembering which nationality someone is can be difficult at times. This is not a criticism of Rhodes; he could not begin to tell the story without all of these people being in it. But it is something to note for the general reader, especially someone who is unfamiliar with most chemists and physicists aside from Albert Einstein, who plays a minor, but pivotal, role in this drama. The most riveting chapter had to do with the actual dropping of the first atomic bomb, over Hiroshima, Japan on August 6, 1945. Rhodes, as he does throughout the book, allows the people involved in the story to explain their thoughts and feelings as much as possible. In this chapter, the remembrances of Japanese who survived the atomic attack are difficult to read. A sample, from page 722, the description by a thirty-year-old woman of encountering a dead person: “The corpse lying on its back on the road had been killed immediately.... Its hand was lifted to the sky and the fingers were burning with blue flames. The fingers were shortened to one-third and distorted. A dark liquid was running to the ground along the hand.” These types of horrible description go on for several pages. Rhodes does not do this to make a moral statement about the U.S. Dropping the bomb on Japan; in fact, he also notes that the Japanese leaders must share some of the blame as their desperate fighting, literally to the death, undoubtedly contributed to Harry Truman's decision to authorize the bombing. But instead he includes the morbid accounts so as the drive home the total devastation and utter ruin that the A-bomb brought into the world. As he accurately states, the bomb did not just destroy thousands of lives, but it completely wiped out an entire city. Rhodes concludes with a forty page Afterword, primarily focusing on the development of the “Super” (or H) bomb. Towards the end, he delves into a philosophic discussion about nation-states, nuclear policy and control, and warfare. While certainly relevant, after reading the preceding chapters detailing the creation of the bomb, it dropping on Japan, the immediate effects upon its people, and all of the political tugs of war in Los Alamos, NM and Washington, this reads as an anti-climax. This is not to say that it does not belong in the book. But rather, the discussion would have been enhanced by some capsules about what all of the various scientists went on to do following WWII. Los Alamos Director Robert Oppenheimer, as an example, had a painful life – both literally and figuratively – through the 1950s and up to his death in 1967. But Rhodes does not choose to mention any of Oppenheimer's travails. Still, it is hard to see how a more complete and accurate depiction of this world-changing event could be told. "
44,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6431984-antonio-rojas,5,"Monumental and Breathtaking!Is a breathtaking journey through the history of nuclear physics and the development of Atomic Theory. It is a masterpiece where Mr. Rhodes regales us with his gift for presenting difficult and intricate concepts in a very logical, insightful, colorful, and above all entertaining fashion.Loosely speaking, the first part of the book covers the key steps that carved the foundations of atomic theory: we get to witness J.J. Thompson discovering the electron; Ernest Rutherford realizing the existence of the nucleus and postulating his “Solar System” model of the atom; Niels Bohr, with a little help from spectroscopy improving that model and carving his more realistic Shell and Orbital design; Chadwick stalking and finally uncovering the neutron; Henri Becquerel and the Curies discovering radioactivity; Heisenberg working his Uncertainty Principle, Schrodinger developing wave mechanics, Pauli his Exclusion Principle. In addition, we become familiar with de Hevesy, John von Neumann, Wigner, Dirac, Millikan, Max Born, Arnold Sommerfeld, Paul Ehrenfest, in summary, all the big architects of Quantum Mechanics and modern physics. But what makes the book a truly superior piece is that Mr. Rhodes, while impeccably describing the science, he submerges the reader into the very personal and complex psychology of each of the characters and the historic context of the time. We see each of these great scientists come to life and wander through history in front of our eyes immersed in the chaotic social and military storm that surrounded the cataclysmic days of the First and Second World Wars.The second part of the book deals more specifically with the creation and the political steps leading to the use of the first atomic bombs on civilian populations by the United States government. We get to see Leo Szilard, the true brain behind the first idea of the atomic bomb and the first to conceptualize the science behind it and its potential consequences; we see Otto Hahn splitting the atom without realizing it and Lise Meitner and Otto Freisch interpreting and using for the first time the term “fission” to name the event; Enrico Fermi “slowing neutrons” and creating a sustained chain reaction; Wigner creating plutonium and enriching uranium; all of this, leading triumphantly to Los Alamos where we witness Edward Teller, Luis Alvarez, Hans Bethe, Lawrence and above all, Robert Oppenheimer, “I am become death, the destroyer of worlds”, where they orchestrated the biggest human effort and enterprise ever achieved: the ability to create the means of our own destruction. Mr. Rhodes cold and non-judgmental recompilation of first hand witnesses and victims of the explosions is both pathetic and truly horrifying. The harrowing images of children aimlessly wandering and holding strips of their own skin, women without feet walking on their ankles, or a man holding his eye in one hand create an infernal motion picture in our brain whose memory is very hard if not impossible to forget. At 790 comprehensive pages excluding Notes, Bibliography, Photo Credits and Index -886 in total- The Making of the Atomic Bomb is a monumental achievement that deserves all the accolades and awards it has gathered through the years. This book is a veritable must read, a must have, a classic."
45,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/204112-damon,5,"Richard Rhodes does a very impressive job of telling how we got to the atomic bomb. He starts in 1900 when Plank looked into a black box and found a new world. The Making of the Atomic Bomb explores the science that makes the bomb possible, the scientist who worked in breaking the atom, the politics which made people want to do it. In doing so it becomes one of the best introductions to quantum mechanics for the laymen. Much better than other books that try to join mysticism and science, Rhodes goes though, in prose, the basics of quantum mechanics and the people who made it. He has also not shy away from using the scientists metaphors to describe the world of the very small (Rutherford's cannon ball is one of the best), nor does he shy away from explaining the concepts that make the bomb possible, like why natural uranium does not explode and why plutonium is much better than uranium. Rhodes also provides a sense a drama the scientist and engineers in New Mexico start to build the bomb. When the first one is exploded, the reader feels a sense of achievement and pride at what man has wrought. And like all good writers, Rhodes is does not let us off the hook, the last portion of the book is a detailed description of the casualties of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The descriptions of the flash burn victims whose blacked, blistered skin peeled off their body exposing the muscle underneath is more than enough for anyone to appreciate Oppenheimer's quote: I am the creator, I am the destroyer.

46,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3529662-cullen,5,"This has the reputation of being the book to read about the Manhattan Project, and having just finished it, I can't imagine one being better. Yes, it is very long. Yes, the narrative can feel a bit jumpy, especially in the first half. There are a lot of names being used, some of which never re-appear, and a lot of seemingly minor scientific experiments detailed exhaustively. And yes, Rhodes dedicates many pages to discussions that do not feel very relevant in 2013, but were very much so when it was written in the mid-80s and the idea that Russia might nuke us was not very far removed.But all of these elements come together in incredible fashion when the book builds up to moments of great importance: the confirmation of the splitting of the atom; the first self-sustaining nuclear reactor in Chicago; the attack on Pearl Harbor; the Trinity test; the dropping of Little Boy over Hiroshima. These sections are written beautifully and effectively convey the excitement and the historical ramifications. They would not be the same without all of the comprehensive background that is given beforehand, and it is hard to imagine this book being edited down very much.Strongly recommended to anybody with an interest in the bomb, or World War II in general."
47,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/426277-james,5,"Richard Rhodes describes the theoretical origins of the bomb, the lab experiments, the building of the prototype, the test at Alamagordo, the training of the B-29 crews assigned to deliver the first two combat bombs and the missions themselves. There's much more. Rhodes, gifted with sharp psychological insight and a novelist's ability to convey character, reveals the personalities and emotional dynamics among the scientists and others responsible for conceiving, engineering, testing and ultimately dropping the apocalyptic devices on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In addition he describes the struggle in Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan to make the first bomb, as well as the political and military events that led inexorably to the destruction of the Japanese cities. This is a beautifully written book (Rhodes has written a separate book on the craft of writing) that anyone interested in science or history would enjoy."
48,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10464045-eric-birk,4,"Rhodes is very thorough and descriptive. The book tells nothing but true stories about the people and events that shaped the making of the atom bomb and in a way that keeps your attention. Other books I read on the subject were very dry and boring, but this book holds your attention, even though it is a long book. If you like Cold War history and 20th century history, this book is a must read. How it actually all came together was so complex, it’s a miracle that it happened at all.I read this book back in 1988, just before I joined the Air Force. Little did I know that I would get a job in the Air Force working on equipment that monitored the world for people making nuclear weapons. The knowledge that I gleaned from this book was very useful in my Air Force career. Very informative."

Rhodes' book about the discovery of the atom and the development of the atomic bomb is a tour de force. It stands as one of the best history books I have ever read. Thorough, wide ranging, and engrossing. I am amazed at the intelligence of scientists working without the benefit of computers. I am horrified by what we can inflict upon one another in war. This is my second time through this book and it is still very much a 5 star read. "

55,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/941349-bob,5,"This is an extraordinary work, one of the finest nonfiction books I've ever read. Its breadth and depth of coverage are incredible. It is engagingly written, truly a book hard to put down. It is full of wonderful anecdotes and photographs. The book is a chronological account of the science, engineering, and politics that created the atomic bomb. It is basically in four parts: physics from around 1880 to 1938, physics from 1939 to 1943, engineering and politics from 1941 to 1945, and the postwar aftermath up to around 1955. The first two parts are largely in Europe, the third and fourth mostly in the US. I was not prepared for the depth of coverage of the period from about 1880 to 1938. It is marvelous story, an epic of human achievement well told. I started out in college as a physics major, so I was familiar with the broad outline of this, and many of the names were familiar. In spite of that, I learned an enormous amount. The book wisely keeps the focus on the people, and succeeds wonderfully in making us feel we know them, at least the major players. In summarizing the book, it's hard to know where to start; Rhodes must have felt the same thing. By 1890 or so it was known that there were tiny particles called electrons that were negatively charged, and that the chemical elements were defined by how many electrons were in each atom. Since atoms are neutral, there must be a corresponding positive charge in each atom, but where? For a while it was thought that the positive charge was a sort of smeared out substrate, like the dough in a muffin, with the electrons stuck in it like blueberries. This was disproven (making a long story short) by Ernest Rutherford, New Zealand born British physicist, a poor boy who grew up on a farm. He showed that the positive charge lies in a ""nucleus"", a very small dense center of the atom, with the electrons much farther out, sort of orbiting around like the planets in the solar system. It wasn't long before the proton was discovered, and the fact that the nucleus contains the same number of protons as there are electrons in the outer shell. It was also not long before it was realized that the planetary analogy would not hold. According to the very well established electromagnetic theory of James Clerk Maxwell, the electrons would simply spiral into the nucleus and the atom would cease to exist. Yet the evidence for protons and the nucleus was undeniable. But the electromagnetic theory of Maxwell was extremely highly regarded. In fact Einstein had just used it (1905) to develop the theory of relativity, also highly regarded. What is the explanation? The explanation is most important development in physics since Newton: quantum theory. Quantum theory began with Max Plank and Einstein around 1890-1900, but really got going after 1915 with the work of Niels Bohr, Erwin Schroedinger, Werner Heisenberg and P. A. M. Dirac. Rhodes does not talk too much about quantum theory itself. He manages to keep the focus on nuclear physics. However, he does point out an essential lesson of quantum theory: light is both a wave and a particle. These seemingly contradictory notions exist at the same time in one thing. Bohr came to call this paraodox-that-is-not-a-paradox ""complementarity."" This abstract idea is important later. Of the four names above, two are extremely significant in the story of the atom bomb: Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg. Bohr was born in Denmark in 1885, so was half a generation younger than Rutherford. He explained the atom by showing how the electrons stayed in well defined ""shells"" rather than orbits like planets. Heisenberg, a German, was half a generation younger yet, born in 1901. He and Schroedinger made huge breakthroughs in the 1920s showing that Bohr's model was still not right. Meanwhile, before 1900, Marie and Pierre Curie had discovered radioactivity. Some elements, notably radium and uranium, decomposed with time by ejecting nuclear particles and becoming lighter elements. Eventually (long story cut short) it was realized that the particles being ejected are often ""neutrons"", the last of the three basic particles to be discovered (James Chadwick, 1932). Neutrons live in the nucleus with protons and seem to be a sort of glue holding the nucleus together.  The first phase of the story ends and the second begins in 1939 with the realization by Otto Hahn, Lise Meitner, and her nephew Otto Frisch that a nucleus could be fractured or split by a neutron being ejected from another atom. The first atom might split into two much lighter atoms -- fission -- and eject two or more neutrons, which could in turn hit and split yet more atoms -- a chain reaction. This was a revolutionary idea, quickly understood by Bohr, who carried the news to the US. Soon, scientists in the US, England, Germany, and Japan (yes Japan) were asking themselves, could this chain reaction become a bomb? Meanwhile, of course, was the hugely important rise of Nazi Germany. Many scientists, especially the Jewish ones, fled Germany by 1939. Meitner fled to Sweden in 1938. Frisch fled to England. Bohr (with only one grandparent Jewish) was at first relatively safe in Denmark, and could travel to England and back, but eventually had to flee to Sweden in 1943. Einstein was long since at Princeton. But, as Rhodes explains, many others, who are not household words, fled Nazi Europe and became key players in the saga of the atomic bomb. Among these are Stanislaw Ulam from Poland, Hans Bethe from Germany, and the Hungarian trio of Leo Szilard, Eugene Wigner, and Edward Teller, all of whom came to the US. All played significant roles in the story of the bomb; Szilard and Teller became big actors in the story. Similarly, physicists were fleeing Italy, including Enrico Fermi and Emilio Segre. The second part of the story surges into high gear with the developments in physics showing that a bomb could really work. In England, Chadwick assembled a group that included Frisch and Rudolf Peierls, recently fled from Germany. It became known as the MAUD committee. Frisch and Peierls produced the Frisch–Peierls memorandum, which was the first document to detail how an atomic explosion could be generated. Bohr soon learned about it, as he was also in England. Long story cut short, a bomb could be made from uranium-235 or from plutonium. Uranium occurs rather commonly in nature, but over 99% of it is the form called 238, abbreviated U-238. You can't make a bomb from that, though you can use it for a nuclear reactor. If enough of the much more radioactive U-235 is gotten together in the right way, a bomb will result. Plutonium does not occur in nature and was first synthesized by Glenn Seaborg in the US in 1940. It is also radioactive enough to make a bomb. About the same time, in 1940 Heisenberg began to understand that uranium 235 could make a bomb. Heisenberg did not like Hitler, but he had no Jewish ancestors and no compelling reason to leave Germany. He was asked by the German army to investigate uses of uranium. Rhodes says that Heisenberg thought that the process of actually getting together enough U-235 would be too expensive and difficult, and that is why the German atomic bomb project never got anywhere. In 2000, Thomas Powers published a book called Heisenberg's War in which he claims that Heisenberg deliberately stalled the German atomic bomb project so that Hitler would never have the bomb. It remains controversial, but Rhodes (writing in 1987) does not talk much about Heisenberg. Nonetheless, the British and Bohr assumed that the Germans would understand everything that they did, and would certainly be doing bomb research. This key idea, that the allies must keep up with the Germans, is the start of the third part of the saga, the engineering and political story of the actual making of the bomb. Americans were working too. Already in 1939, Hungarian emigre Leo Szilard realized that fission could be used to make a nuclear reactor and possibly a bomb. Szilard had known Einstein years before; in fact in 1926 they had patented a refrigerator! He became almost obsessed with the idea that President Roosevelt must understand the threat of the Germans having a bomb. In July 1939, Szilard and Wigner drove to Long Island, where Einstein was staying (how they found him is an interesting story). They convinced Einstein to write the now famous letter to FDR urging that the matter be given the highest priority. FDR was impressed, but it took more than one letter. That's a long story; read the book!  Eventually, especially after the Americans learned of the British MAUD committee work, a high level committee was formed to begin the research and manufacture of a bomb. The leaders of this committee were Vannevar Bush, James Conant, and Arthur Compton. Vannevar Bush (no relation to the presidents Bush) was an older engineer, a longtime influential person in the highest levels of academe and government. James Conant was a chemist and the president of Harvard. Arthur Compton had won the Nobel prize in physics in 1927. All of these people are fleshed out wonderfully in Rhodes's book. The big question for the Americans, as it was for the Germans and Japanese, was could the enormous effort to produce the bomb pay off in time for World War II? First, why ""enormous effort""? As Niels Bohr said around 1940, to actually make such a bomb would take half of the industrial apparatus of the United States for two years. This turned out to be only a modest overstatement. Producing enough U-235 was a huge task. Many tons of uranium ore would have to be processed to produce U-238, then a huge painstaking process (invention of Ernest Lawrence) would have to follow. (The Japanese realized this too, and abandoned the atomic bomb as impractical.) Eventually, processing U-235 was done at the Oak Ridge site in Tennessee, a gigantic complex. The alternative was to use plutonium. Plutonium can be created with a nuclear reactor at lesser cost. However, in 1942 no one was sure how to make a bomb out of plutonium, as it is almost too good. If a critical mass is not brought together VERY promptly, it would ""fizzle"", yielding an explosion scarcely any better than chemical bombs. The atomic bomb, of course, is a hundred thousand times better than that. The decision in the US was to do both approaches, to use both U-235 and plutonium. Plutonium was manufactured at another huge new facility, the Hanford Plant in Washington state. These two plants provided the ""brawn"" for the making of the atomic bomb, and employed thousands of people. But the ""brain"" was the third brand new facility built from scratch, the Los Alamos laboratory in New Mexico. This brings us at last to two of the most important names in this subject, Robert Oppenheimer and Leslie Groves. Robert Oppenheimer was born in New York in 1904, the son of a wealthy Jewish importer. With his rather privileged upbringing, Robert had spent some summers in the high plateaus in northern New Mexico. (Photos of the young Oppenheimer look remarkably like Bob Dylan.) I'll skip over his background in physics and how he came to the attention of the Bush committee, but it was decided to put him in overall charge of the construction of the atomic bomb. This was soon given the name Manhattan Project. Based on Oppenheimer's recommendation, a boys' school at Los Alamos was purchased, along with a hundred square miles of surrounding land. Colonel Leslie Groves was appointed the military leader of the project, who technically was above Oppenheimer. Rhodes does a wonderful job sketching how their relationship evolved. In short, both Oppenheimer and Groves did a wonderful job.  Rhodes' description of the building of the Los Alamos lab and the recruiting of the scientists and their families is perhaps the best part of this uniformly excellent book. The big names came, as well as many unknown today and many who later became famous. Enrico Fermi (who had created the first nuclear reactor in history in Chicago), Segre, Frisch, Bohr, Richard Feynman, Ulam, Lawrence, Seaborg, Bethe, two of Fermi's proteges Leona Woods and Herbert Anderson, Peierls and his colleague Klaus Fuchs from England. All of these went on to distinguished careers in the following decades. (more about Klaus Fuchs later.) Security was tight. Not all could take it. Edward Condon, a physicist ironically born in Alamogordo NM, resigned after six weeks: ""The thing which upsets me the most is the extraordinary close security policy.... In my case I found that the extreme concern with security was morbidly depressing -- especially the censoring mail and telephone calls."" Much later he was the target of the House Un-American Activities Committee because he was a ""follower"" of a ""new revolutionary movement"", quantum mechanics!  To make a long story short again, perhaps the biggest problem they solved at Los Alamos was the plutonium bomb. As mentioned above, the key is to force a critical mass of plutonium into a very small volume very quickly, to harness the vast number of neutrons released in the chain reaction. A young physicist named Seth Neddermeyer had the key idea: implosion. That means, arrange a group of ordinary explosives around a hollow sphere of plutonium. Set off the explosives at the same time and they will compress the plutonium into critical mass. This is easier said than done, and besides Neddermeyer the person who made it work was George Kistiakowsky, an ordinance expert. Implosion is not necessary in a U-235 bomb, but, as mentioned above, plutonium is easier to manufacture. There is one strong lesson from all of this: it is very hard to build an atomic bomb! Good! One more physics topic before we get to the more political aspects. The idea of using the energy from a fission bomb (uranium or plutonium atomic bomb) to initiate a fusion reaction (hydrogen bomb) was first proposed casually by Enrico Fermi to Edward Teller in the fall of 1941. Teller latched onto it and made it his ""baby"" until the first hydrogen bomb was detonated in 1952. During the war years at Los Alamos he insisted on working on it even though most of the others said to let it go until after the war. He was vindicated when it did indeed unleash 1000 times more energy than the atomic bombs. To quickly wrap up this phase, the Manhattan project succeeded in producing two plutonium bombs (the one tested in the New Mexico desert and one that fell on Nagasaki) and one U-235 bomb, the one that fell on Hiroshima. Now to the 500 pound gorilla in the room: was all this necessary? Was it morally correct to build and use the bomb, killing 130,000 people? The physicists who worked on the bomb did so almost entirely to make sure that the Allies would not be behind the Germans, who they felt sure were working on an atomic bomb. Many, perhaps half, of those physicists, had escaped Nazi persecution. This was a real and palpable threat to them. I do not see how anyone can argue with that. But did any of them see farther into the future? One especially did so: Niels Bohr. If reading this book will do nothing else, it will make you respect Niels Bohr. Already in 1943, as Los Alamos was just being built, Bohr was looking ahead to a post-war world with atomic weapons. He was terrified at the idea. He held no illusions that we in the US could keep the weapon for ourselves. Once successfully demonstrated, he had no doubt that the Soviet Union could build one in a few years. Indeed, he assumed they were already aware of the Manhattan Project. His solution was radical openness, his ""principle of complementarity."" Recall that this is the phrase he used twenty years earlier to grasp the apparently contradictory notions of quantum mechanics.  Complementarity means that the atomic bomb is a two-edged sword. On the one hand it is a terrible weapon, having the potential to unleash horrific suffering. On the other hand, since governments will realize that, they will be forced to not use it, to try much harder than ever to maintain peace. To help this along, he wanted the US to not only make it clear to everyone that the Manhattan Project was going on, he wanted the US to share everything we learned. He wanted in essence to give away the blueprints (not to the Germans during the war of course), that we would in this way generate enormous good will.  Making a long story short, in 1944 he gained personal audiences with both FDR and Churchill to push this idea. FDR was sympathetic. Churchill was appalled, to the extent that he wanted Bohr arrested. When FDR and Churchill met later in 1944, Churchill prevailed against the already enfeebled FDR, and that was the end of Bohr's far reaching vision. At least, he was not arrested. What about the idea that dropping the bombs on Japan was unnecessary, that the death toll was unprecedented? Rhodes points out that at least the second half of this statement is incorrect. There were already horrific bombings and killings. We all know about the holocaust, but many people today don't seem to know about the German executions of at least 500,000 prisoners in Russia, or the terrible murders and rapes that the Japanese perpetrated in China, which killed 150,000 civilians, or the Battle of Britain, in which the English lost 40,000, or the Dresden fire bombing that killed 25,000, or the Tokyo fire bombing in which 334 B29 bombers killed 90,000 people. The death toll from Hiroshima and Nagasaki was absolutely not unprecedented. Most Americans who lived through those years think that the atomic bombs ended the war and saved several hundred thousand American lives, and probably 500,000 Japanese. A few comments on the fourth phase of this book, the postwar period: Klaus Fuchs, mentioned above, was a Russian spy. He served nine years in prison in England, later emigrated to East Germany. Rhodes never mentions Julius or Ethel Rosenberg. I find that a bit odd. Oppenheimer had married a woman who had been a member of the communist party. This caused him trouble in 1941, but he was appointed to Los Alamos in spite of it. After the war, he had a very good career at Berkeley and Princeton. In 1949 he lost his security clearance because of his prewar communist sympathies, and because of the struggle with Edward Teller, who was championing the building of the hydrogen bomb. Oppenheimer was seen by the scientific community as a martyr to McCarthyism. He came to represent the struggle between right-wing militarists (symbolized by Teller) and left-wing intellectuals (symbolized by Oppenheimer) over the moral question of nuclear bombs.  To wrap up this already long review, let's return once more to the question of should the US have dropped the bombs on Japan. I will let Leona Woods have the last word. She later went on to a long career as a physicist:  ""I certainly do recall how I felt when the atomic bombs were used. My brother-in-law was captain of the first minesweeper. My brother was a Marine on Okinawa. I'm sure they would not have lasted in an invasion. It was clear the war would continue, with half a million of our fighting men dead not to say how many Japanese. You know and I know that [we] firebombed Tokyo and nobody even mentions the slaughter that happened then. They think Nagasaki and Hiroshima were something [very bad] compared to the firebombing. THEY'RE WRONG! I have no regrets. I think we did right, and we couldn't have done it differently. Yeah, I know it has been suggested the second bomb, Nagasaki, was not necessary. ... when you are in a war, to the death, I don't think you stand around and ask, Is it right?' """
56,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85753449-pritam-chattopadhyay,4,"In the foreword to this extremely interesting book, the author writes: The closing days of the Second World War marked a similar turning point in human history, the point of entry into a new era when humankind for the first time acquired the means of its own destruction. The discovery of how to release nuclear energy, and its application to build weapons of mass destruction, has gradually removed the prejudice on which total war is based: the insupportable conviction that there is a limited amount of energy available in the world to concentrate into explosives, that it is possible to accumulate more of such energy than one’s enemies and thereby militarily to prevail. So cheap, so portable, so holocaustal did nuclear weapons eventually become that even nation-states as belligerent as the Soviet Union and the United States preferred to sacrifice a portion of their national sovereignty—preferred to forego the power to make total war—rather than be destroyed in their fury.First published in 1986, this scrupulously researched and broad narrative by Richard Rhodes is the author’s ultimate account, tracing the expansion of the world’s eventual apocalyptic weapon from its origins as a problem in theoretical physics to its devastating culmination at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The book, at the same time, is also a chronicle of the personalities and greatest minds of the 20th century—especially Robert Oppenheimer, Niels Bohr, Leo Szilard, Enrico Fermi, Edward Teller, and Ernest Lawrence — and their inputs to developing the atomic bomb. Rhodes describes exhaustively the great scientific achievements that led up to the invention of the atomic bomb. Everything of importance is examined, from the discovery of the atomic nucleus and of nuclear fission to the emergence of quantum physics, the invention of the mass-spectroscope and of the cyclotron, the creation of such man-made elements as plutonium and tritium, and implementation of the nuclear chain reaction in uranium. Even more important, Rhodes shows how these achievements were thrust into the arms of the state, which culminated in the unfolding of the nuclear arms race. Often brilliantly, he records the rise of fascism and of anti-Semitism, and the intensification of nationalist ambitions. He traces the outbreak of WW II, which provoked a hysterical rivalry among nations to devise the bomb.Rhodes does a brilliant job in explaining the Manhattan Project, with a host of elements on everything from laboratory experiments to training of bombing pilots.The author prophetically observes : I think of a world without nuclear weapons not as a utopian dream but simply as a world where delivery times have been deliberately lengthened to months or even years, with correspondingly longer periods interim during which to resolve disputes short of war. In such a world, if negotiations fail, if conventional skirmishes fail, if both sides revert to arming themselves with nuclear weapons again—then at worst we will only arrive once more at the dangerous precipice where we all stand now.The discovery of how to release nuclear energy, like all fundamental scientific discoveries, changed the structure of human affairs—permanently.How that happened is the story this book attempts to tell."
57,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5672051-brahm,5,"The Making of the Atomic Bomb in audiobook form is just over 37 hours (the book clocks in at 900 pages). It was an immense history of EVERYTHING connected to the atomic weapons program, starting with a great chapter on the ancient philosophy of science, to primers on chemistry and physics, to the evolution of weapons of mass destruction including horrific WWI gas weapons, to post-WWI European politics, to stories of individual scientists and their cumulative discoveries, to stories of the supply chain and secret politics that had to be developed to feed the US atomic weapons program. The book converges to, and ends immediately after the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The Making of the Atomic Bomb was immense, powerful, and comprehensive. I loved the technical depth and the personal stories of the scientists and other actors involved. It feels like I just finished a University course. The pace of scientific discovery in the late 1930s is nothing short of amazing, and the scientists are such interesting characters. In the final chapter, the first-hand accounts of the immediate aftermath of Hiroshima and Nagasaki are graphic and deeply disturbing. It's a big change in tone; you invest hours and hours reading/listening about scientific, political, industrial and engineering progress, making it difficult to face the gut-wrenching, violent outcome. Better understanding of atomic theory and history, but mostly the consequences of nuclear weapons leaves me feeling unsettled over the range and number of nuclear weapons that exist today. They're in the background; we don't think about them. I didn't ever seriously consider or understand the physical damage these weapons can cause, OR the political consequences (ie, the world is locked in an eternal standoff of nuclear powers, even if we don't hear it on the news every day). The audiobook was narrated by Holter Graham. I am brand-new to audiobooks, but I thought it was exceptionally well read. I wonder if dense books are especially well-suited to audiobooks, as a bit of inflection and tone by a careful narrator can really bring a serious, technical and/or dense material to life. "
58,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3816725-larry-bassett,3,"I have to thank audible books for allowing me to actually experience this book. I am pretty sure I never would’ve gotten through even the first half of the book without the help of a skilled reader. I would give the first half of the book 2 stars and the last half of the book 4 stars does arriving at the medium of three stars. The first half or more of the book is way too complicated for my simple science knowledge. It might be very interesting to someone more versed in physics. It goes into great detail about 19th century and early 20th century physics discoveries and it is indefatigable in naming names! Way beyond my ability to compute.The second half of a book is exceedingly more interesting story for the average reader. Some of it you will of heard before but some of the inside stories of the relationships of the scientists Was new information to me. The relationship between science and engineering is something that I am not familiar with. A lot of the story about the development of theory and experimentation. And then an implementation is fascinating. The expansion and development of this $2 billion project beginning with essentially vacant ground in los Alamos and Hartford and Tennessee was very well documented. In the entire book there are about 2600 footnotes. Thank goodness the audible reading skips over those. At the end of the Kindle book there are many photographs of the many characters that appear in starring and supporting roles.I am not sure what the major takeaways of this book are. There is a fair amount of discussion about the debate about the good and evil of the atomic bomb. There was considerable hope among scientists that the bomb might force us to create a world of peace. There was of course some dissension about the use of the bomb but it is clear that once the bomb was created, there was no doubt that it would be used.There are many more pages about the horror of the injuries and deaths in Hiroshima then where necessary. We have read those pages too often. The fact that they were literally getting a third Byam ready when JAPAN finally surrendered is not something I have heard about previously. The argument about the bomb saving American lives was pretty well implanted in this book."
59,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56863096-jeremy,4,"Excellently told history of the incredible story of the development of the atomic bomb. Rhodes starts with some of the history of modern physics as it relates to different developments that led to the bomb, including the scientists. It was great to see Niels Bohr get his proper due; he commonly seems to be overlooked, at least among the general public, as one of the most important scientists in history (though he wasn't directly involved in the Manhattan Project). The science throughout this book is quite thorough and complex. After a while I gave up trying to see if I could follow it. While I appreciate that this book is trying to be comprehensive, for my taste he could have backed off the science a little bit. That said, the feat was incredible, and it is equally incredible that a chain reaction of splitting atoms can create such enormous destructive power.The last third or so of the book was exciting, as we got a behind the scenes look at the political and scientific progress towards the inevitable, and a front row seat to the first test of an atomic bomb. Rhodes spends some time in Hiroshima describing the awful outcome of the bomb in all its brutal reality. I was unaware that the Japanese would have potentially surrendered conditionally, but the US was demanding unconditional surrender. There were a number of prescient voices, Bohr's included, that understood what nuclear weapons meant for the world, a threat we must all now live with. Many of those working on the project experienced the cognitive dissonance of being successful with their work, and the fact that it meant terrible death and destruction for innocent lives, and changed the world forever."
60,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63879552-sebastian,5,"BLUF:There are not many books I would recommend more whole-heartedly. Just read it.Details:This is the story of science, industry, and politics, and how humanity went from wondering about structure of the atom in 1910 to dropping exploding balls of plutonium over Japan in 1945.We begin with bunch of European physicists who in the 1920s and 30s, discover the nature of the atom: Rutherford in England discovering the nucleus in 1911, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle in 1926, the Bohr model, Chadwick's discovery of the neutron in 1932, Fermi's 1934 experiments with neutron bombardment in Rome, and finally Otto Hahn and Lise Meitner publishing on nuclear fission in 1938. Rhodes paints a picture of a world of perhaps 100 physicists who knew each other personally and moved around frequently to collaborate for short periods of time. I wonder how funding worked (when Oppenheimer does research at Cavendish, or similar -- were do the dollars come from?) but no-one seems to worry about grants. Another thing that struck me was how broad some of these scientists were. Einstein and Szilard take a couple years off particle physics to study refrigeration in the 1930s. It's interesting to thing about this period of rapid progress against the example of Bell Labs. Common elements seem to be freedom from funding and publishing concerns, and a degree of flexibility in field of study. Unlike Bell, they aren't as commercially-focused although there is a goal that everyone is working against at least implicitly to map the structure of the atom. Also, Bohr is this convener and hub for the physicists, and I'm not sure a similar figure existed at Bell Labs.1938 is a pivotal year. Hahn / Meitner's write up on fission makes it clear to everyone that a fission chain reaction could power a new source of energy -- or a powerful new weapon. All of the fun of science and discovery takes on new meaning when our science Bund discovers their knowledge could be used for destructive ends. Hitler's Anschluss absorbs Austria and persecution of Jews in Germany begins.* Bohr heroically rounds up as many Jewish scientists as he can and whisks them off to Denmark; Szilard in the UK helps get more to England and the US.The war begins and scientists relocate the United States. Szilard, Einstein, and others (""The Hungarian Conspiracy"") attempt to educate military leadership and Roosevelt himself of the destructive power of the bomb. Eventually they do succeed and the great INDUSTRIAL project of the atomic bomb begins. I went in to the book thinking that Los Alamos would be comparable to Bell Labs. It isn't. As alluded to earlier, most scientists who saw the Meitner/Hahn paper in 1938 could surmise a bomb was possible. What differentiated the US from other countries who were pursing nuclear weapons was that we had the industrial capacity and resources to set up Hanford in Oregon to produce plutonium, and enrich uranium in meaningful quantities at Oak Ridge. But the leap to a bomb wasn't one of great scientific innovation, but rather production.The book ends with about 100 pages describing the Japanese victims of the US nuclear attack. The contrast to the joyful early days of Fermi running up and down his hallway on Via Panisperna and taking measurements with his Geiger counter is stark. Sometimes history unfolds in unexpected ways.Far too much to say about the book than can put in writing. Just read it.*A crazy early anecdote talked about how Chaim Weizmann secured the Balfour Declaration in support of a Jewish homeland during WWI in exchange for supporting the government manufacture acetone which was badly needed for artillery. You can't make this stuff up."
61,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11476806-g-d-brennan,4,"I think this book is a touch overrated.Having said that, I couldn't put it down.""The Making of the Atomic Bomb"" is incredibly well-researched; it's thought-provoking and deep, yet lively and literary. And make no mistake, it is well worth your while; its greatest sections and passages are as absorbing and exciting as anything I've ever read. (As a precocious 4th grader prone to fleeing the world by burying my nose in books, I'd read eagerly about the incredible feats of engineering and physics that went into the atomic bombs; this book made me revert to my 4th-grade-self, walking around Chicago oblivious to the comparatively drab sights and sounds of the real world as I explored the livelier world within.) And given the primary research Rhodes has done, especially the interviews with many of the physicists and chemists who literally manufactured history in a hastily-assembled laboratory in the New Mexico desert, it seems impossible that anyone could put together even a comparably comprehensive history without copiously copping from this one. Nothing else compares; it is the ""War and Peace"" of our only nuclear war.And yet, this feels like a science experiment where one has settled on a hypothesis prior to doing the research, and has ignored or minimized those results that threatened the theory. Rhodes takes us through virtually all of 20th century atomic physics, but he's assembled it in a structure that resembles one of those black hole coin wells one sees at the science center; everything starts out slow and lazy and happy, but eventually things get more energetic and more frentic; valuable time is lost, and valuable money disappears into an abyss of war and militarism. Also, if it shares ""War and Peace's"" strengths, it also shares its flaws; rather than sticking around to observe things and let events speak for themselves, the author spends many of the closing pages on maddening flights of philosophical fancy centered around the potential for worldwide Armageddon that the atomic bomb unleashed. When Rhodes was writing and researching this book--from 1981 to 1986, according to the endnotes--such fears surely seemed lively and compelling, topical and true, matters of monumental import to the whole human race; now they feel quaint and outdated. (In these post 9/11 days of endless hot wars, one almost feels nostalgic for the Cold War. Armageddon clocks ticking down the minutes to midnight? ICBMs on alert in North Dakota, waiting for the launch signals that would send them off on flaming arcs over the polar ice cap, but held at bay only by the prospect of Mutual Assured Destruction? I'll take that over fanatical and resourceful terrorists with a divine mandate any day. Our current world makes MAD feel sane.) At any rate, one realizes at the end that Rhodes' musings are not mere detours at the end of a masterful narrative; they have also warped its course, for in between his excellent chronicling of the bomb's development, Rhodes gets pulled off by other vectors, particularly by Neils Bohr's utopian musings about making nuclear weapons research subject to the same standards of openness and free disclosure that prevail in the rest of scientific discourse.And it's a shame, because in the vast majority of the narrative Rhodes proves himself to be an incredibly talented writer and reporter, with a telling eye for facts and details, and an ease with complicated scientific concepts and analogies that, in turn, sets the reader at ease. I have read many other books on similar subjects and studied nuclear physics at the college level; still, I found myself learning new things from Rhodes' lucid and cogent descriptions of, say, the way a uranium atom fissions almost like a raindrop, or the way a cyclotron spins and separates atomic particles. And he weaves these descriptions into memorable scenes and stories; his descriptions of the construction and operation of the first nuclear reactor, a round-ish pile of graphite bricks and uranium trussed up by wooden scaffolding and nestled in a squash court at the University of Chicago, for instance, are lyrical and unforgettable. It is fascinating to read about the world's top nuclear physicists engaging in an experiment that was by turns precise and haphazard; it is engrossing to envision Enrico Fermi plotting neutron fluxes and calculating reaction coefficients while many of his staff members were wearing leftover raccoon coats to warm themselves against the Chicago winter because they had built the world's first nuclear reactor in an unheated building.Rhodes turns these dead physicists into live characters by keeping his eyes open for the characteristic anecdotes, and his ear tuned for the telling quotes. During the Manhattan Project, for instance, General Leslie Groves, frustrated at wartime copper shortages that threatened to derail the construction of uranium-separating cyclotrons, decided to borrow thousands of tons of silver from the Treasury to build them instead; his assistant was told: ""Colonel, in the Treasury we do not speak of tons of silver; our unit is the troy ounce."" Eventually they ended up with over 10,000 tons of silver, though; Rhodes judiciously uses this fact, and others, to convey the sheer magnitude of America's nuclear effort. Thanks to the Manhattan Project, a whole city sprung up in Tennessee to support the uranium processing efforts, a city with tens of thousands of people which nonetheless remained off the map. And meanwhile the government was establishing the Hanford reservation in Washington State--an area a third the size of Rhode Island. The upshot of all of these efforts, Rhodes tells us, was that the U.S. essentially constructed a nuclear industry from scratch and grew it, in three short years, to be the size of the automobile industry.And yet, of course, it was not about industry alone, but about dropping the product of that industry on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Here, too, I must take issue with the author; he expounds at length on Hiroshima, to the point that one almost becomes numb to its horrors, and yet he skimps on describing Nagasaki. The bomb used there was the more complicated and technically challenging of the two. (The tricky details of its construction end up taking far more space in the narrative than those for the relatively simple gun-type Hiroshima bomb; despite his revulsion at its use, Rhodes clearly admires the complicated engineering challenge it represented.) The mission which dropped it nearly ended up an unqualified and costly failure after it met with a string of bad luck. (Or good luck, at least, for the citizens of Kokura, the Japanese city which was saved from dubious immortality and near-total destruction thanks to unexpectedly cloudy weather that sent the second nuclear mission on to its secondary target; it is doubtful that bad weather has ever been more beneficial for a city and its populace.) And yet the last use of nuclear weapons in anger merits barely more than a page in this lengthy narrative, which is unfair to the reader, unfair to the story, and unfair to the hapless citizens of Nagasaki, whose fluke-filled fate deserves to be better remembered than as a glorified footnote.Short shrift, too, is given to the considerable efforts of Soviet spies at security-heavy Los Alamos; it is possible that much of this information was simply not known when Rhodes wrote, and he did cover this subject in his later ""Dark Sun;"" still, it means this feels somewhat incomplete.None of this is to say that one should avoid this book; it's massive enough and weighty enough that one simply can't avoid it if one is even tangentially interested in these topics. (Indeed, if one were to read only one book on the development and first use of the atomic bomb, this should probably be it.) Still, despite its lengthy word count, its thorough research, and its generally excellent writing, this is neither the last word nor the only word on its subject. "
62,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4828849-michael-burnam-fink,5,"""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.""Robert Oppenheimer, director of the Los Alamos lab, chief designer of the atomic bomb, and a polymath with mystic and leftist inclinations, had the perfect quote for the first artificial dawn of an atomic explosion. There are many ways in which we die: disease, age, accident, violence. And many ways in which we might all die; suddenly in the wake of some cosmological catastrophe or slowly starving on a dying planet. With the atom bomb, it was now possible for a single individual, at the top of a chain of technological and political commitments, to kill almost everyone in the space of an afternoon. The bombs were only used in anger twice, punctuation to end the global slaughter of the Second World War. Since then, history has existed under the shadow of a potential mushroom cloud. This book is the story of how we got there.Rhodes takes almost the first half of the book to establish the basic science and personalities of the atomic bomb. The first half of the 20th century was a golden age for physics which will likely never be equaled, as imaginative theorists and skilled experimenters probed the basic building blocks of the universe. Rutherford and Bohr nailed down, for the first time in evidence rather than speculation, the basic building blocks of matter. Atoms had most of their mass in a small nucleus, and owed their chemical properties to the quantum behavior of electron shells. The neutron was added to the list of fundamental particles. New elements were created by neutron bombardment, and by the late 1930s it was widely known that uranium would fission on bombardment, splitting into two lighter elements, and releasing a large deal of energy. There positive glee of work in this field, at this time, comes through in Rhodes' able biographical sketches of the scientists involved, particularly Bohr, Fermi, and Szilard.Szilard was the first to think of the potential of a fission chain reaction. If some substance, on absorbing a neutron split and released two or more neutrons, could produce a great deal of energy in millionths of a second. It would be a bomb of stupendous power, a city-smasher. Politically perceptive, Szilard had been helping Jewish physicists flee the Nazis for years. He had hoped for an H.G. Wells inspired international coalition to peacefully control this new power, but in 1939 if the bomb was too be invented, best by the Americans or British rather than Hitler.The next section, building the bomb, is less fun. Bohr predicted that you would need to turn all of America into a factory to build a bomb, and that is what the Manhattan project did, mobilizing thousands of scientists, $2 billion, and massive plants to do the hard work of separating fissile U-235 and Plutonium from natural uranium. Bureaucratic confusion and balky precision engineering made the task anything but easy. The other powers pursued the bomb. The British sent over their best to help with the Manhattan project. Germany's team, lead by Heisenberg, never had the necessary priority in the Reich, and were stalled by clever British-Norwegian sabotage directed at a heavy water production facility required for the Nazi reactor design. Japan never had access to the raw material to move beyond theory.The last section is grimmer yet. The design of the bomb was an exercise in precision, in delicately engineered explosive lenses to make the implosion to critical mass happen smoothly in nanoseconds. Tibbetts' B-29 bomber group trained to a razor's edge to accomplish the mission of deploying the 'gadget'. Roosevelt, on approving the Manhattan project, had instinctively reserved the bomb to himself as President. In 1945, Vice President Truman had not been read into the project until he succeeded to the presidency. The bomb was used on Hiroshima because it could be, because the Japanese still resisted, and because something had to be shown for the effort invested. It was a crime, a mass-murder in an instant. Rhodes does not flinch from the horror of Hiroshima.Personally, I think we need to distinguish between the bomb's use at the end of the Second World War, where it seems a matter of degree compared to area bombing rather than kind, and its use now, where that would signal breaking the nuclear taboo. This does not absolve the scientists who built the bomb of their responsibility. Nature's secrets were all around, and once fission had been theorized it was probably only a matter of time before someone figured out how to make it work, but these people made a choice to build Death a supersonic jet bomber to replicate his tired old horse. The Making of the Atomic Bomb is a penetrating look at the most consequential scientific and political moment of the 20th century. I'd give it six stars, if I could. It is also my 1000th review on Goodreads!"

65,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2209582-ross,3,"This is an exhaustive history of the bombs development., some 900 pages. The first half deals with the fundamental physics that makes nuclear weapons possible. The remainder deals with the actual development.My previous understanding of the bomb history stemmed from a movie some 20 years ago. In this film Albert Einstein perceives the potential for the bomb based on his famous equationE=MC squared. He quickly contacts President Roosevelt and FDR assigns a General Groves to develop the bomb ASAP in order to end the war.The actual truth is almost unbelievable.In the late 1930’s physicists in Europe realize that the fission of uranium can be used to make a bomb. Most of these scientists are Jews and they flee Hitler to the U.S. terrified that Germany will develop the bomb. Using what connections they can they approach officers separately in the U.S. army and navy. In both instances they are laughed at. Now more terrified than ever they approach Einstein, hoping his prestige can get word of the danger to someone in power. Einstein actually does have a contact that knows FDR and a letter from Einstein, actually written by our refugee physicists, is taken to the White House and read to FDR. The President seems impressed and says he will act on it. What he actually does is assign a bureaucrat in the Department of Standards to look into this thing. The bureaucrat now puts the letter in his safe and does nothing. It never occurs to FDR to follow-up on what is being done.Meanwhile the Germans and British are working on development and the British think the U.S. is also working on it A year later Churchill concerned about what the U.S. is doing sends a delegation over to discuss the project. They are horrified to find nothing is being done. A lot of screaming and yelling now takes place and finally General Groves is assigned.More than a year had been lost and we are very lucky today that we don’t have to speak German."
66,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7226831-josh-friedlander,5,"An epic topic, perhaps the epic topic, matched by a book epic in scope and detail. Rhodes starts off at the beginning of 20th century understanding of the atom, going into intricate detail about the lives of Bohr, Rutherford, Szilard, et al. He seems equally happy talking about Kierkegaard's Either/Or philosophy, the Pacific Theatre, or the intricacies of isolating Uranium-235. There's a lot of science in this book - I googled a lot but still felt like I missed enough to justify a second reading sometime - and some coverage of the effects of the bomb, the moral concerns of the scientists and politicians involved in its deployment, and the state of today's world. Rhodes wrote this book in the mid-1980s, but of course, the great, numbing, existential threat of the bomb still looms over us today; even if we think of it less."
67,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14945161-sandy-maguire,5,"Amazing book. The first act is a fantastic set of tableaus about the physicists and progression of science necessary to discover the capabilities of the atom. The second act is somewhat dry, regarding mostly the politicking necessary to have made the bomb happen, but there is some decent engineering spliced in here and there. The third is about the war effort, the Trinity test, and the eventual dropping of the bomb. The last chapter is horrifying and not something I'd describe as the feel-good read of the year, but it helps to drive home just how terrible these things are.I would strongly recommend this book to everyone."

It's 800+ pages of tiny text, but there's not a superfluous sentence to be found. Just a staggering amount of information. And no wonder - this book is a textbook of physics in the first half of the 20th century, a case study of the relationship between science and war (and scientists and soldiers), and a history of the rising tolerability of mass civilian slaughter, combined with multiple biographies of some of history's most characteristic scientists.The climax of the book from Trinity to Nagasaki is awesome, cinematic, and chilling. This is a serious investment, but well worth your time."

Like, uber. Not just an exhaustive regarding the scientific aspects, but the social, political and wartime factors that contributed and led up to the creation of the most destructive weapon ever conceived. Even ample knowledge of the personal lives of the scientists involved is conveyed. There is so much about the development of the bomb that I certainly wasn't aware of and I would venture to say that most people aren't. How close that the Nazi's were to developing their own nuclear device, and the fact that the Japanese were actively researching their own atomic bomb. Overall, its good. Very good. But if you're more broadly interested in the history of the nuke... this book might drive you insane. Its hardcore. Also this book stops directly after the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the surrender of Japan, which seems a shame. So much of interest happens in the next several years, including the development of thermonuclear bomb technology (which is conceptually covered in the book), USSR espionage contributing to their own bomb development and the first stages of the arms race."

73,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6871223-aaron-million,4,"Richard Rhodes' monumental undertaking here is both admirable and daunting at the same time. As one might expect, the story of the development of the atomic bomb, and of atomic power in general, does not occur overnight and does not involved just a few individuals. It evolves over decades of often pain-staking work done by scientists who span a wide range of nationalities, specialties, opinions, and motivations. As such, a thorough job requires a lot of work – both for Rhodes and for the reader. Not being well-versed in science, and especially in physics, the sections containing detailed discussions of neutrons, electrons, atomic elements, chain reactions, volts, etc... were not the easiest for me to absorb. But that is due to my limited capacity to understand those things, not to Rhodes' writing or researching skills. In fact, he is not just writing for a scientific audience, but for a general audience. Thus, he cannot delve too far into the weeds of nuclear physics without losing quite a few people. But he cannot, at the same time, brush past very important discoveries and experiments. He does an admirable job of finding middle ground: not too detailed to discourage readers, but not superficial enough to upset scientists who understand these advanced topics. Almost as much of a struggle as the scientific aspect, is the difficulty in keeping all of the main characters (and there is no shortage of these) straight. So many people provided significant contributions to the development of the bomb: scientifically, politically, militarily, economically, that the names start to run together at a certain point. In addition, especially throughout the first half of the book, the scientists are from several different (mainly European) countries, and thus their work is taking place in many different laboratories in different cities. Just remembering which nationality someone is can be difficult at times. This is not a criticism of Rhodes; he could not begin to tell the story without all of these people being in it. But it is something to note for the general reader, especially someone who is unfamiliar with most chemists and physicists aside from Albert Einstein, who plays a minor, but pivotal, role in this drama. The most riveting chapter had to do with the actual dropping of the first atomic bomb, over Hiroshima, Japan on August 6, 1945. Rhodes, as he does throughout the book, allows the people involved in the story to explain their thoughts and feelings as much as possible. In this chapter, the remembrances of Japanese who survived the atomic attack are difficult to read. A sample, from page 722, the description by a thirty-year-old woman of encountering a dead person: “The corpse lying on its back on the road had been killed immediately.... Its hand was lifted to the sky and the fingers were burning with blue flames. The fingers were shortened to one-third and distorted. A dark liquid was running to the ground along the hand.” These types of horrible description go on for several pages. Rhodes does not do this to make a moral statement about the U.S. Dropping the bomb on Japan; in fact, he also notes that the Japanese leaders must share some of the blame as their desperate fighting, literally to the death, undoubtedly contributed to Harry Truman's decision to authorize the bombing. But instead he includes the morbid accounts so as the drive home the total devastation and utter ruin that the A-bomb brought into the world. As he accurately states, the bomb did not just destroy thousands of lives, but it completely wiped out an entire city. Rhodes concludes with a forty page Afterword, primarily focusing on the development of the “Super” (or H) bomb. Towards the end, he delves into a philosophic discussion about nation-states, nuclear policy and control, and warfare. While certainly relevant, after reading the preceding chapters detailing the creation of the bomb, it dropping on Japan, the immediate effects upon its people, and all of the political tugs of war in Los Alamos, NM and Washington, this reads as an anti-climax. This is not to say that it does not belong in the book. But rather, the discussion would have been enhanced by some capsules about what all of the various scientists went on to do following WWII. Los Alamos Director Robert Oppenheimer, as an example, had a painful life – both literally and figuratively – through the 1950s and up to his death in 1967. But Rhodes does not choose to mention any of Oppenheimer's travails. Still, it is hard to see how a more complete and accurate depiction of this world-changing event could be told. "
74,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6431984-antonio-rojas,5,"Monumental and Breathtaking!Is a breathtaking journey through the history of nuclear physics and the development of Atomic Theory. It is a masterpiece where Mr. Rhodes regales us with his gift for presenting difficult and intricate concepts in a very logical, insightful, colorful, and above all entertaining fashion.Loosely speaking, the first part of the book covers the key steps that carved the foundations of atomic theory: we get to witness J.J. Thompson discovering the electron; Ernest Rutherford realizing the existence of the nucleus and postulating his “Solar System” model of the atom; Niels Bohr, with a little help from spectroscopy improving that model and carving his more realistic Shell and Orbital design; Chadwick stalking and finally uncovering the neutron; Henri Becquerel and the Curies discovering radioactivity; Heisenberg working his Uncertainty Principle, Schrodinger developing wave mechanics, Pauli his Exclusion Principle. In addition, we become familiar with de Hevesy, John von Neumann, Wigner, Dirac, Millikan, Max Born, Arnold Sommerfeld, Paul Ehrenfest, in summary, all the big architects of Quantum Mechanics and modern physics. But what makes the book a truly superior piece is that Mr. Rhodes, while impeccably describing the science, he submerges the reader into the very personal and complex psychology of each of the characters and the historic context of the time. We see each of these great scientists come to life and wander through history in front of our eyes immersed in the chaotic social and military storm that surrounded the cataclysmic days of the First and Second World Wars.The second part of the book deals more specifically with the creation and the political steps leading to the use of the first atomic bombs on civilian populations by the United States government. We get to see Leo Szilard, the true brain behind the first idea of the atomic bomb and the first to conceptualize the science behind it and its potential consequences; we see Otto Hahn splitting the atom without realizing it and Lise Meitner and Otto Freisch interpreting and using for the first time the term “fission” to name the event; Enrico Fermi “slowing neutrons” and creating a sustained chain reaction; Wigner creating plutonium and enriching uranium; all of this, leading triumphantly to Los Alamos where we witness Edward Teller, Luis Alvarez, Hans Bethe, Lawrence and above all, Robert Oppenheimer, “I am become death, the destroyer of worlds”, where they orchestrated the biggest human effort and enterprise ever achieved: the ability to create the means of our own destruction. Mr. Rhodes cold and non-judgmental recompilation of first hand witnesses and victims of the explosions is both pathetic and truly horrifying. The harrowing images of children aimlessly wandering and holding strips of their own skin, women without feet walking on their ankles, or a man holding his eye in one hand create an infernal motion picture in our brain whose memory is very hard if not impossible to forget. At 790 comprehensive pages excluding Notes, Bibliography, Photo Credits and Index -886 in total- The Making of the Atomic Bomb is a monumental achievement that deserves all the accolades and awards it has gathered through the years. This book is a veritable must read, a must have, a classic."
75,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/204112-damon,5,"Richard Rhodes does a very impressive job of telling how we got to the atomic bomb. He starts in 1900 when Plank looked into a black box and found a new world. The Making of the Atomic Bomb explores the science that makes the bomb possible, the scientist who worked in breaking the atom, the politics which made people want to do it. In doing so it becomes one of the best introductions to quantum mechanics for the laymen. Much better than other books that try to join mysticism and science, Rhodes goes though, in prose, the basics of quantum mechanics and the people who made it. He has also not shy away from using the scientists metaphors to describe the world of the very small (Rutherford's cannon ball is one of the best), nor does he shy away from explaining the concepts that make the bomb possible, like why natural uranium does not explode and why plutonium is much better than uranium. Rhodes also provides a sense a drama the scientist and engineers in New Mexico start to build the bomb. When the first one is exploded, the reader feels a sense of achievement and pride at what man has wrought. And like all good writers, Rhodes is does not let us off the hook, the last portion of the book is a detailed description of the casualties of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The descriptions of the flash burn victims whose blacked, blistered skin peeled off their body exposing the muscle underneath is more than enough for anyone to appreciate Oppenheimer's quote: I am the creator, I am the destroyer.

Yes, it is very long. Yes, the narrative can feel a bit jumpy, especially in the first half. There are a lot of names being used, some of which never re-appear, and a lot of seemingly minor scientific experiments detailed exhaustively. And yes, Rhodes dedicates many pages to discussions that do not feel very relevant in 2013, but were very much so when it was written in the mid-80s and the idea that Russia might nuke us was not very far removed.But all of these elements come together in incredible fashion when the book builds up to moments of great importance: the confirmation of the splitting of the atom; the first self-sustaining nuclear reactor in Chicago; the attack on Pearl Harbor; the Trinity test; the dropping of Little Boy over Hiroshima. These sections are written beautifully and effectively convey the excitement and the historical ramifications. They would not be the same without all of the comprehensive background that is given beforehand, and it is hard to imagine this book being edited down very much.Strongly recommended to anybody with an interest in the bomb, or World War II in general."

In addition he describes the struggle in Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan to make the first bomb, as well as the political and military events that led inexorably to the destruction of the Japanese cities. This is a beautifully written book (Rhodes has written a separate book on the craft of writing) that anyone interested in science or history would enjoy."
78,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10464045-eric-birk,4,"Rhodes is very thorough and descriptive. The book tells nothing but true stories about the people and events that shaped the making of the atom bomb and in a way that keeps your attention. Other books I read on the subject were very dry and boring, but this book holds your attention, even though it is a long book. If you like Cold War history and 20th century history, this book is a must read. How it actually all came together was so complex, it’s a miracle that it happened at all.I read this book back in 1988, just before I joined the Air Force. Little did I know that I would get a job in the Air Force working on equipment that monitored the world for people making nuclear weapons. The knowledge that I gleaned from this book was very useful in my Air Force career. Very informative."

Rhodes' book about the discovery of the atom and the development of the atomic bomb is a tour de force. It stands as one of the best history books I have ever read. Thorough, wide ranging, and engrossing. I am amazed at the intelligence of scientists working without the benefit of computers. I am horrified by what we can inflict upon one another in war. This is my second time through this book and it is still very much a 5 star read. "

85,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/941349-bob,5,"This is an extraordinary work, one of the finest nonfiction books I've ever read. Its breadth and depth of coverage are incredible. It is engagingly written, truly a book hard to put down. It is full of wonderful anecdotes and photographs. The book is a chronological account of the science, engineering, and politics that created the atomic bomb. It is basically in four parts: physics from around 1880 to 1938, physics from 1939 to 1943, engineering and politics from 1941 to 1945, and the postwar aftermath up to around 1955. The first two parts are largely in Europe, the third and fourth mostly in the US. I was not prepared for the depth of coverage of the period from about 1880 to 1938. It is marvelous story, an epic of human achievement well told. I started out in college as a physics major, so I was familiar with the broad outline of this, and many of the names were familiar. In spite of that, I learned an enormous amount. The book wisely keeps the focus on the people, and succeeds wonderfully in making us feel we know them, at least the major players. In summarizing the book, it's hard to know where to start; Rhodes must have felt the same thing. By 1890 or so it was known that there were tiny particles called electrons that were negatively charged, and that the chemical elements were defined by how many electrons were in each atom. Since atoms are neutral, there must be a corresponding positive charge in each atom, but where? For a while it was thought that the positive charge was a sort of smeared out substrate, like the dough in a muffin, with the electrons stuck in it like blueberries. This was disproven (making a long story short) by Ernest Rutherford, New Zealand born British physicist, a poor boy who grew up on a farm. He showed that the positive charge lies in a ""nucleus"", a very small dense center of the atom, with the electrons much farther out, sort of orbiting around like the planets in the solar system. It wasn't long before the proton was discovered, and the fact that the nucleus contains the same number of protons as there are electrons in the outer shell. It was also not long before it was realized that the planetary analogy would not hold. According to the very well established electromagnetic theory of James Clerk Maxwell, the electrons would simply spiral into the nucleus and the atom would cease to exist. Yet the evidence for protons and the nucleus was undeniable. But the electromagnetic theory of Maxwell was extremely highly regarded. In fact Einstein had just used it (1905) to develop the theory of relativity, also highly regarded. What is the explanation? The explanation is most important development in physics since Newton: quantum theory. Quantum theory began with Max Plank and Einstein around 1890-1900, but really got going after 1915 with the work of Niels Bohr, Erwin Schroedinger, Werner Heisenberg and P. A. M. Dirac. Rhodes does not talk too much about quantum theory itself. He manages to keep the focus on nuclear physics. However, he does point out an essential lesson of quantum theory: light is both a wave and a particle. These seemingly contradictory notions exist at the same time in one thing. Bohr came to call this paraodox-that-is-not-a-paradox ""complementarity."" This abstract idea is important later. Of the four names above, two are extremely significant in the story of the atom bomb: Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg. Bohr was born in Denmark in 1885, so was half a generation younger than Rutherford. He explained the atom by showing how the electrons stayed in well defined ""shells"" rather than orbits like planets. Heisenberg, a German, was half a generation younger yet, born in 1901. He and Schroedinger made huge breakthroughs in the 1920s showing that Bohr's model was still not right. Meanwhile, before 1900, Marie and Pierre Curie had discovered radioactivity. Some elements, notably radium and uranium, decomposed with time by ejecting nuclear particles and becoming lighter elements. Eventually (long story cut short) it was realized that the particles being ejected are often ""neutrons"", the last of the three basic particles to be discovered (James Chadwick, 1932). Neutrons live in the nucleus with protons and seem to be a sort of glue holding the nucleus together.  The first phase of the story ends and the second begins in 1939 with the realization by Otto Hahn, Lise Meitner, and her nephew Otto Frisch that a nucleus could be fractured or split by a neutron being ejected from another atom. The first atom might split into two much lighter atoms -- fission -- and eject two or more neutrons, which could in turn hit and split yet more atoms -- a chain reaction. This was a revolutionary idea, quickly understood by Bohr, who carried the news to the US. Soon, scientists in the US, England, Germany, and Japan (yes Japan) were asking themselves, could this chain reaction become a bomb? Meanwhile, of course, was the hugely important rise of Nazi Germany. Many scientists, especially the Jewish ones, fled Germany by 1939. Meitner fled to Sweden in 1938. Frisch fled to England. Bohr (with only one grandparent Jewish) was at first relatively safe in Denmark, and could travel to England and back, but eventually had to flee to Sweden in 1943. Einstein was long since at Princeton. But, as Rhodes explains, many others, who are not household words, fled Nazi Europe and became key players in the saga of the atomic bomb. Among these are Stanislaw Ulam from Poland, Hans Bethe from Germany, and the Hungarian trio of Leo Szilard, Eugene Wigner, and Edward Teller, all of whom came to the US. All played significant roles in the story of the bomb; Szilard and Teller became big actors in the story. Similarly, physicists were fleeing Italy, including Enrico Fermi and Emilio Segre. The second part of the story surges into high gear with the developments in physics showing that a bomb could really work. In England, Chadwick assembled a group that included Frisch and Rudolf Peierls, recently fled from Germany. It became known as the MAUD committee. Frisch and Peierls produced the Frisch–Peierls memorandum, which was the first document to detail how an atomic explosion could be generated. Bohr soon learned about it, as he was also in England. Long story cut short, a bomb could be made from uranium-235 or from plutonium. Uranium occurs rather commonly in nature, but over 99% of it is the form called 238, abbreviated U-238. You can't make a bomb from that, though you can use it for a nuclear reactor. If enough of the much more radioactive U-235 is gotten together in the right way, a bomb will result. Plutonium does not occur in nature and was first synthesized by Glenn Seaborg in the US in 1940. It is also radioactive enough to make a bomb. About the same time, in 1940 Heisenberg began to understand that uranium 235 could make a bomb. Heisenberg did not like Hitler, but he had no Jewish ancestors and no compelling reason to leave Germany. He was asked by the German army to investigate uses of uranium. Rhodes says that Heisenberg thought that the process of actually getting together enough U-235 would be too expensive and difficult, and that is why the German atomic bomb project never got anywhere. In 2000, Thomas Powers published a book called Heisenberg's War in which he claims that Heisenberg deliberately stalled the German atomic bomb project so that Hitler would never have the bomb. It remains controversial, but Rhodes (writing in 1987) does not talk much about Heisenberg. Nonetheless, the British and Bohr assumed that the Germans would understand everything that they did, and would certainly be doing bomb research. This key idea, that the allies must keep up with the Germans, is the start of the third part of the saga, the engineering and political story of the actual making of the bomb. Americans were working too. Already in 1939, Hungarian emigre Leo Szilard realized that fission could be used to make a nuclear reactor and possibly a bomb. Szilard had known Einstein years before; in fact in 1926 they had patented a refrigerator! He became almost obsessed with the idea that President Roosevelt must understand the threat of the Germans having a bomb. In July 1939, Szilard and Wigner drove to Long Island, where Einstein was staying (how they found him is an interesting story). They convinced Einstein to write the now famous letter to FDR urging that the matter be given the highest priority. FDR was impressed, but it took more than one letter. That's a long story; read the book!  Eventually, especially after the Americans learned of the British MAUD committee work, a high level committee was formed to begin the research and manufacture of a bomb. The leaders of this committee were Vannevar Bush, James Conant, and Arthur Compton. Vannevar Bush (no relation to the presidents Bush) was an older engineer, a longtime influential person in the highest levels of academe and government. James Conant was a chemist and the president of Harvard. Arthur Compton had won the Nobel prize in physics in 1927. All of these people are fleshed out wonderfully in Rhodes's book. The big question for the Americans, as it was for the Germans and Japanese, was could the enormous effort to produce the bomb pay off in time for World War II? First, why ""enormous effort""? As Niels Bohr said around 1940, to actually make such a bomb would take half of the industrial apparatus of the United States for two years. This turned out to be only a modest overstatement. Producing enough U-235 was a huge task. Many tons of uranium ore would have to be processed to produce U-238, then a huge painstaking process (invention of Ernest Lawrence) would have to follow. (The Japanese realized this too, and abandoned the atomic bomb as impractical.) Eventually, processing U-235 was done at the Oak Ridge site in Tennessee, a gigantic complex. The alternative was to use plutonium. Plutonium can be created with a nuclear reactor at lesser cost. However, in 1942 no one was sure how to make a bomb out of plutonium, as it is almost too good. If a critical mass is not brought together VERY promptly, it would ""fizzle"", yielding an explosion scarcely any better than chemical bombs. The atomic bomb, of course, is a hundred thousand times better than that. The decision in the US was to do both approaches, to use both U-235 and plutonium. Plutonium was manufactured at another huge new facility, the Hanford Plant in Washington state. These two plants provided the ""brawn"" for the making of the atomic bomb, and employed thousands of people. But the ""brain"" was the third brand new facility built from scratch, the Los Alamos laboratory in New Mexico. This brings us at last to two of the most important names in this subject, Robert Oppenheimer and Leslie Groves. Robert Oppenheimer was born in New York in 1904, the son of a wealthy Jewish importer. With his rather privileged upbringing, Robert had spent some summers in the high plateaus in northern New Mexico. (Photos of the young Oppenheimer look remarkably like Bob Dylan.) I'll skip over his background in physics and how he came to the attention of the Bush committee, but it was decided to put him in overall charge of the construction of the atomic bomb. This was soon given the name Manhattan Project. Based on Oppenheimer's recommendation, a boys' school at Los Alamos was purchased, along with a hundred square miles of surrounding land. Colonel Leslie Groves was appointed the military leader of the project, who technically was above Oppenheimer. Rhodes does a wonderful job sketching how their relationship evolved. In short, both Oppenheimer and Groves did a wonderful job.  Rhodes' description of the building of the Los Alamos lab and the recruiting of the scientists and their families is perhaps the best part of this uniformly excellent book. The big names came, as well as many unknown today and many who later became famous. Enrico Fermi (who had created the first nuclear reactor in history in Chicago), Segre, Frisch, Bohr, Richard Feynman, Ulam, Lawrence, Seaborg, Bethe, two of Fermi's proteges Leona Woods and Herbert Anderson, Peierls and his colleague Klaus Fuchs from England. All of these went on to distinguished careers in the following decades. (more about Klaus Fuchs later.) Security was tight. Not all could take it. Edward Condon, a physicist ironically born in Alamogordo NM, resigned after six weeks: ""The thing which upsets me the most is the extraordinary close security policy.... In my case I found that the extreme concern with security was morbidly depressing -- especially the censoring mail and telephone calls."" Much later he was the target of the House Un-American Activities Committee because he was a ""follower"" of a ""new revolutionary movement"", quantum mechanics!  To make a long story short again, perhaps the biggest problem they solved at Los Alamos was the plutonium bomb. As mentioned above, the key is to force a critical mass of plutonium into a very small volume very quickly, to harness the vast number of neutrons released in the chain reaction. A young physicist named Seth Neddermeyer had the key idea: implosion. That means, arrange a group of ordinary explosives around a hollow sphere of plutonium. Set off the explosives at the same time and they will compress the plutonium into critical mass. This is easier said than done, and besides Neddermeyer the person who made it work was George Kistiakowsky, an ordinance expert. Implosion is not necessary in a U-235 bomb, but, as mentioned above, plutonium is easier to manufacture. There is one strong lesson from all of this: it is very hard to build an atomic bomb! Good! One more physics topic before we get to the more political aspects. The idea of using the energy from a fission bomb (uranium or plutonium atomic bomb) to initiate a fusion reaction (hydrogen bomb) was first proposed casually by Enrico Fermi to Edward Teller in the fall of 1941. Teller latched onto it and made it his ""baby"" until the first hydrogen bomb was detonated in 1952. During the war years at Los Alamos he insisted on working on it even though most of the others said to let it go until after the war. He was vindicated when it did indeed unleash 1000 times more energy than the atomic bombs. To quickly wrap up this phase, the Manhattan project succeeded in producing two plutonium bombs (the one tested in the New Mexico desert and one that fell on Nagasaki) and one U-235 bomb, the one that fell on Hiroshima. Now to the 500 pound gorilla in the room: was all this necessary? Was it morally correct to build and use the bomb, killing 130,000 people? The physicists who worked on the bomb did so almost entirely to make sure that the Allies would not be behind the Germans, who they felt sure were working on an atomic bomb. Many, perhaps half, of those physicists, had escaped Nazi persecution. This was a real and palpable threat to them. I do not see how anyone can argue with that. But did any of them see farther into the future? One especially did so: Niels Bohr. If reading this book will do nothing else, it will make you respect Niels Bohr. Already in 1943, as Los Alamos was just being built, Bohr was looking ahead to a post-war world with atomic weapons. He was terrified at the idea. He held no illusions that we in the US could keep the weapon for ourselves. Once successfully demonstrated, he had no doubt that the Soviet Union could build one in a few years. Indeed, he assumed they were already aware of the Manhattan Project. His solution was radical openness, his ""principle of complementarity."" Recall that this is the phrase he used twenty years earlier to grasp the apparently contradictory notions of quantum mechanics.  Complementarity means that the atomic bomb is a two-edged sword. On the one hand it is a terrible weapon, having the potential to unleash horrific suffering. On the other hand, since governments will realize that, they will be forced to not use it, to try much harder than ever to maintain peace. To help this along, he wanted the US to not only make it clear to everyone that the Manhattan Project was going on, he wanted the US to share everything we learned. He wanted in essence to give away the blueprints (not to the Germans during the war of course), that we would in this way generate enormous good will.  Making a long story short, in 1944 he gained personal audiences with both FDR and Churchill to push this idea. FDR was sympathetic. Churchill was appalled, to the extent that he wanted Bohr arrested. When FDR and Churchill met later in 1944, Churchill prevailed against the already enfeebled FDR, and that was the end of Bohr's far reaching vision. At least, he was not arrested. What about the idea that dropping the bombs on Japan was unnecessary, that the death toll was unprecedented? Rhodes points out that at least the second half of this statement is incorrect. There were already horrific bombings and killings. We all know about the holocaust, but many people today don't seem to know about the German executions of at least 500,000 prisoners in Russia, or the terrible murders and rapes that the Japanese perpetrated in China, which killed 150,000 civilians, or the Battle of Britain, in which the English lost 40,000, or the Dresden fire bombing that killed 25,000, or the Tokyo fire bombing in which 334 B29 bombers killed 90,000 people. The death toll from Hiroshima and Nagasaki was absolutely not unprecedented. Most Americans who lived through those years think that the atomic bombs ended the war and saved several hundred thousand American lives, and probably 500,000 Japanese. A few comments on the fourth phase of this book, the postwar period: Klaus Fuchs, mentioned above, was a Russian spy. He served nine years in prison in England, later emigrated to East Germany. Rhodes never mentions Julius or Ethel Rosenberg. I find that a bit odd. Oppenheimer had married a woman who had been a member of the communist party. This caused him trouble in 1941, but he was appointed to Los Alamos in spite of it. After the war, he had a very good career at Berkeley and Princeton. In 1949 he lost his security clearance because of his prewar communist sympathies, and because of the struggle with Edward Teller, who was championing the building of the hydrogen bomb. Oppenheimer was seen by the scientific community as a martyr to McCarthyism. He came to represent the struggle between right-wing militarists (symbolized by Teller) and left-wing intellectuals (symbolized by Oppenheimer) over the moral question of nuclear bombs.  To wrap up this already long review, let's return once more to the question of should the US have dropped the bombs on Japan. I will let Leona Woods have the last word. She later went on to a long career as a physicist:  ""I certainly do recall how I felt when the atomic bombs were used. My brother-in-law was captain of the first minesweeper. My brother was a Marine on Okinawa. I'm sure they would not have lasted in an invasion. It was clear the war would continue, with half a million of our fighting men dead not to say how many Japanese. You know and I know that [we] firebombed Tokyo and nobody even mentions the slaughter that happened then. They think Nagasaki and Hiroshima were something [very bad] compared to the firebombing. THEY'RE WRONG! I have no regrets. I think we did right, and we couldn't have done it differently. Yeah, I know it has been suggested the second bomb, Nagasaki, was not necessary. ... when you are in a war, to the death, I don't think you stand around and ask, Is it right?' """
86,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85753449-pritam-chattopadhyay,4,"In the foreword to this extremely interesting book, the author writes: The closing days of the Second World War marked a similar turning point in human history, the point of entry into a new era when humankind for the first time acquired the means of its own destruction. The discovery of how to release nuclear energy, and its application to build weapons of mass destruction, has gradually removed the prejudice on which total war is based: the insupportable conviction that there is a limited amount of energy available in the world to concentrate into explosives, that it is possible to accumulate more of such energy than one’s enemies and thereby militarily to prevail. So cheap, so portable, so holocaustal did nuclear weapons eventually become that even nation-states as belligerent as the Soviet Union and the United States preferred to sacrifice a portion of their national sovereignty—preferred to forego the power to make total war—rather than be destroyed in their fury.First published in 1986, this scrupulously researched and broad narrative by Richard Rhodes is the author’s ultimate account, tracing the expansion of the world’s eventual apocalyptic weapon from its origins as a problem in theoretical physics to its devastating culmination at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The book, at the same time, is also a chronicle of the personalities and greatest minds of the 20th century—especially Robert Oppenheimer, Niels Bohr, Leo Szilard, Enrico Fermi, Edward Teller, and Ernest Lawrence — and their inputs to developing the atomic bomb. Rhodes describes exhaustively the great scientific achievements that led up to the invention of the atomic bomb. Everything of importance is examined, from the discovery of the atomic nucleus and of nuclear fission to the emergence of quantum physics, the invention of the mass-spectroscope and of the cyclotron, the creation of such man-made elements as plutonium and tritium, and implementation of the nuclear chain reaction in uranium. Even more important, Rhodes shows how these achievements were thrust into the arms of the state, which culminated in the unfolding of the nuclear arms race. Often brilliantly, he records the rise of fascism and of anti-Semitism, and the intensification of nationalist ambitions. He traces the outbreak of WW II, which provoked a hysterical rivalry among nations to devise the bomb.Rhodes does a brilliant job in explaining the Manhattan Project, with a host of elements on everything from laboratory experiments to training of bombing pilots.The author prophetically observes : I think of a world without nuclear weapons not as a utopian dream but simply as a world where delivery times have been deliberately lengthened to months or even years, with correspondingly longer periods interim during which to resolve disputes short of war. In such a world, if negotiations fail, if conventional skirmishes fail, if both sides revert to arming themselves with nuclear weapons again—then at worst we will only arrive once more at the dangerous precipice where we all stand now.The discovery of how to release nuclear energy, like all fundamental scientific discoveries, changed the structure of human affairs—permanently.How that happened is the story this book attempts to tell."
87,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5672051-brahm,5,"The Making of the Atomic Bomb in audiobook form is just over 37 hours (the book clocks in at 900 pages). It was an immense history of EVERYTHING connected to the atomic weapons program, starting with a great chapter on the ancient philosophy of science, to primers on chemistry and physics, to the evolution of weapons of mass destruction including horrific WWI gas weapons, to post-WWI European politics, to stories of individual scientists and their cumulative discoveries, to stories of the supply chain and secret politics that had to be developed to feed the US atomic weapons program. The book converges to, and ends immediately after the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The Making of the Atomic Bomb was immense, powerful, and comprehensive. I loved the technical depth and the personal stories of the scientists and other actors involved. It feels like I just finished a University course. The pace of scientific discovery in the late 1930s is nothing short of amazing, and the scientists are such interesting characters. In the final chapter, the first-hand accounts of the immediate aftermath of Hiroshima and Nagasaki are graphic and deeply disturbing. It's a big change in tone; you invest hours and hours reading/listening about scientific, political, industrial and engineering progress, making it difficult to face the gut-wrenching, violent outcome. Better understanding of atomic theory and history, but mostly the consequences of nuclear weapons leaves me feeling unsettled over the range and number of nuclear weapons that exist today. They're in the background; we don't think about them. I didn't ever seriously consider or understand the physical damage these weapons can cause, OR the political consequences (ie, the world is locked in an eternal standoff of nuclear powers, even if we don't hear it on the news every day). The audiobook was narrated by Holter Graham. I am brand-new to audiobooks, but I thought it was exceptionally well read. I wonder if dense books are especially well-suited to audiobooks, as a bit of inflection and tone by a careful narrator can really bring a serious, technical and/or dense material to life. "
88,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3816725-larry-bassett,3,"I have to thank audible books for allowing me to actually experience this book. I am pretty sure I never would’ve gotten through even the first half of the book without the help of a skilled reader. I would give the first half of the book 2 stars and the last half of the book 4 stars does arriving at the medium of three stars. The first half or more of the book is way too complicated for my simple science knowledge. It might be very interesting to someone more versed in physics. It goes into great detail about 19th century and early 20th century physics discoveries and it is indefatigable in naming names! Way beyond my ability to compute.The second half of a book is exceedingly more interesting story for the average reader. Some of it you will of heard before but some of the inside stories of the relationships of the scientists Was new information to me. The relationship between science and engineering is something that I am not familiar with. A lot of the story about the development of theory and experimentation. And then an implementation is fascinating. The expansion and development of this $2 billion project beginning with essentially vacant ground in los Alamos and Hartford and Tennessee was very well documented. In the entire book there are about 2600 footnotes. Thank goodness the audible reading skips over those. At the end of the Kindle book there are many photographs of the many characters that appear in starring and supporting roles.I am not sure what the major takeaways of this book are. There is a fair amount of discussion about the debate about the good and evil of the atomic bomb. There was considerable hope among scientists that the bomb might force us to create a world of peace. There was of course some dissension about the use of the bomb but it is clear that once the bomb was created, there was no doubt that it would be used.There are many more pages about the horror of the injuries and deaths in Hiroshima then where necessary. We have read those pages too often. The fact that they were literally getting a third Byam ready when JAPAN finally surrendered is not something I have heard about previously. The argument about the bomb saving American lives was pretty well implanted in this book."
89,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56863096-jeremy,4,"Excellently told history of the incredible story of the development of the atomic bomb. Rhodes starts with some of the history of modern physics as it relates to different developments that led to the bomb, including the scientists. It was great to see Niels Bohr get his proper due; he commonly seems to be overlooked, at least among the general public, as one of the most important scientists in history (though he wasn't directly involved in the Manhattan Project). The science throughout this book is quite thorough and complex. After a while I gave up trying to see if I could follow it. While I appreciate that this book is trying to be comprehensive, for my taste he could have backed off the science a little bit. That said, the feat was incredible, and it is equally incredible that a chain reaction of splitting atoms can create such enormous destructive power.The last third or so of the book was exciting, as we got a behind the scenes look at the political and scientific progress towards the inevitable, and a front row seat to the first test of an atomic bomb. Rhodes spends some time in Hiroshima describing the awful outcome of the bomb in all its brutal reality. I was unaware that the Japanese would have potentially surrendered conditionally, but the US was demanding unconditional surrender. There were a number of prescient voices, Bohr's included, that understood what nuclear weapons meant for the world, a threat we must all now live with. Many of those working on the project experienced the cognitive dissonance of being successful with their work, and the fact that it meant terrible death and destruction for innocent lives, and changed the world forever."
90,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63879552-sebastian,5,"BLUF:There are not many books I would recommend more whole-heartedly. Just read it.Details:This is the story of science, industry, and politics, and how humanity went from wondering about structure of the atom in 1910 to dropping exploding balls of plutonium over Japan in 1945.We begin with bunch of European physicists who in the 1920s and 30s, discover the nature of the atom: Rutherford in England discovering the nucleus in 1911, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle in 1926, the Bohr model, Chadwick's discovery of the neutron in 1932, Fermi's 1934 experiments with neutron bombardment in Rome, and finally Otto Hahn and Lise Meitner publishing on nuclear fission in 1938. Rhodes paints a picture of a world of perhaps 100 physicists who knew each other personally and moved around frequently to collaborate for short periods of time. I wonder how funding worked (when Oppenheimer does research at Cavendish, or similar -- were do the dollars come from?) but no-one seems to worry about grants. Another thing that struck me was how broad some of these scientists were. Einstein and Szilard take a couple years off particle physics to study refrigeration in the 1930s. It's interesting to thing about this period of rapid progress against the example of Bell Labs. Common elements seem to be freedom from funding and publishing concerns, and a degree of flexibility in field of study. Unlike Bell, they aren't as commercially-focused although there is a goal that everyone is working against at least implicitly to map the structure of the atom. Also, Bohr is this convener and hub for the physicists, and I'm not sure a similar figure existed at Bell Labs.1938 is a pivotal year. Hahn / Meitner's write up on fission makes it clear to everyone that a fission chain reaction could power a new source of energy -- or a powerful new weapon. All of the fun of science and discovery takes on new meaning when our science Bund discovers their knowledge could be used for destructive ends. Hitler's Anschluss absorbs Austria and persecution of Jews in Germany begins.* Bohr heroically rounds up as many Jewish scientists as he can and whisks them off to Denmark; Szilard in the UK helps get more to England and the US.The war begins and scientists relocate the United States. Szilard, Einstein, and others (""The Hungarian Conspiracy"") attempt to educate military leadership and Roosevelt himself of the destructive power of the bomb. Eventually they do succeed and the great INDUSTRIAL project of the atomic bomb begins. I went in to the book thinking that Los Alamos would be comparable to Bell Labs. It isn't. As alluded to earlier, most scientists who saw the Meitner/Hahn paper in 1938 could surmise a bomb was possible. What differentiated the US from other countries who were pursing nuclear weapons was that we had the industrial capacity and resources to set up Hanford in Oregon to produce plutonium, and enrich uranium in meaningful quantities at Oak Ridge. But the leap to a bomb wasn't one of great scientific innovation, but rather production.The book ends with about 100 pages describing the Japanese victims of the US nuclear attack. The contrast to the joyful early days of Fermi running up and down his hallway on Via Panisperna and taking measurements with his Geiger counter is stark. Sometimes history unfolds in unexpected ways.Far too much to say about the book than can put in writing. Just read it.*A crazy early anecdote talked about how Chaim Weizmann secured the Balfour Declaration in support of a Jewish homeland during WWI in exchange for supporting the government manufacture acetone which was badly needed for artillery. You can't make this stuff up."
91,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11476806-g-d-brennan,4,"I think this book is a touch overrated.Having said that, I couldn't put it down.""The Making of the Atomic Bomb"" is incredibly well-researched; it's thought-provoking and deep, yet lively and literary. And make no mistake, it is well worth your while; its greatest sections and passages are as absorbing and exciting as anything I've ever read. (As a precocious 4th grader prone to fleeing the world by burying my nose in books, I'd read eagerly about the incredible feats of engineering and physics that went into the atomic bombs; this book made me revert to my 4th-grade-self, walking around Chicago oblivious to the comparatively drab sights and sounds of the real world as I explored the livelier world within.) And given the primary research Rhodes has done, especially the interviews with many of the physicists and chemists who literally manufactured history in a hastily-assembled laboratory in the New Mexico desert, it seems impossible that anyone could put together even a comparably comprehensive history without copiously copping from this one. Nothing else compares; it is the ""War and Peace"" of our only nuclear war.And yet, this feels like a science experiment where one has settled on a hypothesis prior to doing the research, and has ignored or minimized those results that threatened the theory. Rhodes takes us through virtually all of 20th century atomic physics, but he's assembled it in a structure that resembles one of those black hole coin wells one sees at the science center; everything starts out slow and lazy and happy, but eventually things get more energetic and more frentic; valuable time is lost, and valuable money disappears into an abyss of war and militarism. Also, if it shares ""War and Peace's"" strengths, it also shares its flaws; rather than sticking around to observe things and let events speak for themselves, the author spends many of the closing pages on maddening flights of philosophical fancy centered around the potential for worldwide Armageddon that the atomic bomb unleashed. When Rhodes was writing and researching this book--from 1981 to 1986, according to the endnotes--such fears surely seemed lively and compelling, topical and true, matters of monumental import to the whole human race; now they feel quaint and outdated. (In these post 9/11 days of endless hot wars, one almost feels nostalgic for the Cold War. Armageddon clocks ticking down the minutes to midnight? ICBMs on alert in North Dakota, waiting for the launch signals that would send them off on flaming arcs over the polar ice cap, but held at bay only by the prospect of Mutual Assured Destruction? I'll take that over fanatical and resourceful terrorists with a divine mandate any day. Our current world makes MAD feel sane.) At any rate, one realizes at the end that Rhodes' musings are not mere detours at the end of a masterful narrative; they have also warped its course, for in between his excellent chronicling of the bomb's development, Rhodes gets pulled off by other vectors, particularly by Neils Bohr's utopian musings about making nuclear weapons research subject to the same standards of openness and free disclosure that prevail in the rest of scientific discourse.And it's a shame, because in the vast majority of the narrative Rhodes proves himself to be an incredibly talented writer and reporter, with a telling eye for facts and details, and an ease with complicated scientific concepts and analogies that, in turn, sets the reader at ease. I have read many other books on similar subjects and studied nuclear physics at the college level; still, I found myself learning new things from Rhodes' lucid and cogent descriptions of, say, the way a uranium atom fissions almost like a raindrop, or the way a cyclotron spins and separates atomic particles. And he weaves these descriptions into memorable scenes and stories; his descriptions of the construction and operation of the first nuclear reactor, a round-ish pile of graphite bricks and uranium trussed up by wooden scaffolding and nestled in a squash court at the University of Chicago, for instance, are lyrical and unforgettable. It is fascinating to read about the world's top nuclear physicists engaging in an experiment that was by turns precise and haphazard; it is engrossing to envision Enrico Fermi plotting neutron fluxes and calculating reaction coefficients while many of his staff members were wearing leftover raccoon coats to warm themselves against the Chicago winter because they had built the world's first nuclear reactor in an unheated building.Rhodes turns these dead physicists into live characters by keeping his eyes open for the characteristic anecdotes, and his ear tuned for the telling quotes. During the Manhattan Project, for instance, General Leslie Groves, frustrated at wartime copper shortages that threatened to derail the construction of uranium-separating cyclotrons, decided to borrow thousands of tons of silver from the Treasury to build them instead; his assistant was told: ""Colonel, in the Treasury we do not speak of tons of silver; our unit is the troy ounce."" Eventually they ended up with over 10,000 tons of silver, though; Rhodes judiciously uses this fact, and others, to convey the sheer magnitude of America's nuclear effort. Thanks to the Manhattan Project, a whole city sprung up in Tennessee to support the uranium processing efforts, a city with tens of thousands of people which nonetheless remained off the map. And meanwhile the government was establishing the Hanford reservation in Washington State--an area a third the size of Rhode Island. The upshot of all of these efforts, Rhodes tells us, was that the U.S. essentially constructed a nuclear industry from scratch and grew it, in three short years, to be the size of the automobile industry.And yet, of course, it was not about industry alone, but about dropping the product of that industry on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Here, too, I must take issue with the author; he expounds at length on Hiroshima, to the point that one almost becomes numb to its horrors, and yet he skimps on describing Nagasaki. The bomb used there was the more complicated and technically challenging of the two. (The tricky details of its construction end up taking far more space in the narrative than those for the relatively simple gun-type Hiroshima bomb; despite his revulsion at its use, Rhodes clearly admires the complicated engineering challenge it represented.) The mission which dropped it nearly ended up an unqualified and costly failure after it met with a string of bad luck. (Or good luck, at least, for the citizens of Kokura, the Japanese city which was saved from dubious immortality and near-total destruction thanks to unexpectedly cloudy weather that sent the second nuclear mission on to its secondary target; it is doubtful that bad weather has ever been more beneficial for a city and its populace.) And yet the last use of nuclear weapons in anger merits barely more than a page in this lengthy narrative, which is unfair to the reader, unfair to the story, and unfair to the hapless citizens of Nagasaki, whose fluke-filled fate deserves to be better remembered than as a glorified footnote.Short shrift, too, is given to the considerable efforts of Soviet spies at security-heavy Los Alamos; it is possible that much of this information was simply not known when Rhodes wrote, and he did cover this subject in his later ""Dark Sun;"" still, it means this feels somewhat incomplete.None of this is to say that one should avoid this book; it's massive enough and weighty enough that one simply can't avoid it if one is even tangentially interested in these topics. (Indeed, if one were to read only one book on the development and first use of the atomic bomb, this should probably be it.) Still, despite its lengthy word count, its thorough research, and its generally excellent writing, this is neither the last word nor the only word on its subject. "
92,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4828849-michael-burnam-fink,5,"""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.""Robert Oppenheimer, director of the Los Alamos lab, chief designer of the atomic bomb, and a polymath with mystic and leftist inclinations, had the perfect quote for the first artificial dawn of an atomic explosion. There are many ways in which we die: disease, age, accident, violence. And many ways in which we might all die; suddenly in the wake of some cosmological catastrophe or slowly starving on a dying planet. With the atom bomb, it was now possible for a single individual, at the top of a chain of technological and political commitments, to kill almost everyone in the space of an afternoon. The bombs were only used in anger twice, punctuation to end the global slaughter of the Second World War. Since then, history has existed under the shadow of a potential mushroom cloud. This book is the story of how we got there.Rhodes takes almost the first half of the book to establish the basic science and personalities of the atomic bomb. The first half of the 20th century was a golden age for physics which will likely never be equaled, as imaginative theorists and skilled experimenters probed the basic building blocks of the universe. Rutherford and Bohr nailed down, for the first time in evidence rather than speculation, the basic building blocks of matter. Atoms had most of their mass in a small nucleus, and owed their chemical properties to the quantum behavior of electron shells. The neutron was added to the list of fundamental particles. New elements were created by neutron bombardment, and by the late 1930s it was widely known that uranium would fission on bombardment, splitting into two lighter elements, and releasing a large deal of energy. There positive glee of work in this field, at this time, comes through in Rhodes' able biographical sketches of the scientists involved, particularly Bohr, Fermi, and Szilard.Szilard was the first to think of the potential of a fission chain reaction. If some substance, on absorbing a neutron split and released two or more neutrons, could produce a great deal of energy in millionths of a second. It would be a bomb of stupendous power, a city-smasher. Politically perceptive, Szilard had been helping Jewish physicists flee the Nazis for years. He had hoped for an H.G. Wells inspired international coalition to peacefully control this new power, but in 1939 if the bomb was too be invented, best by the Americans or British rather than Hitler.The next section, building the bomb, is less fun. Bohr predicted that you would need to turn all of America into a factory to build a bomb, and that is what the Manhattan project did, mobilizing thousands of scientists, $2 billion, and massive plants to do the hard work of separating fissile U-235 and Plutonium from natural uranium. Bureaucratic confusion and balky precision engineering made the task anything but easy. The other powers pursued the bomb. The British sent over their best to help with the Manhattan project. Germany's team, lead by Heisenberg, never had the necessary priority in the Reich, and were stalled by clever British-Norwegian sabotage directed at a heavy water production facility required for the Nazi reactor design. Japan never had access to the raw material to move beyond theory.The last section is grimmer yet. The design of the bomb was an exercise in precision, in delicately engineered explosive lenses to make the implosion to critical mass happen smoothly in nanoseconds. Tibbetts' B-29 bomber group trained to a razor's edge to accomplish the mission of deploying the 'gadget'. Roosevelt, on approving the Manhattan project, had instinctively reserved the bomb to himself as President. In 1945, Vice President Truman had not been read into the project until he succeeded to the presidency. The bomb was used on Hiroshima because it could be, because the Japanese still resisted, and because something had to be shown for the effort invested. It was a crime, a mass-murder in an instant. Rhodes does not flinch from the horror of Hiroshima.Personally, I think we need to distinguish between the bomb's use at the end of the Second World War, where it seems a matter of degree compared to area bombing rather than kind, and its use now, where that would signal breaking the nuclear taboo. This does not absolve the scientists who built the bomb of their responsibility. Nature's secrets were all around, and once fission had been theorized it was probably only a matter of time before someone figured out how to make it work, but these people made a choice to build Death a supersonic jet bomber to replicate his tired old horse. The Making of the Atomic Bomb is a penetrating look at the most consequential scientific and political moment of the 20th century. I'd give it six stars, if I could. It is also my 1000th review on Goodreads!"

95,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2209582-ross,3,"This is an exhaustive history of the bombs development., some 900 pages. The first half deals with the fundamental physics that makes nuclear weapons possible. The remainder deals with the actual development.My previous understanding of the bomb history stemmed from a movie some 20 years ago. In this film Albert Einstein perceives the potential for the bomb based on his famous equationE=MC squared. He quickly contacts President Roosevelt and FDR assigns a General Groves to develop the bomb ASAP in order to end the war.The actual truth is almost unbelievable.In the late 1930’s physicists in Europe realize that the fission of uranium can be used to make a bomb. Most of these scientists are Jews and they flee Hitler to the U.S. terrified that Germany will develop the bomb. Using what connections they can they approach officers separately in the U.S. army and navy. In both instances they are laughed at. Now more terrified than ever they approach Einstein, hoping his prestige can get word of the danger to someone in power. Einstein actually does have a contact that knows FDR and a letter from Einstein, actually written by our refugee physicists, is taken to the White House and read to FDR. The President seems impressed and says he will act on it. What he actually does is assign a bureaucrat in the Department of Standards to look into this thing. The bureaucrat now puts the letter in his safe and does nothing. It never occurs to FDR to follow-up on what is being done.Meanwhile the Germans and British are working on development and the British think the U.S. is also working on it A year later Churchill concerned about what the U.S. is doing sends a delegation over to discuss the project. They are horrified to find nothing is being done. A lot of screaming and yelling now takes place and finally General Groves is assigned.More than a year had been lost and we are very lucky today that we don’t have to speak German."
96,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7226831-josh-friedlander,5,"An epic topic, perhaps the epic topic, matched by a book epic in scope and detail. Rhodes starts off at the beginning of 20th century understanding of the atom, going into intricate detail about the lives of Bohr, Rutherford, Szilard, et al. He seems equally happy talking about Kierkegaard's Either/Or philosophy, the Pacific Theatre, or the intricacies of isolating Uranium-235. There's a lot of science in this book - I googled a lot but still felt like I missed enough to justify a second reading sometime - and some coverage of the effects of the bomb, the moral concerns of the scientists and politicians involved in its deployment, and the state of today's world. Rhodes wrote this book in the mid-1980s, but of course, the great, numbing, existential threat of the bomb still looms over us today; even if we think of it less."
97,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14945161-sandy-maguire,5,"Amazing book. The first act is a fantastic set of tableaus about the physicists and progression of science necessary to discover the capabilities of the atom. The second act is somewhat dry, regarding mostly the politicking necessary to have made the bomb happen, but there is some decent engineering spliced in here and there. The third is about the war effort, the Trinity test, and the eventual dropping of the bomb. The last chapter is horrifying and not something I'd describe as the feel-good read of the year, but it helps to drive home just how terrible these things are.I would strongly recommend this book to everyone."
98,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76660175-stephen-clare,5,"An astonishing book, dense as lead and explosive as plutonium. It's 800+ pages of tiny text, but there's not a superfluous sentence to be found. Just a staggering amount of information. And no wonder - this book is a textbook of physics in the first half of the 20th century, a case study of the relationship between science and war (and scientists and soldiers), and a history of the rising tolerability of mass civilian slaughter, combined with multiple biographies of some of history's most characteristic scientists.The climax of the book from Trinity to Nagasaki is awesome, cinematic, and chilling. This is a serious investment, but well worth your time."

Like, uber. Not just an exhaustive regarding the scientific aspects, but the social, political and wartime factors that contributed and led up to the creation of the most destructive weapon ever conceived. Even ample knowledge of the personal lives of the scientists involved is conveyed. There is so much about the development of the bomb that I certainly wasn't aware of and I would venture to say that most people aren't. How close that the Nazi's were to developing their own nuclear device, and the fact that the Japanese were actively researching their own atomic bomb. Overall, its good. Very good. But if you're more broadly interested in the history of the nuke... this book might drive you insane. Its hardcore. Also this book stops directly after the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the surrender of Japan, which seems a shame. So much of interest happens in the next several years, including the development of thermonuclear bomb technology (which is conceptually covered in the book), USSR espionage contributing to their own bomb development and the first stages of the arms race."

While it didn't change my mind about nuclear weapons, it did a lot to deepen my thinking about them.

103,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6871223-aaron-million,4,"Richard Rhodes' monumental undertaking here is both admirable and daunting at the same time. As one might expect, the story of the development of the atomic bomb, and of atomic power in general, does not occur overnight and does not involved just a few individuals. It evolves over decades of often pain-staking work done by scientists who span a wide range of nationalities, specialties, opinions, and motivations. As such, a thorough job requires a lot of work – both for Rhodes and for the reader. Not being well-versed in science, and especially in physics, the sections containing detailed discussions of neutrons, electrons, atomic elements, chain reactions, volts, etc... were not the easiest for me to absorb. But that is due to my limited capacity to understand those things, not to Rhodes' writing or researching skills. In fact, he is not just writing for a scientific audience, but for a general audience. Thus, he cannot delve too far into the weeds of nuclear physics without losing quite a few people. But he cannot, at the same time, brush past very important discoveries and experiments. He does an admirable job of finding middle ground: not too detailed to discourage readers, but not superficial enough to upset scientists who understand these advanced topics. Almost as much of a struggle as the scientific aspect, is the difficulty in keeping all of the main characters (and there is no shortage of these) straight. So many people provided significant contributions to the development of the bomb: scientifically, politically, militarily, economically, that the names start to run together at a certain point. In addition, especially throughout the first half of the book, the scientists are from several different (mainly European) countries, and thus their work is taking place in many different laboratories in different cities. Just remembering which nationality someone is can be difficult at times. This is not a criticism of Rhodes; he could not begin to tell the story without all of these people being in it. But it is something to note for the general reader, especially someone who is unfamiliar with most chemists and physicists aside from Albert Einstein, who plays a minor, but pivotal, role in this drama. The most riveting chapter had to do with the actual dropping of the first atomic bomb, over Hiroshima, Japan on August 6, 1945. Rhodes, as he does throughout the book, allows the people involved in the story to explain their thoughts and feelings as much as possible. In this chapter, the remembrances of Japanese who survived the atomic attack are difficult to read. A sample, from page 722, the description by a thirty-year-old woman of encountering a dead person: “The corpse lying on its back on the road had been killed immediately.... Its hand was lifted to the sky and the fingers were burning with blue flames. The fingers were shortened to one-third and distorted. A dark liquid was running to the ground along the hand.” These types of horrible description go on for several pages. Rhodes does not do this to make a moral statement about the U.S. Dropping the bomb on Japan; in fact, he also notes that the Japanese leaders must share some of the blame as their desperate fighting, literally to the death, undoubtedly contributed to Harry Truman's decision to authorize the bombing. But instead he includes the morbid accounts so as the drive home the total devastation and utter ruin that the A-bomb brought into the world. As he accurately states, the bomb did not just destroy thousands of lives, but it completely wiped out an entire city. Rhodes concludes with a forty page Afterword, primarily focusing on the development of the “Super” (or H) bomb. Towards the end, he delves into a philosophic discussion about nation-states, nuclear policy and control, and warfare. While certainly relevant, after reading the preceding chapters detailing the creation of the bomb, it dropping on Japan, the immediate effects upon its people, and all of the political tugs of war in Los Alamos, NM and Washington, this reads as an anti-climax. This is not to say that it does not belong in the book. But rather, the discussion would have been enhanced by some capsules about what all of the various scientists went on to do following WWII. Los Alamos Director Robert Oppenheimer, as an example, had a painful life – both literally and figuratively – through the 1950s and up to his death in 1967. But Rhodes does not choose to mention any of Oppenheimer's travails. Still, it is hard to see how a more complete and accurate depiction of this world-changing event could be told. "
104,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6431984-antonio-rojas,5,"Monumental and Breathtaking!Is a breathtaking journey through the history of nuclear physics and the development of Atomic Theory. It is a masterpiece where Mr. Rhodes regales us with his gift for presenting difficult and intricate concepts in a very logical, insightful, colorful, and above all entertaining fashion.Loosely speaking, the first part of the book covers the key steps that carved the foundations of atomic theory: we get to witness J.J. Thompson discovering the electron; Ernest Rutherford realizing the existence of the nucleus and postulating his “Solar System” model of the atom; Niels Bohr, with a little help from spectroscopy improving that model and carving his more realistic Shell and Orbital design; Chadwick stalking and finally uncovering the neutron; Henri Becquerel and the Curies discovering radioactivity; Heisenberg working his Uncertainty Principle, Schrodinger developing wave mechanics, Pauli his Exclusion Principle. In addition, we become familiar with de Hevesy, John von Neumann, Wigner, Dirac, Millikan, Max Born, Arnold Sommerfeld, Paul Ehrenfest, in summary, all the big architects of Quantum Mechanics and modern physics. But what makes the book a truly superior piece is that Mr. Rhodes, while impeccably describing the science, he submerges the reader into the very personal and complex psychology of each of the characters and the historic context of the time. We see each of these great scientists come to life and wander through history in front of our eyes immersed in the chaotic social and military storm that surrounded the cataclysmic days of the First and Second World Wars.The second part of the book deals more specifically with the creation and the political steps leading to the use of the first atomic bombs on civilian populations by the United States government. We get to see Leo Szilard, the true brain behind the first idea of the atomic bomb and the first to conceptualize the science behind it and its potential consequences; we see Otto Hahn splitting the atom without realizing it and Lise Meitner and Otto Freisch interpreting and using for the first time the term “fission” to name the event; Enrico Fermi “slowing neutrons” and creating a sustained chain reaction; Wigner creating plutonium and enriching uranium; all of this, leading triumphantly to Los Alamos where we witness Edward Teller, Luis Alvarez, Hans Bethe, Lawrence and above all, Robert Oppenheimer, “I am become death, the destroyer of worlds”, where they orchestrated the biggest human effort and enterprise ever achieved: the ability to create the means of our own destruction. Mr. Rhodes cold and non-judgmental recompilation of first hand witnesses and victims of the explosions is both pathetic and truly horrifying. The harrowing images of children aimlessly wandering and holding strips of their own skin, women without feet walking on their ankles, or a man holding his eye in one hand create an infernal motion picture in our brain whose memory is very hard if not impossible to forget. At 790 comprehensive pages excluding Notes, Bibliography, Photo Credits and Index -886 in total- The Making of the Atomic Bomb is a monumental achievement that deserves all the accolades and awards it has gathered through the years. This book is a veritable must read, a must have, a classic."
105,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/204112-damon,5,"Richard Rhodes does a very impressive job of telling how we got to the atomic bomb. He starts in 1900 when Plank looked into a black box and found a new world. The Making of the Atomic Bomb explores the science that makes the bomb possible, the scientist who worked in breaking the atom, the politics which made people want to do it. In doing so it becomes one of the best introductions to quantum mechanics for the laymen. Much better than other books that try to join mysticism and science, Rhodes goes though, in prose, the basics of quantum mechanics and the people who made it. He has also not shy away from using the scientists metaphors to describe the world of the very small (Rutherford's cannon ball is one of the best), nor does he shy away from explaining the concepts that make the bomb possible, like why natural uranium does not explode and why plutonium is much better than uranium. Rhodes also provides a sense a drama the scientist and engineers in New Mexico start to build the bomb. When the first one is exploded, the reader feels a sense of achievement and pride at what man has wrought. And like all good writers, Rhodes is does not let us off the hook, the last portion of the book is a detailed description of the casualties of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The descriptions of the flash burn victims whose blacked, blistered skin peeled off their body exposing the muscle underneath is more than enough for anyone to appreciate Oppenheimer's quote: I am the creator, I am the destroyer.

Yes, it is very long. Yes, the narrative can feel a bit jumpy, especially in the first half. There are a lot of names being used, some of which never re-appear, and a lot of seemingly minor scientific experiments detailed exhaustively. And yes, Rhodes dedicates many pages to discussions that do not feel very relevant in 2013, but were very much so when it was written in the mid-80s and the idea that Russia might nuke us was not very far removed.But all of these elements come together in incredible fashion when the book builds up to moments of great importance: the confirmation of the splitting of the atom; the first self-sustaining nuclear reactor in Chicago; the attack on Pearl Harbor; the Trinity test; the dropping of Little Boy over Hiroshima. These sections are written beautifully and effectively convey the excitement and the historical ramifications. They would not be the same without all of the comprehensive background that is given beforehand, and it is hard to imagine this book being edited down very much.Strongly recommended to anybody with an interest in the bomb, or World War II in general."

There's much more. Rhodes, gifted with sharp psychological insight and a novelist's ability to convey character, reveals the personalities and emotional dynamics among the scientists and others responsible for conceiving, engineering, testing and ultimately dropping the apocalyptic devices on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In addition he describes the struggle in Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan to make the first bomb, as well as the political and military events that led inexorably to the destruction of the Japanese cities.

Other books I read on the subject were very dry and boring, but this book holds your attention, even though it is a long book. If you like Cold War history and 20th century history, this book is a must read. How it actually all came together was so complex, it’s a miracle that it happened at all.I read this book back in 1988, just before I joined the Air Force.

115,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/941349-bob,5,"This is an extraordinary work, one of the finest nonfiction books I've ever read. Its breadth and depth of coverage are incredible. It is engagingly written, truly a book hard to put down. It is full of wonderful anecdotes and photographs. The book is a chronological account of the science, engineering, and politics that created the atomic bomb. It is basically in four parts: physics from around 1880 to 1938, physics from 1939 to 1943, engineering and politics from 1941 to 1945, and the postwar aftermath up to around 1955. The first two parts are largely in Europe, the third and fourth mostly in the US. I was not prepared for the depth of coverage of the period from about 1880 to 1938. It is marvelous story, an epic of human achievement well told. I started out in college as a physics major, so I was familiar with the broad outline of this, and many of the names were familiar. In spite of that, I learned an enormous amount. The book wisely keeps the focus on the people, and succeeds wonderfully in making us feel we know them, at least the major players. In summarizing the book, it's hard to know where to start; Rhodes must have felt the same thing. By 1890 or so it was known that there were tiny particles called electrons that were negatively charged, and that the chemical elements were defined by how many electrons were in each atom. Since atoms are neutral, there must be a corresponding positive charge in each atom, but where? For a while it was thought that the positive charge was a sort of smeared out substrate, like the dough in a muffin, with the electrons stuck in it like blueberries. This was disproven (making a long story short) by Ernest Rutherford, New Zealand born British physicist, a poor boy who grew up on a farm. He showed that the positive charge lies in a ""nucleus"", a very small dense center of the atom, with the electrons much farther out, sort of orbiting around like the planets in the solar system. It wasn't long before the proton was discovered, and the fact that the nucleus contains the same number of protons as there are electrons in the outer shell. It was also not long before it was realized that the planetary analogy would not hold. According to the very well established electromagnetic theory of James Clerk Maxwell, the electrons would simply spiral into the nucleus and the atom would cease to exist. Yet the evidence for protons and the nucleus was undeniable. But the electromagnetic theory of Maxwell was extremely highly regarded. In fact Einstein had just used it (1905) to develop the theory of relativity, also highly regarded. What is the explanation? The explanation is most important development in physics since Newton: quantum theory. Quantum theory began with Max Plank and Einstein around 1890-1900, but really got going after 1915 with the work of Niels Bohr, Erwin Schroedinger, Werner Heisenberg and P. A. M. Dirac. Rhodes does not talk too much about quantum theory itself. He manages to keep the focus on nuclear physics. However, he does point out an essential lesson of quantum theory: light is both a wave and a particle. These seemingly contradictory notions exist at the same time in one thing. Bohr came to call this paraodox-that-is-not-a-paradox ""complementarity."" This abstract idea is important later. Of the four names above, two are extremely significant in the story of the atom bomb: Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg. Bohr was born in Denmark in 1885, so was half a generation younger than Rutherford. He explained the atom by showing how the electrons stayed in well defined ""shells"" rather than orbits like planets. Heisenberg, a German, was half a generation younger yet, born in 1901. He and Schroedinger made huge breakthroughs in the 1920s showing that Bohr's model was still not right. Meanwhile, before 1900, Marie and Pierre Curie had discovered radioactivity. Some elements, notably radium and uranium, decomposed with time by ejecting nuclear particles and becoming lighter elements. Eventually (long story cut short) it was realized that the particles being ejected are often ""neutrons"", the last of the three basic particles to be discovered (James Chadwick, 1932). Neutrons live in the nucleus with protons and seem to be a sort of glue holding the nucleus together.  The first phase of the story ends and the second begins in 1939 with the realization by Otto Hahn, Lise Meitner, and her nephew Otto Frisch that a nucleus could be fractured or split by a neutron being ejected from another atom. The first atom might split into two much lighter atoms -- fission -- and eject two or more neutrons, which could in turn hit and split yet more atoms -- a chain reaction. This was a revolutionary idea, quickly understood by Bohr, who carried the news to the US. Soon, scientists in the US, England, Germany, and Japan (yes Japan) were asking themselves, could this chain reaction become a bomb? Meanwhile, of course, was the hugely important rise of Nazi Germany. Many scientists, especially the Jewish ones, fled Germany by 1939. Meitner fled to Sweden in 1938. Frisch fled to England. Bohr (with only one grandparent Jewish) was at first relatively safe in Denmark, and could travel to England and back, but eventually had to flee to Sweden in 1943. Einstein was long since at Princeton. But, as Rhodes explains, many others, who are not household words, fled Nazi Europe and became key players in the saga of the atomic bomb. Among these are Stanislaw Ulam from Poland, Hans Bethe from Germany, and the Hungarian trio of Leo Szilard, Eugene Wigner, and Edward Teller, all of whom came to the US. All played significant roles in the story of the bomb; Szilard and Teller became big actors in the story. Similarly, physicists were fleeing Italy, including Enrico Fermi and Emilio Segre. The second part of the story surges into high gear with the developments in physics showing that a bomb could really work. In England, Chadwick assembled a group that included Frisch and Rudolf Peierls, recently fled from Germany. It became known as the MAUD committee. Frisch and Peierls produced the Frisch–Peierls memorandum, which was the first document to detail how an atomic explosion could be generated. Bohr soon learned about it, as he was also in England. Long story cut short, a bomb could be made from uranium-235 or from plutonium. Uranium occurs rather commonly in nature, but over 99% of it is the form called 238, abbreviated U-238. You can't make a bomb from that, though you can use it for a nuclear reactor. If enough of the much more radioactive U-235 is gotten together in the right way, a bomb will result. Plutonium does not occur in nature and was first synthesized by Glenn Seaborg in the US in 1940. It is also radioactive enough to make a bomb. About the same time, in 1940 Heisenberg began to understand that uranium 235 could make a bomb. Heisenberg did not like Hitler, but he had no Jewish ancestors and no compelling reason to leave Germany. He was asked by the German army to investigate uses of uranium. Rhodes says that Heisenberg thought that the process of actually getting together enough U-235 would be too expensive and difficult, and that is why the German atomic bomb project never got anywhere. In 2000, Thomas Powers published a book called Heisenberg's War in which he claims that Heisenberg deliberately stalled the German atomic bomb project so that Hitler would never have the bomb. It remains controversial, but Rhodes (writing in 1987) does not talk much about Heisenberg. Nonetheless, the British and Bohr assumed that the Germans would understand everything that they did, and would certainly be doing bomb research. This key idea, that the allies must keep up with the Germans, is the start of the third part of the saga, the engineering and political story of the actual making of the bomb. Americans were working too. Already in 1939, Hungarian emigre Leo Szilard realized that fission could be used to make a nuclear reactor and possibly a bomb. Szilard had known Einstein years before; in fact in 1926 they had patented a refrigerator! He became almost obsessed with the idea that President Roosevelt must understand the threat of the Germans having a bomb. In July 1939, Szilard and Wigner drove to Long Island, where Einstein was staying (how they found him is an interesting story). They convinced Einstein to write the now famous letter to FDR urging that the matter be given the highest priority. FDR was impressed, but it took more than one letter. That's a long story; read the book!  Eventually, especially after the Americans learned of the British MAUD committee work, a high level committee was formed to begin the research and manufacture of a bomb. The leaders of this committee were Vannevar Bush, James Conant, and Arthur Compton. Vannevar Bush (no relation to the presidents Bush) was an older engineer, a longtime influential person in the highest levels of academe and government. James Conant was a chemist and the president of Harvard. Arthur Compton had won the Nobel prize in physics in 1927. All of these people are fleshed out wonderfully in Rhodes's book. The big question for the Americans, as it was for the Germans and Japanese, was could the enormous effort to produce the bomb pay off in time for World War II? First, why ""enormous effort""? As Niels Bohr said around 1940, to actually make such a bomb would take half of the industrial apparatus of the United States for two years. This turned out to be only a modest overstatement. Producing enough U-235 was a huge task. Many tons of uranium ore would have to be processed to produce U-238, then a huge painstaking process (invention of Ernest Lawrence) would have to follow. (The Japanese realized this too, and abandoned the atomic bomb as impractical.) Eventually, processing U-235 was done at the Oak Ridge site in Tennessee, a gigantic complex. The alternative was to use plutonium. Plutonium can be created with a nuclear reactor at lesser cost. However, in 1942 no one was sure how to make a bomb out of plutonium, as it is almost too good. If a critical mass is not brought together VERY promptly, it would ""fizzle"", yielding an explosion scarcely any better than chemical bombs. The atomic bomb, of course, is a hundred thousand times better than that. The decision in the US was to do both approaches, to use both U-235 and plutonium. Plutonium was manufactured at another huge new facility, the Hanford Plant in Washington state. These two plants provided the ""brawn"" for the making of the atomic bomb, and employed thousands of people. But the ""brain"" was the third brand new facility built from scratch, the Los Alamos laboratory in New Mexico. This brings us at last to two of the most important names in this subject, Robert Oppenheimer and Leslie Groves. Robert Oppenheimer was born in New York in 1904, the son of a wealthy Jewish importer. With his rather privileged upbringing, Robert had spent some summers in the high plateaus in northern New Mexico. (Photos of the young Oppenheimer look remarkably like Bob Dylan.) I'll skip over his background in physics and how he came to the attention of the Bush committee, but it was decided to put him in overall charge of the construction of the atomic bomb. This was soon given the name Manhattan Project. Based on Oppenheimer's recommendation, a boys' school at Los Alamos was purchased, along with a hundred square miles of surrounding land. Colonel Leslie Groves was appointed the military leader of the project, who technically was above Oppenheimer. Rhodes does a wonderful job sketching how their relationship evolved. In short, both Oppenheimer and Groves did a wonderful job.  Rhodes' description of the building of the Los Alamos lab and the recruiting of the scientists and their families is perhaps the best part of this uniformly excellent book. The big names came, as well as many unknown today and many who later became famous. Enrico Fermi (who had created the first nuclear reactor in history in Chicago), Segre, Frisch, Bohr, Richard Feynman, Ulam, Lawrence, Seaborg, Bethe, two of Fermi's proteges Leona Woods and Herbert Anderson, Peierls and his colleague Klaus Fuchs from England. All of these went on to distinguished careers in the following decades. (more about Klaus Fuchs later.) Security was tight. Not all could take it. Edward Condon, a physicist ironically born in Alamogordo NM, resigned after six weeks: ""The thing which upsets me the most is the extraordinary close security policy.... In my case I found that the extreme concern with security was morbidly depressing -- especially the censoring mail and telephone calls."" Much later he was the target of the House Un-American Activities Committee because he was a ""follower"" of a ""new revolutionary movement"", quantum mechanics!  To make a long story short again, perhaps the biggest problem they solved at Los Alamos was the plutonium bomb. As mentioned above, the key is to force a critical mass of plutonium into a very small volume very quickly, to harness the vast number of neutrons released in the chain reaction. A young physicist named Seth Neddermeyer had the key idea: implosion. That means, arrange a group of ordinary explosives around a hollow sphere of plutonium. Set off the explosives at the same time and they will compress the plutonium into critical mass. This is easier said than done, and besides Neddermeyer the person who made it work was George Kistiakowsky, an ordinance expert. Implosion is not necessary in a U-235 bomb, but, as mentioned above, plutonium is easier to manufacture. There is one strong lesson from all of this: it is very hard to build an atomic bomb! Good! One more physics topic before we get to the more political aspects. The idea of using the energy from a fission bomb (uranium or plutonium atomic bomb) to initiate a fusion reaction (hydrogen bomb) was first proposed casually by Enrico Fermi to Edward Teller in the fall of 1941. Teller latched onto it and made it his ""baby"" until the first hydrogen bomb was detonated in 1952. During the war years at Los Alamos he insisted on working on it even though most of the others said to let it go until after the war. He was vindicated when it did indeed unleash 1000 times more energy than the atomic bombs. To quickly wrap up this phase, the Manhattan project succeeded in producing two plutonium bombs (the one tested in the New Mexico desert and one that fell on Nagasaki) and one U-235 bomb, the one that fell on Hiroshima. Now to the 500 pound gorilla in the room: was all this necessary? Was it morally correct to build and use the bomb, killing 130,000 people? The physicists who worked on the bomb did so almost entirely to make sure that the Allies would not be behind the Germans, who they felt sure were working on an atomic bomb. Many, perhaps half, of those physicists, had escaped Nazi persecution. This was a real and palpable threat to them. I do not see how anyone can argue with that. But did any of them see farther into the future? One especially did so: Niels Bohr. If reading this book will do nothing else, it will make you respect Niels Bohr. Already in 1943, as Los Alamos was just being built, Bohr was looking ahead to a post-war world with atomic weapons. He was terrified at the idea. He held no illusions that we in the US could keep the weapon for ourselves. Once successfully demonstrated, he had no doubt that the Soviet Union could build one in a few years. Indeed, he assumed they were already aware of the Manhattan Project. His solution was radical openness, his ""principle of complementarity."" Recall that this is the phrase he used twenty years earlier to grasp the apparently contradictory notions of quantum mechanics.  Complementarity means that the atomic bomb is a two-edged sword. On the one hand it is a terrible weapon, having the potential to unleash horrific suffering. On the other hand, since governments will realize that, they will be forced to not use it, to try much harder than ever to maintain peace. To help this along, he wanted the US to not only make it clear to everyone that the Manhattan Project was going on, he wanted the US to share everything we learned. He wanted in essence to give away the blueprints (not to the Germans during the war of course), that we would in this way generate enormous good will.  Making a long story short, in 1944 he gained personal audiences with both FDR and Churchill to push this idea. FDR was sympathetic. Churchill was appalled, to the extent that he wanted Bohr arrested. When FDR and Churchill met later in 1944, Churchill prevailed against the already enfeebled FDR, and that was the end of Bohr's far reaching vision. At least, he was not arrested. What about the idea that dropping the bombs on Japan was unnecessary, that the death toll was unprecedented? Rhodes points out that at least the second half of this statement is incorrect. There were already horrific bombings and killings. We all know about the holocaust, but many people today don't seem to know about the German executions of at least 500,000 prisoners in Russia, or the terrible murders and rapes that the Japanese perpetrated in China, which killed 150,000 civilians, or the Battle of Britain, in which the English lost 40,000, or the Dresden fire bombing that killed 25,000, or the Tokyo fire bombing in which 334 B29 bombers killed 90,000 people. The death toll from Hiroshima and Nagasaki was absolutely not unprecedented. Most Americans who lived through those years think that the atomic bombs ended the war and saved several hundred thousand American lives, and probably 500,000 Japanese. A few comments on the fourth phase of this book, the postwar period: Klaus Fuchs, mentioned above, was a Russian spy. He served nine years in prison in England, later emigrated to East Germany. Rhodes never mentions Julius or Ethel Rosenberg. I find that a bit odd. Oppenheimer had married a woman who had been a member of the communist party. This caused him trouble in 1941, but he was appointed to Los Alamos in spite of it. After the war, he had a very good career at Berkeley and Princeton. In 1949 he lost his security clearance because of his prewar communist sympathies, and because of the struggle with Edward Teller, who was championing the building of the hydrogen bomb. Oppenheimer was seen by the scientific community as a martyr to McCarthyism. He came to represent the struggle between right-wing militarists (symbolized by Teller) and left-wing intellectuals (symbolized by Oppenheimer) over the moral question of nuclear bombs.  To wrap up this already long review, let's return once more to the question of should the US have dropped the bombs on Japan. I will let Leona Woods have the last word. She later went on to a long career as a physicist:  ""I certainly do recall how I felt when the atomic bombs were used. My brother-in-law was captain of the first minesweeper. My brother was a Marine on Okinawa. I'm sure they would not have lasted in an invasion. It was clear the war would continue, with half a million of our fighting men dead not to say how many Japanese. You know and I know that [we] firebombed Tokyo and nobody even mentions the slaughter that happened then. They think Nagasaki and Hiroshima were something [very bad] compared to the firebombing. THEY'RE WRONG! I have no regrets. I think we did right, and we couldn't have done it differently. Yeah, I know it has been suggested the second bomb, Nagasaki, was not necessary. ... when you are in a war, to the death, I don't think you stand around and ask, Is it right?' """
116,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85753449-pritam-chattopadhyay,4,"In the foreword to this extremely interesting book, the author writes: The closing days of the Second World War marked a similar turning point in human history, the point of entry into a new era when humankind for the first time acquired the means of its own destruction. The discovery of how to release nuclear energy, and its application to build weapons of mass destruction, has gradually removed the prejudice on which total war is based: the insupportable conviction that there is a limited amount of energy available in the world to concentrate into explosives, that it is possible to accumulate more of such energy than one’s enemies and thereby militarily to prevail. So cheap, so portable, so holocaustal did nuclear weapons eventually become that even nation-states as belligerent as the Soviet Union and the United States preferred to sacrifice a portion of their national sovereignty—preferred to forego the power to make total war—rather than be destroyed in their fury.First published in 1986, this scrupulously researched and broad narrative by Richard Rhodes is the author’s ultimate account, tracing the expansion of the world’s eventual apocalyptic weapon from its origins as a problem in theoretical physics to its devastating culmination at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The book, at the same time, is also a chronicle of the personalities and greatest minds of the 20th century—especially Robert Oppenheimer, Niels Bohr, Leo Szilard, Enrico Fermi, Edward Teller, and Ernest Lawrence — and their inputs to developing the atomic bomb. Rhodes describes exhaustively the great scientific achievements that led up to the invention of the atomic bomb. Everything of importance is examined, from the discovery of the atomic nucleus and of nuclear fission to the emergence of quantum physics, the invention of the mass-spectroscope and of the cyclotron, the creation of such man-made elements as plutonium and tritium, and implementation of the nuclear chain reaction in uranium. Even more important, Rhodes shows how these achievements were thrust into the arms of the state, which culminated in the unfolding of the nuclear arms race. Often brilliantly, he records the rise of fascism and of anti-Semitism, and the intensification of nationalist ambitions. He traces the outbreak of WW II, which provoked a hysterical rivalry among nations to devise the bomb.Rhodes does a brilliant job in explaining the Manhattan Project, with a host of elements on everything from laboratory experiments to training of bombing pilots.The author prophetically observes : I think of a world without nuclear weapons not as a utopian dream but simply as a world where delivery times have been deliberately lengthened to months or even years, with correspondingly longer periods interim during which to resolve disputes short of war. In such a world, if negotiations fail, if conventional skirmishes fail, if both sides revert to arming themselves with nuclear weapons again—then at worst we will only arrive once more at the dangerous precipice where we all stand now.The discovery of how to release nuclear energy, like all fundamental scientific discoveries, changed the structure of human affairs—permanently.How that happened is the story this book attempts to tell."
117,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5672051-brahm,5,"The Making of the Atomic Bomb in audiobook form is just over 37 hours (the book clocks in at 900 pages). It was an immense history of EVERYTHING connected to the atomic weapons program, starting with a great chapter on the ancient philosophy of science, to primers on chemistry and physics, to the evolution of weapons of mass destruction including horrific WWI gas weapons, to post-WWI European politics, to stories of individual scientists and their cumulative discoveries, to stories of the supply chain and secret politics that had to be developed to feed the US atomic weapons program. The book converges to, and ends immediately after the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The Making of the Atomic Bomb was immense, powerful, and comprehensive. I loved the technical depth and the personal stories of the scientists and other actors involved. It feels like I just finished a University course. The pace of scientific discovery in the late 1930s is nothing short of amazing, and the scientists are such interesting characters. In the final chapter, the first-hand accounts of the immediate aftermath of Hiroshima and Nagasaki are graphic and deeply disturbing. It's a big change in tone; you invest hours and hours reading/listening about scientific, political, industrial and engineering progress, making it difficult to face the gut-wrenching, violent outcome. Better understanding of atomic theory and history, but mostly the consequences of nuclear weapons leaves me feeling unsettled over the range and number of nuclear weapons that exist today. They're in the background; we don't think about them. I didn't ever seriously consider or understand the physical damage these weapons can cause, OR the political consequences (ie, the world is locked in an eternal standoff of nuclear powers, even if we don't hear it on the news every day). The audiobook was narrated by Holter Graham. I am brand-new to audiobooks, but I thought it was exceptionally well read. I wonder if dense books are especially well-suited to audiobooks, as a bit of inflection and tone by a careful narrator can really bring a serious, technical and/or dense material to life. "
118,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3816725-larry-bassett,3,"I have to thank audible books for allowing me to actually experience this book. I am pretty sure I never would’ve gotten through even the first half of the book without the help of a skilled reader. I would give the first half of the book 2 stars and the last half of the book 4 stars does arriving at the medium of three stars. The first half or more of the book is way too complicated for my simple science knowledge. It might be very interesting to someone more versed in physics. It goes into great detail about 19th century and early 20th century physics discoveries and it is indefatigable in naming names! Way beyond my ability to compute.The second half of a book is exceedingly more interesting story for the average reader. Some of it you will of heard before but some of the inside stories of the relationships of the scientists Was new information to me. The relationship between science and engineering is something that I am not familiar with. A lot of the story about the development of theory and experimentation. And then an implementation is fascinating. The expansion and development of this $2 billion project beginning with essentially vacant ground in los Alamos and Hartford and Tennessee was very well documented. In the entire book there are about 2600 footnotes. Thank goodness the audible reading skips over those. At the end of the Kindle book there are many photographs of the many characters that appear in starring and supporting roles.I am not sure what the major takeaways of this book are. There is a fair amount of discussion about the debate about the good and evil of the atomic bomb. There was considerable hope among scientists that the bomb might force us to create a world of peace. There was of course some dissension about the use of the bomb but it is clear that once the bomb was created, there was no doubt that it would be used.There are many more pages about the horror of the injuries and deaths in Hiroshima then where necessary. We have read those pages too often. The fact that they were literally getting a third Byam ready when JAPAN finally surrendered is not something I have heard about previously. The argument about the bomb saving American lives was pretty well implanted in this book."
119,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56863096-jeremy,4,"Excellently told history of the incredible story of the development of the atomic bomb. Rhodes starts with some of the history of modern physics as it relates to different developments that led to the bomb, including the scientists. It was great to see Niels Bohr get his proper due; he commonly seems to be overlooked, at least among the general public, as one of the most important scientists in history (though he wasn't directly involved in the Manhattan Project). The science throughout this book is quite thorough and complex. After a while I gave up trying to see if I could follow it. While I appreciate that this book is trying to be comprehensive, for my taste he could have backed off the science a little bit. That said, the feat was incredible, and it is equally incredible that a chain reaction of splitting atoms can create such enormous destructive power.The last third or so of the book was exciting, as we got a behind the scenes look at the political and scientific progress towards the inevitable, and a front row seat to the first test of an atomic bomb. Rhodes spends some time in Hiroshima describing the awful outcome of the bomb in all its brutal reality. I was unaware that the Japanese would have potentially surrendered conditionally, but the US was demanding unconditional surrender. There were a number of prescient voices, Bohr's included, that understood what nuclear weapons meant for the world, a threat we must all now live with. Many of those working on the project experienced the cognitive dissonance of being successful with their work, and the fact that it meant terrible death and destruction for innocent lives, and changed the world forever."
120,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63879552-sebastian,5,"BLUF:There are not many books I would recommend more whole-heartedly. Just read it.Details:This is the story of science, industry, and politics, and how humanity went from wondering about structure of the atom in 1910 to dropping exploding balls of plutonium over Japan in 1945.We begin with bunch of European physicists who in the 1920s and 30s, discover the nature of the atom: Rutherford in England discovering the nucleus in 1911, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle in 1926, the Bohr model, Chadwick's discovery of the neutron in 1932, Fermi's 1934 experiments with neutron bombardment in Rome, and finally Otto Hahn and Lise Meitner publishing on nuclear fission in 1938. Rhodes paints a picture of a world of perhaps 100 physicists who knew each other personally and moved around frequently to collaborate for short periods of time. I wonder how funding worked (when Oppenheimer does research at Cavendish, or similar -- were do the dollars come from?) but no-one seems to worry about grants. Another thing that struck me was how broad some of these scientists were. Einstein and Szilard take a couple years off particle physics to study refrigeration in the 1930s. It's interesting to thing about this period of rapid progress against the example of Bell Labs. Common elements seem to be freedom from funding and publishing concerns, and a degree of flexibility in field of study. Unlike Bell, they aren't as commercially-focused although there is a goal that everyone is working against at least implicitly to map the structure of the atom. Also, Bohr is this convener and hub for the physicists, and I'm not sure a similar figure existed at Bell Labs.1938 is a pivotal year. Hahn / Meitner's write up on fission makes it clear to everyone that a fission chain reaction could power a new source of energy -- or a powerful new weapon. All of the fun of science and discovery takes on new meaning when our science Bund discovers their knowledge could be used for destructive ends. Hitler's Anschluss absorbs Austria and persecution of Jews in Germany begins.* Bohr heroically rounds up as many Jewish scientists as he can and whisks them off to Denmark; Szilard in the UK helps get more to England and the US.The war begins and scientists relocate the United States. Szilard, Einstein, and others (""The Hungarian Conspiracy"") attempt to educate military leadership and Roosevelt himself of the destructive power of the bomb. Eventually they do succeed and the great INDUSTRIAL project of the atomic bomb begins. I went in to the book thinking that Los Alamos would be comparable to Bell Labs. It isn't. As alluded to earlier, most scientists who saw the Meitner/Hahn paper in 1938 could surmise a bomb was possible. What differentiated the US from other countries who were pursing nuclear weapons was that we had the industrial capacity and resources to set up Hanford in Oregon to produce plutonium, and enrich uranium in meaningful quantities at Oak Ridge. But the leap to a bomb wasn't one of great scientific innovation, but rather production.The book ends with about 100 pages describing the Japanese victims of the US nuclear attack. The contrast to the joyful early days of Fermi running up and down his hallway on Via Panisperna and taking measurements with his Geiger counter is stark. Sometimes history unfolds in unexpected ways.Far too much to say about the book than can put in writing. Just read it.*A crazy early anecdote talked about how Chaim Weizmann secured the Balfour Declaration in support of a Jewish homeland during WWI in exchange for supporting the government manufacture acetone which was badly needed for artillery. You can't make this stuff up."
121,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11476806-g-d-brennan,4,"I think this book is a touch overrated.Having said that, I couldn't put it down.""The Making of the Atomic Bomb"" is incredibly well-researched; it's thought-provoking and deep, yet lively and literary. And make no mistake, it is well worth your while; its greatest sections and passages are as absorbing and exciting as anything I've ever read. (As a precocious 4th grader prone to fleeing the world by burying my nose in books, I'd read eagerly about the incredible feats of engineering and physics that went into the atomic bombs; this book made me revert to my 4th-grade-self, walking around Chicago oblivious to the comparatively drab sights and sounds of the real world as I explored the livelier world within.) And given the primary research Rhodes has done, especially the interviews with many of the physicists and chemists who literally manufactured history in a hastily-assembled laboratory in the New Mexico desert, it seems impossible that anyone could put together even a comparably comprehensive history without copiously copping from this one. Nothing else compares; it is the ""War and Peace"" of our only nuclear war.And yet, this feels like a science experiment where one has settled on a hypothesis prior to doing the research, and has ignored or minimized those results that threatened the theory. Rhodes takes us through virtually all of 20th century atomic physics, but he's assembled it in a structure that resembles one of those black hole coin wells one sees at the science center; everything starts out slow and lazy and happy, but eventually things get more energetic and more frentic; valuable time is lost, and valuable money disappears into an abyss of war and militarism. Also, if it shares ""War and Peace's"" strengths, it also shares its flaws; rather than sticking around to observe things and let events speak for themselves, the author spends many of the closing pages on maddening flights of philosophical fancy centered around the potential for worldwide Armageddon that the atomic bomb unleashed. When Rhodes was writing and researching this book--from 1981 to 1986, according to the endnotes--such fears surely seemed lively and compelling, topical and true, matters of monumental import to the whole human race; now they feel quaint and outdated. (In these post 9/11 days of endless hot wars, one almost feels nostalgic for the Cold War. Armageddon clocks ticking down the minutes to midnight? ICBMs on alert in North Dakota, waiting for the launch signals that would send them off on flaming arcs over the polar ice cap, but held at bay only by the prospect of Mutual Assured Destruction? I'll take that over fanatical and resourceful terrorists with a divine mandate any day. Our current world makes MAD feel sane.) At any rate, one realizes at the end that Rhodes' musings are not mere detours at the end of a masterful narrative; they have also warped its course, for in between his excellent chronicling of the bomb's development, Rhodes gets pulled off by other vectors, particularly by Neils Bohr's utopian musings about making nuclear weapons research subject to the same standards of openness and free disclosure that prevail in the rest of scientific discourse.And it's a shame, because in the vast majority of the narrative Rhodes proves himself to be an incredibly talented writer and reporter, with a telling eye for facts and details, and an ease with complicated scientific concepts and analogies that, in turn, sets the reader at ease. I have read many other books on similar subjects and studied nuclear physics at the college level; still, I found myself learning new things from Rhodes' lucid and cogent descriptions of, say, the way a uranium atom fissions almost like a raindrop, or the way a cyclotron spins and separates atomic particles. And he weaves these descriptions into memorable scenes and stories; his descriptions of the construction and operation of the first nuclear reactor, a round-ish pile of graphite bricks and uranium trussed up by wooden scaffolding and nestled in a squash court at the University of Chicago, for instance, are lyrical and unforgettable. It is fascinating to read about the world's top nuclear physicists engaging in an experiment that was by turns precise and haphazard; it is engrossing to envision Enrico Fermi plotting neutron fluxes and calculating reaction coefficients while many of his staff members were wearing leftover raccoon coats to warm themselves against the Chicago winter because they had built the world's first nuclear reactor in an unheated building.Rhodes turns these dead physicists into live characters by keeping his eyes open for the characteristic anecdotes, and his ear tuned for the telling quotes. During the Manhattan Project, for instance, General Leslie Groves, frustrated at wartime copper shortages that threatened to derail the construction of uranium-separating cyclotrons, decided to borrow thousands of tons of silver from the Treasury to build them instead; his assistant was told: ""Colonel, in the Treasury we do not speak of tons of silver; our unit is the troy ounce."" Eventually they ended up with over 10,000 tons of silver, though; Rhodes judiciously uses this fact, and others, to convey the sheer magnitude of America's nuclear effort. Thanks to the Manhattan Project, a whole city sprung up in Tennessee to support the uranium processing efforts, a city with tens of thousands of people which nonetheless remained off the map. And meanwhile the government was establishing the Hanford reservation in Washington State--an area a third the size of Rhode Island. The upshot of all of these efforts, Rhodes tells us, was that the U.S. essentially constructed a nuclear industry from scratch and grew it, in three short years, to be the size of the automobile industry.And yet, of course, it was not about industry alone, but about dropping the product of that industry on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Here, too, I must take issue with the author; he expounds at length on Hiroshima, to the point that one almost becomes numb to its horrors, and yet he skimps on describing Nagasaki. The bomb used there was the more complicated and technically challenging of the two. (The tricky details of its construction end up taking far more space in the narrative than those for the relatively simple gun-type Hiroshima bomb; despite his revulsion at its use, Rhodes clearly admires the complicated engineering challenge it represented.) The mission which dropped it nearly ended up an unqualified and costly failure after it met with a string of bad luck. (Or good luck, at least, for the citizens of Kokura, the Japanese city which was saved from dubious immortality and near-total destruction thanks to unexpectedly cloudy weather that sent the second nuclear mission on to its secondary target; it is doubtful that bad weather has ever been more beneficial for a city and its populace.) And yet the last use of nuclear weapons in anger merits barely more than a page in this lengthy narrative, which is unfair to the reader, unfair to the story, and unfair to the hapless citizens of Nagasaki, whose fluke-filled fate deserves to be better remembered than as a glorified footnote.Short shrift, too, is given to the considerable efforts of Soviet spies at security-heavy Los Alamos; it is possible that much of this information was simply not known when Rhodes wrote, and he did cover this subject in his later ""Dark Sun;"" still, it means this feels somewhat incomplete.None of this is to say that one should avoid this book; it's massive enough and weighty enough that one simply can't avoid it if one is even tangentially interested in these topics. (Indeed, if one were to read only one book on the development and first use of the atomic bomb, this should probably be it.) Still, despite its lengthy word count, its thorough research, and its generally excellent writing, this is neither the last word nor the only word on its subject. "
122,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4828849-michael-burnam-fink,5,"""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.""Robert Oppenheimer, director of the Los Alamos lab, chief designer of the atomic bomb, and a polymath with mystic and leftist inclinations, had the perfect quote for the first artificial dawn of an atomic explosion. There are many ways in which we die: disease, age, accident, violence. And many ways in which we might all die; suddenly in the wake of some cosmological catastrophe or slowly starving on a dying planet. With the atom bomb, it was now possible for a single individual, at the top of a chain of technological and political commitments, to kill almost everyone in the space of an afternoon. The bombs were only used in anger twice, punctuation to end the global slaughter of the Second World War. Since then, history has existed under the shadow of a potential mushroom cloud. This book is the story of how we got there.Rhodes takes almost the first half of the book to establish the basic science and personalities of the atomic bomb. The first half of the 20th century was a golden age for physics which will likely never be equaled, as imaginative theorists and skilled experimenters probed the basic building blocks of the universe. Rutherford and Bohr nailed down, for the first time in evidence rather than speculation, the basic building blocks of matter. Atoms had most of their mass in a small nucleus, and owed their chemical properties to the quantum behavior of electron shells. The neutron was added to the list of fundamental particles. New elements were created by neutron bombardment, and by the late 1930s it was widely known that uranium would fission on bombardment, splitting into two lighter elements, and releasing a large deal of energy. There positive glee of work in this field, at this time, comes through in Rhodes' able biographical sketches of the scientists involved, particularly Bohr, Fermi, and Szilard.Szilard was the first to think of the potential of a fission chain reaction. If some substance, on absorbing a neutron split and released two or more neutrons, could produce a great deal of energy in millionths of a second. It would be a bomb of stupendous power, a city-smasher. Politically perceptive, Szilard had been helping Jewish physicists flee the Nazis for years. He had hoped for an H.G. Wells inspired international coalition to peacefully control this new power, but in 1939 if the bomb was too be invented, best by the Americans or British rather than Hitler.The next section, building the bomb, is less fun. Bohr predicted that you would need to turn all of America into a factory to build a bomb, and that is what the Manhattan project did, mobilizing thousands of scientists, $2 billion, and massive plants to do the hard work of separating fissile U-235 and Plutonium from natural uranium. Bureaucratic confusion and balky precision engineering made the task anything but easy. The other powers pursued the bomb. The British sent over their best to help with the Manhattan project. Germany's team, lead by Heisenberg, never had the necessary priority in the Reich, and were stalled by clever British-Norwegian sabotage directed at a heavy water production facility required for the Nazi reactor design. Japan never had access to the raw material to move beyond theory.The last section is grimmer yet. The design of the bomb was an exercise in precision, in delicately engineered explosive lenses to make the implosion to critical mass happen smoothly in nanoseconds. Tibbetts' B-29 bomber group trained to a razor's edge to accomplish the mission of deploying the 'gadget'. Roosevelt, on approving the Manhattan project, had instinctively reserved the bomb to himself as President. In 1945, Vice President Truman had not been read into the project until he succeeded to the presidency. The bomb was used on Hiroshima because it could be, because the Japanese still resisted, and because something had to be shown for the effort invested. It was a crime, a mass-murder in an instant. Rhodes does not flinch from the horror of Hiroshima.Personally, I think we need to distinguish between the bomb's use at the end of the Second World War, where it seems a matter of degree compared to area bombing rather than kind, and its use now, where that would signal breaking the nuclear taboo. This does not absolve the scientists who built the bomb of their responsibility. Nature's secrets were all around, and once fission had been theorized it was probably only a matter of time before someone figured out how to make it work, but these people made a choice to build Death a supersonic jet bomber to replicate his tired old horse. The Making of the Atomic Bomb is a penetrating look at the most consequential scientific and political moment of the 20th century. I'd give it six stars, if I could. It is also my 1000th review on Goodreads!"
123,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8511956-lance,5,"Probably the best book ever written on the atomic bomb, from the early science to the aftermath of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

125,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2209582-ross,3,"This is an exhaustive history of the bombs development., some 900 pages. The first half deals with the fundamental physics that makes nuclear weapons possible. The remainder deals with the actual development.My previous understanding of the bomb history stemmed from a movie some 20 years ago. In this film Albert Einstein perceives the potential for the bomb based on his famous equationE=MC squared. He quickly contacts President Roosevelt and FDR assigns a General Groves to develop the bomb ASAP in order to end the war.The actual truth is almost unbelievable.In the late 1930’s physicists in Europe realize that the fission of uranium can be used to make a bomb. Most of these scientists are Jews and they flee Hitler to the U.S. terrified that Germany will develop the bomb. Using what connections they can they approach officers separately in the U.S. army and navy. In both instances they are laughed at. Now more terrified than ever they approach Einstein, hoping his prestige can get word of the danger to someone in power. Einstein actually does have a contact that knows FDR and a letter from Einstein, actually written by our refugee physicists, is taken to the White House and read to FDR. The President seems impressed and says he will act on it. What he actually does is assign a bureaucrat in the Department of Standards to look into this thing. The bureaucrat now puts the letter in his safe and does nothing. It never occurs to FDR to follow-up on what is being done.Meanwhile the Germans and British are working on development and the British think the U.S. is also working on it A year later Churchill concerned about what the U.S. is doing sends a delegation over to discuss the project. They are horrified to find nothing is being done. A lot of screaming and yelling now takes place and finally General Groves is assigned.More than a year had been lost and we are very lucky today that we don’t have to speak German."
126,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7226831-josh-friedlander,5,"An epic topic, perhaps the epic topic, matched by a book epic in scope and detail. Rhodes starts off at the beginning of 20th century understanding of the atom, going into intricate detail about the lives of Bohr, Rutherford, Szilard, et al. He seems equally happy talking about Kierkegaard's Either/Or philosophy, the Pacific Theatre, or the intricacies of isolating Uranium-235. There's a lot of science in this book - I googled a lot but still felt like I missed enough to justify a second reading sometime - and some coverage of the effects of the bomb, the moral concerns of the scientists and politicians involved in its deployment, and the state of today's world. Rhodes wrote this book in the mid-1980s, but of course, the great, numbing, existential threat of the bomb still looms over us today; even if we think of it less."
127,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14945161-sandy-maguire,5,"Amazing book. The first act is a fantastic set of tableaus about the physicists and progression of science necessary to discover the capabilities of the atom. The second act is somewhat dry, regarding mostly the politicking necessary to have made the bomb happen, but there is some decent engineering spliced in here and there. The third is about the war effort, the Trinity test, and the eventual dropping of the bomb. The last chapter is horrifying and not something I'd describe as the feel-good read of the year, but it helps to drive home just how terrible these things are.I would strongly recommend this book to everyone."
128,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76660175-stephen-clare,5,"An astonishing book, dense as lead and explosive as plutonium. It's 800+ pages of tiny text, but there's not a superfluous sentence to be found. Just a staggering amount of information. And no wonder - this book is a textbook of physics in the first half of the 20th century, a case study of the relationship between science and war (and scientists and soldiers), and a history of the rising tolerability of mass civilian slaughter, combined with multiple biographies of some of history's most characteristic scientists.The climax of the book from Trinity to Nagasaki is awesome, cinematic, and chilling. This is a serious investment, but well worth your time."

Like, uber. Not just an exhaustive regarding the scientific aspects, but the social, political and wartime factors that contributed and led up to the creation of the most destructive weapon ever conceived. Even ample knowledge of the personal lives of the scientists involved is conveyed. There is so much about the development of the bomb that I certainly wasn't aware of and I would venture to say that most people aren't. How close that the Nazi's were to developing their own nuclear device, and the fact that the Japanese were actively researching their own atomic bomb. Overall, its good. Very good. But if you're more broadly interested in the history of the nuke... this book might drive you insane. Its hardcore. Also this book stops directly after the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the surrender of Japan, which seems a shame. So much of interest happens in the next several years, including the development of thermonuclear bomb technology (which is conceptually covered in the book), USSR espionage contributing to their own bomb development and the first stages of the arms race."
132,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/384386-dan,5,"At first I wasn't sure about starting as early in the history of atomic weapons as he did, but he was right to do so. While it didn't change my mind about nuclear weapons, it did a lot to deepen my thinking about them. Was reading about the successful Trinity test at the moment my wife's water broke and we went to the hospital to have our first baby, which was pretty timely. "
133,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6871223-aaron-million,4,"Richard Rhodes' monumental undertaking here is both admirable and daunting at the same time. As one might expect, the story of the development of the atomic bomb, and of atomic power in general, does not occur overnight and does not involved just a few individuals. It evolves over decades of often pain-staking work done by scientists who span a wide range of nationalities, specialties, opinions, and motivations. As such, a thorough job requires a lot of work – both for Rhodes and for the reader. Not being well-versed in science, and especially in physics, the sections containing detailed discussions of neutrons, electrons, atomic elements, chain reactions, volts, etc... were not the easiest for me to absorb. But that is due to my limited capacity to understand those things, not to Rhodes' writing or researching skills. In fact, he is not just writing for a scientific audience, but for a general audience. Thus, he cannot delve too far into the weeds of nuclear physics without losing quite a few people. But he cannot, at the same time, brush past very important discoveries and experiments. He does an admirable job of finding middle ground: not too detailed to discourage readers, but not superficial enough to upset scientists who understand these advanced topics. Almost as much of a struggle as the scientific aspect, is the difficulty in keeping all of the main characters (and there is no shortage of these) straight. So many people provided significant contributions to the development of the bomb: scientifically, politically, militarily, economically, that the names start to run together at a certain point. In addition, especially throughout the first half of the book, the scientists are from several different (mainly European) countries, and thus their work is taking place in many different laboratories in different cities. Just remembering which nationality someone is can be difficult at times. This is not a criticism of Rhodes; he could not begin to tell the story without all of these people being in it. But it is something to note for the general reader, especially someone who is unfamiliar with most chemists and physicists aside from Albert Einstein, who plays a minor, but pivotal, role in this drama. The most riveting chapter had to do with the actual dropping of the first atomic bomb, over Hiroshima, Japan on August 6, 1945. Rhodes, as he does throughout the book, allows the people involved in the story to explain their thoughts and feelings as much as possible. In this chapter, the remembrances of Japanese who survived the atomic attack are difficult to read. A sample, from page 722, the description by a thirty-year-old woman of encountering a dead person: “The corpse lying on its back on the road had been killed immediately.... Its hand was lifted to the sky and the fingers were burning with blue flames. The fingers were shortened to one-third and distorted. A dark liquid was running to the ground along the hand.” These types of horrible description go on for several pages. Rhodes does not do this to make a moral statement about the U.S. Dropping the bomb on Japan; in fact, he also notes that the Japanese leaders must share some of the blame as their desperate fighting, literally to the death, undoubtedly contributed to Harry Truman's decision to authorize the bombing. But instead he includes the morbid accounts so as the drive home the total devastation and utter ruin that the A-bomb brought into the world. As he accurately states, the bomb did not just destroy thousands of lives, but it completely wiped out an entire city. Rhodes concludes with a forty page Afterword, primarily focusing on the development of the “Super” (or H) bomb. Towards the end, he delves into a philosophic discussion about nation-states, nuclear policy and control, and warfare. While certainly relevant, after reading the preceding chapters detailing the creation of the bomb, it dropping on Japan, the immediate effects upon its people, and all of the political tugs of war in Los Alamos, NM and Washington, this reads as an anti-climax. This is not to say that it does not belong in the book. But rather, the discussion would have been enhanced by some capsules about what all of the various scientists went on to do following WWII. Los Alamos Director Robert Oppenheimer, as an example, had a painful life – both literally and figuratively – through the 1950s and up to his death in 1967. But Rhodes does not choose to mention any of Oppenheimer's travails. Still, it is hard to see how a more complete and accurate depiction of this world-changing event could be told. "
134,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6431984-antonio-rojas,5,"Monumental and Breathtaking!Is a breathtaking journey through the history of nuclear physics and the development of Atomic Theory. It is a masterpiece where Mr. Rhodes regales us with his gift for presenting difficult and intricate concepts in a very logical, insightful, colorful, and above all entertaining fashion.Loosely speaking, the first part of the book covers the key steps that carved the foundations of atomic theory: we get to witness J.J. Thompson discovering the electron; Ernest Rutherford realizing the existence of the nucleus and postulating his “Solar System” model of the atom; Niels Bohr, with a little help from spectroscopy improving that model and carving his more realistic Shell and Orbital design; Chadwick stalking and finally uncovering the neutron; Henri Becquerel and the Curies discovering radioactivity; Heisenberg working his Uncertainty Principle, Schrodinger developing wave mechanics, Pauli his Exclusion Principle. In addition, we become familiar with de Hevesy, John von Neumann, Wigner, Dirac, Millikan, Max Born, Arnold Sommerfeld, Paul Ehrenfest, in summary, all the big architects of Quantum Mechanics and modern physics. But what makes the book a truly superior piece is that Mr. Rhodes, while impeccably describing the science, he submerges the reader into the very personal and complex psychology of each of the characters and the historic context of the time. We see each of these great scientists come to life and wander through history in front of our eyes immersed in the chaotic social and military storm that surrounded the cataclysmic days of the First and Second World Wars.The second part of the book deals more specifically with the creation and the political steps leading to the use of the first atomic bombs on civilian populations by the United States government. We get to see Leo Szilard, the true brain behind the first idea of the atomic bomb and the first to conceptualize the science behind it and its potential consequences; we see Otto Hahn splitting the atom without realizing it and Lise Meitner and Otto Freisch interpreting and using for the first time the term “fission” to name the event; Enrico Fermi “slowing neutrons” and creating a sustained chain reaction; Wigner creating plutonium and enriching uranium; all of this, leading triumphantly to Los Alamos where we witness Edward Teller, Luis Alvarez, Hans Bethe, Lawrence and above all, Robert Oppenheimer, “I am become death, the destroyer of worlds”, where they orchestrated the biggest human effort and enterprise ever achieved: the ability to create the means of our own destruction. Mr. Rhodes cold and non-judgmental recompilation of first hand witnesses and victims of the explosions is both pathetic and truly horrifying. The harrowing images of children aimlessly wandering and holding strips of their own skin, women without feet walking on their ankles, or a man holding his eye in one hand create an infernal motion picture in our brain whose memory is very hard if not impossible to forget. At 790 comprehensive pages excluding Notes, Bibliography, Photo Credits and Index -886 in total- The Making of the Atomic Bomb is a monumental achievement that deserves all the accolades and awards it has gathered through the years. This book is a veritable must read, a must have, a classic."
135,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/204112-damon,5,"Richard Rhodes does a very impressive job of telling how we got to the atomic bomb. He starts in 1900 when Plank looked into a black box and found a new world. The Making of the Atomic Bomb explores the science that makes the bomb possible, the scientist who worked in breaking the atom, the politics which made people want to do it. In doing so it becomes one of the best introductions to quantum mechanics for the laymen. Much better than other books that try to join mysticism and science, Rhodes goes though, in prose, the basics of quantum mechanics and the people who made it. He has also not shy away from using the scientists metaphors to describe the world of the very small (Rutherford's cannon ball is one of the best), nor does he shy away from explaining the concepts that make the bomb possible, like why natural uranium does not explode and why plutonium is much better than uranium. Rhodes also provides a sense a drama the scientist and engineers in New Mexico start to build the bomb. When the first one is exploded, the reader feels a sense of achievement and pride at what man has wrought. And like all good writers, Rhodes is does not let us off the hook, the last portion of the book is a detailed description of the casualties of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The descriptions of the flash burn victims whose blacked, blistered skin peeled off their body exposing the muscle underneath is more than enough for anyone to appreciate Oppenheimer's quote: I am the creator, I am the destroyer.

Yes, it is very long. Yes, the narrative can feel a bit jumpy, especially in the first half. There are a lot of names being used, some of which never re-appear, and a lot of seemingly minor scientific experiments detailed exhaustively. And yes, Rhodes dedicates many pages to discussions that do not feel very relevant in 2013, but were very much so when it was written in the mid-80s and the idea that Russia might nuke us was not very far removed.But all of these elements come together in incredible fashion when the book builds up to moments of great importance: the confirmation of the splitting of the atom; the first self-sustaining nuclear reactor in Chicago; the attack on Pearl Harbor; the Trinity test; the dropping of Little Boy over Hiroshima. These sections are written beautifully and effectively convey the excitement and the historical ramifications. They would not be the same without all of the comprehensive background that is given beforehand, and it is hard to imagine this book being edited down very much.Strongly recommended to anybody with an interest in the bomb, or World War II in general."

There's much more. Rhodes, gifted with sharp psychological insight and a novelist's ability to convey character, reveals the personalities and emotional dynamics among the scientists and others responsible for conceiving, engineering, testing and ultimately dropping the apocalyptic devices on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In addition he describes the struggle in Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan to make the first bomb, as well as the political and military events that led inexorably to the destruction of the Japanese cities.

The book tells nothing but true stories about the people and events that shaped the making of the atom bomb and in a way that keeps your attention. Other books I read on the subject were very dry and boring, but this book holds your attention, even though it is a long book. If you like Cold War history and 20th century history, this book is a must read. How it actually all came together was so complex, it’s a miracle that it happened at all.I read this book back in 1988, just before I joined the Air Force. Little did I know that I would get a job in the Air Force working on equipment that monitored the world for people making nuclear weapons.

145,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/941349-bob,5,"This is an extraordinary work, one of the finest nonfiction books I've ever read. Its breadth and depth of coverage are incredible. It is engagingly written, truly a book hard to put down. It is full of wonderful anecdotes and photographs. The book is a chronological account of the science, engineering, and politics that created the atomic bomb. It is basically in four parts: physics from around 1880 to 1938, physics from 1939 to 1943, engineering and politics from 1941 to 1945, and the postwar aftermath up to around 1955. The first two parts are largely in Europe, the third and fourth mostly in the US. I was not prepared for the depth of coverage of the period from about 1880 to 1938. It is marvelous story, an epic of human achievement well told. I started out in college as a physics major, so I was familiar with the broad outline of this, and many of the names were familiar. In spite of that, I learned an enormous amount. The book wisely keeps the focus on the people, and succeeds wonderfully in making us feel we know them, at least the major players. In summarizing the book, it's hard to know where to start; Rhodes must have felt the same thing. By 1890 or so it was known that there were tiny particles called electrons that were negatively charged, and that the chemical elements were defined by how many electrons were in each atom. Since atoms are neutral, there must be a corresponding positive charge in each atom, but where? For a while it was thought that the positive charge was a sort of smeared out substrate, like the dough in a muffin, with the electrons stuck in it like blueberries. This was disproven (making a long story short) by Ernest Rutherford, New Zealand born British physicist, a poor boy who grew up on a farm. He showed that the positive charge lies in a ""nucleus"", a very small dense center of the atom, with the electrons much farther out, sort of orbiting around like the planets in the solar system. It wasn't long before the proton was discovered, and the fact that the nucleus contains the same number of protons as there are electrons in the outer shell. It was also not long before it was realized that the planetary analogy would not hold. According to the very well established electromagnetic theory of James Clerk Maxwell, the electrons would simply spiral into the nucleus and the atom would cease to exist. Yet the evidence for protons and the nucleus was undeniable. But the electromagnetic theory of Maxwell was extremely highly regarded. In fact Einstein had just used it (1905) to develop the theory of relativity, also highly regarded. What is the explanation? The explanation is most important development in physics since Newton: quantum theory. Quantum theory began with Max Plank and Einstein around 1890-1900, but really got going after 1915 with the work of Niels Bohr, Erwin Schroedinger, Werner Heisenberg and P. A. M. Dirac. Rhodes does not talk too much about quantum theory itself. He manages to keep the focus on nuclear physics. However, he does point out an essential lesson of quantum theory: light is both a wave and a particle. These seemingly contradictory notions exist at the same time in one thing. Bohr came to call this paraodox-that-is-not-a-paradox ""complementarity."" This abstract idea is important later. Of the four names above, two are extremely significant in the story of the atom bomb: Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg. Bohr was born in Denmark in 1885, so was half a generation younger than Rutherford. He explained the atom by showing how the electrons stayed in well defined ""shells"" rather than orbits like planets. Heisenberg, a German, was half a generation younger yet, born in 1901. He and Schroedinger made huge breakthroughs in the 1920s showing that Bohr's model was still not right. Meanwhile, before 1900, Marie and Pierre Curie had discovered radioactivity. Some elements, notably radium and uranium, decomposed with time by ejecting nuclear particles and becoming lighter elements. Eventually (long story cut short) it was realized that the particles being ejected are often ""neutrons"", the last of the three basic particles to be discovered (James Chadwick, 1932). Neutrons live in the nucleus with protons and seem to be a sort of glue holding the nucleus together.  The first phase of the story ends and the second begins in 1939 with the realization by Otto Hahn, Lise Meitner, and her nephew Otto Frisch that a nucleus could be fractured or split by a neutron being ejected from another atom. The first atom might split into two much lighter atoms -- fission -- and eject two or more neutrons, which could in turn hit and split yet more atoms -- a chain reaction. This was a revolutionary idea, quickly understood by Bohr, who carried the news to the US. Soon, scientists in the US, England, Germany, and Japan (yes Japan) were asking themselves, could this chain reaction become a bomb? Meanwhile, of course, was the hugely important rise of Nazi Germany. Many scientists, especially the Jewish ones, fled Germany by 1939. Meitner fled to Sweden in 1938. Frisch fled to England. Bohr (with only one grandparent Jewish) was at first relatively safe in Denmark, and could travel to England and back, but eventually had to flee to Sweden in 1943. Einstein was long since at Princeton. But, as Rhodes explains, many others, who are not household words, fled Nazi Europe and became key players in the saga of the atomic bomb. Among these are Stanislaw Ulam from Poland, Hans Bethe from Germany, and the Hungarian trio of Leo Szilard, Eugene Wigner, and Edward Teller, all of whom came to the US. All played significant roles in the story of the bomb; Szilard and Teller became big actors in the story. Similarly, physicists were fleeing Italy, including Enrico Fermi and Emilio Segre. The second part of the story surges into high gear with the developments in physics showing that a bomb could really work. In England, Chadwick assembled a group that included Frisch and Rudolf Peierls, recently fled from Germany. It became known as the MAUD committee. Frisch and Peierls produced the Frisch–Peierls memorandum, which was the first document to detail how an atomic explosion could be generated. Bohr soon learned about it, as he was also in England. Long story cut short, a bomb could be made from uranium-235 or from plutonium. Uranium occurs rather commonly in nature, but over 99% of it is the form called 238, abbreviated U-238. You can't make a bomb from that, though you can use it for a nuclear reactor. If enough of the much more radioactive U-235 is gotten together in the right way, a bomb will result. Plutonium does not occur in nature and was first synthesized by Glenn Seaborg in the US in 1940. It is also radioactive enough to make a bomb. About the same time, in 1940 Heisenberg began to understand that uranium 235 could make a bomb. Heisenberg did not like Hitler, but he had no Jewish ancestors and no compelling reason to leave Germany. He was asked by the German army to investigate uses of uranium. Rhodes says that Heisenberg thought that the process of actually getting together enough U-235 would be too expensive and difficult, and that is why the German atomic bomb project never got anywhere. In 2000, Thomas Powers published a book called Heisenberg's War in which he claims that Heisenberg deliberately stalled the German atomic bomb project so that Hitler would never have the bomb. It remains controversial, but Rhodes (writing in 1987) does not talk much about Heisenberg. Nonetheless, the British and Bohr assumed that the Germans would understand everything that they did, and would certainly be doing bomb research. This key idea, that the allies must keep up with the Germans, is the start of the third part of the saga, the engineering and political story of the actual making of the bomb. Americans were working too. Already in 1939, Hungarian emigre Leo Szilard realized that fission could be used to make a nuclear reactor and possibly a bomb. Szilard had known Einstein years before; in fact in 1926 they had patented a refrigerator! He became almost obsessed with the idea that President Roosevelt must understand the threat of the Germans having a bomb. In July 1939, Szilard and Wigner drove to Long Island, where Einstein was staying (how they found him is an interesting story). They convinced Einstein to write the now famous letter to FDR urging that the matter be given the highest priority. FDR was impressed, but it took more than one letter. That's a long story; read the book!  Eventually, especially after the Americans learned of the British MAUD committee work, a high level committee was formed to begin the research and manufacture of a bomb. The leaders of this committee were Vannevar Bush, James Conant, and Arthur Compton. Vannevar Bush (no relation to the presidents Bush) was an older engineer, a longtime influential person in the highest levels of academe and government. James Conant was a chemist and the president of Harvard. Arthur Compton had won the Nobel prize in physics in 1927. All of these people are fleshed out wonderfully in Rhodes's book. The big question for the Americans, as it was for the Germans and Japanese, was could the enormous effort to produce the bomb pay off in time for World War II? First, why ""enormous effort""? As Niels Bohr said around 1940, to actually make such a bomb would take half of the industrial apparatus of the United States for two years. This turned out to be only a modest overstatement. Producing enough U-235 was a huge task. Many tons of uranium ore would have to be processed to produce U-238, then a huge painstaking process (invention of Ernest Lawrence) would have to follow. (The Japanese realized this too, and abandoned the atomic bomb as impractical.) Eventually, processing U-235 was done at the Oak Ridge site in Tennessee, a gigantic complex. The alternative was to use plutonium. Plutonium can be created with a nuclear reactor at lesser cost. However, in 1942 no one was sure how to make a bomb out of plutonium, as it is almost too good. If a critical mass is not brought together VERY promptly, it would ""fizzle"", yielding an explosion scarcely any better than chemical bombs. The atomic bomb, of course, is a hundred thousand times better than that. The decision in the US was to do both approaches, to use both U-235 and plutonium. Plutonium was manufactured at another huge new facility, the Hanford Plant in Washington state. These two plants provided the ""brawn"" for the making of the atomic bomb, and employed thousands of people. But the ""brain"" was the third brand new facility built from scratch, the Los Alamos laboratory in New Mexico. This brings us at last to two of the most important names in this subject, Robert Oppenheimer and Leslie Groves. Robert Oppenheimer was born in New York in 1904, the son of a wealthy Jewish importer. With his rather privileged upbringing, Robert had spent some summers in the high plateaus in northern New Mexico. (Photos of the young Oppenheimer look remarkably like Bob Dylan.) I'll skip over his background in physics and how he came to the attention of the Bush committee, but it was decided to put him in overall charge of the construction of the atomic bomb. This was soon given the name Manhattan Project. Based on Oppenheimer's recommendation, a boys' school at Los Alamos was purchased, along with a hundred square miles of surrounding land. Colonel Leslie Groves was appointed the military leader of the project, who technically was above Oppenheimer. Rhodes does a wonderful job sketching how their relationship evolved. In short, both Oppenheimer and Groves did a wonderful job.  Rhodes' description of the building of the Los Alamos lab and the recruiting of the scientists and their families is perhaps the best part of this uniformly excellent book. The big names came, as well as many unknown today and many who later became famous. Enrico Fermi (who had created the first nuclear reactor in history in Chicago), Segre, Frisch, Bohr, Richard Feynman, Ulam, Lawrence, Seaborg, Bethe, two of Fermi's proteges Leona Woods and Herbert Anderson, Peierls and his colleague Klaus Fuchs from England. All of these went on to distinguished careers in the following decades. (more about Klaus Fuchs later.) Security was tight. Not all could take it. Edward Condon, a physicist ironically born in Alamogordo NM, resigned after six weeks: ""The thing which upsets me the most is the extraordinary close security policy.... In my case I found that the extreme concern with security was morbidly depressing -- especially the censoring mail and telephone calls."" Much later he was the target of the House Un-American Activities Committee because he was a ""follower"" of a ""new revolutionary movement"", quantum mechanics!  To make a long story short again, perhaps the biggest problem they solved at Los Alamos was the plutonium bomb. As mentioned above, the key is to force a critical mass of plutonium into a very small volume very quickly, to harness the vast number of neutrons released in the chain reaction. A young physicist named Seth Neddermeyer had the key idea: implosion. That means, arrange a group of ordinary explosives around a hollow sphere of plutonium. Set off the explosives at the same time and they will compress the plutonium into critical mass. This is easier said than done, and besides Neddermeyer the person who made it work was George Kistiakowsky, an ordinance expert. Implosion is not necessary in a U-235 bomb, but, as mentioned above, plutonium is easier to manufacture. There is one strong lesson from all of this: it is very hard to build an atomic bomb! Good! One more physics topic before we get to the more political aspects. The idea of using the energy from a fission bomb (uranium or plutonium atomic bomb) to initiate a fusion reaction (hydrogen bomb) was first proposed casually by Enrico Fermi to Edward Teller in the fall of 1941. Teller latched onto it and made it his ""baby"" until the first hydrogen bomb was detonated in 1952. During the war years at Los Alamos he insisted on working on it even though most of the others said to let it go until after the war. He was vindicated when it did indeed unleash 1000 times more energy than the atomic bombs. To quickly wrap up this phase, the Manhattan project succeeded in producing two plutonium bombs (the one tested in the New Mexico desert and one that fell on Nagasaki) and one U-235 bomb, the one that fell on Hiroshima. Now to the 500 pound gorilla in the room: was all this necessary? Was it morally correct to build and use the bomb, killing 130,000 people? The physicists who worked on the bomb did so almost entirely to make sure that the Allies would not be behind the Germans, who they felt sure were working on an atomic bomb. Many, perhaps half, of those physicists, had escaped Nazi persecution. This was a real and palpable threat to them. I do not see how anyone can argue with that. But did any of them see farther into the future? One especially did so: Niels Bohr. If reading this book will do nothing else, it will make you respect Niels Bohr. Already in 1943, as Los Alamos was just being built, Bohr was looking ahead to a post-war world with atomic weapons. He was terrified at the idea. He held no illusions that we in the US could keep the weapon for ourselves. Once successfully demonstrated, he had no doubt that the Soviet Union could build one in a few years. Indeed, he assumed they were already aware of the Manhattan Project. His solution was radical openness, his ""principle of complementarity."" Recall that this is the phrase he used twenty years earlier to grasp the apparently contradictory notions of quantum mechanics.  Complementarity means that the atomic bomb is a two-edged sword. On the one hand it is a terrible weapon, having the potential to unleash horrific suffering. On the other hand, since governments will realize that, they will be forced to not use it, to try much harder than ever to maintain peace. To help this along, he wanted the US to not only make it clear to everyone that the Manhattan Project was going on, he wanted the US to share everything we learned. He wanted in essence to give away the blueprints (not to the Germans during the war of course), that we would in this way generate enormous good will.  Making a long story short, in 1944 he gained personal audiences with both FDR and Churchill to push this idea. FDR was sympathetic. Churchill was appalled, to the extent that he wanted Bohr arrested. When FDR and Churchill met later in 1944, Churchill prevailed against the already enfeebled FDR, and that was the end of Bohr's far reaching vision. At least, he was not arrested. What about the idea that dropping the bombs on Japan was unnecessary, that the death toll was unprecedented? Rhodes points out that at least the second half of this statement is incorrect. There were already horrific bombings and killings. We all know about the holocaust, but many people today don't seem to know about the German executions of at least 500,000 prisoners in Russia, or the terrible murders and rapes that the Japanese perpetrated in China, which killed 150,000 civilians, or the Battle of Britain, in which the English lost 40,000, or the Dresden fire bombing that killed 25,000, or the Tokyo fire bombing in which 334 B29 bombers killed 90,000 people. The death toll from Hiroshima and Nagasaki was absolutely not unprecedented. Most Americans who lived through those years think that the atomic bombs ended the war and saved several hundred thousand American lives, and probably 500,000 Japanese. A few comments on the fourth phase of this book, the postwar period: Klaus Fuchs, mentioned above, was a Russian spy. He served nine years in prison in England, later emigrated to East Germany. Rhodes never mentions Julius or Ethel Rosenberg. I find that a bit odd. Oppenheimer had married a woman who had been a member of the communist party. This caused him trouble in 1941, but he was appointed to Los Alamos in spite of it. After the war, he had a very good career at Berkeley and Princeton. In 1949 he lost his security clearance because of his prewar communist sympathies, and because of the struggle with Edward Teller, who was championing the building of the hydrogen bomb. Oppenheimer was seen by the scientific community as a martyr to McCarthyism. He came to represent the struggle between right-wing militarists (symbolized by Teller) and left-wing intellectuals (symbolized by Oppenheimer) over the moral question of nuclear bombs.  To wrap up this already long review, let's return once more to the question of should the US have dropped the bombs on Japan. I will let Leona Woods have the last word. She later went on to a long career as a physicist:  ""I certainly do recall how I felt when the atomic bombs were used. My brother-in-law was captain of the first minesweeper. My brother was a Marine on Okinawa. I'm sure they would not have lasted in an invasion. It was clear the war would continue, with half a million of our fighting men dead not to say how many Japanese. You know and I know that [we] firebombed Tokyo and nobody even mentions the slaughter that happened then. They think Nagasaki and Hiroshima were something [very bad] compared to the firebombing. THEY'RE WRONG! I have no regrets. I think we did right, and we couldn't have done it differently. Yeah, I know it has been suggested the second bomb, Nagasaki, was not necessary. ... when you are in a war, to the death, I don't think you stand around and ask, Is it right?' """
146,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85753449-pritam-chattopadhyay,4,"In the foreword to this extremely interesting book, the author writes: The closing days of the Second World War marked a similar turning point in human history, the point of entry into a new era when humankind for the first time acquired the means of its own destruction. The discovery of how to release nuclear energy, and its application to build weapons of mass destruction, has gradually removed the prejudice on which total war is based: the insupportable conviction that there is a limited amount of energy available in the world to concentrate into explosives, that it is possible to accumulate more of such energy than one’s enemies and thereby militarily to prevail. So cheap, so portable, so holocaustal did nuclear weapons eventually become that even nation-states as belligerent as the Soviet Union and the United States preferred to sacrifice a portion of their national sovereignty—preferred to forego the power to make total war—rather than be destroyed in their fury.First published in 1986, this scrupulously researched and broad narrative by Richard Rhodes is the author’s ultimate account, tracing the expansion of the world’s eventual apocalyptic weapon from its origins as a problem in theoretical physics to its devastating culmination at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The book, at the same time, is also a chronicle of the personalities and greatest minds of the 20th century—especially Robert Oppenheimer, Niels Bohr, Leo Szilard, Enrico Fermi, Edward Teller, and Ernest Lawrence — and their inputs to developing the atomic bomb. Rhodes describes exhaustively the great scientific achievements that led up to the invention of the atomic bomb. Everything of importance is examined, from the discovery of the atomic nucleus and of nuclear fission to the emergence of quantum physics, the invention of the mass-spectroscope and of the cyclotron, the creation of such man-made elements as plutonium and tritium, and implementation of the nuclear chain reaction in uranium. Even more important, Rhodes shows how these achievements were thrust into the arms of the state, which culminated in the unfolding of the nuclear arms race. Often brilliantly, he records the rise of fascism and of anti-Semitism, and the intensification of nationalist ambitions. He traces the outbreak of WW II, which provoked a hysterical rivalry among nations to devise the bomb.Rhodes does a brilliant job in explaining the Manhattan Project, with a host of elements on everything from laboratory experiments to training of bombing pilots.The author prophetically observes : I think of a world without nuclear weapons not as a utopian dream but simply as a world where delivery times have been deliberately lengthened to months or even years, with correspondingly longer periods interim during which to resolve disputes short of war. In such a world, if negotiations fail, if conventional skirmishes fail, if both sides revert to arming themselves with nuclear weapons again—then at worst we will only arrive once more at the dangerous precipice where we all stand now.The discovery of how to release nuclear energy, like all fundamental scientific discoveries, changed the structure of human affairs—permanently.How that happened is the story this book attempts to tell."
147,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5672051-brahm,5,"The Making of the Atomic Bomb in audiobook form is just over 37 hours (the book clocks in at 900 pages). It was an immense history of EVERYTHING connected to the atomic weapons program, starting with a great chapter on the ancient philosophy of science, to primers on chemistry and physics, to the evolution of weapons of mass destruction including horrific WWI gas weapons, to post-WWI European politics, to stories of individual scientists and their cumulative discoveries, to stories of the supply chain and secret politics that had to be developed to feed the US atomic weapons program. The book converges to, and ends immediately after the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The Making of the Atomic Bomb was immense, powerful, and comprehensive. I loved the technical depth and the personal stories of the scientists and other actors involved. It feels like I just finished a University course. The pace of scientific discovery in the late 1930s is nothing short of amazing, and the scientists are such interesting characters. In the final chapter, the first-hand accounts of the immediate aftermath of Hiroshima and Nagasaki are graphic and deeply disturbing. It's a big change in tone; you invest hours and hours reading/listening about scientific, political, industrial and engineering progress, making it difficult to face the gut-wrenching, violent outcome. Better understanding of atomic theory and history, but mostly the consequences of nuclear weapons leaves me feeling unsettled over the range and number of nuclear weapons that exist today. They're in the background; we don't think about them. I didn't ever seriously consider or understand the physical damage these weapons can cause, OR the political consequences (ie, the world is locked in an eternal standoff of nuclear powers, even if we don't hear it on the news every day). The audiobook was narrated by Holter Graham. I am brand-new to audiobooks, but I thought it was exceptionally well read. I wonder if dense books are especially well-suited to audiobooks, as a bit of inflection and tone by a careful narrator can really bring a serious, technical and/or dense material to life. "
148,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3816725-larry-bassett,3,"I have to thank audible books for allowing me to actually experience this book. I am pretty sure I never would’ve gotten through even the first half of the book without the help of a skilled reader. I would give the first half of the book 2 stars and the last half of the book 4 stars does arriving at the medium of three stars. The first half or more of the book is way too complicated for my simple science knowledge. It might be very interesting to someone more versed in physics. It goes into great detail about 19th century and early 20th century physics discoveries and it is indefatigable in naming names! Way beyond my ability to compute.The second half of a book is exceedingly more interesting story for the average reader. Some of it you will of heard before but some of the inside stories of the relationships of the scientists Was new information to me. The relationship between science and engineering is something that I am not familiar with. A lot of the story about the development of theory and experimentation. And then an implementation is fascinating. The expansion and development of this $2 billion project beginning with essentially vacant ground in los Alamos and Hartford and Tennessee was very well documented. In the entire book there are about 2600 footnotes. Thank goodness the audible reading skips over those. At the end of the Kindle book there are many photographs of the many characters that appear in starring and supporting roles.I am not sure what the major takeaways of this book are. There is a fair amount of discussion about the debate about the good and evil of the atomic bomb. There was considerable hope among scientists that the bomb might force us to create a world of peace. There was of course some dissension about the use of the bomb but it is clear that once the bomb was created, there was no doubt that it would be used.There are many more pages about the horror of the injuries and deaths in Hiroshima then where necessary. We have read those pages too often. The fact that they were literally getting a third Byam ready when JAPAN finally surrendered is not something I have heard about previously. The argument about the bomb saving American lives was pretty well implanted in this book."
149,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56863096-jeremy,4,"Excellently told history of the incredible story of the development of the atomic bomb. Rhodes starts with some of the history of modern physics as it relates to different developments that led to the bomb, including the scientists. It was great to see Niels Bohr get his proper due; he commonly seems to be overlooked, at least among the general public, as one of the most important scientists in history (though he wasn't directly involved in the Manhattan Project). The science throughout this book is quite thorough and complex. After a while I gave up trying to see if I could follow it. While I appreciate that this book is trying to be comprehensive, for my taste he could have backed off the science a little bit. That said, the feat was incredible, and it is equally incredible that a chain reaction of splitting atoms can create such enormous destructive power.The last third or so of the book was exciting, as we got a behind the scenes look at the political and scientific progress towards the inevitable, and a front row seat to the first test of an atomic bomb. Rhodes spends some time in Hiroshima describing the awful outcome of the bomb in all its brutal reality. I was unaware that the Japanese would have potentially surrendered conditionally, but the US was demanding unconditional surrender. There were a number of prescient voices, Bohr's included, that understood what nuclear weapons meant for the world, a threat we must all now live with. Many of those working on the project experienced the cognitive dissonance of being successful with their work, and the fact that it meant terrible death and destruction for innocent lives, and changed the world forever."
150,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63879552-sebastian,5,"BLUF:There are not many books I would recommend more whole-heartedly. Just read it.Details:This is the story of science, industry, and politics, and how humanity went from wondering about structure of the atom in 1910 to dropping exploding balls of plutonium over Japan in 1945.We begin with bunch of European physicists who in the 1920s and 30s, discover the nature of the atom: Rutherford in England discovering the nucleus in 1911, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle in 1926, the Bohr model, Chadwick's discovery of the neutron in 1932, Fermi's 1934 experiments with neutron bombardment in Rome, and finally Otto Hahn and Lise Meitner publishing on nuclear fission in 1938. Rhodes paints a picture of a world of perhaps 100 physicists who knew each other personally and moved around frequently to collaborate for short periods of time. I wonder how funding worked (when Oppenheimer does research at Cavendish, or similar -- were do the dollars come from?) but no-one seems to worry about grants. Another thing that struck me was how broad some of these scientists were. Einstein and Szilard take a couple years off particle physics to study refrigeration in the 1930s. It's interesting to thing about this period of rapid progress against the example of Bell Labs. Common elements seem to be freedom from funding and publishing concerns, and a degree of flexibility in field of study. Unlike Bell, they aren't as commercially-focused although there is a goal that everyone is working against at least implicitly to map the structure of the atom. Also, Bohr is this convener and hub for the physicists, and I'm not sure a similar figure existed at Bell Labs.1938 is a pivotal year. Hahn / Meitner's write up on fission makes it clear to everyone that a fission chain reaction could power a new source of energy -- or a powerful new weapon. All of the fun of science and discovery takes on new meaning when our science Bund discovers their knowledge could be used for destructive ends. Hitler's Anschluss absorbs Austria and persecution of Jews in Germany begins.* Bohr heroically rounds up as many Jewish scientists as he can and whisks them off to Denmark; Szilard in the UK helps get more to England and the US.The war begins and scientists relocate the United States. Szilard, Einstein, and others (""The Hungarian Conspiracy"") attempt to educate military leadership and Roosevelt himself of the destructive power of the bomb. Eventually they do succeed and the great INDUSTRIAL project of the atomic bomb begins. I went in to the book thinking that Los Alamos would be comparable to Bell Labs. It isn't. As alluded to earlier, most scientists who saw the Meitner/Hahn paper in 1938 could surmise a bomb was possible. What differentiated the US from other countries who were pursing nuclear weapons was that we had the industrial capacity and resources to set up Hanford in Oregon to produce plutonium, and enrich uranium in meaningful quantities at Oak Ridge. But the leap to a bomb wasn't one of great scientific innovation, but rather production.The book ends with about 100 pages describing the Japanese victims of the US nuclear attack. The contrast to the joyful early days of Fermi running up and down his hallway on Via Panisperna and taking measurements with his Geiger counter is stark. Sometimes history unfolds in unexpected ways.Far too much to say about the book than can put in writing. Just read it.*A crazy early anecdote talked about how Chaim Weizmann secured the Balfour Declaration in support of a Jewish homeland during WWI in exchange for supporting the government manufacture acetone which was badly needed for artillery. You can't make this stuff up."
151,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11476806-g-d-brennan,4,"I think this book is a touch overrated.Having said that, I couldn't put it down.""The Making of the Atomic Bomb"" is incredibly well-researched; it's thought-provoking and deep, yet lively and literary. And make no mistake, it is well worth your while; its greatest sections and passages are as absorbing and exciting as anything I've ever read. (As a precocious 4th grader prone to fleeing the world by burying my nose in books, I'd read eagerly about the incredible feats of engineering and physics that went into the atomic bombs; this book made me revert to my 4th-grade-self, walking around Chicago oblivious to the comparatively drab sights and sounds of the real world as I explored the livelier world within.) And given the primary research Rhodes has done, especially the interviews with many of the physicists and chemists who literally manufactured history in a hastily-assembled laboratory in the New Mexico desert, it seems impossible that anyone could put together even a comparably comprehensive history without copiously copping from this one. Nothing else compares; it is the ""War and Peace"" of our only nuclear war.And yet, this feels like a science experiment where one has settled on a hypothesis prior to doing the research, and has ignored or minimized those results that threatened the theory. Rhodes takes us through virtually all of 20th century atomic physics, but he's assembled it in a structure that resembles one of those black hole coin wells one sees at the science center; everything starts out slow and lazy and happy, but eventually things get more energetic and more frentic; valuable time is lost, and valuable money disappears into an abyss of war and militarism. Also, if it shares ""War and Peace's"" strengths, it also shares its flaws; rather than sticking around to observe things and let events speak for themselves, the author spends many of the closing pages on maddening flights of philosophical fancy centered around the potential for worldwide Armageddon that the atomic bomb unleashed. When Rhodes was writing and researching this book--from 1981 to 1986, according to the endnotes--such fears surely seemed lively and compelling, topical and true, matters of monumental import to the whole human race; now they feel quaint and outdated. (In these post 9/11 days of endless hot wars, one almost feels nostalgic for the Cold War. Armageddon clocks ticking down the minutes to midnight? ICBMs on alert in North Dakota, waiting for the launch signals that would send them off on flaming arcs over the polar ice cap, but held at bay only by the prospect of Mutual Assured Destruction? I'll take that over fanatical and resourceful terrorists with a divine mandate any day. Our current world makes MAD feel sane.) At any rate, one realizes at the end that Rhodes' musings are not mere detours at the end of a masterful narrative; they have also warped its course, for in between his excellent chronicling of the bomb's development, Rhodes gets pulled off by other vectors, particularly by Neils Bohr's utopian musings about making nuclear weapons research subject to the same standards of openness and free disclosure that prevail in the rest of scientific discourse.And it's a shame, because in the vast majority of the narrative Rhodes proves himself to be an incredibly talented writer and reporter, with a telling eye for facts and details, and an ease with complicated scientific concepts and analogies that, in turn, sets the reader at ease. I have read many other books on similar subjects and studied nuclear physics at the college level; still, I found myself learning new things from Rhodes' lucid and cogent descriptions of, say, the way a uranium atom fissions almost like a raindrop, or the way a cyclotron spins and separates atomic particles. And he weaves these descriptions into memorable scenes and stories; his descriptions of the construction and operation of the first nuclear reactor, a round-ish pile of graphite bricks and uranium trussed up by wooden scaffolding and nestled in a squash court at the University of Chicago, for instance, are lyrical and unforgettable. It is fascinating to read about the world's top nuclear physicists engaging in an experiment that was by turns precise and haphazard; it is engrossing to envision Enrico Fermi plotting neutron fluxes and calculating reaction coefficients while many of his staff members were wearing leftover raccoon coats to warm themselves against the Chicago winter because they had built the world's first nuclear reactor in an unheated building.Rhodes turns these dead physicists into live characters by keeping his eyes open for the characteristic anecdotes, and his ear tuned for the telling quotes. During the Manhattan Project, for instance, General Leslie Groves, frustrated at wartime copper shortages that threatened to derail the construction of uranium-separating cyclotrons, decided to borrow thousands of tons of silver from the Treasury to build them instead; his assistant was told: ""Colonel, in the Treasury we do not speak of tons of silver; our unit is the troy ounce."" Eventually they ended up with over 10,000 tons of silver, though; Rhodes judiciously uses this fact, and others, to convey the sheer magnitude of America's nuclear effort. Thanks to the Manhattan Project, a whole city sprung up in Tennessee to support the uranium processing efforts, a city with tens of thousands of people which nonetheless remained off the map. And meanwhile the government was establishing the Hanford reservation in Washington State--an area a third the size of Rhode Island. The upshot of all of these efforts, Rhodes tells us, was that the U.S. essentially constructed a nuclear industry from scratch and grew it, in three short years, to be the size of the automobile industry.And yet, of course, it was not about industry alone, but about dropping the product of that industry on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Here, too, I must take issue with the author; he expounds at length on Hiroshima, to the point that one almost becomes numb to its horrors, and yet he skimps on describing Nagasaki. The bomb used there was the more complicated and technically challenging of the two. (The tricky details of its construction end up taking far more space in the narrative than those for the relatively simple gun-type Hiroshima bomb; despite his revulsion at its use, Rhodes clearly admires the complicated engineering challenge it represented.) The mission which dropped it nearly ended up an unqualified and costly failure after it met with a string of bad luck. (Or good luck, at least, for the citizens of Kokura, the Japanese city which was saved from dubious immortality and near-total destruction thanks to unexpectedly cloudy weather that sent the second nuclear mission on to its secondary target; it is doubtful that bad weather has ever been more beneficial for a city and its populace.) And yet the last use of nuclear weapons in anger merits barely more than a page in this lengthy narrative, which is unfair to the reader, unfair to the story, and unfair to the hapless citizens of Nagasaki, whose fluke-filled fate deserves to be better remembered than as a glorified footnote.Short shrift, too, is given to the considerable efforts of Soviet spies at security-heavy Los Alamos; it is possible that much of this information was simply not known when Rhodes wrote, and he did cover this subject in his later ""Dark Sun;"" still, it means this feels somewhat incomplete.None of this is to say that one should avoid this book; it's massive enough and weighty enough that one simply can't avoid it if one is even tangentially interested in these topics. (Indeed, if one were to read only one book on the development and first use of the atomic bomb, this should probably be it.) Still, despite its lengthy word count, its thorough research, and its generally excellent writing, this is neither the last word nor the only word on its subject. "
152,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4828849-michael-burnam-fink,5,"""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.""Robert Oppenheimer, director of the Los Alamos lab, chief designer of the atomic bomb, and a polymath with mystic and leftist inclinations, had the perfect quote for the first artificial dawn of an atomic explosion. There are many ways in which we die: disease, age, accident, violence. And many ways in which we might all die; suddenly in the wake of some cosmological catastrophe or slowly starving on a dying planet. With the atom bomb, it was now possible for a single individual, at the top of a chain of technological and political commitments, to kill almost everyone in the space of an afternoon. The bombs were only used in anger twice, punctuation to end the global slaughter of the Second World War. Since then, history has existed under the shadow of a potential mushroom cloud. This book is the story of how we got there.Rhodes takes almost the first half of the book to establish the basic science and personalities of the atomic bomb. The first half of the 20th century was a golden age for physics which will likely never be equaled, as imaginative theorists and skilled experimenters probed the basic building blocks of the universe. Rutherford and Bohr nailed down, for the first time in evidence rather than speculation, the basic building blocks of matter. Atoms had most of their mass in a small nucleus, and owed their chemical properties to the quantum behavior of electron shells. The neutron was added to the list of fundamental particles. New elements were created by neutron bombardment, and by the late 1930s it was widely known that uranium would fission on bombardment, splitting into two lighter elements, and releasing a large deal of energy. There positive glee of work in this field, at this time, comes through in Rhodes' able biographical sketches of the scientists involved, particularly Bohr, Fermi, and Szilard.Szilard was the first to think of the potential of a fission chain reaction. If some substance, on absorbing a neutron split and released two or more neutrons, could produce a great deal of energy in millionths of a second. It would be a bomb of stupendous power, a city-smasher. Politically perceptive, Szilard had been helping Jewish physicists flee the Nazis for years. He had hoped for an H.G. Wells inspired international coalition to peacefully control this new power, but in 1939 if the bomb was too be invented, best by the Americans or British rather than Hitler.The next section, building the bomb, is less fun. Bohr predicted that you would need to turn all of America into a factory to build a bomb, and that is what the Manhattan project did, mobilizing thousands of scientists, $2 billion, and massive plants to do the hard work of separating fissile U-235 and Plutonium from natural uranium. Bureaucratic confusion and balky precision engineering made the task anything but easy. The other powers pursued the bomb. The British sent over their best to help with the Manhattan project. Germany's team, lead by Heisenberg, never had the necessary priority in the Reich, and were stalled by clever British-Norwegian sabotage directed at a heavy water production facility required for the Nazi reactor design. Japan never had access to the raw material to move beyond theory.The last section is grimmer yet. The design of the bomb was an exercise in precision, in delicately engineered explosive lenses to make the implosion to critical mass happen smoothly in nanoseconds. Tibbetts' B-29 bomber group trained to a razor's edge to accomplish the mission of deploying the 'gadget'. Roosevelt, on approving the Manhattan project, had instinctively reserved the bomb to himself as President. In 1945, Vice President Truman had not been read into the project until he succeeded to the presidency. The bomb was used on Hiroshima because it could be, because the Japanese still resisted, and because something had to be shown for the effort invested. It was a crime, a mass-murder in an instant. Rhodes does not flinch from the horror of Hiroshima.Personally, I think we need to distinguish between the bomb's use at the end of the Second World War, where it seems a matter of degree compared to area bombing rather than kind, and its use now, where that would signal breaking the nuclear taboo. This does not absolve the scientists who built the bomb of their responsibility. Nature's secrets were all around, and once fission had been theorized it was probably only a matter of time before someone figured out how to make it work, but these people made a choice to build Death a supersonic jet bomber to replicate his tired old horse. The Making of the Atomic Bomb is a penetrating look at the most consequential scientific and political moment of the 20th century. I'd give it six stars, if I could. It is also my 1000th review on Goodreads!"

155,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2209582-ross,3,"This is an exhaustive history of the bombs development., some 900 pages. The first half deals with the fundamental physics that makes nuclear weapons possible. The remainder deals with the actual development.My previous understanding of the bomb history stemmed from a movie some 20 years ago. In this film Albert Einstein perceives the potential for the bomb based on his famous equationE=MC squared. He quickly contacts President Roosevelt and FDR assigns a General Groves to develop the bomb ASAP in order to end the war.The actual truth is almost unbelievable.In the late 1930’s physicists in Europe realize that the fission of uranium can be used to make a bomb. Most of these scientists are Jews and they flee Hitler to the U.S. terrified that Germany will develop the bomb. Using what connections they can they approach officers separately in the U.S. army and navy. In both instances they are laughed at. Now more terrified than ever they approach Einstein, hoping his prestige can get word of the danger to someone in power. Einstein actually does have a contact that knows FDR and a letter from Einstein, actually written by our refugee physicists, is taken to the White House and read to FDR. The President seems impressed and says he will act on it. What he actually does is assign a bureaucrat in the Department of Standards to look into this thing. The bureaucrat now puts the letter in his safe and does nothing. It never occurs to FDR to follow-up on what is being done.Meanwhile the Germans and British are working on development and the British think the U.S. is also working on it A year later Churchill concerned about what the U.S. is doing sends a delegation over to discuss the project. They are horrified to find nothing is being done. A lot of screaming and yelling now takes place and finally General Groves is assigned.More than a year had been lost and we are very lucky today that we don’t have to speak German."
156,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7226831-josh-friedlander,5,"An epic topic, perhaps the epic topic, matched by a book epic in scope and detail. Rhodes starts off at the beginning of 20th century understanding of the atom, going into intricate detail about the lives of Bohr, Rutherford, Szilard, et al. He seems equally happy talking about Kierkegaard's Either/Or philosophy, the Pacific Theatre, or the intricacies of isolating Uranium-235. There's a lot of science in this book - I googled a lot but still felt like I missed enough to justify a second reading sometime - and some coverage of the effects of the bomb, the moral concerns of the scientists and politicians involved in its deployment, and the state of today's world. Rhodes wrote this book in the mid-1980s, but of course, the great, numbing, existential threat of the bomb still looms over us today; even if we think of it less."
157,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14945161-sandy-maguire,5,"Amazing book. The first act is a fantastic set of tableaus about the physicists and progression of science necessary to discover the capabilities of the atom. The second act is somewhat dry, regarding mostly the politicking necessary to have made the bomb happen, but there is some decent engineering spliced in here and there. The third is about the war effort, the Trinity test, and the eventual dropping of the bomb. The last chapter is horrifying and not something I'd describe as the feel-good read of the year, but it helps to drive home just how terrible these things are.I would strongly recommend this book to everyone."

It's 800+ pages of tiny text, but there's not a superfluous sentence to be found. Just a staggering amount of information. And no wonder - this book is a textbook of physics in the first half of the 20th century, a case study of the relationship between science and war (and scientists and soldiers), and a history of the rising tolerability of mass civilian slaughter, combined with multiple biographies of some of history's most characteristic scientists.The climax of the book from Trinity to Nagasaki is awesome, cinematic, and chilling. This is a serious investment, but well worth your time."

Like, uber. Not just an exhaustive regarding the scientific aspects, but the social, political and wartime factors that contributed and led up to the creation of the most destructive weapon ever conceived. Even ample knowledge of the personal lives of the scientists involved is conveyed. There is so much about the development of the bomb that I certainly wasn't aware of and I would venture to say that most people aren't. How close that the Nazi's were to developing their own nuclear device, and the fact that the Japanese were actively researching their own atomic bomb. Overall, its good. Very good. But if you're more broadly interested in the history of the nuke... this book might drive you insane. Its hardcore. Also this book stops directly after the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the surrender of Japan, which seems a shame. So much of interest happens in the next several years, including the development of thermonuclear bomb technology (which is conceptually covered in the book), USSR espionage contributing to their own bomb development and the first stages of the arms race."

While it didn't change my mind about nuclear weapons, it did a lot to deepen my thinking about them. Was reading about the successful Trinity test at the moment my wife's water broke and we went to the hospital to have our first baby, which was pretty timely. "
163,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6871223-aaron-million,4,"Richard Rhodes' monumental undertaking here is both admirable and daunting at the same time. As one might expect, the story of the development of the atomic bomb, and of atomic power in general, does not occur overnight and does not involved just a few individuals. It evolves over decades of often pain-staking work done by scientists who span a wide range of nationalities, specialties, opinions, and motivations. As such, a thorough job requires a lot of work – both for Rhodes and for the reader. Not being well-versed in science, and especially in physics, the sections containing detailed discussions of neutrons, electrons, atomic elements, chain reactions, volts, etc... were not the easiest for me to absorb. But that is due to my limited capacity to understand those things, not to Rhodes' writing or researching skills. In fact, he is not just writing for a scientific audience, but for a general audience. Thus, he cannot delve too far into the weeds of nuclear physics without losing quite a few people. But he cannot, at the same time, brush past very important discoveries and experiments. He does an admirable job of finding middle ground: not too detailed to discourage readers, but not superficial enough to upset scientists who understand these advanced topics. Almost as much of a struggle as the scientific aspect, is the difficulty in keeping all of the main characters (and there is no shortage of these) straight. So many people provided significant contributions to the development of the bomb: scientifically, politically, militarily, economically, that the names start to run together at a certain point. In addition, especially throughout the first half of the book, the scientists are from several different (mainly European) countries, and thus their work is taking place in many different laboratories in different cities. Just remembering which nationality someone is can be difficult at times. This is not a criticism of Rhodes; he could not begin to tell the story without all of these people being in it. But it is something to note for the general reader, especially someone who is unfamiliar with most chemists and physicists aside from Albert Einstein, who plays a minor, but pivotal, role in this drama. The most riveting chapter had to do with the actual dropping of the first atomic bomb, over Hiroshima, Japan on August 6, 1945. Rhodes, as he does throughout the book, allows the people involved in the story to explain their thoughts and feelings as much as possible. In this chapter, the remembrances of Japanese who survived the atomic attack are difficult to read. A sample, from page 722, the description by a thirty-year-old woman of encountering a dead person: “The corpse lying on its back on the road had been killed immediately.... Its hand was lifted to the sky and the fingers were burning with blue flames. The fingers were shortened to one-third and distorted. A dark liquid was running to the ground along the hand.” These types of horrible description go on for several pages. Rhodes does not do this to make a moral statement about the U.S. Dropping the bomb on Japan; in fact, he also notes that the Japanese leaders must share some of the blame as their desperate fighting, literally to the death, undoubtedly contributed to Harry Truman's decision to authorize the bombing. But instead he includes the morbid accounts so as the drive home the total devastation and utter ruin that the A-bomb brought into the world. As he accurately states, the bomb did not just destroy thousands of lives, but it completely wiped out an entire city. Rhodes concludes with a forty page Afterword, primarily focusing on the development of the “Super” (or H) bomb. Towards the end, he delves into a philosophic discussion about nation-states, nuclear policy and control, and warfare. While certainly relevant, after reading the preceding chapters detailing the creation of the bomb, it dropping on Japan, the immediate effects upon its people, and all of the political tugs of war in Los Alamos, NM and Washington, this reads as an anti-climax. This is not to say that it does not belong in the book. But rather, the discussion would have been enhanced by some capsules about what all of the various scientists went on to do following WWII. Los Alamos Director Robert Oppenheimer, as an example, had a painful life – both literally and figuratively – through the 1950s and up to his death in 1967. But Rhodes does not choose to mention any of Oppenheimer's travails. Still, it is hard to see how a more complete and accurate depiction of this world-changing event could be told. "
164,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6431984-antonio-rojas,5,"Monumental and Breathtaking!Is a breathtaking journey through the history of nuclear physics and the development of Atomic Theory. It is a masterpiece where Mr. Rhodes regales us with his gift for presenting difficult and intricate concepts in a very logical, insightful, colorful, and above all entertaining fashion.Loosely speaking, the first part of the book covers the key steps that carved the foundations of atomic theory: we get to witness J.J. Thompson discovering the electron; Ernest Rutherford realizing the existence of the nucleus and postulating his “Solar System” model of the atom; Niels Bohr, with a little help from spectroscopy improving that model and carving his more realistic Shell and Orbital design; Chadwick stalking and finally uncovering the neutron; Henri Becquerel and the Curies discovering radioactivity; Heisenberg working his Uncertainty Principle, Schrodinger developing wave mechanics, Pauli his Exclusion Principle. In addition, we become familiar with de Hevesy, John von Neumann, Wigner, Dirac, Millikan, Max Born, Arnold Sommerfeld, Paul Ehrenfest, in summary, all the big architects of Quantum Mechanics and modern physics. But what makes the book a truly superior piece is that Mr. Rhodes, while impeccably describing the science, he submerges the reader into the very personal and complex psychology of each of the characters and the historic context of the time. We see each of these great scientists come to life and wander through history in front of our eyes immersed in the chaotic social and military storm that surrounded the cataclysmic days of the First and Second World Wars.The second part of the book deals more specifically with the creation and the political steps leading to the use of the first atomic bombs on civilian populations by the United States government. We get to see Leo Szilard, the true brain behind the first idea of the atomic bomb and the first to conceptualize the science behind it and its potential consequences; we see Otto Hahn splitting the atom without realizing it and Lise Meitner and Otto Freisch interpreting and using for the first time the term “fission” to name the event; Enrico Fermi “slowing neutrons” and creating a sustained chain reaction; Wigner creating plutonium and enriching uranium; all of this, leading triumphantly to Los Alamos where we witness Edward Teller, Luis Alvarez, Hans Bethe, Lawrence and above all, Robert Oppenheimer, “I am become death, the destroyer of worlds”, where they orchestrated the biggest human effort and enterprise ever achieved: the ability to create the means of our own destruction. Mr. Rhodes cold and non-judgmental recompilation of first hand witnesses and victims of the explosions is both pathetic and truly horrifying. The harrowing images of children aimlessly wandering and holding strips of their own skin, women without feet walking on their ankles, or a man holding his eye in one hand create an infernal motion picture in our brain whose memory is very hard if not impossible to forget. At 790 comprehensive pages excluding Notes, Bibliography, Photo Credits and Index -886 in total- The Making of the Atomic Bomb is a monumental achievement that deserves all the accolades and awards it has gathered through the years. This book is a veritable must read, a must have, a classic."
165,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/204112-damon,5,"Richard Rhodes does a very impressive job of telling how we got to the atomic bomb. He starts in 1900 when Plank looked into a black box and found a new world. The Making of the Atomic Bomb explores the science that makes the bomb possible, the scientist who worked in breaking the atom, the politics which made people want to do it. In doing so it becomes one of the best introductions to quantum mechanics for the laymen. Much better than other books that try to join mysticism and science, Rhodes goes though, in prose, the basics of quantum mechanics and the people who made it. He has also not shy away from using the scientists metaphors to describe the world of the very small (Rutherford's cannon ball is one of the best), nor does he shy away from explaining the concepts that make the bomb possible, like why natural uranium does not explode and why plutonium is much better than uranium. Rhodes also provides a sense a drama the scientist and engineers in New Mexico start to build the bomb. When the first one is exploded, the reader feels a sense of achievement and pride at what man has wrought. And like all good writers, Rhodes is does not let us off the hook, the last portion of the book is a detailed description of the casualties of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The descriptions of the flash burn victims whose blacked, blistered skin peeled off their body exposing the muscle underneath is more than enough for anyone to appreciate Oppenheimer's quote: I am the creator, I am the destroyer.

Yes, it is very long. Yes, the narrative can feel a bit jumpy, especially in the first half. There are a lot of names being used, some of which never re-appear, and a lot of seemingly minor scientific experiments detailed exhaustively. And yes, Rhodes dedicates many pages to discussions that do not feel very relevant in 2013, but were very much so when it was written in the mid-80s and the idea that Russia might nuke us was not very far removed.But all of these elements come together in incredible fashion when the book builds up to moments of great importance: the confirmation of the splitting of the atom; the first self-sustaining nuclear reactor in Chicago; the attack on Pearl Harbor; the Trinity test; the dropping of Little Boy over Hiroshima. These sections are written beautifully and effectively convey the excitement and the historical ramifications. They would not be the same without all of the comprehensive background that is given beforehand, and it is hard to imagine this book being edited down very much.Strongly recommended to anybody with an interest in the bomb, or World War II in general."

Rhodes, gifted with sharp psychological insight and a novelist's ability to convey character, reveals the personalities and emotional dynamics among the scientists and others responsible for conceiving, engineering, testing and ultimately dropping the apocalyptic devices on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In addition he describes the struggle in Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan to make the first bomb, as well as the political and military events that led inexorably to the destruction of the Japanese cities.

If you like Cold War history and 20th century history, this book is a must read. How it actually all came together was so complex, it’s a miracle that it happened at all.I read this book back in 1988, just before I joined the Air Force.

175,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/941349-bob,5,"This is an extraordinary work, one of the finest nonfiction books I've ever read. Its breadth and depth of coverage are incredible. It is engagingly written, truly a book hard to put down. It is full of wonderful anecdotes and photographs. The book is a chronological account of the science, engineering, and politics that created the atomic bomb. It is basically in four parts: physics from around 1880 to 1938, physics from 1939 to 1943, engineering and politics from 1941 to 1945, and the postwar aftermath up to around 1955. The first two parts are largely in Europe, the third and fourth mostly in the US. I was not prepared for the depth of coverage of the period from about 1880 to 1938. It is marvelous story, an epic of human achievement well told. I started out in college as a physics major, so I was familiar with the broad outline of this, and many of the names were familiar. In spite of that, I learned an enormous amount. The book wisely keeps the focus on the people, and succeeds wonderfully in making us feel we know them, at least the major players. In summarizing the book, it's hard to know where to start; Rhodes must have felt the same thing. By 1890 or so it was known that there were tiny particles called electrons that were negatively charged, and that the chemical elements were defined by how many electrons were in each atom. Since atoms are neutral, there must be a corresponding positive charge in each atom, but where? For a while it was thought that the positive charge was a sort of smeared out substrate, like the dough in a muffin, with the electrons stuck in it like blueberries. This was disproven (making a long story short) by Ernest Rutherford, New Zealand born British physicist, a poor boy who grew up on a farm. He showed that the positive charge lies in a ""nucleus"", a very small dense center of the atom, with the electrons much farther out, sort of orbiting around like the planets in the solar system. It wasn't long before the proton was discovered, and the fact that the nucleus contains the same number of protons as there are electrons in the outer shell. It was also not long before it was realized that the planetary analogy would not hold. According to the very well established electromagnetic theory of James Clerk Maxwell, the electrons would simply spiral into the nucleus and the atom would cease to exist. Yet the evidence for protons and the nucleus was undeniable. But the electromagnetic theory of Maxwell was extremely highly regarded. In fact Einstein had just used it (1905) to develop the theory of relativity, also highly regarded. What is the explanation? The explanation is most important development in physics since Newton: quantum theory. Quantum theory began with Max Plank and Einstein around 1890-1900, but really got going after 1915 with the work of Niels Bohr, Erwin Schroedinger, Werner Heisenberg and P. A. M. Dirac. Rhodes does not talk too much about quantum theory itself. He manages to keep the focus on nuclear physics. However, he does point out an essential lesson of quantum theory: light is both a wave and a particle. These seemingly contradictory notions exist at the same time in one thing. Bohr came to call this paraodox-that-is-not-a-paradox ""complementarity."" This abstract idea is important later. Of the four names above, two are extremely significant in the story of the atom bomb: Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg. Bohr was born in Denmark in 1885, so was half a generation younger than Rutherford. He explained the atom by showing how the electrons stayed in well defined ""shells"" rather than orbits like planets. Heisenberg, a German, was half a generation younger yet, born in 1901. He and Schroedinger made huge breakthroughs in the 1920s showing that Bohr's model was still not right. Meanwhile, before 1900, Marie and Pierre Curie had discovered radioactivity. Some elements, notably radium and uranium, decomposed with time by ejecting nuclear particles and becoming lighter elements. Eventually (long story cut short) it was realized that the particles being ejected are often ""neutrons"", the last of the three basic particles to be discovered (James Chadwick, 1932). Neutrons live in the nucleus with protons and seem to be a sort of glue holding the nucleus together.  The first phase of the story ends and the second begins in 1939 with the realization by Otto Hahn, Lise Meitner, and her nephew Otto Frisch that a nucleus could be fractured or split by a neutron being ejected from another atom. The first atom might split into two much lighter atoms -- fission -- and eject two or more neutrons, which could in turn hit and split yet more atoms -- a chain reaction. This was a revolutionary idea, quickly understood by Bohr, who carried the news to the US. Soon, scientists in the US, England, Germany, and Japan (yes Japan) were asking themselves, could this chain reaction become a bomb? Meanwhile, of course, was the hugely important rise of Nazi Germany. Many scientists, especially the Jewish ones, fled Germany by 1939. Meitner fled to Sweden in 1938. Frisch fled to England. Bohr (with only one grandparent Jewish) was at first relatively safe in Denmark, and could travel to England and back, but eventually had to flee to Sweden in 1943. Einstein was long since at Princeton. But, as Rhodes explains, many others, who are not household words, fled Nazi Europe and became key players in the saga of the atomic bomb. Among these are Stanislaw Ulam from Poland, Hans Bethe from Germany, and the Hungarian trio of Leo Szilard, Eugene Wigner, and Edward Teller, all of whom came to the US. All played significant roles in the story of the bomb; Szilard and Teller became big actors in the story. Similarly, physicists were fleeing Italy, including Enrico Fermi and Emilio Segre. The second part of the story surges into high gear with the developments in physics showing that a bomb could really work. In England, Chadwick assembled a group that included Frisch and Rudolf Peierls, recently fled from Germany. It became known as the MAUD committee. Frisch and Peierls produced the Frisch–Peierls memorandum, which was the first document to detail how an atomic explosion could be generated. Bohr soon learned about it, as he was also in England. Long story cut short, a bomb could be made from uranium-235 or from plutonium. Uranium occurs rather commonly in nature, but over 99% of it is the form called 238, abbreviated U-238. You can't make a bomb from that, though you can use it for a nuclear reactor. If enough of the much more radioactive U-235 is gotten together in the right way, a bomb will result. Plutonium does not occur in nature and was first synthesized by Glenn Seaborg in the US in 1940. It is also radioactive enough to make a bomb. About the same time, in 1940 Heisenberg began to understand that uranium 235 could make a bomb. Heisenberg did not like Hitler, but he had no Jewish ancestors and no compelling reason to leave Germany. He was asked by the German army to investigate uses of uranium. Rhodes says that Heisenberg thought that the process of actually getting together enough U-235 would be too expensive and difficult, and that is why the German atomic bomb project never got anywhere. In 2000, Thomas Powers published a book called Heisenberg's War in which he claims that Heisenberg deliberately stalled the German atomic bomb project so that Hitler would never have the bomb. It remains controversial, but Rhodes (writing in 1987) does not talk much about Heisenberg. Nonetheless, the British and Bohr assumed that the Germans would understand everything that they did, and would certainly be doing bomb research. This key idea, that the allies must keep up with the Germans, is the start of the third part of the saga, the engineering and political story of the actual making of the bomb. Americans were working too. Already in 1939, Hungarian emigre Leo Szilard realized that fission could be used to make a nuclear reactor and possibly a bomb. Szilard had known Einstein years before; in fact in 1926 they had patented a refrigerator! He became almost obsessed with the idea that President Roosevelt must understand the threat of the Germans having a bomb. In July 1939, Szilard and Wigner drove to Long Island, where Einstein was staying (how they found him is an interesting story). They convinced Einstein to write the now famous letter to FDR urging that the matter be given the highest priority. FDR was impressed, but it took more than one letter. That's a long story; read the book!  Eventually, especially after the Americans learned of the British MAUD committee work, a high level committee was formed to begin the research and manufacture of a bomb. The leaders of this committee were Vannevar Bush, James Conant, and Arthur Compton. Vannevar Bush (no relation to the presidents Bush) was an older engineer, a longtime influential person in the highest levels of academe and government. James Conant was a chemist and the president of Harvard. Arthur Compton had won the Nobel prize in physics in 1927. All of these people are fleshed out wonderfully in Rhodes's book. The big question for the Americans, as it was for the Germans and Japanese, was could the enormous effort to produce the bomb pay off in time for World War II? First, why ""enormous effort""? As Niels Bohr said around 1940, to actually make such a bomb would take half of the industrial apparatus of the United States for two years. This turned out to be only a modest overstatement. Producing enough U-235 was a huge task. Many tons of uranium ore would have to be processed to produce U-238, then a huge painstaking process (invention of Ernest Lawrence) would have to follow. (The Japanese realized this too, and abandoned the atomic bomb as impractical.) Eventually, processing U-235 was done at the Oak Ridge site in Tennessee, a gigantic complex. The alternative was to use plutonium. Plutonium can be created with a nuclear reactor at lesser cost. However, in 1942 no one was sure how to make a bomb out of plutonium, as it is almost too good. If a critical mass is not brought together VERY promptly, it would ""fizzle"", yielding an explosion scarcely any better than chemical bombs. The atomic bomb, of course, is a hundred thousand times better than that. The decision in the US was to do both approaches, to use both U-235 and plutonium. Plutonium was manufactured at another huge new facility, the Hanford Plant in Washington state. These two plants provided the ""brawn"" for the making of the atomic bomb, and employed thousands of people. But the ""brain"" was the third brand new facility built from scratch, the Los Alamos laboratory in New Mexico. This brings us at last to two of the most important names in this subject, Robert Oppenheimer and Leslie Groves. Robert Oppenheimer was born in New York in 1904, the son of a wealthy Jewish importer. With his rather privileged upbringing, Robert had spent some summers in the high plateaus in northern New Mexico. (Photos of the young Oppenheimer look remarkably like Bob Dylan.) I'll skip over his background in physics and how he came to the attention of the Bush committee, but it was decided to put him in overall charge of the construction of the atomic bomb. This was soon given the name Manhattan Project. Based on Oppenheimer's recommendation, a boys' school at Los Alamos was purchased, along with a hundred square miles of surrounding land. Colonel Leslie Groves was appointed the military leader of the project, who technically was above Oppenheimer. Rhodes does a wonderful job sketching how their relationship evolved. In short, both Oppenheimer and Groves did a wonderful job.  Rhodes' description of the building of the Los Alamos lab and the recruiting of the scientists and their families is perhaps the best part of this uniformly excellent book. The big names came, as well as many unknown today and many who later became famous. Enrico Fermi (who had created the first nuclear reactor in history in Chicago), Segre, Frisch, Bohr, Richard Feynman, Ulam, Lawrence, Seaborg, Bethe, two of Fermi's proteges Leona Woods and Herbert Anderson, Peierls and his colleague Klaus Fuchs from England. All of these went on to distinguished careers in the following decades. (more about Klaus Fuchs later.) Security was tight. Not all could take it. Edward Condon, a physicist ironically born in Alamogordo NM, resigned after six weeks: ""The thing which upsets me the most is the extraordinary close security policy.... In my case I found that the extreme concern with security was morbidly depressing -- especially the censoring mail and telephone calls."" Much later he was the target of the House Un-American Activities Committee because he was a ""follower"" of a ""new revolutionary movement"", quantum mechanics!  To make a long story short again, perhaps the biggest problem they solved at Los Alamos was the plutonium bomb. As mentioned above, the key is to force a critical mass of plutonium into a very small volume very quickly, to harness the vast number of neutrons released in the chain reaction. A young physicist named Seth Neddermeyer had the key idea: implosion. That means, arrange a group of ordinary explosives around a hollow sphere of plutonium. Set off the explosives at the same time and they will compress the plutonium into critical mass. This is easier said than done, and besides Neddermeyer the person who made it work was George Kistiakowsky, an ordinance expert. Implosion is not necessary in a U-235 bomb, but, as mentioned above, plutonium is easier to manufacture. There is one strong lesson from all of this: it is very hard to build an atomic bomb! Good! One more physics topic before we get to the more political aspects. The idea of using the energy from a fission bomb (uranium or plutonium atomic bomb) to initiate a fusion reaction (hydrogen bomb) was first proposed casually by Enrico Fermi to Edward Teller in the fall of 1941. Teller latched onto it and made it his ""baby"" until the first hydrogen bomb was detonated in 1952. During the war years at Los Alamos he insisted on working on it even though most of the others said to let it go until after the war. He was vindicated when it did indeed unleash 1000 times more energy than the atomic bombs. To quickly wrap up this phase, the Manhattan project succeeded in producing two plutonium bombs (the one tested in the New Mexico desert and one that fell on Nagasaki) and one U-235 bomb, the one that fell on Hiroshima. Now to the 500 pound gorilla in the room: was all this necessary? Was it morally correct to build and use the bomb, killing 130,000 people? The physicists who worked on the bomb did so almost entirely to make sure that the Allies would not be behind the Germans, who they felt sure were working on an atomic bomb. Many, perhaps half, of those physicists, had escaped Nazi persecution. This was a real and palpable threat to them. I do not see how anyone can argue with that. But did any of them see farther into the future? One especially did so: Niels Bohr. If reading this book will do nothing else, it will make you respect Niels Bohr. Already in 1943, as Los Alamos was just being built, Bohr was looking ahead to a post-war world with atomic weapons. He was terrified at the idea. He held no illusions that we in the US could keep the weapon for ourselves. Once successfully demonstrated, he had no doubt that the Soviet Union could build one in a few years. Indeed, he assumed they were already aware of the Manhattan Project. His solution was radical openness, his ""principle of complementarity."" Recall that this is the phrase he used twenty years earlier to grasp the apparently contradictory notions of quantum mechanics.  Complementarity means that the atomic bomb is a two-edged sword. On the one hand it is a terrible weapon, having the potential to unleash horrific suffering. On the other hand, since governments will realize that, they will be forced to not use it, to try much harder than ever to maintain peace. To help this along, he wanted the US to not only make it clear to everyone that the Manhattan Project was going on, he wanted the US to share everything we learned. He wanted in essence to give away the blueprints (not to the Germans during the war of course), that we would in this way generate enormous good will.  Making a long story short, in 1944 he gained personal audiences with both FDR and Churchill to push this idea. FDR was sympathetic. Churchill was appalled, to the extent that he wanted Bohr arrested. When FDR and Churchill met later in 1944, Churchill prevailed against the already enfeebled FDR, and that was the end of Bohr's far reaching vision. At least, he was not arrested. What about the idea that dropping the bombs on Japan was unnecessary, that the death toll was unprecedented? Rhodes points out that at least the second half of this statement is incorrect. There were already horrific bombings and killings. We all know about the holocaust, but many people today don't seem to know about the German executions of at least 500,000 prisoners in Russia, or the terrible murders and rapes that the Japanese perpetrated in China, which killed 150,000 civilians, or the Battle of Britain, in which the English lost 40,000, or the Dresden fire bombing that killed 25,000, or the Tokyo fire bombing in which 334 B29 bombers killed 90,000 people. The death toll from Hiroshima and Nagasaki was absolutely not unprecedented. Most Americans who lived through those years think that the atomic bombs ended the war and saved several hundred thousand American lives, and probably 500,000 Japanese. A few comments on the fourth phase of this book, the postwar period: Klaus Fuchs, mentioned above, was a Russian spy. He served nine years in prison in England, later emigrated to East Germany. Rhodes never mentions Julius or Ethel Rosenberg. I find that a bit odd. Oppenheimer had married a woman who had been a member of the communist party. This caused him trouble in 1941, but he was appointed to Los Alamos in spite of it. After the war, he had a very good career at Berkeley and Princeton. In 1949 he lost his security clearance because of his prewar communist sympathies, and because of the struggle with Edward Teller, who was championing the building of the hydrogen bomb. Oppenheimer was seen by the scientific community as a martyr to McCarthyism. He came to represent the struggle between right-wing militarists (symbolized by Teller) and left-wing intellectuals (symbolized by Oppenheimer) over the moral question of nuclear bombs.  To wrap up this already long review, let's return once more to the question of should the US have dropped the bombs on Japan. I will let Leona Woods have the last word. She later went on to a long career as a physicist:  ""I certainly do recall how I felt when the atomic bombs were used. My brother-in-law was captain of the first minesweeper. My brother was a Marine on Okinawa. I'm sure they would not have lasted in an invasion. It was clear the war would continue, with half a million of our fighting men dead not to say how many Japanese. You know and I know that [we] firebombed Tokyo and nobody even mentions the slaughter that happened then. They think Nagasaki and Hiroshima were something [very bad] compared to the firebombing. THEY'RE WRONG! I have no regrets. I think we did right, and we couldn't have done it differently. Yeah, I know it has been suggested the second bomb, Nagasaki, was not necessary. ... when you are in a war, to the death, I don't think you stand around and ask, Is it right?' """
176,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85753449-pritam-chattopadhyay,4,"In the foreword to this extremely interesting book, the author writes: The closing days of the Second World War marked a similar turning point in human history, the point of entry into a new era when humankind for the first time acquired the means of its own destruction. The discovery of how to release nuclear energy, and its application to build weapons of mass destruction, has gradually removed the prejudice on which total war is based: the insupportable conviction that there is a limited amount of energy available in the world to concentrate into explosives, that it is possible to accumulate more of such energy than one’s enemies and thereby militarily to prevail. So cheap, so portable, so holocaustal did nuclear weapons eventually become that even nation-states as belligerent as the Soviet Union and the United States preferred to sacrifice a portion of their national sovereignty—preferred to forego the power to make total war—rather than be destroyed in their fury.First published in 1986, this scrupulously researched and broad narrative by Richard Rhodes is the author’s ultimate account, tracing the expansion of the world’s eventual apocalyptic weapon from its origins as a problem in theoretical physics to its devastating culmination at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The book, at the same time, is also a chronicle of the personalities and greatest minds of the 20th century—especially Robert Oppenheimer, Niels Bohr, Leo Szilard, Enrico Fermi, Edward Teller, and Ernest Lawrence — and their inputs to developing the atomic bomb. Rhodes describes exhaustively the great scientific achievements that led up to the invention of the atomic bomb. Everything of importance is examined, from the discovery of the atomic nucleus and of nuclear fission to the emergence of quantum physics, the invention of the mass-spectroscope and of the cyclotron, the creation of such man-made elements as plutonium and tritium, and implementation of the nuclear chain reaction in uranium. Even more important, Rhodes shows how these achievements were thrust into the arms of the state, which culminated in the unfolding of the nuclear arms race. Often brilliantly, he records the rise of fascism and of anti-Semitism, and the intensification of nationalist ambitions. He traces the outbreak of WW II, which provoked a hysterical rivalry among nations to devise the bomb.Rhodes does a brilliant job in explaining the Manhattan Project, with a host of elements on everything from laboratory experiments to training of bombing pilots.The author prophetically observes : I think of a world without nuclear weapons not as a utopian dream but simply as a world where delivery times have been deliberately lengthened to months or even years, with correspondingly longer periods interim during which to resolve disputes short of war. In such a world, if negotiations fail, if conventional skirmishes fail, if both sides revert to arming themselves with nuclear weapons again—then at worst we will only arrive once more at the dangerous precipice where we all stand now.The discovery of how to release nuclear energy, like all fundamental scientific discoveries, changed the structure of human affairs—permanently.How that happened is the story this book attempts to tell."
177,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5672051-brahm,5,"The Making of the Atomic Bomb in audiobook form is just over 37 hours (the book clocks in at 900 pages). It was an immense history of EVERYTHING connected to the atomic weapons program, starting with a great chapter on the ancient philosophy of science, to primers on chemistry and physics, to the evolution of weapons of mass destruction including horrific WWI gas weapons, to post-WWI European politics, to stories of individual scientists and their cumulative discoveries, to stories of the supply chain and secret politics that had to be developed to feed the US atomic weapons program. The book converges to, and ends immediately after the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The Making of the Atomic Bomb was immense, powerful, and comprehensive. I loved the technical depth and the personal stories of the scientists and other actors involved. It feels like I just finished a University course. The pace of scientific discovery in the late 1930s is nothing short of amazing, and the scientists are such interesting characters. In the final chapter, the first-hand accounts of the immediate aftermath of Hiroshima and Nagasaki are graphic and deeply disturbing. It's a big change in tone; you invest hours and hours reading/listening about scientific, political, industrial and engineering progress, making it difficult to face the gut-wrenching, violent outcome. Better understanding of atomic theory and history, but mostly the consequences of nuclear weapons leaves me feeling unsettled over the range and number of nuclear weapons that exist today. They're in the background; we don't think about them. I didn't ever seriously consider or understand the physical damage these weapons can cause, OR the political consequences (ie, the world is locked in an eternal standoff of nuclear powers, even if we don't hear it on the news every day). The audiobook was narrated by Holter Graham. I am brand-new to audiobooks, but I thought it was exceptionally well read. I wonder if dense books are especially well-suited to audiobooks, as a bit of inflection and tone by a careful narrator can really bring a serious, technical and/or dense material to life. "
178,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3816725-larry-bassett,3,"I have to thank audible books for allowing me to actually experience this book. I am pretty sure I never would’ve gotten through even the first half of the book without the help of a skilled reader. I would give the first half of the book 2 stars and the last half of the book 4 stars does arriving at the medium of three stars. The first half or more of the book is way too complicated for my simple science knowledge. It might be very interesting to someone more versed in physics. It goes into great detail about 19th century and early 20th century physics discoveries and it is indefatigable in naming names! Way beyond my ability to compute.The second half of a book is exceedingly more interesting story for the average reader. Some of it you will of heard before but some of the inside stories of the relationships of the scientists Was new information to me. The relationship between science and engineering is something that I am not familiar with. A lot of the story about the development of theory and experimentation. And then an implementation is fascinating. The expansion and development of this $2 billion project beginning with essentially vacant ground in los Alamos and Hartford and Tennessee was very well documented. In the entire book there are about 2600 footnotes. Thank goodness the audible reading skips over those. At the end of the Kindle book there are many photographs of the many characters that appear in starring and supporting roles.I am not sure what the major takeaways of this book are. There is a fair amount of discussion about the debate about the good and evil of the atomic bomb. There was considerable hope among scientists that the bomb might force us to create a world of peace. There was of course some dissension about the use of the bomb but it is clear that once the bomb was created, there was no doubt that it would be used.There are many more pages about the horror of the injuries and deaths in Hiroshima then where necessary. We have read those pages too often. The fact that they were literally getting a third Byam ready when JAPAN finally surrendered is not something I have heard about previously. The argument about the bomb saving American lives was pretty well implanted in this book."
179,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56863096-jeremy,4,"Excellently told history of the incredible story of the development of the atomic bomb. Rhodes starts with some of the history of modern physics as it relates to different developments that led to the bomb, including the scientists. It was great to see Niels Bohr get his proper due; he commonly seems to be overlooked, at least among the general public, as one of the most important scientists in history (though he wasn't directly involved in the Manhattan Project). The science throughout this book is quite thorough and complex. After a while I gave up trying to see if I could follow it. While I appreciate that this book is trying to be comprehensive, for my taste he could have backed off the science a little bit. That said, the feat was incredible, and it is equally incredible that a chain reaction of splitting atoms can create such enormous destructive power.The last third or so of the book was exciting, as we got a behind the scenes look at the political and scientific progress towards the inevitable, and a front row seat to the first test of an atomic bomb. Rhodes spends some time in Hiroshima describing the awful outcome of the bomb in all its brutal reality. I was unaware that the Japanese would have potentially surrendered conditionally, but the US was demanding unconditional surrender. There were a number of prescient voices, Bohr's included, that understood what nuclear weapons meant for the world, a threat we must all now live with. Many of those working on the project experienced the cognitive dissonance of being successful with their work, and the fact that it meant terrible death and destruction for innocent lives, and changed the world forever."
180,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63879552-sebastian,5,"BLUF:There are not many books I would recommend more whole-heartedly. Just read it.Details:This is the story of science, industry, and politics, and how humanity went from wondering about structure of the atom in 1910 to dropping exploding balls of plutonium over Japan in 1945.We begin with bunch of European physicists who in the 1920s and 30s, discover the nature of the atom: Rutherford in England discovering the nucleus in 1911, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle in 1926, the Bohr model, Chadwick's discovery of the neutron in 1932, Fermi's 1934 experiments with neutron bombardment in Rome, and finally Otto Hahn and Lise Meitner publishing on nuclear fission in 1938. Rhodes paints a picture of a world of perhaps 100 physicists who knew each other personally and moved around frequently to collaborate for short periods of time. I wonder how funding worked (when Oppenheimer does research at Cavendish, or similar -- were do the dollars come from?) but no-one seems to worry about grants. Another thing that struck me was how broad some of these scientists were. Einstein and Szilard take a couple years off particle physics to study refrigeration in the 1930s. It's interesting to thing about this period of rapid progress against the example of Bell Labs. Common elements seem to be freedom from funding and publishing concerns, and a degree of flexibility in field of study. Unlike Bell, they aren't as commercially-focused although there is a goal that everyone is working against at least implicitly to map the structure of the atom. Also, Bohr is this convener and hub for the physicists, and I'm not sure a similar figure existed at Bell Labs.1938 is a pivotal year. Hahn / Meitner's write up on fission makes it clear to everyone that a fission chain reaction could power a new source of energy -- or a powerful new weapon. All of the fun of science and discovery takes on new meaning when our science Bund discovers their knowledge could be used for destructive ends. Hitler's Anschluss absorbs Austria and persecution of Jews in Germany begins.* Bohr heroically rounds up as many Jewish scientists as he can and whisks them off to Denmark; Szilard in the UK helps get more to England and the US.The war begins and scientists relocate the United States. Szilard, Einstein, and others (""The Hungarian Conspiracy"") attempt to educate military leadership and Roosevelt himself of the destructive power of the bomb. Eventually they do succeed and the great INDUSTRIAL project of the atomic bomb begins. I went in to the book thinking that Los Alamos would be comparable to Bell Labs. It isn't. As alluded to earlier, most scientists who saw the Meitner/Hahn paper in 1938 could surmise a bomb was possible. What differentiated the US from other countries who were pursing nuclear weapons was that we had the industrial capacity and resources to set up Hanford in Oregon to produce plutonium, and enrich uranium in meaningful quantities at Oak Ridge. But the leap to a bomb wasn't one of great scientific innovation, but rather production.The book ends with about 100 pages describing the Japanese victims of the US nuclear attack. The contrast to the joyful early days of Fermi running up and down his hallway on Via Panisperna and taking measurements with his Geiger counter is stark. Sometimes history unfolds in unexpected ways.Far too much to say about the book than can put in writing. Just read it.*A crazy early anecdote talked about how Chaim Weizmann secured the Balfour Declaration in support of a Jewish homeland during WWI in exchange for supporting the government manufacture acetone which was badly needed for artillery. You can't make this stuff up."
181,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11476806-g-d-brennan,4,"I think this book is a touch overrated.Having said that, I couldn't put it down.""The Making of the Atomic Bomb"" is incredibly well-researched; it's thought-provoking and deep, yet lively and literary. And make no mistake, it is well worth your while; its greatest sections and passages are as absorbing and exciting as anything I've ever read. (As a precocious 4th grader prone to fleeing the world by burying my nose in books, I'd read eagerly about the incredible feats of engineering and physics that went into the atomic bombs; this book made me revert to my 4th-grade-self, walking around Chicago oblivious to the comparatively drab sights and sounds of the real world as I explored the livelier world within.) And given the primary research Rhodes has done, especially the interviews with many of the physicists and chemists who literally manufactured history in a hastily-assembled laboratory in the New Mexico desert, it seems impossible that anyone could put together even a comparably comprehensive history without copiously copping from this one. Nothing else compares; it is the ""War and Peace"" of our only nuclear war.And yet, this feels like a science experiment where one has settled on a hypothesis prior to doing the research, and has ignored or minimized those results that threatened the theory. Rhodes takes us through virtually all of 20th century atomic physics, but he's assembled it in a structure that resembles one of those black hole coin wells one sees at the science center; everything starts out slow and lazy and happy, but eventually things get more energetic and more frentic; valuable time is lost, and valuable money disappears into an abyss of war and militarism. Also, if it shares ""War and Peace's"" strengths, it also shares its flaws; rather than sticking around to observe things and let events speak for themselves, the author spends many of the closing pages on maddening flights of philosophical fancy centered around the potential for worldwide Armageddon that the atomic bomb unleashed. When Rhodes was writing and researching this book--from 1981 to 1986, according to the endnotes--such fears surely seemed lively and compelling, topical and true, matters of monumental import to the whole human race; now they feel quaint and outdated. (In these post 9/11 days of endless hot wars, one almost feels nostalgic for the Cold War. Armageddon clocks ticking down the minutes to midnight? ICBMs on alert in North Dakota, waiting for the launch signals that would send them off on flaming arcs over the polar ice cap, but held at bay only by the prospect of Mutual Assured Destruction? I'll take that over fanatical and resourceful terrorists with a divine mandate any day. Our current world makes MAD feel sane.) At any rate, one realizes at the end that Rhodes' musings are not mere detours at the end of a masterful narrative; they have also warped its course, for in between his excellent chronicling of the bomb's development, Rhodes gets pulled off by other vectors, particularly by Neils Bohr's utopian musings about making nuclear weapons research subject to the same standards of openness and free disclosure that prevail in the rest of scientific discourse.And it's a shame, because in the vast majority of the narrative Rhodes proves himself to be an incredibly talented writer and reporter, with a telling eye for facts and details, and an ease with complicated scientific concepts and analogies that, in turn, sets the reader at ease. I have read many other books on similar subjects and studied nuclear physics at the college level; still, I found myself learning new things from Rhodes' lucid and cogent descriptions of, say, the way a uranium atom fissions almost like a raindrop, or the way a cyclotron spins and separates atomic particles. And he weaves these descriptions into memorable scenes and stories; his descriptions of the construction and operation of the first nuclear reactor, a round-ish pile of graphite bricks and uranium trussed up by wooden scaffolding and nestled in a squash court at the University of Chicago, for instance, are lyrical and unforgettable. It is fascinating to read about the world's top nuclear physicists engaging in an experiment that was by turns precise and haphazard; it is engrossing to envision Enrico Fermi plotting neutron fluxes and calculating reaction coefficients while many of his staff members were wearing leftover raccoon coats to warm themselves against the Chicago winter because they had built the world's first nuclear reactor in an unheated building.Rhodes turns these dead physicists into live characters by keeping his eyes open for the characteristic anecdotes, and his ear tuned for the telling quotes. During the Manhattan Project, for instance, General Leslie Groves, frustrated at wartime copper shortages that threatened to derail the construction of uranium-separating cyclotrons, decided to borrow thousands of tons of silver from the Treasury to build them instead; his assistant was told: ""Colonel, in the Treasury we do not speak of tons of silver; our unit is the troy ounce."" Eventually they ended up with over 10,000 tons of silver, though; Rhodes judiciously uses this fact, and others, to convey the sheer magnitude of America's nuclear effort. Thanks to the Manhattan Project, a whole city sprung up in Tennessee to support the uranium processing efforts, a city with tens of thousands of people which nonetheless remained off the map. And meanwhile the government was establishing the Hanford reservation in Washington State--an area a third the size of Rhode Island. The upshot of all of these efforts, Rhodes tells us, was that the U.S. essentially constructed a nuclear industry from scratch and grew it, in three short years, to be the size of the automobile industry.And yet, of course, it was not about industry alone, but about dropping the product of that industry on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Here, too, I must take issue with the author; he expounds at length on Hiroshima, to the point that one almost becomes numb to its horrors, and yet he skimps on describing Nagasaki. The bomb used there was the more complicated and technically challenging of the two. (The tricky details of its construction end up taking far more space in the narrative than those for the relatively simple gun-type Hiroshima bomb; despite his revulsion at its use, Rhodes clearly admires the complicated engineering challenge it represented.) The mission which dropped it nearly ended up an unqualified and costly failure after it met with a string of bad luck. (Or good luck, at least, for the citizens of Kokura, the Japanese city which was saved from dubious immortality and near-total destruction thanks to unexpectedly cloudy weather that sent the second nuclear mission on to its secondary target; it is doubtful that bad weather has ever been more beneficial for a city and its populace.) And yet the last use of nuclear weapons in anger merits barely more than a page in this lengthy narrative, which is unfair to the reader, unfair to the story, and unfair to the hapless citizens of Nagasaki, whose fluke-filled fate deserves to be better remembered than as a glorified footnote.Short shrift, too, is given to the considerable efforts of Soviet spies at security-heavy Los Alamos; it is possible that much of this information was simply not known when Rhodes wrote, and he did cover this subject in his later ""Dark Sun;"" still, it means this feels somewhat incomplete.None of this is to say that one should avoid this book; it's massive enough and weighty enough that one simply can't avoid it if one is even tangentially interested in these topics. (Indeed, if one were to read only one book on the development and first use of the atomic bomb, this should probably be it.) Still, despite its lengthy word count, its thorough research, and its generally excellent writing, this is neither the last word nor the only word on its subject. "
182,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4828849-michael-burnam-fink,5,"""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.""Robert Oppenheimer, director of the Los Alamos lab, chief designer of the atomic bomb, and a polymath with mystic and leftist inclinations, had the perfect quote for the first artificial dawn of an atomic explosion. There are many ways in which we die: disease, age, accident, violence. And many ways in which we might all die; suddenly in the wake of some cosmological catastrophe or slowly starving on a dying planet. With the atom bomb, it was now possible for a single individual, at the top of a chain of technological and political commitments, to kill almost everyone in the space of an afternoon. The bombs were only used in anger twice, punctuation to end the global slaughter of the Second World War. Since then, history has existed under the shadow of a potential mushroom cloud. This book is the story of how we got there.Rhodes takes almost the first half of the book to establish the basic science and personalities of the atomic bomb. The first half of the 20th century was a golden age for physics which will likely never be equaled, as imaginative theorists and skilled experimenters probed the basic building blocks of the universe. Rutherford and Bohr nailed down, for the first time in evidence rather than speculation, the basic building blocks of matter. Atoms had most of their mass in a small nucleus, and owed their chemical properties to the quantum behavior of electron shells. The neutron was added to the list of fundamental particles. New elements were created by neutron bombardment, and by the late 1930s it was widely known that uranium would fission on bombardment, splitting into two lighter elements, and releasing a large deal of energy. There positive glee of work in this field, at this time, comes through in Rhodes' able biographical sketches of the scientists involved, particularly Bohr, Fermi, and Szilard.Szilard was the first to think of the potential of a fission chain reaction. If some substance, on absorbing a neutron split and released two or more neutrons, could produce a great deal of energy in millionths of a second. It would be a bomb of stupendous power, a city-smasher. Politically perceptive, Szilard had been helping Jewish physicists flee the Nazis for years. He had hoped for an H.G. Wells inspired international coalition to peacefully control this new power, but in 1939 if the bomb was too be invented, best by the Americans or British rather than Hitler.The next section, building the bomb, is less fun. Bohr predicted that you would need to turn all of America into a factory to build a bomb, and that is what the Manhattan project did, mobilizing thousands of scientists, $2 billion, and massive plants to do the hard work of separating fissile U-235 and Plutonium from natural uranium. Bureaucratic confusion and balky precision engineering made the task anything but easy. The other powers pursued the bomb. The British sent over their best to help with the Manhattan project. Germany's team, lead by Heisenberg, never had the necessary priority in the Reich, and were stalled by clever British-Norwegian sabotage directed at a heavy water production facility required for the Nazi reactor design. Japan never had access to the raw material to move beyond theory.The last section is grimmer yet. The design of the bomb was an exercise in precision, in delicately engineered explosive lenses to make the implosion to critical mass happen smoothly in nanoseconds. Tibbetts' B-29 bomber group trained to a razor's edge to accomplish the mission of deploying the 'gadget'. Roosevelt, on approving the Manhattan project, had instinctively reserved the bomb to himself as President. In 1945, Vice President Truman had not been read into the project until he succeeded to the presidency. The bomb was used on Hiroshima because it could be, because the Japanese still resisted, and because something had to be shown for the effort invested. It was a crime, a mass-murder in an instant. Rhodes does not flinch from the horror of Hiroshima.Personally, I think we need to distinguish between the bomb's use at the end of the Second World War, where it seems a matter of degree compared to area bombing rather than kind, and its use now, where that would signal breaking the nuclear taboo. This does not absolve the scientists who built the bomb of their responsibility. Nature's secrets were all around, and once fission had been theorized it was probably only a matter of time before someone figured out how to make it work, but these people made a choice to build Death a supersonic jet bomber to replicate his tired old horse. The Making of the Atomic Bomb is a penetrating look at the most consequential scientific and political moment of the 20th century. I'd give it six stars, if I could. It is also my 1000th review on Goodreads!"
183,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8511956-lance,5,"Probably the best book ever written on the atomic bomb, from the early science to the aftermath of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

185,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2209582-ross,3,"This is an exhaustive history of the bombs development., some 900 pages. The first half deals with the fundamental physics that makes nuclear weapons possible. The remainder deals with the actual development.My previous understanding of the bomb history stemmed from a movie some 20 years ago. In this film Albert Einstein perceives the potential for the bomb based on his famous equationE=MC squared. He quickly contacts President Roosevelt and FDR assigns a General Groves to develop the bomb ASAP in order to end the war.The actual truth is almost unbelievable.In the late 1930’s physicists in Europe realize that the fission of uranium can be used to make a bomb. Most of these scientists are Jews and they flee Hitler to the U.S. terrified that Germany will develop the bomb. Using what connections they can they approach officers separately in the U.S. army and navy. In both instances they are laughed at. Now more terrified than ever they approach Einstein, hoping his prestige can get word of the danger to someone in power. Einstein actually does have a contact that knows FDR and a letter from Einstein, actually written by our refugee physicists, is taken to the White House and read to FDR. The President seems impressed and says he will act on it. What he actually does is assign a bureaucrat in the Department of Standards to look into this thing. The bureaucrat now puts the letter in his safe and does nothing. It never occurs to FDR to follow-up on what is being done.Meanwhile the Germans and British are working on development and the British think the U.S. is also working on it A year later Churchill concerned about what the U.S. is doing sends a delegation over to discuss the project. They are horrified to find nothing is being done. A lot of screaming and yelling now takes place and finally General Groves is assigned.More than a year had been lost and we are very lucky today that we don’t have to speak German."
186,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7226831-josh-friedlander,5,"An epic topic, perhaps the epic topic, matched by a book epic in scope and detail. Rhodes starts off at the beginning of 20th century understanding of the atom, going into intricate detail about the lives of Bohr, Rutherford, Szilard, et al. He seems equally happy talking about Kierkegaard's Either/Or philosophy, the Pacific Theatre, or the intricacies of isolating Uranium-235. There's a lot of science in this book - I googled a lot but still felt like I missed enough to justify a second reading sometime - and some coverage of the effects of the bomb, the moral concerns of the scientists and politicians involved in its deployment, and the state of today's world. Rhodes wrote this book in the mid-1980s, but of course, the great, numbing, existential threat of the bomb still looms over us today; even if we think of it less."
187,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14945161-sandy-maguire,5,"Amazing book. The first act is a fantastic set of tableaus about the physicists and progression of science necessary to discover the capabilities of the atom. The second act is somewhat dry, regarding mostly the politicking necessary to have made the bomb happen, but there is some decent engineering spliced in here and there. The third is about the war effort, the Trinity test, and the eventual dropping of the bomb. The last chapter is horrifying and not something I'd describe as the feel-good read of the year, but it helps to drive home just how terrible these things are.I would strongly recommend this book to everyone."

It's 800+ pages of tiny text, but there's not a superfluous sentence to be found. Just a staggering amount of information. And no wonder - this book is a textbook of physics in the first half of the 20th century, a case study of the relationship between science and war (and scientists and soldiers), and a history of the rising tolerability of mass civilian slaughter, combined with multiple biographies of some of history's most characteristic scientists.The climax of the book from Trinity to Nagasaki is awesome, cinematic, and chilling. This is a serious investment, but well worth your time."

Like, uber. Not just an exhaustive regarding the scientific aspects, but the social, political and wartime factors that contributed and led up to the creation of the most destructive weapon ever conceived. Even ample knowledge of the personal lives of the scientists involved is conveyed. There is so much about the development of the bomb that I certainly wasn't aware of and I would venture to say that most people aren't. How close that the Nazi's were to developing their own nuclear device, and the fact that the Japanese were actively researching their own atomic bomb. Overall, its good. Very good. But if you're more broadly interested in the history of the nuke... this book might drive you insane. Its hardcore. Also this book stops directly after the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the surrender of Japan, which seems a shame. So much of interest happens in the next several years, including the development of thermonuclear bomb technology (which is conceptually covered in the book), USSR espionage contributing to their own bomb development and the first stages of the arms race."

While it didn't change my mind about nuclear weapons, it did a lot to deepen my thinking about them. Was reading about the successful Trinity test at the moment my wife's water broke and we went to the hospital to have our first baby, which was pretty timely. "
193,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6871223-aaron-million,4,"Richard Rhodes' monumental undertaking here is both admirable and daunting at the same time. As one might expect, the story of the development of the atomic bomb, and of atomic power in general, does not occur overnight and does not involved just a few individuals. It evolves over decades of often pain-staking work done by scientists who span a wide range of nationalities, specialties, opinions, and motivations. As such, a thorough job requires a lot of work – both for Rhodes and for the reader. Not being well-versed in science, and especially in physics, the sections containing detailed discussions of neutrons, electrons, atomic elements, chain reactions, volts, etc... were not the easiest for me to absorb. But that is due to my limited capacity to understand those things, not to Rhodes' writing or researching skills. In fact, he is not just writing for a scientific audience, but for a general audience. Thus, he cannot delve too far into the weeds of nuclear physics without losing quite a few people. But he cannot, at the same time, brush past very important discoveries and experiments. He does an admirable job of finding middle ground: not too detailed to discourage readers, but not superficial enough to upset scientists who understand these advanced topics. Almost as much of a struggle as the scientific aspect, is the difficulty in keeping all of the main characters (and there is no shortage of these) straight. So many people provided significant contributions to the development of the bomb: scientifically, politically, militarily, economically, that the names start to run together at a certain point. In addition, especially throughout the first half of the book, the scientists are from several different (mainly European) countries, and thus their work is taking place in many different laboratories in different cities. Just remembering which nationality someone is can be difficult at times. This is not a criticism of Rhodes; he could not begin to tell the story without all of these people being in it. But it is something to note for the general reader, especially someone who is unfamiliar with most chemists and physicists aside from Albert Einstein, who plays a minor, but pivotal, role in this drama. The most riveting chapter had to do with the actual dropping of the first atomic bomb, over Hiroshima, Japan on August 6, 1945. Rhodes, as he does throughout the book, allows the people involved in the story to explain their thoughts and feelings as much as possible. In this chapter, the remembrances of Japanese who survived the atomic attack are difficult to read. A sample, from page 722, the description by a thirty-year-old woman of encountering a dead person: “The corpse lying on its back on the road had been killed immediately.... Its hand was lifted to the sky and the fingers were burning with blue flames. The fingers were shortened to one-third and distorted. A dark liquid was running to the ground along the hand.” These types of horrible description go on for several pages. Rhodes does not do this to make a moral statement about the U.S. Dropping the bomb on Japan; in fact, he also notes that the Japanese leaders must share some of the blame as their desperate fighting, literally to the death, undoubtedly contributed to Harry Truman's decision to authorize the bombing. But instead he includes the morbid accounts so as the drive home the total devastation and utter ruin that the A-bomb brought into the world. As he accurately states, the bomb did not just destroy thousands of lives, but it completely wiped out an entire city. Rhodes concludes with a forty page Afterword, primarily focusing on the development of the “Super” (or H) bomb. Towards the end, he delves into a philosophic discussion about nation-states, nuclear policy and control, and warfare. While certainly relevant, after reading the preceding chapters detailing the creation of the bomb, it dropping on Japan, the immediate effects upon its people, and all of the political tugs of war in Los Alamos, NM and Washington, this reads as an anti-climax. This is not to say that it does not belong in the book. But rather, the discussion would have been enhanced by some capsules about what all of the various scientists went on to do following WWII. Los Alamos Director Robert Oppenheimer, as an example, had a painful life – both literally and figuratively – through the 1950s and up to his death in 1967. But Rhodes does not choose to mention any of Oppenheimer's travails. Still, it is hard to see how a more complete and accurate depiction of this world-changing event could be told. "
194,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6431984-antonio-rojas,5,"Monumental and Breathtaking!Is a breathtaking journey through the history of nuclear physics and the development of Atomic Theory. It is a masterpiece where Mr. Rhodes regales us with his gift for presenting difficult and intricate concepts in a very logical, insightful, colorful, and above all entertaining fashion.Loosely speaking, the first part of the book covers the key steps that carved the foundations of atomic theory: we get to witness J.J. Thompson discovering the electron; Ernest Rutherford realizing the existence of the nucleus and postulating his “Solar System” model of the atom; Niels Bohr, with a little help from spectroscopy improving that model and carving his more realistic Shell and Orbital design; Chadwick stalking and finally uncovering the neutron; Henri Becquerel and the Curies discovering radioactivity; Heisenberg working his Uncertainty Principle, Schrodinger developing wave mechanics, Pauli his Exclusion Principle. In addition, we become familiar with de Hevesy, John von Neumann, Wigner, Dirac, Millikan, Max Born, Arnold Sommerfeld, Paul Ehrenfest, in summary, all the big architects of Quantum Mechanics and modern physics. But what makes the book a truly superior piece is that Mr. Rhodes, while impeccably describing the science, he submerges the reader into the very personal and complex psychology of each of the characters and the historic context of the time. We see each of these great scientists come to life and wander through history in front of our eyes immersed in the chaotic social and military storm that surrounded the cataclysmic days of the First and Second World Wars.The second part of the book deals more specifically with the creation and the political steps leading to the use of the first atomic bombs on civilian populations by the United States government. We get to see Leo Szilard, the true brain behind the first idea of the atomic bomb and the first to conceptualize the science behind it and its potential consequences; we see Otto Hahn splitting the atom without realizing it and Lise Meitner and Otto Freisch interpreting and using for the first time the term “fission” to name the event; Enrico Fermi “slowing neutrons” and creating a sustained chain reaction; Wigner creating plutonium and enriching uranium; all of this, leading triumphantly to Los Alamos where we witness Edward Teller, Luis Alvarez, Hans Bethe, Lawrence and above all, Robert Oppenheimer, “I am become death, the destroyer of worlds”, where they orchestrated the biggest human effort and enterprise ever achieved: the ability to create the means of our own destruction. Mr. Rhodes cold and non-judgmental recompilation of first hand witnesses and victims of the explosions is both pathetic and truly horrifying. The harrowing images of children aimlessly wandering and holding strips of their own skin, women without feet walking on their ankles, or a man holding his eye in one hand create an infernal motion picture in our brain whose memory is very hard if not impossible to forget. At 790 comprehensive pages excluding Notes, Bibliography, Photo Credits and Index -886 in total- The Making of the Atomic Bomb is a monumental achievement that deserves all the accolades and awards it has gathered through the years. This book is a veritable must read, a must have, a classic."
195,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/204112-damon,5,"Richard Rhodes does a very impressive job of telling how we got to the atomic bomb. He starts in 1900 when Plank looked into a black box and found a new world. The Making of the Atomic Bomb explores the science that makes the bomb possible, the scientist who worked in breaking the atom, the politics which made people want to do it. In doing so it becomes one of the best introductions to quantum mechanics for the laymen. Much better than other books that try to join mysticism and science, Rhodes goes though, in prose, the basics of quantum mechanics and the people who made it. He has also not shy away from using the scientists metaphors to describe the world of the very small (Rutherford's cannon ball is one of the best), nor does he shy away from explaining the concepts that make the bomb possible, like why natural uranium does not explode and why plutonium is much better than uranium. Rhodes also provides a sense a drama the scientist and engineers in New Mexico start to build the bomb. When the first one is exploded, the reader feels a sense of achievement and pride at what man has wrought. And like all good writers, Rhodes is does not let us off the hook, the last portion of the book is a detailed description of the casualties of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The descriptions of the flash burn victims whose blacked, blistered skin peeled off their body exposing the muscle underneath is more than enough for anyone to appreciate Oppenheimer's quote: I am the creator, I am the destroyer.

Yes, it is very long. Yes, the narrative can feel a bit jumpy, especially in the first half. There are a lot of names being used, some of which never re-appear, and a lot of seemingly minor scientific experiments detailed exhaustively. And yes, Rhodes dedicates many pages to discussions that do not feel very relevant in 2013, but were very much so when it was written in the mid-80s and the idea that Russia might nuke us was not very far removed.But all of these elements come together in incredible fashion when the book builds up to moments of great importance: the confirmation of the splitting of the atom; the first self-sustaining nuclear reactor in Chicago; the attack on Pearl Harbor; the Trinity test; the dropping of Little Boy over Hiroshima. These sections are written beautifully and effectively convey the excitement and the historical ramifications. They would not be the same without all of the comprehensive background that is given beforehand, and it is hard to imagine this book being edited down very much.Strongly recommended to anybody with an interest in the bomb, or World War II in general."

There's much more. Rhodes, gifted with sharp psychological insight and a novelist's ability to convey character, reveals the personalities and emotional dynamics among the scientists and others responsible for conceiving, engineering, testing and ultimately dropping the apocalyptic devices on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In addition he describes the struggle in Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan to make the first bomb, as well as the political and military events that led inexorably to the destruction of the Japanese cities.

The book tells nothing but true stories about the people and events that shaped the making of the atom bomb and in a way that keeps your attention. Other books I read on the subject were very dry and boring, but this book holds your attention, even though it is a long book. If you like Cold War history and 20th century history, this book is a must read. How it actually all came together was so complex, it’s a miracle that it happened at all.I read this book back in 1988, just before I joined the Air Force. Little did I know that I would get a job in the Air Force working on equipment that monitored the world for people making nuclear weapons.

205,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/941349-bob,5,"This is an extraordinary work, one of the finest nonfiction books I've ever read. Its breadth and depth of coverage are incredible. It is engagingly written, truly a book hard to put down. It is full of wonderful anecdotes and photographs. The book is a chronological account of the science, engineering, and politics that created the atomic bomb. It is basically in four parts: physics from around 1880 to 1938, physics from 1939 to 1943, engineering and politics from 1941 to 1945, and the postwar aftermath up to around 1955. The first two parts are largely in Europe, the third and fourth mostly in the US. I was not prepared for the depth of coverage of the period from about 1880 to 1938. It is marvelous story, an epic of human achievement well told. I started out in college as a physics major, so I was familiar with the broad outline of this, and many of the names were familiar. In spite of that, I learned an enormous amount. The book wisely keeps the focus on the people, and succeeds wonderfully in making us feel we know them, at least the major players. In summarizing the book, it's hard to know where to start; Rhodes must have felt the same thing. By 1890 or so it was known that there were tiny particles called electrons that were negatively charged, and that the chemical elements were defined by how many electrons were in each atom. Since atoms are neutral, there must be a corresponding positive charge in each atom, but where? For a while it was thought that the positive charge was a sort of smeared out substrate, like the dough in a muffin, with the electrons stuck in it like blueberries. This was disproven (making a long story short) by Ernest Rutherford, New Zealand born British physicist, a poor boy who grew up on a farm. He showed that the positive charge lies in a ""nucleus"", a very small dense center of the atom, with the electrons much farther out, sort of orbiting around like the planets in the solar system. It wasn't long before the proton was discovered, and the fact that the nucleus contains the same number of protons as there are electrons in the outer shell. It was also not long before it was realized that the planetary analogy would not hold. According to the very well established electromagnetic theory of James Clerk Maxwell, the electrons would simply spiral into the nucleus and the atom would cease to exist. Yet the evidence for protons and the nucleus was undeniable. But the electromagnetic theory of Maxwell was extremely highly regarded. In fact Einstein had just used it (1905) to develop the theory of relativity, also highly regarded. What is the explanation? The explanation is most important development in physics since Newton: quantum theory. Quantum theory began with Max Plank and Einstein around 1890-1900, but really got going after 1915 with the work of Niels Bohr, Erwin Schroedinger, Werner Heisenberg and P. A. M. Dirac. Rhodes does not talk too much about quantum theory itself. He manages to keep the focus on nuclear physics. However, he does point out an essential lesson of quantum theory: light is both a wave and a particle. These seemingly contradictory notions exist at the same time in one thing. Bohr came to call this paraodox-that-is-not-a-paradox ""complementarity."" This abstract idea is important later. Of the four names above, two are extremely significant in the story of the atom bomb: Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg. Bohr was born in Denmark in 1885, so was half a generation younger than Rutherford. He explained the atom by showing how the electrons stayed in well defined ""shells"" rather than orbits like planets. Heisenberg, a German, was half a generation younger yet, born in 1901. He and Schroedinger made huge breakthroughs in the 1920s showing that Bohr's model was still not right. Meanwhile, before 1900, Marie and Pierre Curie had discovered radioactivity. Some elements, notably radium and uranium, decomposed with time by ejecting nuclear particles and becoming lighter elements. Eventually (long story cut short) it was realized that the particles being ejected are often ""neutrons"", the last of the three basic particles to be discovered (James Chadwick, 1932). Neutrons live in the nucleus with protons and seem to be a sort of glue holding the nucleus together.  The first phase of the story ends and the second begins in 1939 with the realization by Otto Hahn, Lise Meitner, and her nephew Otto Frisch that a nucleus could be fractured or split by a neutron being ejected from another atom. The first atom might split into two much lighter atoms -- fission -- and eject two or more neutrons, which could in turn hit and split yet more atoms -- a chain reaction. This was a revolutionary idea, quickly understood by Bohr, who carried the news to the US. Soon, scientists in the US, England, Germany, and Japan (yes Japan) were asking themselves, could this chain reaction become a bomb? Meanwhile, of course, was the hugely important rise of Nazi Germany. Many scientists, especially the Jewish ones, fled Germany by 1939. Meitner fled to Sweden in 1938. Frisch fled to England. Bohr (with only one grandparent Jewish) was at first relatively safe in Denmark, and could travel to England and back, but eventually had to flee to Sweden in 1943. Einstein was long since at Princeton. But, as Rhodes explains, many others, who are not household words, fled Nazi Europe and became key players in the saga of the atomic bomb. Among these are Stanislaw Ulam from Poland, Hans Bethe from Germany, and the Hungarian trio of Leo Szilard, Eugene Wigner, and Edward Teller, all of whom came to the US. All played significant roles in the story of the bomb; Szilard and Teller became big actors in the story. Similarly, physicists were fleeing Italy, including Enrico Fermi and Emilio Segre. The second part of the story surges into high gear with the developments in physics showing that a bomb could really work. In England, Chadwick assembled a group that included Frisch and Rudolf Peierls, recently fled from Germany. It became known as the MAUD committee. Frisch and Peierls produced the Frisch–Peierls memorandum, which was the first document to detail how an atomic explosion could be generated. Bohr soon learned about it, as he was also in England. Long story cut short, a bomb could be made from uranium-235 or from plutonium. Uranium occurs rather commonly in nature, but over 99% of it is the form called 238, abbreviated U-238. You can't make a bomb from that, though you can use it for a nuclear reactor. If enough of the much more radioactive U-235 is gotten together in the right way, a bomb will result. Plutonium does not occur in nature and was first synthesized by Glenn Seaborg in the US in 1940. It is also radioactive enough to make a bomb. About the same time, in 1940 Heisenberg began to understand that uranium 235 could make a bomb. Heisenberg did not like Hitler, but he had no Jewish ancestors and no compelling reason to leave Germany. He was asked by the German army to investigate uses of uranium. Rhodes says that Heisenberg thought that the process of actually getting together enough U-235 would be too expensive and difficult, and that is why the German atomic bomb project never got anywhere. In 2000, Thomas Powers published a book called Heisenberg's War in which he claims that Heisenberg deliberately stalled the German atomic bomb project so that Hitler would never have the bomb. It remains controversial, but Rhodes (writing in 1987) does not talk much about Heisenberg. Nonetheless, the British and Bohr assumed that the Germans would understand everything that they did, and would certainly be doing bomb research. This key idea, that the allies must keep up with the Germans, is the start of the third part of the saga, the engineering and political story of the actual making of the bomb. Americans were working too. Already in 1939, Hungarian emigre Leo Szilard realized that fission could be used to make a nuclear reactor and possibly a bomb. Szilard had known Einstein years before; in fact in 1926 they had patented a refrigerator! He became almost obsessed with the idea that President Roosevelt must understand the threat of the Germans having a bomb. In July 1939, Szilard and Wigner drove to Long Island, where Einstein was staying (how they found him is an interesting story). They convinced Einstein to write the now famous letter to FDR urging that the matter be given the highest priority. FDR was impressed, but it took more than one letter. That's a long story; read the book!  Eventually, especially after the Americans learned of the British MAUD committee work, a high level committee was formed to begin the research and manufacture of a bomb. The leaders of this committee were Vannevar Bush, James Conant, and Arthur Compton. Vannevar Bush (no relation to the presidents Bush) was an older engineer, a longtime influential person in the highest levels of academe and government. James Conant was a chemist and the president of Harvard. Arthur Compton had won the Nobel prize in physics in 1927. All of these people are fleshed out wonderfully in Rhodes's book. The big question for the Americans, as it was for the Germans and Japanese, was could the enormous effort to produce the bomb pay off in time for World War II? First, why ""enormous effort""? As Niels Bohr said around 1940, to actually make such a bomb would take half of the industrial apparatus of the United States for two years. This turned out to be only a modest overstatement. Producing enough U-235 was a huge task. Many tons of uranium ore would have to be processed to produce U-238, then a huge painstaking process (invention of Ernest Lawrence) would have to follow. (The Japanese realized this too, and abandoned the atomic bomb as impractical.) Eventually, processing U-235 was done at the Oak Ridge site in Tennessee, a gigantic complex. The alternative was to use plutonium. Plutonium can be created with a nuclear reactor at lesser cost. However, in 1942 no one was sure how to make a bomb out of plutonium, as it is almost too good. If a critical mass is not brought together VERY promptly, it would ""fizzle"", yielding an explosion scarcely any better than chemical bombs. The atomic bomb, of course, is a hundred thousand times better than that. The decision in the US was to do both approaches, to use both U-235 and plutonium. Plutonium was manufactured at another huge new facility, the Hanford Plant in Washington state. These two plants provided the ""brawn"" for the making of the atomic bomb, and employed thousands of people. But the ""brain"" was the third brand new facility built from scratch, the Los Alamos laboratory in New Mexico. This brings us at last to two of the most important names in this subject, Robert Oppenheimer and Leslie Groves. Robert Oppenheimer was born in New York in 1904, the son of a wealthy Jewish importer. With his rather privileged upbringing, Robert had spent some summers in the high plateaus in northern New Mexico. (Photos of the young Oppenheimer look remarkably like Bob Dylan.) I'll skip over his background in physics and how he came to the attention of the Bush committee, but it was decided to put him in overall charge of the construction of the atomic bomb. This was soon given the name Manhattan Project. Based on Oppenheimer's recommendation, a boys' school at Los Alamos was purchased, along with a hundred square miles of surrounding land. Colonel Leslie Groves was appointed the military leader of the project, who technically was above Oppenheimer. Rhodes does a wonderful job sketching how their relationship evolved. In short, both Oppenheimer and Groves did a wonderful job.  Rhodes' description of the building of the Los Alamos lab and the recruiting of the scientists and their families is perhaps the best part of this uniformly excellent book. The big names came, as well as many unknown today and many who later became famous. Enrico Fermi (who had created the first nuclear reactor in history in Chicago), Segre, Frisch, Bohr, Richard Feynman, Ulam, Lawrence, Seaborg, Bethe, two of Fermi's proteges Leona Woods and Herbert Anderson, Peierls and his colleague Klaus Fuchs from England. All of these went on to distinguished careers in the following decades. (more about Klaus Fuchs later.) Security was tight. Not all could take it. Edward Condon, a physicist ironically born in Alamogordo NM, resigned after six weeks: ""The thing which upsets me the most is the extraordinary close security policy.... In my case I found that the extreme concern with security was morbidly depressing -- especially the censoring mail and telephone calls."" Much later he was the target of the House Un-American Activities Committee because he was a ""follower"" of a ""new revolutionary movement"", quantum mechanics!  To make a long story short again, perhaps the biggest problem they solved at Los Alamos was the plutonium bomb. As mentioned above, the key is to force a critical mass of plutonium into a very small volume very quickly, to harness the vast number of neutrons released in the chain reaction. A young physicist named Seth Neddermeyer had the key idea: implosion. That means, arrange a group of ordinary explosives around a hollow sphere of plutonium. Set off the explosives at the same time and they will compress the plutonium into critical mass. This is easier said than done, and besides Neddermeyer the person who made it work was George Kistiakowsky, an ordinance expert. Implosion is not necessary in a U-235 bomb, but, as mentioned above, plutonium is easier to manufacture. There is one strong lesson from all of this: it is very hard to build an atomic bomb! Good! One more physics topic before we get to the more political aspects. The idea of using the energy from a fission bomb (uranium or plutonium atomic bomb) to initiate a fusion reaction (hydrogen bomb) was first proposed casually by Enrico Fermi to Edward Teller in the fall of 1941. Teller latched onto it and made it his ""baby"" until the first hydrogen bomb was detonated in 1952. During the war years at Los Alamos he insisted on working on it even though most of the others said to let it go until after the war. He was vindicated when it did indeed unleash 1000 times more energy than the atomic bombs. To quickly wrap up this phase, the Manhattan project succeeded in producing two plutonium bombs (the one tested in the New Mexico desert and one that fell on Nagasaki) and one U-235 bomb, the one that fell on Hiroshima. Now to the 500 pound gorilla in the room: was all this necessary? Was it morally correct to build and use the bomb, killing 130,000 people? The physicists who worked on the bomb did so almost entirely to make sure that the Allies would not be behind the Germans, who they felt sure were working on an atomic bomb. Many, perhaps half, of those physicists, had escaped Nazi persecution. This was a real and palpable threat to them. I do not see how anyone can argue with that. But did any of them see farther into the future? One especially did so: Niels Bohr. If reading this book will do nothing else, it will make you respect Niels Bohr. Already in 1943, as Los Alamos was just being built, Bohr was looking ahead to a post-war world with atomic weapons. He was terrified at the idea. He held no illusions that we in the US could keep the weapon for ourselves. Once successfully demonstrated, he had no doubt that the Soviet Union could build one in a few years. Indeed, he assumed they were already aware of the Manhattan Project. His solution was radical openness, his ""principle of complementarity."" Recall that this is the phrase he used twenty years earlier to grasp the apparently contradictory notions of quantum mechanics.  Complementarity means that the atomic bomb is a two-edged sword. On the one hand it is a terrible weapon, having the potential to unleash horrific suffering. On the other hand, since governments will realize that, they will be forced to not use it, to try much harder than ever to maintain peace. To help this along, he wanted the US to not only make it clear to everyone that the Manhattan Project was going on, he wanted the US to share everything we learned. He wanted in essence to give away the blueprints (not to the Germans during the war of course), that we would in this way generate enormous good will.  Making a long story short, in 1944 he gained personal audiences with both FDR and Churchill to push this idea. FDR was sympathetic. Churchill was appalled, to the extent that he wanted Bohr arrested. When FDR and Churchill met later in 1944, Churchill prevailed against the already enfeebled FDR, and that was the end of Bohr's far reaching vision. At least, he was not arrested. What about the idea that dropping the bombs on Japan was unnecessary, that the death toll was unprecedented? Rhodes points out that at least the second half of this statement is incorrect. There were already horrific bombings and killings. We all know about the holocaust, but many people today don't seem to know about the German executions of at least 500,000 prisoners in Russia, or the terrible murders and rapes that the Japanese perpetrated in China, which killed 150,000 civilians, or the Battle of Britain, in which the English lost 40,000, or the Dresden fire bombing that killed 25,000, or the Tokyo fire bombing in which 334 B29 bombers killed 90,000 people. The death toll from Hiroshima and Nagasaki was absolutely not unprecedented. Most Americans who lived through those years think that the atomic bombs ended the war and saved several hundred thousand American lives, and probably 500,000 Japanese. A few comments on the fourth phase of this book, the postwar period: Klaus Fuchs, mentioned above, was a Russian spy. He served nine years in prison in England, later emigrated to East Germany. Rhodes never mentions Julius or Ethel Rosenberg. I find that a bit odd. Oppenheimer had married a woman who had been a member of the communist party. This caused him trouble in 1941, but he was appointed to Los Alamos in spite of it. After the war, he had a very good career at Berkeley and Princeton. In 1949 he lost his security clearance because of his prewar communist sympathies, and because of the struggle with Edward Teller, who was championing the building of the hydrogen bomb. Oppenheimer was seen by the scientific community as a martyr to McCarthyism. He came to represent the struggle between right-wing militarists (symbolized by Teller) and left-wing intellectuals (symbolized by Oppenheimer) over the moral question of nuclear bombs.  To wrap up this already long review, let's return once more to the question of should the US have dropped the bombs on Japan. I will let Leona Woods have the last word. She later went on to a long career as a physicist:  ""I certainly do recall how I felt when the atomic bombs were used. My brother-in-law was captain of the first minesweeper. My brother was a Marine on Okinawa. I'm sure they would not have lasted in an invasion. It was clear the war would continue, with half a million of our fighting men dead not to say how many Japanese. You know and I know that [we] firebombed Tokyo and nobody even mentions the slaughter that happened then. They think Nagasaki and Hiroshima were something [very bad] compared to the firebombing. THEY'RE WRONG! I have no regrets. I think we did right, and we couldn't have done it differently. Yeah, I know it has been suggested the second bomb, Nagasaki, was not necessary. ... when you are in a war, to the death, I don't think you stand around and ask, Is it right?' """
206,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85753449-pritam-chattopadhyay,4,"In the foreword to this extremely interesting book, the author writes: The closing days of the Second World War marked a similar turning point in human history, the point of entry into a new era when humankind for the first time acquired the means of its own destruction. The discovery of how to release nuclear energy, and its application to build weapons of mass destruction, has gradually removed the prejudice on which total war is based: the insupportable conviction that there is a limited amount of energy available in the world to concentrate into explosives, that it is possible to accumulate more of such energy than one’s enemies and thereby militarily to prevail. So cheap, so portable, so holocaustal did nuclear weapons eventually become that even nation-states as belligerent as the Soviet Union and the United States preferred to sacrifice a portion of their national sovereignty—preferred to forego the power to make total war—rather than be destroyed in their fury.First published in 1986, this scrupulously researched and broad narrative by Richard Rhodes is the author’s ultimate account, tracing the expansion of the world’s eventual apocalyptic weapon from its origins as a problem in theoretical physics to its devastating culmination at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The book, at the same time, is also a chronicle of the personalities and greatest minds of the 20th century—especially Robert Oppenheimer, Niels Bohr, Leo Szilard, Enrico Fermi, Edward Teller, and Ernest Lawrence — and their inputs to developing the atomic bomb. Rhodes describes exhaustively the great scientific achievements that led up to the invention of the atomic bomb. Everything of importance is examined, from the discovery of the atomic nucleus and of nuclear fission to the emergence of quantum physics, the invention of the mass-spectroscope and of the cyclotron, the creation of such man-made elements as plutonium and tritium, and implementation of the nuclear chain reaction in uranium. Even more important, Rhodes shows how these achievements were thrust into the arms of the state, which culminated in the unfolding of the nuclear arms race. Often brilliantly, he records the rise of fascism and of anti-Semitism, and the intensification of nationalist ambitions. He traces the outbreak of WW II, which provoked a hysterical rivalry among nations to devise the bomb.Rhodes does a brilliant job in explaining the Manhattan Project, with a host of elements on everything from laboratory experiments to training of bombing pilots.The author prophetically observes : I think of a world without nuclear weapons not as a utopian dream but simply as a world where delivery times have been deliberately lengthened to months or even years, with correspondingly longer periods interim during which to resolve disputes short of war. In such a world, if negotiations fail, if conventional skirmishes fail, if both sides revert to arming themselves with nuclear weapons again—then at worst we will only arrive once more at the dangerous precipice where we all stand now.The discovery of how to release nuclear energy, like all fundamental scientific discoveries, changed the structure of human affairs—permanently.How that happened is the story this book attempts to tell."
207,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5672051-brahm,5,"The Making of the Atomic Bomb in audiobook form is just over 37 hours (the book clocks in at 900 pages). It was an immense history of EVERYTHING connected to the atomic weapons program, starting with a great chapter on the ancient philosophy of science, to primers on chemistry and physics, to the evolution of weapons of mass destruction including horrific WWI gas weapons, to post-WWI European politics, to stories of individual scientists and their cumulative discoveries, to stories of the supply chain and secret politics that had to be developed to feed the US atomic weapons program. The book converges to, and ends immediately after the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The Making of the Atomic Bomb was immense, powerful, and comprehensive. I loved the technical depth and the personal stories of the scientists and other actors involved. It feels like I just finished a University course. The pace of scientific discovery in the late 1930s is nothing short of amazing, and the scientists are such interesting characters. In the final chapter, the first-hand accounts of the immediate aftermath of Hiroshima and Nagasaki are graphic and deeply disturbing. It's a big change in tone; you invest hours and hours reading/listening about scientific, political, industrial and engineering progress, making it difficult to face the gut-wrenching, violent outcome. Better understanding of atomic theory and history, but mostly the consequences of nuclear weapons leaves me feeling unsettled over the range and number of nuclear weapons that exist today. They're in the background; we don't think about them. I didn't ever seriously consider or understand the physical damage these weapons can cause, OR the political consequences (ie, the world is locked in an eternal standoff of nuclear powers, even if we don't hear it on the news every day). The audiobook was narrated by Holter Graham. I am brand-new to audiobooks, but I thought it was exceptionally well read. I wonder if dense books are especially well-suited to audiobooks, as a bit of inflection and tone by a careful narrator can really bring a serious, technical and/or dense material to life. "
208,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3816725-larry-bassett,3,"I have to thank audible books for allowing me to actually experience this book. I am pretty sure I never would’ve gotten through even the first half of the book without the help of a skilled reader. I would give the first half of the book 2 stars and the last half of the book 4 stars does arriving at the medium of three stars. The first half or more of the book is way too complicated for my simple science knowledge. It might be very interesting to someone more versed in physics. It goes into great detail about 19th century and early 20th century physics discoveries and it is indefatigable in naming names! Way beyond my ability to compute.The second half of a book is exceedingly more interesting story for the average reader. Some of it you will of heard before but some of the inside stories of the relationships of the scientists Was new information to me. The relationship between science and engineering is something that I am not familiar with. A lot of the story about the development of theory and experimentation. And then an implementation is fascinating. The expansion and development of this $2 billion project beginning with essentially vacant ground in los Alamos and Hartford and Tennessee was very well documented. In the entire book there are about 2600 footnotes. Thank goodness the audible reading skips over those. At the end of the Kindle book there are many photographs of the many characters that appear in starring and supporting roles.I am not sure what the major takeaways of this book are. There is a fair amount of discussion about the debate about the good and evil of the atomic bomb. There was considerable hope among scientists that the bomb might force us to create a world of peace. There was of course some dissension about the use of the bomb but it is clear that once the bomb was created, there was no doubt that it would be used.There are many more pages about the horror of the injuries and deaths in Hiroshima then where necessary. We have read those pages too often. The fact that they were literally getting a third Byam ready when JAPAN finally surrendered is not something I have heard about previously. The argument about the bomb saving American lives was pretty well implanted in this book."
209,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56863096-jeremy,4,"Excellently told history of the incredible story of the development of the atomic bomb. Rhodes starts with some of the history of modern physics as it relates to different developments that led to the bomb, including the scientists. It was great to see Niels Bohr get his proper due; he commonly seems to be overlooked, at least among the general public, as one of the most important scientists in history (though he wasn't directly involved in the Manhattan Project). The science throughout this book is quite thorough and complex. After a while I gave up trying to see if I could follow it. While I appreciate that this book is trying to be comprehensive, for my taste he could have backed off the science a little bit. That said, the feat was incredible, and it is equally incredible that a chain reaction of splitting atoms can create such enormous destructive power.The last third or so of the book was exciting, as we got a behind the scenes look at the political and scientific progress towards the inevitable, and a front row seat to the first test of an atomic bomb. Rhodes spends some time in Hiroshima describing the awful outcome of the bomb in all its brutal reality. I was unaware that the Japanese would have potentially surrendered conditionally, but the US was demanding unconditional surrender. There were a number of prescient voices, Bohr's included, that understood what nuclear weapons meant for the world, a threat we must all now live with. Many of those working on the project experienced the cognitive dissonance of being successful with their work, and the fact that it meant terrible death and destruction for innocent lives, and changed the world forever."
210,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63879552-sebastian,5,"BLUF:There are not many books I would recommend more whole-heartedly. Just read it.Details:This is the story of science, industry, and politics, and how humanity went from wondering about structure of the atom in 1910 to dropping exploding balls of plutonium over Japan in 1945.We begin with bunch of European physicists who in the 1920s and 30s, discover the nature of the atom: Rutherford in England discovering the nucleus in 1911, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle in 1926, the Bohr model, Chadwick's discovery of the neutron in 1932, Fermi's 1934 experiments with neutron bombardment in Rome, and finally Otto Hahn and Lise Meitner publishing on nuclear fission in 1938. Rhodes paints a picture of a world of perhaps 100 physicists who knew each other personally and moved around frequently to collaborate for short periods of time. I wonder how funding worked (when Oppenheimer does research at Cavendish, or similar -- were do the dollars come from?) but no-one seems to worry about grants. Another thing that struck me was how broad some of these scientists were. Einstein and Szilard take a couple years off particle physics to study refrigeration in the 1930s. It's interesting to thing about this period of rapid progress against the example of Bell Labs. Common elements seem to be freedom from funding and publishing concerns, and a degree of flexibility in field of study. Unlike Bell, they aren't as commercially-focused although there is a goal that everyone is working against at least implicitly to map the structure of the atom. Also, Bohr is this convener and hub for the physicists, and I'm not sure a similar figure existed at Bell Labs.1938 is a pivotal year. Hahn / Meitner's write up on fission makes it clear to everyone that a fission chain reaction could power a new source of energy -- or a powerful new weapon. All of the fun of science and discovery takes on new meaning when our science Bund discovers their knowledge could be used for destructive ends. Hitler's Anschluss absorbs Austria and persecution of Jews in Germany begins.* Bohr heroically rounds up as many Jewish scientists as he can and whisks them off to Denmark; Szilard in the UK helps get more to England and the US.The war begins and scientists relocate the United States. Szilard, Einstein, and others (""The Hungarian Conspiracy"") attempt to educate military leadership and Roosevelt himself of the destructive power of the bomb. Eventually they do succeed and the great INDUSTRIAL project of the atomic bomb begins. I went in to the book thinking that Los Alamos would be comparable to Bell Labs. It isn't. As alluded to earlier, most scientists who saw the Meitner/Hahn paper in 1938 could surmise a bomb was possible. What differentiated the US from other countries who were pursing nuclear weapons was that we had the industrial capacity and resources to set up Hanford in Oregon to produce plutonium, and enrich uranium in meaningful quantities at Oak Ridge. But the leap to a bomb wasn't one of great scientific innovation, but rather production.The book ends with about 100 pages describing the Japanese victims of the US nuclear attack. The contrast to the joyful early days of Fermi running up and down his hallway on Via Panisperna and taking measurements with his Geiger counter is stark. Sometimes history unfolds in unexpected ways.Far too much to say about the book than can put in writing. Just read it.*A crazy early anecdote talked about how Chaim Weizmann secured the Balfour Declaration in support of a Jewish homeland during WWI in exchange for supporting the government manufacture acetone which was badly needed for artillery. You can't make this stuff up."
211,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11476806-g-d-brennan,4,"I think this book is a touch overrated.Having said that, I couldn't put it down.""The Making of the Atomic Bomb"" is incredibly well-researched; it's thought-provoking and deep, yet lively and literary. And make no mistake, it is well worth your while; its greatest sections and passages are as absorbing and exciting as anything I've ever read. (As a precocious 4th grader prone to fleeing the world by burying my nose in books, I'd read eagerly about the incredible feats of engineering and physics that went into the atomic bombs; this book made me revert to my 4th-grade-self, walking around Chicago oblivious to the comparatively drab sights and sounds of the real world as I explored the livelier world within.) And given the primary research Rhodes has done, especially the interviews with many of the physicists and chemists who literally manufactured history in a hastily-assembled laboratory in the New Mexico desert, it seems impossible that anyone could put together even a comparably comprehensive history without copiously copping from this one. Nothing else compares; it is the ""War and Peace"" of our only nuclear war.And yet, this feels like a science experiment where one has settled on a hypothesis prior to doing the research, and has ignored or minimized those results that threatened the theory. Rhodes takes us through virtually all of 20th century atomic physics, but he's assembled it in a structure that resembles one of those black hole coin wells one sees at the science center; everything starts out slow and lazy and happy, but eventually things get more energetic and more frentic; valuable time is lost, and valuable money disappears into an abyss of war and militarism. Also, if it shares ""War and Peace's"" strengths, it also shares its flaws; rather than sticking around to observe things and let events speak for themselves, the author spends many of the closing pages on maddening flights of philosophical fancy centered around the potential for worldwide Armageddon that the atomic bomb unleashed. When Rhodes was writing and researching this book--from 1981 to 1986, according to the endnotes--such fears surely seemed lively and compelling, topical and true, matters of monumental import to the whole human race; now they feel quaint and outdated. (In these post 9/11 days of endless hot wars, one almost feels nostalgic for the Cold War. Armageddon clocks ticking down the minutes to midnight? ICBMs on alert in North Dakota, waiting for the launch signals that would send them off on flaming arcs over the polar ice cap, but held at bay only by the prospect of Mutual Assured Destruction? I'll take that over fanatical and resourceful terrorists with a divine mandate any day. Our current world makes MAD feel sane.) At any rate, one realizes at the end that Rhodes' musings are not mere detours at the end of a masterful narrative; they have also warped its course, for in between his excellent chronicling of the bomb's development, Rhodes gets pulled off by other vectors, particularly by Neils Bohr's utopian musings about making nuclear weapons research subject to the same standards of openness and free disclosure that prevail in the rest of scientific discourse.And it's a shame, because in the vast majority of the narrative Rhodes proves himself to be an incredibly talented writer and reporter, with a telling eye for facts and details, and an ease with complicated scientific concepts and analogies that, in turn, sets the reader at ease. I have read many other books on similar subjects and studied nuclear physics at the college level; still, I found myself learning new things from Rhodes' lucid and cogent descriptions of, say, the way a uranium atom fissions almost like a raindrop, or the way a cyclotron spins and separates atomic particles. And he weaves these descriptions into memorable scenes and stories; his descriptions of the construction and operation of the first nuclear reactor, a round-ish pile of graphite bricks and uranium trussed up by wooden scaffolding and nestled in a squash court at the University of Chicago, for instance, are lyrical and unforgettable. It is fascinating to read about the world's top nuclear physicists engaging in an experiment that was by turns precise and haphazard; it is engrossing to envision Enrico Fermi plotting neutron fluxes and calculating reaction coefficients while many of his staff members were wearing leftover raccoon coats to warm themselves against the Chicago winter because they had built the world's first nuclear reactor in an unheated building.Rhodes turns these dead physicists into live characters by keeping his eyes open for the characteristic anecdotes, and his ear tuned for the telling quotes. During the Manhattan Project, for instance, General Leslie Groves, frustrated at wartime copper shortages that threatened to derail the construction of uranium-separating cyclotrons, decided to borrow thousands of tons of silver from the Treasury to build them instead; his assistant was told: ""Colonel, in the Treasury we do not speak of tons of silver; our unit is the troy ounce."" Eventually they ended up with over 10,000 tons of silver, though; Rhodes judiciously uses this fact, and others, to convey the sheer magnitude of America's nuclear effort. Thanks to the Manhattan Project, a whole city sprung up in Tennessee to support the uranium processing efforts, a city with tens of thousands of people which nonetheless remained off the map. And meanwhile the government was establishing the Hanford reservation in Washington State--an area a third the size of Rhode Island. The upshot of all of these efforts, Rhodes tells us, was that the U.S. essentially constructed a nuclear industry from scratch and grew it, in three short years, to be the size of the automobile industry.And yet, of course, it was not about industry alone, but about dropping the product of that industry on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Here, too, I must take issue with the author; he expounds at length on Hiroshima, to the point that one almost becomes numb to its horrors, and yet he skimps on describing Nagasaki. The bomb used there was the more complicated and technically challenging of the two. (The tricky details of its construction end up taking far more space in the narrative than those for the relatively simple gun-type Hiroshima bomb; despite his revulsion at its use, Rhodes clearly admires the complicated engineering challenge it represented.) The mission which dropped it nearly ended up an unqualified and costly failure after it met with a string of bad luck. (Or good luck, at least, for the citizens of Kokura, the Japanese city which was saved from dubious immortality and near-total destruction thanks to unexpectedly cloudy weather that sent the second nuclear mission on to its secondary target; it is doubtful that bad weather has ever been more beneficial for a city and its populace.) And yet the last use of nuclear weapons in anger merits barely more than a page in this lengthy narrative, which is unfair to the reader, unfair to the story, and unfair to the hapless citizens of Nagasaki, whose fluke-filled fate deserves to be better remembered than as a glorified footnote.Short shrift, too, is given to the considerable efforts of Soviet spies at security-heavy Los Alamos; it is possible that much of this information was simply not known when Rhodes wrote, and he did cover this subject in his later ""Dark Sun;"" still, it means this feels somewhat incomplete.None of this is to say that one should avoid this book; it's massive enough and weighty enough that one simply can't avoid it if one is even tangentially interested in these topics. (Indeed, if one were to read only one book on the development and first use of the atomic bomb, this should probably be it.) Still, despite its lengthy word count, its thorough research, and its generally excellent writing, this is neither the last word nor the only word on its subject. "

There are many ways in which we die: disease, age, accident, violence. And many ways in which we might all die; suddenly in the wake of some cosmological catastrophe or slowly starving on a dying planet. With the atom bomb, it was now possible for a single individual, at the top of a chain of technological and political commitments, to kill almost everyone in the space of an afternoon. The bombs were only used in anger twice, punctuation to end the global slaughter of the Second World War. Since then, history has existed under the shadow of a potential mushroom cloud. This book is the story of how we got there.Rhodes takes almost the first half of the book to establish the basic science and personalities of the atomic bomb. The first half of the 20th century was a golden age for physics which will likely never be equaled, as imaginative theorists and skilled experimenters probed the basic building blocks of the universe. Rutherford and Bohr nailed down, for the first time in evidence rather than speculation, the basic building blocks of matter. Atoms had most of their mass in a small nucleus, and owed their chemical properties to the quantum behavior of electron shells. The neutron was added to the list of fundamental particles. New elements were created by neutron bombardment, and by the late 1930s it was widely known that uranium would fission on bombardment, splitting into two lighter elements, and releasing a large deal of energy. There positive glee of work in this field, at this time, comes through in Rhodes' able biographical sketches of the scientists involved, particularly Bohr, Fermi, and Szilard.Szilard was the first to think of the potential of a fission chain reaction. If some substance, on absorbing a neutron split and released two or more neutrons, could produce a great deal of energy in millionths of a second. It would be a bomb of stupendous power, a city-smasher. Politically perceptive, Szilard had been helping Jewish physicists flee the Nazis for years. He had hoped for an H.G. Wells inspired international coalition to peacefully control this new power, but in 1939 if the bomb was too be invented, best by the Americans or British rather than Hitler.The next section, building the bomb, is less fun. Bohr predicted that you would need to turn all of America into a factory to build a bomb, and that is what the Manhattan project did, mobilizing thousands of scientists, $2 billion, and massive plants to do the hard work of separating fissile U-235 and Plutonium from natural uranium. Bureaucratic confusion and balky precision engineering made the task anything but easy. The other powers pursued the bomb. The British sent over their best to help with the Manhattan project. Germany's team, lead by Heisenberg, never had the necessary priority in the Reich, and were stalled by clever British-Norwegian sabotage directed at a heavy water production facility required for the Nazi reactor design. Japan never had access to the raw material to move beyond theory.The last section is grimmer yet. The design of the bomb was an exercise in precision, in delicately engineered explosive lenses to make the implosion to critical mass happen smoothly in nanoseconds. Tibbetts' B-29 bomber group trained to a razor's edge to accomplish the mission of deploying the 'gadget'. Roosevelt, on approving the Manhattan project, had instinctively reserved the bomb to himself as President. In 1945, Vice President Truman had not been read into the project until he succeeded to the presidency. The bomb was used on Hiroshima because it could be, because the Japanese still resisted, and because something had to be shown for the effort invested. It was a crime, a mass-murder in an instant. Rhodes does not flinch from the horror of Hiroshima.Personally, I think we need to distinguish between the bomb's use at the end of the Second World War, where it seems a matter of degree compared to area bombing rather than kind, and its use now, where that would signal breaking the nuclear taboo. This does not absolve the scientists who built the bomb of their responsibility. Nature's secrets were all around, and once fission had been theorized it was probably only a matter of time before someone figured out how to make it work, but these people made a choice to build Death a supersonic jet bomber to replicate his tired old horse. The Making of the Atomic Bomb is a penetrating look at the most consequential scientific and political moment of the 20th century. I'd give it six stars, if I could. It is also my 1000th review on Goodreads!"
213,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8511956-lance,5,"Probably the best book ever written on the atomic bomb, from the early science to the aftermath of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It was so good, but so dense and detailed, I did have a hard time keeping up with everyone and everything. But one couldn’t ask for a more complete book on this topic."

215,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2209582-ross,3,"This is an exhaustive history of the bombs development., some 900 pages. The first half deals with the fundamental physics that makes nuclear weapons possible. The remainder deals with the actual development.My previous understanding of the bomb history stemmed from a movie some 20 years ago. In this film Albert Einstein perceives the potential for the bomb based on his famous equationE=MC squared. He quickly contacts President Roosevelt and FDR assigns a General Groves to develop the bomb ASAP in order to end the war.The actual truth is almost unbelievable.In the late 1930’s physicists in Europe realize that the fission of uranium can be used to make a bomb. Most of these scientists are Jews and they flee Hitler to the U.S. terrified that Germany will develop the bomb. Using what connections they can they approach officers separately in the U.S. army and navy. In both instances they are laughed at. Now more terrified than ever they approach Einstein, hoping his prestige can get word of the danger to someone in power. Einstein actually does have a contact that knows FDR and a letter from Einstein, actually written by our refugee physicists, is taken to the White House and read to FDR. The President seems impressed and says he will act on it. What he actually does is assign a bureaucrat in the Department of Standards to look into this thing. The bureaucrat now puts the letter in his safe and does nothing. It never occurs to FDR to follow-up on what is being done.Meanwhile the Germans and British are working on development and the British think the U.S. is also working on it A year later Churchill concerned about what the U.S. is doing sends a delegation over to discuss the project. They are horrified to find nothing is being done. A lot of screaming and yelling now takes place and finally General Groves is assigned.More than a year had been lost and we are very lucky today that we don’t have to speak German."
216,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7226831-josh-friedlander,5,"An epic topic, perhaps the epic topic, matched by a book epic in scope and detail. Rhodes starts off at the beginning of 20th century understanding of the atom, going into intricate detail about the lives of Bohr, Rutherford, Szilard, et al. He seems equally happy talking about Kierkegaard's Either/Or philosophy, the Pacific Theatre, or the intricacies of isolating Uranium-235. There's a lot of science in this book - I googled a lot but still felt like I missed enough to justify a second reading sometime - and some coverage of the effects of the bomb, the moral concerns of the scientists and politicians involved in its deployment, and the state of today's world. Rhodes wrote this book in the mid-1980s, but of course, the great, numbing, existential threat of the bomb still looms over us today; even if we think of it less."
217,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14945161-sandy-maguire,5,"Amazing book. The first act is a fantastic set of tableaus about the physicists and progression of science necessary to discover the capabilities of the atom. The second act is somewhat dry, regarding mostly the politicking necessary to have made the bomb happen, but there is some decent engineering spliced in here and there. The third is about the war effort, the Trinity test, and the eventual dropping of the bomb. The last chapter is horrifying and not something I'd describe as the feel-good read of the year, but it helps to drive home just how terrible these things are.I would strongly recommend this book to everyone."
218,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76660175-stephen-clare,5,"An astonishing book, dense as lead and explosive as plutonium. It's 800+ pages of tiny text, but there's not a superfluous sentence to be found. Just a staggering amount of information. And no wonder - this book is a textbook of physics in the first half of the 20th century, a case study of the relationship between science and war (and scientists and soldiers), and a history of the rising tolerability of mass civilian slaughter, combined with multiple biographies of some of history's most characteristic scientists.The climax of the book from Trinity to Nagasaki is awesome, cinematic, and chilling. This is a serious investment, but well worth your time."

Like, uber. Not just an exhaustive regarding the scientific aspects, but the social, political and wartime factors that contributed and led up to the creation of the most destructive weapon ever conceived. Even ample knowledge of the personal lives of the scientists involved is conveyed. There is so much about the development of the bomb that I certainly wasn't aware of and I would venture to say that most people aren't. How close that the Nazi's were to developing their own nuclear device, and the fact that the Japanese were actively researching their own atomic bomb. Overall, its good. Very good. But if you're more broadly interested in the history of the nuke... this book might drive you insane. Its hardcore. Also this book stops directly after the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the surrender of Japan, which seems a shame. So much of interest happens in the next several years, including the development of thermonuclear bomb technology (which is conceptually covered in the book), USSR espionage contributing to their own bomb development and the first stages of the arms race."

223,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6871223-aaron-million,4,"Richard Rhodes' monumental undertaking here is both admirable and daunting at the same time. As one might expect, the story of the development of the atomic bomb, and of atomic power in general, does not occur overnight and does not involved just a few individuals. It evolves over decades of often pain-staking work done by scientists who span a wide range of nationalities, specialties, opinions, and motivations. As such, a thorough job requires a lot of work – both for Rhodes and for the reader. Not being well-versed in science, and especially in physics, the sections containing detailed discussions of neutrons, electrons, atomic elements, chain reactions, volts, etc... were not the easiest for me to absorb. But that is due to my limited capacity to understand those things, not to Rhodes' writing or researching skills. In fact, he is not just writing for a scientific audience, but for a general audience. Thus, he cannot delve too far into the weeds of nuclear physics without losing quite a few people. But he cannot, at the same time, brush past very important discoveries and experiments. He does an admirable job of finding middle ground: not too detailed to discourage readers, but not superficial enough to upset scientists who understand these advanced topics. Almost as much of a struggle as the scientific aspect, is the difficulty in keeping all of the main characters (and there is no shortage of these) straight. So many people provided significant contributions to the development of the bomb: scientifically, politically, militarily, economically, that the names start to run together at a certain point. In addition, especially throughout the first half of the book, the scientists are from several different (mainly European) countries, and thus their work is taking place in many different laboratories in different cities. Just remembering which nationality someone is can be difficult at times. This is not a criticism of Rhodes; he could not begin to tell the story without all of these people being in it. But it is something to note for the general reader, especially someone who is unfamiliar with most chemists and physicists aside from Albert Einstein, who plays a minor, but pivotal, role in this drama. The most riveting chapter had to do with the actual dropping of the first atomic bomb, over Hiroshima, Japan on August 6, 1945. Rhodes, as he does throughout the book, allows the people involved in the story to explain their thoughts and feelings as much as possible. In this chapter, the remembrances of Japanese who survived the atomic attack are difficult to read. A sample, from page 722, the description by a thirty-year-old woman of encountering a dead person: “The corpse lying on its back on the road had been killed immediately.... Its hand was lifted to the sky and the fingers were burning with blue flames. The fingers were shortened to one-third and distorted. A dark liquid was running to the ground along the hand.” These types of horrible description go on for several pages. Rhodes does not do this to make a moral statement about the U.S. Dropping the bomb on Japan; in fact, he also notes that the Japanese leaders must share some of the blame as their desperate fighting, literally to the death, undoubtedly contributed to Harry Truman's decision to authorize the bombing. But instead he includes the morbid accounts so as the drive home the total devastation and utter ruin that the A-bomb brought into the world. As he accurately states, the bomb did not just destroy thousands of lives, but it completely wiped out an entire city. Rhodes concludes with a forty page Afterword, primarily focusing on the development of the “Super” (or H) bomb. Towards the end, he delves into a philosophic discussion about nation-states, nuclear policy and control, and warfare. While certainly relevant, after reading the preceding chapters detailing the creation of the bomb, it dropping on Japan, the immediate effects upon its people, and all of the political tugs of war in Los Alamos, NM and Washington, this reads as an anti-climax. This is not to say that it does not belong in the book. But rather, the discussion would have been enhanced by some capsules about what all of the various scientists went on to do following WWII. Los Alamos Director Robert Oppenheimer, as an example, had a painful life – both literally and figuratively – through the 1950s and up to his death in 1967. But Rhodes does not choose to mention any of Oppenheimer's travails. Still, it is hard to see how a more complete and accurate depiction of this world-changing event could be told. "
224,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6431984-antonio-rojas,5,"Monumental and Breathtaking!Is a breathtaking journey through the history of nuclear physics and the development of Atomic Theory. It is a masterpiece where Mr. Rhodes regales us with his gift for presenting difficult and intricate concepts in a very logical, insightful, colorful, and above all entertaining fashion.Loosely speaking, the first part of the book covers the key steps that carved the foundations of atomic theory: we get to witness J.J. Thompson discovering the electron; Ernest Rutherford realizing the existence of the nucleus and postulating his “Solar System” model of the atom; Niels Bohr, with a little help from spectroscopy improving that model and carving his more realistic Shell and Orbital design; Chadwick stalking and finally uncovering the neutron; Henri Becquerel and the Curies discovering radioactivity; Heisenberg working his Uncertainty Principle, Schrodinger developing wave mechanics, Pauli his Exclusion Principle. In addition, we become familiar with de Hevesy, John von Neumann, Wigner, Dirac, Millikan, Max Born, Arnold Sommerfeld, Paul Ehrenfest, in summary, all the big architects of Quantum Mechanics and modern physics. But what makes the book a truly superior piece is that Mr. Rhodes, while impeccably describing the science, he submerges the reader into the very personal and complex psychology of each of the characters and the historic context of the time. We see each of these great scientists come to life and wander through history in front of our eyes immersed in the chaotic social and military storm that surrounded the cataclysmic days of the First and Second World Wars.The second part of the book deals more specifically with the creation and the political steps leading to the use of the first atomic bombs on civilian populations by the United States government. We get to see Leo Szilard, the true brain behind the first idea of the atomic bomb and the first to conceptualize the science behind it and its potential consequences; we see Otto Hahn splitting the atom without realizing it and Lise Meitner and Otto Freisch interpreting and using for the first time the term “fission” to name the event; Enrico Fermi “slowing neutrons” and creating a sustained chain reaction; Wigner creating plutonium and enriching uranium; all of this, leading triumphantly to Los Alamos where we witness Edward Teller, Luis Alvarez, Hans Bethe, Lawrence and above all, Robert Oppenheimer, “I am become death, the destroyer of worlds”, where they orchestrated the biggest human effort and enterprise ever achieved: the ability to create the means of our own destruction. Mr. Rhodes cold and non-judgmental recompilation of first hand witnesses and victims of the explosions is both pathetic and truly horrifying. The harrowing images of children aimlessly wandering and holding strips of their own skin, women without feet walking on their ankles, or a man holding his eye in one hand create an infernal motion picture in our brain whose memory is very hard if not impossible to forget. At 790 comprehensive pages excluding Notes, Bibliography, Photo Credits and Index -886 in total- The Making of the Atomic Bomb is a monumental achievement that deserves all the accolades and awards it has gathered through the years. This book is a veritable must read, a must have, a classic."
225,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/204112-damon,5,"Richard Rhodes does a very impressive job of telling how we got to the atomic bomb. He starts in 1900 when Plank looked into a black box and found a new world. The Making of the Atomic Bomb explores the science that makes the bomb possible, the scientist who worked in breaking the atom, the politics which made people want to do it. In doing so it becomes one of the best introductions to quantum mechanics for the laymen. Much better than other books that try to join mysticism and science, Rhodes goes though, in prose, the basics of quantum mechanics and the people who made it. He has also not shy away from using the scientists metaphors to describe the world of the very small (Rutherford's cannon ball is one of the best), nor does he shy away from explaining the concepts that make the bomb possible, like why natural uranium does not explode and why plutonium is much better than uranium. Rhodes also provides a sense a drama the scientist and engineers in New Mexico start to build the bomb. When the first one is exploded, the reader feels a sense of achievement and pride at what man has wrought. And like all good writers, Rhodes is does not let us off the hook, the last portion of the book is a detailed description of the casualties of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The descriptions of the flash burn victims whose blacked, blistered skin peeled off their body exposing the muscle underneath is more than enough for anyone to appreciate Oppenheimer's quote: I am the creator, I am the destroyer.

Yes, it is very long. Yes, the narrative can feel a bit jumpy, especially in the first half. There are a lot of names being used, some of which never re-appear, and a lot of seemingly minor scientific experiments detailed exhaustively. And yes, Rhodes dedicates many pages to discussions that do not feel very relevant in 2013, but were very much so when it was written in the mid-80s and the idea that Russia might nuke us was not very far removed.But all of these elements come together in incredible fashion when the book builds up to moments of great importance: the confirmation of the splitting of the atom; the first self-sustaining nuclear reactor in Chicago; the attack on Pearl Harbor; the Trinity test; the dropping of Little Boy over Hiroshima. These sections are written beautifully and effectively convey the excitement and the historical ramifications. They would not be the same without all of the comprehensive background that is given beforehand, and it is hard to imagine this book being edited down very much.Strongly recommended to anybody with an interest in the bomb, or World War II in general."

There's much more. Rhodes, gifted with sharp psychological insight and a novelist's ability to convey character, reveals the personalities and emotional dynamics among the scientists and others responsible for conceiving, engineering, testing and ultimately dropping the apocalyptic devices on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In addition he describes the struggle in Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan to make the first bomb, as well as the political and military events that led inexorably to the destruction of the Japanese cities. This is a beautifully written book (Rhodes has written a separate book on the craft of writing) that anyone interested in science or history would enjoy."

The book tells nothing but true stories about the people and events that shaped the making of the atom bomb and in a way that keeps your attention. Other books I read on the subject were very dry and boring, but this book holds your attention, even though it is a long book. If you like Cold War history and 20th century history, this book is a must read. How it actually all came together was so complex, it’s a miracle that it happened at all.I read this book back in 1988, just before I joined the Air Force. Little did I know that I would get a job in the Air Force working on equipment that monitored the world for people making nuclear weapons. The knowledge that I gleaned from this book was very useful in my Air Force career. Very informative."

235,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/941349-bob,5,"This is an extraordinary work, one of the finest nonfiction books I've ever read. Its breadth and depth of coverage are incredible. It is engagingly written, truly a book hard to put down. It is full of wonderful anecdotes and photographs. The book is a chronological account of the science, engineering, and politics that created the atomic bomb. It is basically in four parts: physics from around 1880 to 1938, physics from 1939 to 1943, engineering and politics from 1941 to 1945, and the postwar aftermath up to around 1955. The first two parts are largely in Europe, the third and fourth mostly in the US. I was not prepared for the depth of coverage of the period from about 1880 to 1938. It is marvelous story, an epic of human achievement well told. I started out in college as a physics major, so I was familiar with the broad outline of this, and many of the names were familiar. In spite of that, I learned an enormous amount. The book wisely keeps the focus on the people, and succeeds wonderfully in making us feel we know them, at least the major players. In summarizing the book, it's hard to know where to start; Rhodes must have felt the same thing. By 1890 or so it was known that there were tiny particles called electrons that were negatively charged, and that the chemical elements were defined by how many electrons were in each atom. Since atoms are neutral, there must be a corresponding positive charge in each atom, but where? For a while it was thought that the positive charge was a sort of smeared out substrate, like the dough in a muffin, with the electrons stuck in it like blueberries. This was disproven (making a long story short) by Ernest Rutherford, New Zealand born British physicist, a poor boy who grew up on a farm. He showed that the positive charge lies in a ""nucleus"", a very small dense center of the atom, with the electrons much farther out, sort of orbiting around like the planets in the solar system. It wasn't long before the proton was discovered, and the fact that the nucleus contains the same number of protons as there are electrons in the outer shell. It was also not long before it was realized that the planetary analogy would not hold. According to the very well established electromagnetic theory of James Clerk Maxwell, the electrons would simply spiral into the nucleus and the atom would cease to exist. Yet the evidence for protons and the nucleus was undeniable. But the electromagnetic theory of Maxwell was extremely highly regarded. In fact Einstein had just used it (1905) to develop the theory of relativity, also highly regarded. What is the explanation? The explanation is most important development in physics since Newton: quantum theory. Quantum theory began with Max Plank and Einstein around 1890-1900, but really got going after 1915 with the work of Niels Bohr, Erwin Schroedinger, Werner Heisenberg and P. A. M. Dirac. Rhodes does not talk too much about quantum theory itself. He manages to keep the focus on nuclear physics. However, he does point out an essential lesson of quantum theory: light is both a wave and a particle. These seemingly contradictory notions exist at the same time in one thing. Bohr came to call this paraodox-that-is-not-a-paradox ""complementarity."" This abstract idea is important later. Of the four names above, two are extremely significant in the story of the atom bomb: Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg. Bohr was born in Denmark in 1885, so was half a generation younger than Rutherford. He explained the atom by showing how the electrons stayed in well defined ""shells"" rather than orbits like planets. Heisenberg, a German, was half a generation younger yet, born in 1901. He and Schroedinger made huge breakthroughs in the 1920s showing that Bohr's model was still not right. Meanwhile, before 1900, Marie and Pierre Curie had discovered radioactivity. Some elements, notably radium and uranium, decomposed with time by ejecting nuclear particles and becoming lighter elements. Eventually (long story cut short) it was realized that the particles being ejected are often ""neutrons"", the last of the three basic particles to be discovered (James Chadwick, 1932). Neutrons live in the nucleus with protons and seem to be a sort of glue holding the nucleus together.  The first phase of the story ends and the second begins in 1939 with the realization by Otto Hahn, Lise Meitner, and her nephew Otto Frisch that a nucleus could be fractured or split by a neutron being ejected from another atom. The first atom might split into two much lighter atoms -- fission -- and eject two or more neutrons, which could in turn hit and split yet more atoms -- a chain reaction. This was a revolutionary idea, quickly understood by Bohr, who carried the news to the US. Soon, scientists in the US, England, Germany, and Japan (yes Japan) were asking themselves, could this chain reaction become a bomb? Meanwhile, of course, was the hugely important rise of Nazi Germany. Many scientists, especially the Jewish ones, fled Germany by 1939. Meitner fled to Sweden in 1938. Frisch fled to England. Bohr (with only one grandparent Jewish) was at first relatively safe in Denmark, and could travel to England and back, but eventually had to flee to Sweden in 1943. Einstein was long since at Princeton. But, as Rhodes explains, many others, who are not household words, fled Nazi Europe and became key players in the saga of the atomic bomb. Among these are Stanislaw Ulam from Poland, Hans Bethe from Germany, and the Hungarian trio of Leo Szilard, Eugene Wigner, and Edward Teller, all of whom came to the US. All played significant roles in the story of the bomb; Szilard and Teller became big actors in the story. Similarly, physicists were fleeing Italy, including Enrico Fermi and Emilio Segre. The second part of the story surges into high gear with the developments in physics showing that a bomb could really work. In England, Chadwick assembled a group that included Frisch and Rudolf Peierls, recently fled from Germany. It became known as the MAUD committee. Frisch and Peierls produced the Frisch–Peierls memorandum, which was the first document to detail how an atomic explosion could be generated. Bohr soon learned about it, as he was also in England. Long story cut short, a bomb could be made from uranium-235 or from plutonium. Uranium occurs rather commonly in nature, but over 99% of it is the form called 238, abbreviated U-238. You can't make a bomb from that, though you can use it for a nuclear reactor. If enough of the much more radioactive U-235 is gotten together in the right way, a bomb will result. Plutonium does not occur in nature and was first synthesized by Glenn Seaborg in the US in 1940. It is also radioactive enough to make a bomb. About the same time, in 1940 Heisenberg began to understand that uranium 235 could make a bomb. Heisenberg did not like Hitler, but he had no Jewish ancestors and no compelling reason to leave Germany. He was asked by the German army to investigate uses of uranium. Rhodes says that Heisenberg thought that the process of actually getting together enough U-235 would be too expensive and difficult, and that is why the German atomic bomb project never got anywhere. In 2000, Thomas Powers published a book called Heisenberg's War in which he claims that Heisenberg deliberately stalled the German atomic bomb project so that Hitler would never have the bomb. It remains controversial, but Rhodes (writing in 1987) does not talk much about Heisenberg. Nonetheless, the British and Bohr assumed that the Germans would understand everything that they did, and would certainly be doing bomb research. This key idea, that the allies must keep up with the Germans, is the start of the third part of the saga, the engineering and political story of the actual making of the bomb. Americans were working too. Already in 1939, Hungarian emigre Leo Szilard realized that fission could be used to make a nuclear reactor and possibly a bomb. Szilard had known Einstein years before; in fact in 1926 they had patented a refrigerator! He became almost obsessed with the idea that President Roosevelt must understand the threat of the Germans having a bomb. In July 1939, Szilard and Wigner drove to Long Island, where Einstein was staying (how they found him is an interesting story). They convinced Einstein to write the now famous letter to FDR urging that the matter be given the highest priority. FDR was impressed, but it took more than one letter. That's a long story; read the book!  Eventually, especially after the Americans learned of the British MAUD committee work, a high level committee was formed to begin the research and manufacture of a bomb. The leaders of this committee were Vannevar Bush, James Conant, and Arthur Compton. Vannevar Bush (no relation to the presidents Bush) was an older engineer, a longtime influential person in the highest levels of academe and government. James Conant was a chemist and the president of Harvard. Arthur Compton had won the Nobel prize in physics in 1927. All of these people are fleshed out wonderfully in Rhodes's book. The big question for the Americans, as it was for the Germans and Japanese, was could the enormous effort to produce the bomb pay off in time for World War II? First, why ""enormous effort""? As Niels Bohr said around 1940, to actually make such a bomb would take half of the industrial apparatus of the United States for two years. This turned out to be only a modest overstatement. Producing enough U-235 was a huge task. Many tons of uranium ore would have to be processed to produce U-238, then a huge painstaking process (invention of Ernest Lawrence) would have to follow. (The Japanese realized this too, and abandoned the atomic bomb as impractical.) Eventually, processing U-235 was done at the Oak Ridge site in Tennessee, a gigantic complex. The alternative was to use plutonium. Plutonium can be created with a nuclear reactor at lesser cost. However, in 1942 no one was sure how to make a bomb out of plutonium, as it is almost too good. If a critical mass is not brought together VERY promptly, it would ""fizzle"", yielding an explosion scarcely any better than chemical bombs. The atomic bomb, of course, is a hundred thousand times better than that. The decision in the US was to do both approaches, to use both U-235 and plutonium. Plutonium was manufactured at another huge new facility, the Hanford Plant in Washington state. These two plants provided the ""brawn"" for the making of the atomic bomb, and employed thousands of people. But the ""brain"" was the third brand new facility built from scratch, the Los Alamos laboratory in New Mexico. This brings us at last to two of the most important names in this subject, Robert Oppenheimer and Leslie Groves. Robert Oppenheimer was born in New York in 1904, the son of a wealthy Jewish importer. With his rather privileged upbringing, Robert had spent some summers in the high plateaus in northern New Mexico. (Photos of the young Oppenheimer look remarkably like Bob Dylan.) I'll skip over his background in physics and how he came to the attention of the Bush committee, but it was decided to put him in overall charge of the construction of the atomic bomb. This was soon given the name Manhattan Project. Based on Oppenheimer's recommendation, a boys' school at Los Alamos was purchased, along with a hundred square miles of surrounding land. Colonel Leslie Groves was appointed the military leader of the project, who technically was above Oppenheimer. Rhodes does a wonderful job sketching how their relationship evolved. In short, both Oppenheimer and Groves did a wonderful job.  Rhodes' description of the building of the Los Alamos lab and the recruiting of the scientists and their families is perhaps the best part of this uniformly excellent book. The big names came, as well as many unknown today and many who later became famous. Enrico Fermi (who had created the first nuclear reactor in history in Chicago), Segre, Frisch, Bohr, Richard Feynman, Ulam, Lawrence, Seaborg, Bethe, two of Fermi's proteges Leona Woods and Herbert Anderson, Peierls and his colleague Klaus Fuchs from England. All of these went on to distinguished careers in the following decades. (more about Klaus Fuchs later.) Security was tight. Not all could take it. Edward Condon, a physicist ironically born in Alamogordo NM, resigned after six weeks: ""The thing which upsets me the most is the extraordinary close security policy.... In my case I found that the extreme concern with security was morbidly depressing -- especially the censoring mail and telephone calls."" Much later he was the target of the House Un-American Activities Committee because he was a ""follower"" of a ""new revolutionary movement"", quantum mechanics!  To make a long story short again, perhaps the biggest problem they solved at Los Alamos was the plutonium bomb. As mentioned above, the key is to force a critical mass of plutonium into a very small volume very quickly, to harness the vast number of neutrons released in the chain reaction. A young physicist named Seth Neddermeyer had the key idea: implosion. That means, arrange a group of ordinary explosives around a hollow sphere of plutonium. Set off the explosives at the same time and they will compress the plutonium into critical mass. This is easier said than done, and besides Neddermeyer the person who made it work was George Kistiakowsky, an ordinance expert. Implosion is not necessary in a U-235 bomb, but, as mentioned above, plutonium is easier to manufacture. There is one strong lesson from all of this: it is very hard to build an atomic bomb! Good! One more physics topic before we get to the more political aspects. The idea of using the energy from a fission bomb (uranium or plutonium atomic bomb) to initiate a fusion reaction (hydrogen bomb) was first proposed casually by Enrico Fermi to Edward Teller in the fall of 1941. Teller latched onto it and made it his ""baby"" until the first hydrogen bomb was detonated in 1952. During the war years at Los Alamos he insisted on working on it even though most of the others said to let it go until after the war. He was vindicated when it did indeed unleash 1000 times more energy than the atomic bombs. To quickly wrap up this phase, the Manhattan project succeeded in producing two plutonium bombs (the one tested in the New Mexico desert and one that fell on Nagasaki) and one U-235 bomb, the one that fell on Hiroshima. Now to the 500 pound gorilla in the room: was all this necessary? Was it morally correct to build and use the bomb, killing 130,000 people? The physicists who worked on the bomb did so almost entirely to make sure that the Allies would not be behind the Germans, who they felt sure were working on an atomic bomb. Many, perhaps half, of those physicists, had escaped Nazi persecution. This was a real and palpable threat to them. I do not see how anyone can argue with that. But did any of them see farther into the future? One especially did so: Niels Bohr. If reading this book will do nothing else, it will make you respect Niels Bohr. Already in 1943, as Los Alamos was just being built, Bohr was looking ahead to a post-war world with atomic weapons. He was terrified at the idea. He held no illusions that we in the US could keep the weapon for ourselves. Once successfully demonstrated, he had no doubt that the Soviet Union could build one in a few years. Indeed, he assumed they were already aware of the Manhattan Project. His solution was radical openness, his ""principle of complementarity."" Recall that this is the phrase he used twenty years earlier to grasp the apparently contradictory notions of quantum mechanics.  Complementarity means that the atomic bomb is a two-edged sword. On the one hand it is a terrible weapon, having the potential to unleash horrific suffering. On the other hand, since governments will realize that, they will be forced to not use it, to try much harder than ever to maintain peace. To help this along, he wanted the US to not only make it clear to everyone that the Manhattan Project was going on, he wanted the US to share everything we learned. He wanted in essence to give away the blueprints (not to the Germans during the war of course), that we would in this way generate enormous good will.  Making a long story short, in 1944 he gained personal audiences with both FDR and Churchill to push this idea. FDR was sympathetic. Churchill was appalled, to the extent that he wanted Bohr arrested. When FDR and Churchill met later in 1944, Churchill prevailed against the already enfeebled FDR, and that was the end of Bohr's far reaching vision. At least, he was not arrested. What about the idea that dropping the bombs on Japan was unnecessary, that the death toll was unprecedented? Rhodes points out that at least the second half of this statement is incorrect. There were already horrific bombings and killings. We all know about the holocaust, but many people today don't seem to know about the German executions of at least 500,000 prisoners in Russia, or the terrible murders and rapes that the Japanese perpetrated in China, which killed 150,000 civilians, or the Battle of Britain, in which the English lost 40,000, or the Dresden fire bombing that killed 25,000, or the Tokyo fire bombing in which 334 B29 bombers killed 90,000 people. The death toll from Hiroshima and Nagasaki was absolutely not unprecedented. Most Americans who lived through those years think that the atomic bombs ended the war and saved several hundred thousand American lives, and probably 500,000 Japanese. A few comments on the fourth phase of this book, the postwar period: Klaus Fuchs, mentioned above, was a Russian spy. He served nine years in prison in England, later emigrated to East Germany. Rhodes never mentions Julius or Ethel Rosenberg. I find that a bit odd. Oppenheimer had married a woman who had been a member of the communist party. This caused him trouble in 1941, but he was appointed to Los Alamos in spite of it. After the war, he had a very good career at Berkeley and Princeton. In 1949 he lost his security clearance because of his prewar communist sympathies, and because of the struggle with Edward Teller, who was championing the building of the hydrogen bomb. Oppenheimer was seen by the scientific community as a martyr to McCarthyism. He came to represent the struggle between right-wing militarists (symbolized by Teller) and left-wing intellectuals (symbolized by Oppenheimer) over the moral question of nuclear bombs.  To wrap up this already long review, let's return once more to the question of should the US have dropped the bombs on Japan. I will let Leona Woods have the last word. She later went on to a long career as a physicist:  ""I certainly do recall how I felt when the atomic bombs were used. My brother-in-law was captain of the first minesweeper. My brother was a Marine on Okinawa. I'm sure they would not have lasted in an invasion. It was clear the war would continue, with half a million of our fighting men dead not to say how many Japanese. You know and I know that [we] firebombed Tokyo and nobody even mentions the slaughter that happened then. They think Nagasaki and Hiroshima were something [very bad] compared to the firebombing. THEY'RE WRONG! I have no regrets. I think we did right, and we couldn't have done it differently. Yeah, I know it has been suggested the second bomb, Nagasaki, was not necessary. ... when you are in a war, to the death, I don't think you stand around and ask, Is it right?' """
236,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85753449-pritam-chattopadhyay,4,"In the foreword to this extremely interesting book, the author writes: The closing days of the Second World War marked a similar turning point in human history, the point of entry into a new era when humankind for the first time acquired the means of its own destruction. The discovery of how to release nuclear energy, and its application to build weapons of mass destruction, has gradually removed the prejudice on which total war is based: the insupportable conviction that there is a limited amount of energy available in the world to concentrate into explosives, that it is possible to accumulate more of such energy than one’s enemies and thereby militarily to prevail. So cheap, so portable, so holocaustal did nuclear weapons eventually become that even nation-states as belligerent as the Soviet Union and the United States preferred to sacrifice a portion of their national sovereignty—preferred to forego the power to make total war—rather than be destroyed in their fury.First published in 1986, this scrupulously researched and broad narrative by Richard Rhodes is the author’s ultimate account, tracing the expansion of the world’s eventual apocalyptic weapon from its origins as a problem in theoretical physics to its devastating culmination at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The book, at the same time, is also a chronicle of the personalities and greatest minds of the 20th century—especially Robert Oppenheimer, Niels Bohr, Leo Szilard, Enrico Fermi, Edward Teller, and Ernest Lawrence — and their inputs to developing the atomic bomb. Rhodes describes exhaustively the great scientific achievements that led up to the invention of the atomic bomb. Everything of importance is examined, from the discovery of the atomic nucleus and of nuclear fission to the emergence of quantum physics, the invention of the mass-spectroscope and of the cyclotron, the creation of such man-made elements as plutonium and tritium, and implementation of the nuclear chain reaction in uranium. Even more important, Rhodes shows how these achievements were thrust into the arms of the state, which culminated in the unfolding of the nuclear arms race. Often brilliantly, he records the rise of fascism and of anti-Semitism, and the intensification of nationalist ambitions. He traces the outbreak of WW II, which provoked a hysterical rivalry among nations to devise the bomb.Rhodes does a brilliant job in explaining the Manhattan Project, with a host of elements on everything from laboratory experiments to training of bombing pilots.The author prophetically observes : I think of a world without nuclear weapons not as a utopian dream but simply as a world where delivery times have been deliberately lengthened to months or even years, with correspondingly longer periods interim during which to resolve disputes short of war. In such a world, if negotiations fail, if conventional skirmishes fail, if both sides revert to arming themselves with nuclear weapons again—then at worst we will only arrive once more at the dangerous precipice where we all stand now.The discovery of how to release nuclear energy, like all fundamental scientific discoveries, changed the structure of human affairs—permanently.How that happened is the story this book attempts to tell."
237,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5672051-brahm,5,"The Making of the Atomic Bomb in audiobook form is just over 37 hours (the book clocks in at 900 pages). It was an immense history of EVERYTHING connected to the atomic weapons program, starting with a great chapter on the ancient philosophy of science, to primers on chemistry and physics, to the evolution of weapons of mass destruction including horrific WWI gas weapons, to post-WWI European politics, to stories of individual scientists and their cumulative discoveries, to stories of the supply chain and secret politics that had to be developed to feed the US atomic weapons program. The book converges to, and ends immediately after the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The Making of the Atomic Bomb was immense, powerful, and comprehensive. I loved the technical depth and the personal stories of the scientists and other actors involved. It feels like I just finished a University course. The pace of scientific discovery in the late 1930s is nothing short of amazing, and the scientists are such interesting characters. In the final chapter, the first-hand accounts of the immediate aftermath of Hiroshima and Nagasaki are graphic and deeply disturbing. It's a big change in tone; you invest hours and hours reading/listening about scientific, political, industrial and engineering progress, making it difficult to face the gut-wrenching, violent outcome. Better understanding of atomic theory and history, but mostly the consequences of nuclear weapons leaves me feeling unsettled over the range and number of nuclear weapons that exist today. They're in the background; we don't think about them. I didn't ever seriously consider or understand the physical damage these weapons can cause, OR the political consequences (ie, the world is locked in an eternal standoff of nuclear powers, even if we don't hear it on the news every day). The audiobook was narrated by Holter Graham. I am brand-new to audiobooks, but I thought it was exceptionally well read. I wonder if dense books are especially well-suited to audiobooks, as a bit of inflection and tone by a careful narrator can really bring a serious, technical and/or dense material to life. "
238,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3816725-larry-bassett,3,"I have to thank audible books for allowing me to actually experience this book. I am pretty sure I never would’ve gotten through even the first half of the book without the help of a skilled reader. I would give the first half of the book 2 stars and the last half of the book 4 stars does arriving at the medium of three stars. The first half or more of the book is way too complicated for my simple science knowledge. It might be very interesting to someone more versed in physics. It goes into great detail about 19th century and early 20th century physics discoveries and it is indefatigable in naming names! Way beyond my ability to compute.The second half of a book is exceedingly more interesting story for the average reader. Some of it you will of heard before but some of the inside stories of the relationships of the scientists Was new information to me. The relationship between science and engineering is something that I am not familiar with. A lot of the story about the development of theory and experimentation. And then an implementation is fascinating. The expansion and development of this $2 billion project beginning with essentially vacant ground in los Alamos and Hartford and Tennessee was very well documented. In the entire book there are about 2600 footnotes. Thank goodness the audible reading skips over those. At the end of the Kindle book there are many photographs of the many characters that appear in starring and supporting roles.I am not sure what the major takeaways of this book are. There is a fair amount of discussion about the debate about the good and evil of the atomic bomb. There was considerable hope among scientists that the bomb might force us to create a world of peace. There was of course some dissension about the use of the bomb but it is clear that once the bomb was created, there was no doubt that it would be used.There are many more pages about the horror of the injuries and deaths in Hiroshima then where necessary. We have read those pages too often. The fact that they were literally getting a third Byam ready when JAPAN finally surrendered is not something I have heard about previously. The argument about the bomb saving American lives was pretty well implanted in this book."
239,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56863096-jeremy,4,"Excellently told history of the incredible story of the development of the atomic bomb. Rhodes starts with some of the history of modern physics as it relates to different developments that led to the bomb, including the scientists. It was great to see Niels Bohr get his proper due; he commonly seems to be overlooked, at least among the general public, as one of the most important scientists in history (though he wasn't directly involved in the Manhattan Project). The science throughout this book is quite thorough and complex. After a while I gave up trying to see if I could follow it. While I appreciate that this book is trying to be comprehensive, for my taste he could have backed off the science a little bit. That said, the feat was incredible, and it is equally incredible that a chain reaction of splitting atoms can create such enormous destructive power.The last third or so of the book was exciting, as we got a behind the scenes look at the political and scientific progress towards the inevitable, and a front row seat to the first test of an atomic bomb. Rhodes spends some time in Hiroshima describing the awful outcome of the bomb in all its brutal reality. I was unaware that the Japanese would have potentially surrendered conditionally, but the US was demanding unconditional surrender. There were a number of prescient voices, Bohr's included, that understood what nuclear weapons meant for the world, a threat we must all now live with. Many of those working on the project experienced the cognitive dissonance of being successful with their work, and the fact that it meant terrible death and destruction for innocent lives, and changed the world forever."
240,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63879552-sebastian,5,"BLUF:There are not many books I would recommend more whole-heartedly. Just read it.Details:This is the story of science, industry, and politics, and how humanity went from wondering about structure of the atom in 1910 to dropping exploding balls of plutonium over Japan in 1945.We begin with bunch of European physicists who in the 1920s and 30s, discover the nature of the atom: Rutherford in England discovering the nucleus in 1911, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle in 1926, the Bohr model, Chadwick's discovery of the neutron in 1932, Fermi's 1934 experiments with neutron bombardment in Rome, and finally Otto Hahn and Lise Meitner publishing on nuclear fission in 1938. Rhodes paints a picture of a world of perhaps 100 physicists who knew each other personally and moved around frequently to collaborate for short periods of time. I wonder how funding worked (when Oppenheimer does research at Cavendish, or similar -- were do the dollars come from?) but no-one seems to worry about grants. Another thing that struck me was how broad some of these scientists were. Einstein and Szilard take a couple years off particle physics to study refrigeration in the 1930s. It's interesting to thing about this period of rapid progress against the example of Bell Labs. Common elements seem to be freedom from funding and publishing concerns, and a degree of flexibility in field of study. Unlike Bell, they aren't as commercially-focused although there is a goal that everyone is working against at least implicitly to map the structure of the atom. Also, Bohr is this convener and hub for the physicists, and I'm not sure a similar figure existed at Bell Labs.1938 is a pivotal year. Hahn / Meitner's write up on fission makes it clear to everyone that a fission chain reaction could power a new source of energy -- or a powerful new weapon. All of the fun of science and discovery takes on new meaning when our science Bund discovers their knowledge could be used for destructive ends. Hitler's Anschluss absorbs Austria and persecution of Jews in Germany begins.* Bohr heroically rounds up as many Jewish scientists as he can and whisks them off to Denmark; Szilard in the UK helps get more to England and the US.The war begins and scientists relocate the United States. Szilard, Einstein, and others (""The Hungarian Conspiracy"") attempt to educate military leadership and Roosevelt himself of the destructive power of the bomb. Eventually they do succeed and the great INDUSTRIAL project of the atomic bomb begins. I went in to the book thinking that Los Alamos would be comparable to Bell Labs. It isn't. As alluded to earlier, most scientists who saw the Meitner/Hahn paper in 1938 could surmise a bomb was possible. What differentiated the US from other countries who were pursing nuclear weapons was that we had the industrial capacity and resources to set up Hanford in Oregon to produce plutonium, and enrich uranium in meaningful quantities at Oak Ridge. But the leap to a bomb wasn't one of great scientific innovation, but rather production.The book ends with about 100 pages describing the Japanese victims of the US nuclear attack. The contrast to the joyful early days of Fermi running up and down his hallway on Via Panisperna and taking measurements with his Geiger counter is stark. Sometimes history unfolds in unexpected ways.Far too much to say about the book than can put in writing. Just read it.*A crazy early anecdote talked about how Chaim Weizmann secured the Balfour Declaration in support of a Jewish homeland during WWI in exchange for supporting the government manufacture acetone which was badly needed for artillery. You can't make this stuff up."
241,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11476806-g-d-brennan,4,"I think this book is a touch overrated.Having said that, I couldn't put it down.""The Making of the Atomic Bomb"" is incredibly well-researched; it's thought-provoking and deep, yet lively and literary. And make no mistake, it is well worth your while; its greatest sections and passages are as absorbing and exciting as anything I've ever read. (As a precocious 4th grader prone to fleeing the world by burying my nose in books, I'd read eagerly about the incredible feats of engineering and physics that went into the atomic bombs; this book made me revert to my 4th-grade-self, walking around Chicago oblivious to the comparatively drab sights and sounds of the real world as I explored the livelier world within.) And given the primary research Rhodes has done, especially the interviews with many of the physicists and chemists who literally manufactured history in a hastily-assembled laboratory in the New Mexico desert, it seems impossible that anyone could put together even a comparably comprehensive history without copiously copping from this one. Nothing else compares; it is the ""War and Peace"" of our only nuclear war.And yet, this feels like a science experiment where one has settled on a hypothesis prior to doing the research, and has ignored or minimized those results that threatened the theory. Rhodes takes us through virtually all of 20th century atomic physics, but he's assembled it in a structure that resembles one of those black hole coin wells one sees at the science center; everything starts out slow and lazy and happy, but eventually things get more energetic and more frentic; valuable time is lost, and valuable money disappears into an abyss of war and militarism. Also, if it shares ""War and Peace's"" strengths, it also shares its flaws; rather than sticking around to observe things and let events speak for themselves, the author spends many of the closing pages on maddening flights of philosophical fancy centered around the potential for worldwide Armageddon that the atomic bomb unleashed. When Rhodes was writing and researching this book--from 1981 to 1986, according to the endnotes--such fears surely seemed lively and compelling, topical and true, matters of monumental import to the whole human race; now they feel quaint and outdated. (In these post 9/11 days of endless hot wars, one almost feels nostalgic for the Cold War. Armageddon clocks ticking down the minutes to midnight? ICBMs on alert in North Dakota, waiting for the launch signals that would send them off on flaming arcs over the polar ice cap, but held at bay only by the prospect of Mutual Assured Destruction? I'll take that over fanatical and resourceful terrorists with a divine mandate any day. Our current world makes MAD feel sane.) At any rate, one realizes at the end that Rhodes' musings are not mere detours at the end of a masterful narrative; they have also warped its course, for in between his excellent chronicling of the bomb's development, Rhodes gets pulled off by other vectors, particularly by Neils Bohr's utopian musings about making nuclear weapons research subject to the same standards of openness and free disclosure that prevail in the rest of scientific discourse.And it's a shame, because in the vast majority of the narrative Rhodes proves himself to be an incredibly talented writer and reporter, with a telling eye for facts and details, and an ease with complicated scientific concepts and analogies that, in turn, sets the reader at ease. I have read many other books on similar subjects and studied nuclear physics at the college level; still, I found myself learning new things from Rhodes' lucid and cogent descriptions of, say, the way a uranium atom fissions almost like a raindrop, or the way a cyclotron spins and separates atomic particles. And he weaves these descriptions into memorable scenes and stories; his descriptions of the construction and operation of the first nuclear reactor, a round-ish pile of graphite bricks and uranium trussed up by wooden scaffolding and nestled in a squash court at the University of Chicago, for instance, are lyrical and unforgettable. It is fascinating to read about the world's top nuclear physicists engaging in an experiment that was by turns precise and haphazard; it is engrossing to envision Enrico Fermi plotting neutron fluxes and calculating reaction coefficients while many of his staff members were wearing leftover raccoon coats to warm themselves against the Chicago winter because they had built the world's first nuclear reactor in an unheated building.Rhodes turns these dead physicists into live characters by keeping his eyes open for the characteristic anecdotes, and his ear tuned for the telling quotes. During the Manhattan Project, for instance, General Leslie Groves, frustrated at wartime copper shortages that threatened to derail the construction of uranium-separating cyclotrons, decided to borrow thousands of tons of silver from the Treasury to build them instead; his assistant was told: ""Colonel, in the Treasury we do not speak of tons of silver; our unit is the troy ounce."" Eventually they ended up with over 10,000 tons of silver, though; Rhodes judiciously uses this fact, and others, to convey the sheer magnitude of America's nuclear effort. Thanks to the Manhattan Project, a whole city sprung up in Tennessee to support the uranium processing efforts, a city with tens of thousands of people which nonetheless remained off the map. And meanwhile the government was establishing the Hanford reservation in Washington State--an area a third the size of Rhode Island. The upshot of all of these efforts, Rhodes tells us, was that the U.S. essentially constructed a nuclear industry from scratch and grew it, in three short years, to be the size of the automobile industry.And yet, of course, it was not about industry alone, but about dropping the product of that industry on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Here, too, I must take issue with the author; he expounds at length on Hiroshima, to the point that one almost becomes numb to its horrors, and yet he skimps on describing Nagasaki. The bomb used there was the more complicated and technically challenging of the two. (The tricky details of its construction end up taking far more space in the narrative than those for the relatively simple gun-type Hiroshima bomb; despite his revulsion at its use, Rhodes clearly admires the complicated engineering challenge it represented.) The mission which dropped it nearly ended up an unqualified and costly failure after it met with a string of bad luck. (Or good luck, at least, for the citizens of Kokura, the Japanese city which was saved from dubious immortality and near-total destruction thanks to unexpectedly cloudy weather that sent the second nuclear mission on to its secondary target; it is doubtful that bad weather has ever been more beneficial for a city and its populace.) And yet the last use of nuclear weapons in anger merits barely more than a page in this lengthy narrative, which is unfair to the reader, unfair to the story, and unfair to the hapless citizens of Nagasaki, whose fluke-filled fate deserves to be better remembered than as a glorified footnote.Short shrift, too, is given to the considerable efforts of Soviet spies at security-heavy Los Alamos; it is possible that much of this information was simply not known when Rhodes wrote, and he did cover this subject in his later ""Dark Sun;"" still, it means this feels somewhat incomplete.None of this is to say that one should avoid this book; it's massive enough and weighty enough that one simply can't avoid it if one is even tangentially interested in these topics. (Indeed, if one were to read only one book on the development and first use of the atomic bomb, this should probably be it.) Still, despite its lengthy word count, its thorough research, and its generally excellent writing, this is neither the last word nor the only word on its subject. "
242,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4828849-michael-burnam-fink,5,"""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.""Robert Oppenheimer, director of the Los Alamos lab, chief designer of the atomic bomb, and a polymath with mystic and leftist inclinations, had the perfect quote for the first artificial dawn of an atomic explosion. There are many ways in which we die: disease, age, accident, violence. And many ways in which we might all die; suddenly in the wake of some cosmological catastrophe or slowly starving on a dying planet. With the atom bomb, it was now possible for a single individual, at the top of a chain of technological and political commitments, to kill almost everyone in the space of an afternoon. The bombs were only used in anger twice, punctuation to end the global slaughter of the Second World War. Since then, history has existed under the shadow of a potential mushroom cloud. This book is the story of how we got there.Rhodes takes almost the first half of the book to establish the basic science and personalities of the atomic bomb. The first half of the 20th century was a golden age for physics which will likely never be equaled, as imaginative theorists and skilled experimenters probed the basic building blocks of the universe. Rutherford and Bohr nailed down, for the first time in evidence rather than speculation, the basic building blocks of matter. Atoms had most of their mass in a small nucleus, and owed their chemical properties to the quantum behavior of electron shells. The neutron was added to the list of fundamental particles. New elements were created by neutron bombardment, and by the late 1930s it was widely known that uranium would fission on bombardment, splitting into two lighter elements, and releasing a large deal of energy. There positive glee of work in this field, at this time, comes through in Rhodes' able biographical sketches of the scientists involved, particularly Bohr, Fermi, and Szilard.Szilard was the first to think of the potential of a fission chain reaction. If some substance, on absorbing a neutron split and released two or more neutrons, could produce a great deal of energy in millionths of a second. It would be a bomb of stupendous power, a city-smasher. Politically perceptive, Szilard had been helping Jewish physicists flee the Nazis for years. He had hoped for an H.G. Wells inspired international coalition to peacefully control this new power, but in 1939 if the bomb was too be invented, best by the Americans or British rather than Hitler.The next section, building the bomb, is less fun. Bohr predicted that you would need to turn all of America into a factory to build a bomb, and that is what the Manhattan project did, mobilizing thousands of scientists, $2 billion, and massive plants to do the hard work of separating fissile U-235 and Plutonium from natural uranium. Bureaucratic confusion and balky precision engineering made the task anything but easy. The other powers pursued the bomb. The British sent over their best to help with the Manhattan project. Germany's team, lead by Heisenberg, never had the necessary priority in the Reich, and were stalled by clever British-Norwegian sabotage directed at a heavy water production facility required for the Nazi reactor design. Japan never had access to the raw material to move beyond theory.The last section is grimmer yet. The design of the bomb was an exercise in precision, in delicately engineered explosive lenses to make the implosion to critical mass happen smoothly in nanoseconds. Tibbetts' B-29 bomber group trained to a razor's edge to accomplish the mission of deploying the 'gadget'. Roosevelt, on approving the Manhattan project, had instinctively reserved the bomb to himself as President. In 1945, Vice President Truman had not been read into the project until he succeeded to the presidency. The bomb was used on Hiroshima because it could be, because the Japanese still resisted, and because something had to be shown for the effort invested. It was a crime, a mass-murder in an instant. Rhodes does not flinch from the horror of Hiroshima.Personally, I think we need to distinguish between the bomb's use at the end of the Second World War, where it seems a matter of degree compared to area bombing rather than kind, and its use now, where that would signal breaking the nuclear taboo. This does not absolve the scientists who built the bomb of their responsibility. Nature's secrets were all around, and once fission had been theorized it was probably only a matter of time before someone figured out how to make it work, but these people made a choice to build Death a supersonic jet bomber to replicate his tired old horse. The Making of the Atomic Bomb is a penetrating look at the most consequential scientific and political moment of the 20th century. I'd give it six stars, if I could. It is also my 1000th review on Goodreads!"
243,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8511956-lance,5,"Probably the best book ever written on the atomic bomb, from the early science to the aftermath of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It was so good, but so dense and detailed, I did have a hard time keeping up with everyone and everything. But one couldn’t ask for a more complete book on this topic."

245,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2209582-ross,3,"This is an exhaustive history of the bombs development., some 900 pages. The first half deals with the fundamental physics that makes nuclear weapons possible. The remainder deals with the actual development.My previous understanding of the bomb history stemmed from a movie some 20 years ago. In this film Albert Einstein perceives the potential for the bomb based on his famous equationE=MC squared. He quickly contacts President Roosevelt and FDR assigns a General Groves to develop the bomb ASAP in order to end the war.The actual truth is almost unbelievable.In the late 1930’s physicists in Europe realize that the fission of uranium can be used to make a bomb. Most of these scientists are Jews and they flee Hitler to the U.S. terrified that Germany will develop the bomb. Using what connections they can they approach officers separately in the U.S. army and navy. In both instances they are laughed at. Now more terrified than ever they approach Einstein, hoping his prestige can get word of the danger to someone in power. Einstein actually does have a contact that knows FDR and a letter from Einstein, actually written by our refugee physicists, is taken to the White House and read to FDR. The President seems impressed and says he will act on it. What he actually does is assign a bureaucrat in the Department of Standards to look into this thing. The bureaucrat now puts the letter in his safe and does nothing. It never occurs to FDR to follow-up on what is being done.Meanwhile the Germans and British are working on development and the British think the U.S. is also working on it A year later Churchill concerned about what the U.S. is doing sends a delegation over to discuss the project. They are horrified to find nothing is being done. A lot of screaming and yelling now takes place and finally General Groves is assigned.More than a year had been lost and we are very lucky today that we don’t have to speak German."
246,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7226831-josh-friedlander,5,"An epic topic, perhaps the epic topic, matched by a book epic in scope and detail. Rhodes starts off at the beginning of 20th century understanding of the atom, going into intricate detail about the lives of Bohr, Rutherford, Szilard, et al. He seems equally happy talking about Kierkegaard's Either/Or philosophy, the Pacific Theatre, or the intricacies of isolating Uranium-235. There's a lot of science in this book - I googled a lot but still felt like I missed enough to justify a second reading sometime - and some coverage of the effects of the bomb, the moral concerns of the scientists and politicians involved in its deployment, and the state of today's world. Rhodes wrote this book in the mid-1980s, but of course, the great, numbing, existential threat of the bomb still looms over us today; even if we think of it less."
247,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14945161-sandy-maguire,5,"Amazing book. The first act is a fantastic set of tableaus about the physicists and progression of science necessary to discover the capabilities of the atom. The second act is somewhat dry, regarding mostly the politicking necessary to have made the bomb happen, but there is some decent engineering spliced in here and there. The third is about the war effort, the Trinity test, and the eventual dropping of the bomb. The last chapter is horrifying and not something I'd describe as the feel-good read of the year, but it helps to drive home just how terrible these things are.I would strongly recommend this book to everyone."
248,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76660175-stephen-clare,5,"An astonishing book, dense as lead and explosive as plutonium. It's 800+ pages of tiny text, but there's not a superfluous sentence to be found. Just a staggering amount of information. And no wonder - this book is a textbook of physics in the first half of the 20th century, a case study of the relationship between science and war (and scientists and soldiers), and a history of the rising tolerability of mass civilian slaughter, combined with multiple biographies of some of history's most characteristic scientists.The climax of the book from Trinity to Nagasaki is awesome, cinematic, and chilling. This is a serious investment, but well worth your time."

Like, uber. Not just an exhaustive regarding the scientific aspects, but the social, political and wartime factors that contributed and led up to the creation of the most destructive weapon ever conceived. Even ample knowledge of the personal lives of the scientists involved is conveyed. There is so much about the development of the bomb that I certainly wasn't aware of and I would venture to say that most people aren't. How close that the Nazi's were to developing their own nuclear device, and the fact that the Japanese were actively researching their own atomic bomb. Overall, its good. Very good. But if you're more broadly interested in the history of the nuke... this book might drive you insane. Its hardcore. Also this book stops directly after the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the surrender of Japan, which seems a shame. So much of interest happens in the next several years, including the development of thermonuclear bomb technology (which is conceptually covered in the book), USSR espionage contributing to their own bomb development and the first stages of the arms race."

253,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6871223-aaron-million,4,"Richard Rhodes' monumental undertaking here is both admirable and daunting at the same time. As one might expect, the story of the development of the atomic bomb, and of atomic power in general, does not occur overnight and does not involved just a few individuals. It evolves over decades of often pain-staking work done by scientists who span a wide range of nationalities, specialties, opinions, and motivations. As such, a thorough job requires a lot of work – both for Rhodes and for the reader. Not being well-versed in science, and especially in physics, the sections containing detailed discussions of neutrons, electrons, atomic elements, chain reactions, volts, etc... were not the easiest for me to absorb. But that is due to my limited capacity to understand those things, not to Rhodes' writing or researching skills. In fact, he is not just writing for a scientific audience, but for a general audience. Thus, he cannot delve too far into the weeds of nuclear physics without losing quite a few people. But he cannot, at the same time, brush past very important discoveries and experiments. He does an admirable job of finding middle ground: not too detailed to discourage readers, but not superficial enough to upset scientists who understand these advanced topics. Almost as much of a struggle as the scientific aspect, is the difficulty in keeping all of the main characters (and there is no shortage of these) straight. So many people provided significant contributions to the development of the bomb: scientifically, politically, militarily, economically, that the names start to run together at a certain point. In addition, especially throughout the first half of the book, the scientists are from several different (mainly European) countries, and thus their work is taking place in many different laboratories in different cities. Just remembering which nationality someone is can be difficult at times. This is not a criticism of Rhodes; he could not begin to tell the story without all of these people being in it. But it is something to note for the general reader, especially someone who is unfamiliar with most chemists and physicists aside from Albert Einstein, who plays a minor, but pivotal, role in this drama. The most riveting chapter had to do with the actual dropping of the first atomic bomb, over Hiroshima, Japan on August 6, 1945. Rhodes, as he does throughout the book, allows the people involved in the story to explain their thoughts and feelings as much as possible. In this chapter, the remembrances of Japanese who survived the atomic attack are difficult to read. A sample, from page 722, the description by a thirty-year-old woman of encountering a dead person: “The corpse lying on its back on the road had been killed immediately.... Its hand was lifted to the sky and the fingers were burning with blue flames. The fingers were shortened to one-third and distorted. A dark liquid was running to the ground along the hand.” These types of horrible description go on for several pages. Rhodes does not do this to make a moral statement about the U.S. Dropping the bomb on Japan; in fact, he also notes that the Japanese leaders must share some of the blame as their desperate fighting, literally to the death, undoubtedly contributed to Harry Truman's decision to authorize the bombing. But instead he includes the morbid accounts so as the drive home the total devastation and utter ruin that the A-bomb brought into the world. As he accurately states, the bomb did not just destroy thousands of lives, but it completely wiped out an entire city. Rhodes concludes with a forty page Afterword, primarily focusing on the development of the “Super” (or H) bomb. Towards the end, he delves into a philosophic discussion about nation-states, nuclear policy and control, and warfare. While certainly relevant, after reading the preceding chapters detailing the creation of the bomb, it dropping on Japan, the immediate effects upon its people, and all of the political tugs of war in Los Alamos, NM and Washington, this reads as an anti-climax. This is not to say that it does not belong in the book. But rather, the discussion would have been enhanced by some capsules about what all of the various scientists went on to do following WWII. Los Alamos Director Robert Oppenheimer, as an example, had a painful life – both literally and figuratively – through the 1950s and up to his death in 1967. But Rhodes does not choose to mention any of Oppenheimer's travails. Still, it is hard to see how a more complete and accurate depiction of this world-changing event could be told. "
254,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6431984-antonio-rojas,5,"Monumental and Breathtaking!Is a breathtaking journey through the history of nuclear physics and the development of Atomic Theory. It is a masterpiece where Mr. Rhodes regales us with his gift for presenting difficult and intricate concepts in a very logical, insightful, colorful, and above all entertaining fashion.Loosely speaking, the first part of the book covers the key steps that carved the foundations of atomic theory: we get to witness J.J. Thompson discovering the electron; Ernest Rutherford realizing the existence of the nucleus and postulating his “Solar System” model of the atom; Niels Bohr, with a little help from spectroscopy improving that model and carving his more realistic Shell and Orbital design; Chadwick stalking and finally uncovering the neutron; Henri Becquerel and the Curies discovering radioactivity; Heisenberg working his Uncertainty Principle, Schrodinger developing wave mechanics, Pauli his Exclusion Principle. In addition, we become familiar with de Hevesy, John von Neumann, Wigner, Dirac, Millikan, Max Born, Arnold Sommerfeld, Paul Ehrenfest, in summary, all the big architects of Quantum Mechanics and modern physics. But what makes the book a truly superior piece is that Mr. Rhodes, while impeccably describing the science, he submerges the reader into the very personal and complex psychology of each of the characters and the historic context of the time. We see each of these great scientists come to life and wander through history in front of our eyes immersed in the chaotic social and military storm that surrounded the cataclysmic days of the First and Second World Wars.The second part of the book deals more specifically with the creation and the political steps leading to the use of the first atomic bombs on civilian populations by the United States government. We get to see Leo Szilard, the true brain behind the first idea of the atomic bomb and the first to conceptualize the science behind it and its potential consequences; we see Otto Hahn splitting the atom without realizing it and Lise Meitner and Otto Freisch interpreting and using for the first time the term “fission” to name the event; Enrico Fermi “slowing neutrons” and creating a sustained chain reaction; Wigner creating plutonium and enriching uranium; all of this, leading triumphantly to Los Alamos where we witness Edward Teller, Luis Alvarez, Hans Bethe, Lawrence and above all, Robert Oppenheimer, “I am become death, the destroyer of worlds”, where they orchestrated the biggest human effort and enterprise ever achieved: the ability to create the means of our own destruction. Mr. Rhodes cold and non-judgmental recompilation of first hand witnesses and victims of the explosions is both pathetic and truly horrifying. The harrowing images of children aimlessly wandering and holding strips of their own skin, women without feet walking on their ankles, or a man holding his eye in one hand create an infernal motion picture in our brain whose memory is very hard if not impossible to forget. At 790 comprehensive pages excluding Notes, Bibliography, Photo Credits and Index -886 in total- The Making of the Atomic Bomb is a monumental achievement that deserves all the accolades and awards it has gathered through the years. This book is a veritable must read, a must have, a classic."
255,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/204112-damon,5,"Richard Rhodes does a very impressive job of telling how we got to the atomic bomb. He starts in 1900 when Plank looked into a black box and found a new world. The Making of the Atomic Bomb explores the science that makes the bomb possible, the scientist who worked in breaking the atom, the politics which made people want to do it. In doing so it becomes one of the best introductions to quantum mechanics for the laymen. Much better than other books that try to join mysticism and science, Rhodes goes though, in prose, the basics of quantum mechanics and the people who made it. He has also not shy away from using the scientists metaphors to describe the world of the very small (Rutherford's cannon ball is one of the best), nor does he shy away from explaining the concepts that make the bomb possible, like why natural uranium does not explode and why plutonium is much better than uranium. Rhodes also provides a sense a drama the scientist and engineers in New Mexico start to build the bomb. When the first one is exploded, the reader feels a sense of achievement and pride at what man has wrought. And like all good writers, Rhodes is does not let us off the hook, the last portion of the book is a detailed description of the casualties of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The descriptions of the flash burn victims whose blacked, blistered skin peeled off their body exposing the muscle underneath is more than enough for anyone to appreciate Oppenheimer's quote: I am the creator, I am the destroyer.

Yes, it is very long. Yes, the narrative can feel a bit jumpy, especially in the first half. There are a lot of names being used, some of which never re-appear, and a lot of seemingly minor scientific experiments detailed exhaustively. And yes, Rhodes dedicates many pages to discussions that do not feel very relevant in 2013, but were very much so when it was written in the mid-80s and the idea that Russia might nuke us was not very far removed.But all of these elements come together in incredible fashion when the book builds up to moments of great importance: the confirmation of the splitting of the atom; the first self-sustaining nuclear reactor in Chicago; the attack on Pearl Harbor; the Trinity test; the dropping of Little Boy over Hiroshima. These sections are written beautifully and effectively convey the excitement and the historical ramifications. They would not be the same without all of the comprehensive background that is given beforehand, and it is hard to imagine this book being edited down very much.Strongly recommended to anybody with an interest in the bomb, or World War II in general."

There's much more. Rhodes, gifted with sharp psychological insight and a novelist's ability to convey character, reveals the personalities and emotional dynamics among the scientists and others responsible for conceiving, engineering, testing and ultimately dropping the apocalyptic devices on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In addition he describes the struggle in Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan to make the first bomb, as well as the political and military events that led inexorably to the destruction of the Japanese cities.

The book tells nothing but true stories about the people and events that shaped the making of the atom bomb and in a way that keeps your attention. Other books I read on the subject were very dry and boring, but this book holds your attention, even though it is a long book. If you like Cold War history and 20th century history, this book is a must read. How it actually all came together was so complex, it’s a miracle that it happened at all.I read this book back in 1988, just before I joined the Air Force. Little did I know that I would get a job in the Air Force working on equipment that monitored the world for people making nuclear weapons.

265,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/941349-bob,5,"This is an extraordinary work, one of the finest nonfiction books I've ever read. Its breadth and depth of coverage are incredible. It is engagingly written, truly a book hard to put down. It is full of wonderful anecdotes and photographs. The book is a chronological account of the science, engineering, and politics that created the atomic bomb. It is basically in four parts: physics from around 1880 to 1938, physics from 1939 to 1943, engineering and politics from 1941 to 1945, and the postwar aftermath up to around 1955. The first two parts are largely in Europe, the third and fourth mostly in the US. I was not prepared for the depth of coverage of the period from about 1880 to 1938. It is marvelous story, an epic of human achievement well told. I started out in college as a physics major, so I was familiar with the broad outline of this, and many of the names were familiar. In spite of that, I learned an enormous amount. The book wisely keeps the focus on the people, and succeeds wonderfully in making us feel we know them, at least the major players. In summarizing the book, it's hard to know where to start; Rhodes must have felt the same thing. By 1890 or so it was known that there were tiny particles called electrons that were negatively charged, and that the chemical elements were defined by how many electrons were in each atom. Since atoms are neutral, there must be a corresponding positive charge in each atom, but where? For a while it was thought that the positive charge was a sort of smeared out substrate, like the dough in a muffin, with the electrons stuck in it like blueberries. This was disproven (making a long story short) by Ernest Rutherford, New Zealand born British physicist, a poor boy who grew up on a farm. He showed that the positive charge lies in a ""nucleus"", a very small dense center of the atom, with the electrons much farther out, sort of orbiting around like the planets in the solar system. It wasn't long before the proton was discovered, and the fact that the nucleus contains the same number of protons as there are electrons in the outer shell. It was also not long before it was realized that the planetary analogy would not hold. According to the very well established electromagnetic theory of James Clerk Maxwell, the electrons would simply spiral into the nucleus and the atom would cease to exist. Yet the evidence for protons and the nucleus was undeniable. But the electromagnetic theory of Maxwell was extremely highly regarded. In fact Einstein had just used it (1905) to develop the theory of relativity, also highly regarded. What is the explanation? The explanation is most important development in physics since Newton: quantum theory. Quantum theory began with Max Plank and Einstein around 1890-1900, but really got going after 1915 with the work of Niels Bohr, Erwin Schroedinger, Werner Heisenberg and P. A. M. Dirac. Rhodes does not talk too much about quantum theory itself. He manages to keep the focus on nuclear physics. However, he does point out an essential lesson of quantum theory: light is both a wave and a particle. These seemingly contradictory notions exist at the same time in one thing. Bohr came to call this paraodox-that-is-not-a-paradox ""complementarity."" This abstract idea is important later. Of the four names above, two are extremely significant in the story of the atom bomb: Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg. Bohr was born in Denmark in 1885, so was half a generation younger than Rutherford. He explained the atom by showing how the electrons stayed in well defined ""shells"" rather than orbits like planets. Heisenberg, a German, was half a generation younger yet, born in 1901. He and Schroedinger made huge breakthroughs in the 1920s showing that Bohr's model was still not right. Meanwhile, before 1900, Marie and Pierre Curie had discovered radioactivity. Some elements, notably radium and uranium, decomposed with time by ejecting nuclear particles and becoming lighter elements. Eventually (long story cut short) it was realized that the particles being ejected are often ""neutrons"", the last of the three basic particles to be discovered (James Chadwick, 1932). Neutrons live in the nucleus with protons and seem to be a sort of glue holding the nucleus together.  The first phase of the story ends and the second begins in 1939 with the realization by Otto Hahn, Lise Meitner, and her nephew Otto Frisch that a nucleus could be fractured or split by a neutron being ejected from another atom. The first atom might split into two much lighter atoms -- fission -- and eject two or more neutrons, which could in turn hit and split yet more atoms -- a chain reaction. This was a revolutionary idea, quickly understood by Bohr, who carried the news to the US. Soon, scientists in the US, England, Germany, and Japan (yes Japan) were asking themselves, could this chain reaction become a bomb? Meanwhile, of course, was the hugely important rise of Nazi Germany. Many scientists, especially the Jewish ones, fled Germany by 1939. Meitner fled to Sweden in 1938. Frisch fled to England. Bohr (with only one grandparent Jewish) was at first relatively safe in Denmark, and could travel to England and back, but eventually had to flee to Sweden in 1943. Einstein was long since at Princeton. But, as Rhodes explains, many others, who are not household words, fled Nazi Europe and became key players in the saga of the atomic bomb. Among these are Stanislaw Ulam from Poland, Hans Bethe from Germany, and the Hungarian trio of Leo Szilard, Eugene Wigner, and Edward Teller, all of whom came to the US. All played significant roles in the story of the bomb; Szilard and Teller became big actors in the story. Similarly, physicists were fleeing Italy, including Enrico Fermi and Emilio Segre. The second part of the story surges into high gear with the developments in physics showing that a bomb could really work. In England, Chadwick assembled a group that included Frisch and Rudolf Peierls, recently fled from Germany. It became known as the MAUD committee. Frisch and Peierls produced the Frisch–Peierls memorandum, which was the first document to detail how an atomic explosion could be generated. Bohr soon learned about it, as he was also in England. Long story cut short, a bomb could be made from uranium-235 or from plutonium. Uranium occurs rather commonly in nature, but over 99% of it is the form called 238, abbreviated U-238. You can't make a bomb from that, though you can use it for a nuclear reactor. If enough of the much more radioactive U-235 is gotten together in the right way, a bomb will result. Plutonium does not occur in nature and was first synthesized by Glenn Seaborg in the US in 1940. It is also radioactive enough to make a bomb. About the same time, in 1940 Heisenberg began to understand that uranium 235 could make a bomb. Heisenberg did not like Hitler, but he had no Jewish ancestors and no compelling reason to leave Germany. He was asked by the German army to investigate uses of uranium. Rhodes says that Heisenberg thought that the process of actually getting together enough U-235 would be too expensive and difficult, and that is why the German atomic bomb project never got anywhere. In 2000, Thomas Powers published a book called Heisenberg's War in which he claims that Heisenberg deliberately stalled the German atomic bomb project so that Hitler would never have the bomb. It remains controversial, but Rhodes (writing in 1987) does not talk much about Heisenberg. Nonetheless, the British and Bohr assumed that the Germans would understand everything that they did, and would certainly be doing bomb research. This key idea, that the allies must keep up with the Germans, is the start of the third part of the saga, the engineering and political story of the actual making of the bomb. Americans were working too. Already in 1939, Hungarian emigre Leo Szilard realized that fission could be used to make a nuclear reactor and possibly a bomb. Szilard had known Einstein years before; in fact in 1926 they had patented a refrigerator! He became almost obsessed with the idea that President Roosevelt must understand the threat of the Germans having a bomb. In July 1939, Szilard and Wigner drove to Long Island, where Einstein was staying (how they found him is an interesting story). They convinced Einstein to write the now famous letter to FDR urging that the matter be given the highest priority. FDR was impressed, but it took more than one letter. That's a long story; read the book!  Eventually, especially after the Americans learned of the British MAUD committee work, a high level committee was formed to begin the research and manufacture of a bomb. The leaders of this committee were Vannevar Bush, James Conant, and Arthur Compton. Vannevar Bush (no relation to the presidents Bush) was an older engineer, a longtime influential person in the highest levels of academe and government. James Conant was a chemist and the president of Harvard. Arthur Compton had won the Nobel prize in physics in 1927. All of these people are fleshed out wonderfully in Rhodes's book. The big question for the Americans, as it was for the Germans and Japanese, was could the enormous effort to produce the bomb pay off in time for World War II? First, why ""enormous effort""? As Niels Bohr said around 1940, to actually make such a bomb would take half of the industrial apparatus of the United States for two years. This turned out to be only a modest overstatement. Producing enough U-235 was a huge task. Many tons of uranium ore would have to be processed to produce U-238, then a huge painstaking process (invention of Ernest Lawrence) would have to follow. (The Japanese realized this too, and abandoned the atomic bomb as impractical.) Eventually, processing U-235 was done at the Oak Ridge site in Tennessee, a gigantic complex. The alternative was to use plutonium. Plutonium can be created with a nuclear reactor at lesser cost. However, in 1942 no one was sure how to make a bomb out of plutonium, as it is almost too good. If a critical mass is not brought together VERY promptly, it would ""fizzle"", yielding an explosion scarcely any better than chemical bombs. The atomic bomb, of course, is a hundred thousand times better than that. The decision in the US was to do both approaches, to use both U-235 and plutonium. Plutonium was manufactured at another huge new facility, the Hanford Plant in Washington state. These two plants provided the ""brawn"" for the making of the atomic bomb, and employed thousands of people. But the ""brain"" was the third brand new facility built from scratch, the Los Alamos laboratory in New Mexico. This brings us at last to two of the most important names in this subject, Robert Oppenheimer and Leslie Groves. Robert Oppenheimer was born in New York in 1904, the son of a wealthy Jewish importer. With his rather privileged upbringing, Robert had spent some summers in the high plateaus in northern New Mexico. (Photos of the young Oppenheimer look remarkably like Bob Dylan.) I'll skip over his background in physics and how he came to the attention of the Bush committee, but it was decided to put him in overall charge of the construction of the atomic bomb. This was soon given the name Manhattan Project. Based on Oppenheimer's recommendation, a boys' school at Los Alamos was purchased, along with a hundred square miles of surrounding land. Colonel Leslie Groves was appointed the military leader of the project, who technically was above Oppenheimer. Rhodes does a wonderful job sketching how their relationship evolved. In short, both Oppenheimer and Groves did a wonderful job.  Rhodes' description of the building of the Los Alamos lab and the recruiting of the scientists and their families is perhaps the best part of this uniformly excellent book. The big names came, as well as many unknown today and many who later became famous. Enrico Fermi (who had created the first nuclear reactor in history in Chicago), Segre, Frisch, Bohr, Richard Feynman, Ulam, Lawrence, Seaborg, Bethe, two of Fermi's proteges Leona Woods and Herbert Anderson, Peierls and his colleague Klaus Fuchs from England. All of these went on to distinguished careers in the following decades. (more about Klaus Fuchs later.) Security was tight. Not all could take it. Edward Condon, a physicist ironically born in Alamogordo NM, resigned after six weeks: ""The thing which upsets me the most is the extraordinary close security policy.... In my case I found that the extreme concern with security was morbidly depressing -- especially the censoring mail and telephone calls."" Much later he was the target of the House Un-American Activities Committee because he was a ""follower"" of a ""new revolutionary movement"", quantum mechanics!  To make a long story short again, perhaps the biggest problem they solved at Los Alamos was the plutonium bomb. As mentioned above, the key is to force a critical mass of plutonium into a very small volume very quickly, to harness the vast number of neutrons released in the chain reaction. A young physicist named Seth Neddermeyer had the key idea: implosion. That means, arrange a group of ordinary explosives around a hollow sphere of plutonium. Set off the explosives at the same time and they will compress the plutonium into critical mass. This is easier said than done, and besides Neddermeyer the person who made it work was George Kistiakowsky, an ordinance expert. Implosion is not necessary in a U-235 bomb, but, as mentioned above, plutonium is easier to manufacture. There is one strong lesson from all of this: it is very hard to build an atomic bomb! Good! One more physics topic before we get to the more political aspects. The idea of using the energy from a fission bomb (uranium or plutonium atomic bomb) to initiate a fusion reaction (hydrogen bomb) was first proposed casually by Enrico Fermi to Edward Teller in the fall of 1941. Teller latched onto it and made it his ""baby"" until the first hydrogen bomb was detonated in 1952. During the war years at Los Alamos he insisted on working on it even though most of the others said to let it go until after the war. He was vindicated when it did indeed unleash 1000 times more energy than the atomic bombs. To quickly wrap up this phase, the Manhattan project succeeded in producing two plutonium bombs (the one tested in the New Mexico desert and one that fell on Nagasaki) and one U-235 bomb, the one that fell on Hiroshima. Now to the 500 pound gorilla in the room: was all this necessary? Was it morally correct to build and use the bomb, killing 130,000 people? The physicists who worked on the bomb did so almost entirely to make sure that the Allies would not be behind the Germans, who they felt sure were working on an atomic bomb. Many, perhaps half, of those physicists, had escaped Nazi persecution. This was a real and palpable threat to them. I do not see how anyone can argue with that. But did any of them see farther into the future? One especially did so: Niels Bohr. If reading this book will do nothing else, it will make you respect Niels Bohr. Already in 1943, as Los Alamos was just being built, Bohr was looking ahead to a post-war world with atomic weapons. He was terrified at the idea. He held no illusions that we in the US could keep the weapon for ourselves. Once successfully demonstrated, he had no doubt that the Soviet Union could build one in a few years. Indeed, he assumed they were already aware of the Manhattan Project. His solution was radical openness, his ""principle of complementarity."" Recall that this is the phrase he used twenty years earlier to grasp the apparently contradictory notions of quantum mechanics.  Complementarity means that the atomic bomb is a two-edged sword. On the one hand it is a terrible weapon, having the potential to unleash horrific suffering. On the other hand, since governments will realize that, they will be forced to not use it, to try much harder than ever to maintain peace. To help this along, he wanted the US to not only make it clear to everyone that the Manhattan Project was going on, he wanted the US to share everything we learned. He wanted in essence to give away the blueprints (not to the Germans during the war of course), that we would in this way generate enormous good will.  Making a long story short, in 1944 he gained personal audiences with both FDR and Churchill to push this idea. FDR was sympathetic. Churchill was appalled, to the extent that he wanted Bohr arrested. When FDR and Churchill met later in 1944, Churchill prevailed against the already enfeebled FDR, and that was the end of Bohr's far reaching vision. At least, he was not arrested. What about the idea that dropping the bombs on Japan was unnecessary, that the death toll was unprecedented? Rhodes points out that at least the second half of this statement is incorrect. There were already horrific bombings and killings. We all know about the holocaust, but many people today don't seem to know about the German executions of at least 500,000 prisoners in Russia, or the terrible murders and rapes that the Japanese perpetrated in China, which killed 150,000 civilians, or the Battle of Britain, in which the English lost 40,000, or the Dresden fire bombing that killed 25,000, or the Tokyo fire bombing in which 334 B29 bombers killed 90,000 people. The death toll from Hiroshima and Nagasaki was absolutely not unprecedented. Most Americans who lived through those years think that the atomic bombs ended the war and saved several hundred thousand American lives, and probably 500,000 Japanese. A few comments on the fourth phase of this book, the postwar period: Klaus Fuchs, mentioned above, was a Russian spy. He served nine years in prison in England, later emigrated to East Germany. Rhodes never mentions Julius or Ethel Rosenberg. I find that a bit odd. Oppenheimer had married a woman who had been a member of the communist party. This caused him trouble in 1941, but he was appointed to Los Alamos in spite of it. After the war, he had a very good career at Berkeley and Princeton. In 1949 he lost his security clearance because of his prewar communist sympathies, and because of the struggle with Edward Teller, who was championing the building of the hydrogen bomb. Oppenheimer was seen by the scientific community as a martyr to McCarthyism. He came to represent the struggle between right-wing militarists (symbolized by Teller) and left-wing intellectuals (symbolized by Oppenheimer) over the moral question of nuclear bombs.  To wrap up this already long review, let's return once more to the question of should the US have dropped the bombs on Japan. I will let Leona Woods have the last word. She later went on to a long career as a physicist:  ""I certainly do recall how I felt when the atomic bombs were used. My brother-in-law was captain of the first minesweeper. My brother was a Marine on Okinawa. I'm sure they would not have lasted in an invasion. It was clear the war would continue, with half a million of our fighting men dead not to say how many Japanese. You know and I know that [we] firebombed Tokyo and nobody even mentions the slaughter that happened then. They think Nagasaki and Hiroshima were something [very bad] compared to the firebombing. THEY'RE WRONG! I have no regrets. I think we did right, and we couldn't have done it differently. Yeah, I know it has been suggested the second bomb, Nagasaki, was not necessary. ... when you are in a war, to the death, I don't think you stand around and ask, Is it right?' """
266,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85753449-pritam-chattopadhyay,4,"In the foreword to this extremely interesting book, the author writes: The closing days of the Second World War marked a similar turning point in human history, the point of entry into a new era when humankind for the first time acquired the means of its own destruction. The discovery of how to release nuclear energy, and its application to build weapons of mass destruction, has gradually removed the prejudice on which total war is based: the insupportable conviction that there is a limited amount of energy available in the world to concentrate into explosives, that it is possible to accumulate more of such energy than one’s enemies and thereby militarily to prevail. So cheap, so portable, so holocaustal did nuclear weapons eventually become that even nation-states as belligerent as the Soviet Union and the United States preferred to sacrifice a portion of their national sovereignty—preferred to forego the power to make total war—rather than be destroyed in their fury.First published in 1986, this scrupulously researched and broad narrative by Richard Rhodes is the author’s ultimate account, tracing the expansion of the world’s eventual apocalyptic weapon from its origins as a problem in theoretical physics to its devastating culmination at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The book, at the same time, is also a chronicle of the personalities and greatest minds of the 20th century—especially Robert Oppenheimer, Niels Bohr, Leo Szilard, Enrico Fermi, Edward Teller, and Ernest Lawrence — and their inputs to developing the atomic bomb. Rhodes describes exhaustively the great scientific achievements that led up to the invention of the atomic bomb. Everything of importance is examined, from the discovery of the atomic nucleus and of nuclear fission to the emergence of quantum physics, the invention of the mass-spectroscope and of the cyclotron, the creation of such man-made elements as plutonium and tritium, and implementation of the nuclear chain reaction in uranium. Even more important, Rhodes shows how these achievements were thrust into the arms of the state, which culminated in the unfolding of the nuclear arms race. Often brilliantly, he records the rise of fascism and of anti-Semitism, and the intensification of nationalist ambitions. He traces the outbreak of WW II, which provoked a hysterical rivalry among nations to devise the bomb.Rhodes does a brilliant job in explaining the Manhattan Project, with a host of elements on everything from laboratory experiments to training of bombing pilots.The author prophetically observes : I think of a world without nuclear weapons not as a utopian dream but simply as a world where delivery times have been deliberately lengthened to months or even years, with correspondingly longer periods interim during which to resolve disputes short of war. In such a world, if negotiations fail, if conventional skirmishes fail, if both sides revert to arming themselves with nuclear weapons again—then at worst we will only arrive once more at the dangerous precipice where we all stand now.The discovery of how to release nuclear energy, like all fundamental scientific discoveries, changed the structure of human affairs—permanently.How that happened is the story this book attempts to tell."
267,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5672051-brahm,5,"The Making of the Atomic Bomb in audiobook form is just over 37 hours (the book clocks in at 900 pages). It was an immense history of EVERYTHING connected to the atomic weapons program, starting with a great chapter on the ancient philosophy of science, to primers on chemistry and physics, to the evolution of weapons of mass destruction including horrific WWI gas weapons, to post-WWI European politics, to stories of individual scientists and their cumulative discoveries, to stories of the supply chain and secret politics that had to be developed to feed the US atomic weapons program. The book converges to, and ends immediately after the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The Making of the Atomic Bomb was immense, powerful, and comprehensive. I loved the technical depth and the personal stories of the scientists and other actors involved. It feels like I just finished a University course. The pace of scientific discovery in the late 1930s is nothing short of amazing, and the scientists are such interesting characters. In the final chapter, the first-hand accounts of the immediate aftermath of Hiroshima and Nagasaki are graphic and deeply disturbing. It's a big change in tone; you invest hours and hours reading/listening about scientific, political, industrial and engineering progress, making it difficult to face the gut-wrenching, violent outcome. Better understanding of atomic theory and history, but mostly the consequences of nuclear weapons leaves me feeling unsettled over the range and number of nuclear weapons that exist today. They're in the background; we don't think about them. I didn't ever seriously consider or understand the physical damage these weapons can cause, OR the political consequences (ie, the world is locked in an eternal standoff of nuclear powers, even if we don't hear it on the news every day). The audiobook was narrated by Holter Graham. I am brand-new to audiobooks, but I thought it was exceptionally well read. I wonder if dense books are especially well-suited to audiobooks, as a bit of inflection and tone by a careful narrator can really bring a serious, technical and/or dense material to life. "
268,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3816725-larry-bassett,3,"I have to thank audible books for allowing me to actually experience this book. I am pretty sure I never would’ve gotten through even the first half of the book without the help of a skilled reader. I would give the first half of the book 2 stars and the last half of the book 4 stars does arriving at the medium of three stars. The first half or more of the book is way too complicated for my simple science knowledge. It might be very interesting to someone more versed in physics. It goes into great detail about 19th century and early 20th century physics discoveries and it is indefatigable in naming names! Way beyond my ability to compute.The second half of a book is exceedingly more interesting story for the average reader. Some of it you will of heard before but some of the inside stories of the relationships of the scientists Was new information to me. The relationship between science and engineering is something that I am not familiar with. A lot of the story about the development of theory and experimentation. And then an implementation is fascinating. The expansion and development of this $2 billion project beginning with essentially vacant ground in los Alamos and Hartford and Tennessee was very well documented. In the entire book there are about 2600 footnotes. Thank goodness the audible reading skips over those. At the end of the Kindle book there are many photographs of the many characters that appear in starring and supporting roles.I am not sure what the major takeaways of this book are. There is a fair amount of discussion about the debate about the good and evil of the atomic bomb. There was considerable hope among scientists that the bomb might force us to create a world of peace. There was of course some dissension about the use of the bomb but it is clear that once the bomb was created, there was no doubt that it would be used.There are many more pages about the horror of the injuries and deaths in Hiroshima then where necessary. We have read those pages too often. The fact that they were literally getting a third Byam ready when JAPAN finally surrendered is not something I have heard about previously. The argument about the bomb saving American lives was pretty well implanted in this book."
269,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56863096-jeremy,4,"Excellently told history of the incredible story of the development of the atomic bomb. Rhodes starts with some of the history of modern physics as it relates to different developments that led to the bomb, including the scientists. It was great to see Niels Bohr get his proper due; he commonly seems to be overlooked, at least among the general public, as one of the most important scientists in history (though he wasn't directly involved in the Manhattan Project). The science throughout this book is quite thorough and complex. After a while I gave up trying to see if I could follow it. While I appreciate that this book is trying to be comprehensive, for my taste he could have backed off the science a little bit. That said, the feat was incredible, and it is equally incredible that a chain reaction of splitting atoms can create such enormous destructive power.The last third or so of the book was exciting, as we got a behind the scenes look at the political and scientific progress towards the inevitable, and a front row seat to the first test of an atomic bomb. Rhodes spends some time in Hiroshima describing the awful outcome of the bomb in all its brutal reality. I was unaware that the Japanese would have potentially surrendered conditionally, but the US was demanding unconditional surrender. There were a number of prescient voices, Bohr's included, that understood what nuclear weapons meant for the world, a threat we must all now live with. Many of those working on the project experienced the cognitive dissonance of being successful with their work, and the fact that it meant terrible death and destruction for innocent lives, and changed the world forever."
270,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63879552-sebastian,5,"BLUF:There are not many books I would recommend more whole-heartedly. Just read it.Details:This is the story of science, industry, and politics, and how humanity went from wondering about structure of the atom in 1910 to dropping exploding balls of plutonium over Japan in 1945.We begin with bunch of European physicists who in the 1920s and 30s, discover the nature of the atom: Rutherford in England discovering the nucleus in 1911, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle in 1926, the Bohr model, Chadwick's discovery of the neutron in 1932, Fermi's 1934 experiments with neutron bombardment in Rome, and finally Otto Hahn and Lise Meitner publishing on nuclear fission in 1938. Rhodes paints a picture of a world of perhaps 100 physicists who knew each other personally and moved around frequently to collaborate for short periods of time. I wonder how funding worked (when Oppenheimer does research at Cavendish, or similar -- were do the dollars come from?) but no-one seems to worry about grants. Another thing that struck me was how broad some of these scientists were. Einstein and Szilard take a couple years off particle physics to study refrigeration in the 1930s. It's interesting to thing about this period of rapid progress against the example of Bell Labs. Common elements seem to be freedom from funding and publishing concerns, and a degree of flexibility in field of study. Unlike Bell, they aren't as commercially-focused although there is a goal that everyone is working against at least implicitly to map the structure of the atom. Also, Bohr is this convener and hub for the physicists, and I'm not sure a similar figure existed at Bell Labs.1938 is a pivotal year. Hahn / Meitner's write up on fission makes it clear to everyone that a fission chain reaction could power a new source of energy -- or a powerful new weapon. All of the fun of science and discovery takes on new meaning when our science Bund discovers their knowledge could be used for destructive ends. Hitler's Anschluss absorbs Austria and persecution of Jews in Germany begins.* Bohr heroically rounds up as many Jewish scientists as he can and whisks them off to Denmark; Szilard in the UK helps get more to England and the US.The war begins and scientists relocate the United States. Szilard, Einstein, and others (""The Hungarian Conspiracy"") attempt to educate military leadership and Roosevelt himself of the destructive power of the bomb. Eventually they do succeed and the great INDUSTRIAL project of the atomic bomb begins. I went in to the book thinking that Los Alamos would be comparable to Bell Labs. It isn't. As alluded to earlier, most scientists who saw the Meitner/Hahn paper in 1938 could surmise a bomb was possible. What differentiated the US from other countries who were pursing nuclear weapons was that we had the industrial capacity and resources to set up Hanford in Oregon to produce plutonium, and enrich uranium in meaningful quantities at Oak Ridge. But the leap to a bomb wasn't one of great scientific innovation, but rather production.The book ends with about 100 pages describing the Japanese victims of the US nuclear attack. The contrast to the joyful early days of Fermi running up and down his hallway on Via Panisperna and taking measurements with his Geiger counter is stark. Sometimes history unfolds in unexpected ways.Far too much to say about the book than can put in writing. Just read it.*A crazy early anecdote talked about how Chaim Weizmann secured the Balfour Declaration in support of a Jewish homeland during WWI in exchange for supporting the government manufacture acetone which was badly needed for artillery. You can't make this stuff up."
271,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11476806-g-d-brennan,4,"I think this book is a touch overrated.Having said that, I couldn't put it down.""The Making of the Atomic Bomb"" is incredibly well-researched; it's thought-provoking and deep, yet lively and literary. And make no mistake, it is well worth your while; its greatest sections and passages are as absorbing and exciting as anything I've ever read. (As a precocious 4th grader prone to fleeing the world by burying my nose in books, I'd read eagerly about the incredible feats of engineering and physics that went into the atomic bombs; this book made me revert to my 4th-grade-self, walking around Chicago oblivious to the comparatively drab sights and sounds of the real world as I explored the livelier world within.) And given the primary research Rhodes has done, especially the interviews with many of the physicists and chemists who literally manufactured history in a hastily-assembled laboratory in the New Mexico desert, it seems impossible that anyone could put together even a comparably comprehensive history without copiously copping from this one. Nothing else compares; it is the ""War and Peace"" of our only nuclear war.And yet, this feels like a science experiment where one has settled on a hypothesis prior to doing the research, and has ignored or minimized those results that threatened the theory. Rhodes takes us through virtually all of 20th century atomic physics, but he's assembled it in a structure that resembles one of those black hole coin wells one sees at the science center; everything starts out slow and lazy and happy, but eventually things get more energetic and more frentic; valuable time is lost, and valuable money disappears into an abyss of war and militarism. Also, if it shares ""War and Peace's"" strengths, it also shares its flaws; rather than sticking around to observe things and let events speak for themselves, the author spends many of the closing pages on maddening flights of philosophical fancy centered around the potential for worldwide Armageddon that the atomic bomb unleashed. When Rhodes was writing and researching this book--from 1981 to 1986, according to the endnotes--such fears surely seemed lively and compelling, topical and true, matters of monumental import to the whole human race; now they feel quaint and outdated. (In these post 9/11 days of endless hot wars, one almost feels nostalgic for the Cold War. Armageddon clocks ticking down the minutes to midnight? ICBMs on alert in North Dakota, waiting for the launch signals that would send them off on flaming arcs over the polar ice cap, but held at bay only by the prospect of Mutual Assured Destruction? I'll take that over fanatical and resourceful terrorists with a divine mandate any day. Our current world makes MAD feel sane.) At any rate, one realizes at the end that Rhodes' musings are not mere detours at the end of a masterful narrative; they have also warped its course, for in between his excellent chronicling of the bomb's development, Rhodes gets pulled off by other vectors, particularly by Neils Bohr's utopian musings about making nuclear weapons research subject to the same standards of openness and free disclosure that prevail in the rest of scientific discourse.And it's a shame, because in the vast majority of the narrative Rhodes proves himself to be an incredibly talented writer and reporter, with a telling eye for facts and details, and an ease with complicated scientific concepts and analogies that, in turn, sets the reader at ease. I have read many other books on similar subjects and studied nuclear physics at the college level; still, I found myself learning new things from Rhodes' lucid and cogent descriptions of, say, the way a uranium atom fissions almost like a raindrop, or the way a cyclotron spins and separates atomic particles. And he weaves these descriptions into memorable scenes and stories; his descriptions of the construction and operation of the first nuclear reactor, a round-ish pile of graphite bricks and uranium trussed up by wooden scaffolding and nestled in a squash court at the University of Chicago, for instance, are lyrical and unforgettable. It is fascinating to read about the world's top nuclear physicists engaging in an experiment that was by turns precise and haphazard; it is engrossing to envision Enrico Fermi plotting neutron fluxes and calculating reaction coefficients while many of his staff members were wearing leftover raccoon coats to warm themselves against the Chicago winter because they had built the world's first nuclear reactor in an unheated building.Rhodes turns these dead physicists into live characters by keeping his eyes open for the characteristic anecdotes, and his ear tuned for the telling quotes. During the Manhattan Project, for instance, General Leslie Groves, frustrated at wartime copper shortages that threatened to derail the construction of uranium-separating cyclotrons, decided to borrow thousands of tons of silver from the Treasury to build them instead; his assistant was told: ""Colonel, in the Treasury we do not speak of tons of silver; our unit is the troy ounce."" Eventually they ended up with over 10,000 tons of silver, though; Rhodes judiciously uses this fact, and others, to convey the sheer magnitude of America's nuclear effort. Thanks to the Manhattan Project, a whole city sprung up in Tennessee to support the uranium processing efforts, a city with tens of thousands of people which nonetheless remained off the map. And meanwhile the government was establishing the Hanford reservation in Washington State--an area a third the size of Rhode Island. The upshot of all of these efforts, Rhodes tells us, was that the U.S. essentially constructed a nuclear industry from scratch and grew it, in three short years, to be the size of the automobile industry.And yet, of course, it was not about industry alone, but about dropping the product of that industry on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Here, too, I must take issue with the author; he expounds at length on Hiroshima, to the point that one almost becomes numb to its horrors, and yet he skimps on describing Nagasaki. The bomb used there was the more complicated and technically challenging of the two. (The tricky details of its construction end up taking far more space in the narrative than those for the relatively simple gun-type Hiroshima bomb; despite his revulsion at its use, Rhodes clearly admires the complicated engineering challenge it represented.) The mission which dropped it nearly ended up an unqualified and costly failure after it met with a string of bad luck. (Or good luck, at least, for the citizens of Kokura, the Japanese city which was saved from dubious immortality and near-total destruction thanks to unexpectedly cloudy weather that sent the second nuclear mission on to its secondary target; it is doubtful that bad weather has ever been more beneficial for a city and its populace.) And yet the last use of nuclear weapons in anger merits barely more than a page in this lengthy narrative, which is unfair to the reader, unfair to the story, and unfair to the hapless citizens of Nagasaki, whose fluke-filled fate deserves to be better remembered than as a glorified footnote.Short shrift, too, is given to the considerable efforts of Soviet spies at security-heavy Los Alamos; it is possible that much of this information was simply not known when Rhodes wrote, and he did cover this subject in his later ""Dark Sun;"" still, it means this feels somewhat incomplete.None of this is to say that one should avoid this book; it's massive enough and weighty enough that one simply can't avoid it if one is even tangentially interested in these topics. (Indeed, if one were to read only one book on the development and first use of the atomic bomb, this should probably be it.) Still, despite its lengthy word count, its thorough research, and its generally excellent writing, this is neither the last word nor the only word on its subject. "
272,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4828849-michael-burnam-fink,5,"""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.""Robert Oppenheimer, director of the Los Alamos lab, chief designer of the atomic bomb, and a polymath with mystic and leftist inclinations, had the perfect quote for the first artificial dawn of an atomic explosion. There are many ways in which we die: disease, age, accident, violence. And many ways in which we might all die; suddenly in the wake of some cosmological catastrophe or slowly starving on a dying planet. With the atom bomb, it was now possible for a single individual, at the top of a chain of technological and political commitments, to kill almost everyone in the space of an afternoon. The bombs were only used in anger twice, punctuation to end the global slaughter of the Second World War. Since then, history has existed under the shadow of a potential mushroom cloud. This book is the story of how we got there.Rhodes takes almost the first half of the book to establish the basic science and personalities of the atomic bomb. The first half of the 20th century was a golden age for physics which will likely never be equaled, as imaginative theorists and skilled experimenters probed the basic building blocks of the universe. Rutherford and Bohr nailed down, for the first time in evidence rather than speculation, the basic building blocks of matter. Atoms had most of their mass in a small nucleus, and owed their chemical properties to the quantum behavior of electron shells. The neutron was added to the list of fundamental particles. New elements were created by neutron bombardment, and by the late 1930s it was widely known that uranium would fission on bombardment, splitting into two lighter elements, and releasing a large deal of energy. There positive glee of work in this field, at this time, comes through in Rhodes' able biographical sketches of the scientists involved, particularly Bohr, Fermi, and Szilard.Szilard was the first to think of the potential of a fission chain reaction. If some substance, on absorbing a neutron split and released two or more neutrons, could produce a great deal of energy in millionths of a second. It would be a bomb of stupendous power, a city-smasher. Politically perceptive, Szilard had been helping Jewish physicists flee the Nazis for years. He had hoped for an H.G. Wells inspired international coalition to peacefully control this new power, but in 1939 if the bomb was too be invented, best by the Americans or British rather than Hitler.The next section, building the bomb, is less fun. Bohr predicted that you would need to turn all of America into a factory to build a bomb, and that is what the Manhattan project did, mobilizing thousands of scientists, $2 billion, and massive plants to do the hard work of separating fissile U-235 and Plutonium from natural uranium. Bureaucratic confusion and balky precision engineering made the task anything but easy. The other powers pursued the bomb. The British sent over their best to help with the Manhattan project. Germany's team, lead by Heisenberg, never had the necessary priority in the Reich, and were stalled by clever British-Norwegian sabotage directed at a heavy water production facility required for the Nazi reactor design. Japan never had access to the raw material to move beyond theory.The last section is grimmer yet. The design of the bomb was an exercise in precision, in delicately engineered explosive lenses to make the implosion to critical mass happen smoothly in nanoseconds. Tibbetts' B-29 bomber group trained to a razor's edge to accomplish the mission of deploying the 'gadget'. Roosevelt, on approving the Manhattan project, had instinctively reserved the bomb to himself as President. In 1945, Vice President Truman had not been read into the project until he succeeded to the presidency. The bomb was used on Hiroshima because it could be, because the Japanese still resisted, and because something had to be shown for the effort invested. It was a crime, a mass-murder in an instant. Rhodes does not flinch from the horror of Hiroshima.Personally, I think we need to distinguish between the bomb's use at the end of the Second World War, where it seems a matter of degree compared to area bombing rather than kind, and its use now, where that would signal breaking the nuclear taboo. This does not absolve the scientists who built the bomb of their responsibility. Nature's secrets were all around, and once fission had been theorized it was probably only a matter of time before someone figured out how to make it work, but these people made a choice to build Death a supersonic jet bomber to replicate his tired old horse. The Making of the Atomic Bomb is a penetrating look at the most consequential scientific and political moment of the 20th century. I'd give it six stars, if I could. It is also my 1000th review on Goodreads!"

The first half deals with the fundamental physics that makes nuclear weapons possible. The remainder deals with the actual development.My previous understanding of the bomb history stemmed from a movie some 20 years ago. In this film Albert Einstein perceives the potential for the bomb based on his famous equationE=MC squared. He quickly contacts President Roosevelt and FDR assigns a General Groves to develop the bomb ASAP in order to end the war.The actual truth is almost unbelievable.In the late 1930’s physicists in Europe realize that the fission of uranium can be used to make a bomb. Most of these scientists are Jews and they flee Hitler to the U.S. terrified that Germany will develop the bomb. Using what connections they can they approach officers separately in the U.S. army and navy. In both instances they are laughed at. Now more terrified than ever they approach Einstein, hoping his prestige can get word of the danger to someone in power. Einstein actually does have a contact that knows FDR and a letter from Einstein, actually written by our refugee physicists, is taken to the White House and read to FDR. The President seems impressed and says he will act on it. What he actually does is assign a bureaucrat in the Department of Standards to look into this thing. The bureaucrat now puts the letter in his safe and does nothing. It never occurs to FDR to follow-up on what is being done.Meanwhile the Germans and British are working on development and the British think the U.S. is also working on it A year later Churchill concerned about what the U.S. is doing sends a delegation over to discuss the project. They are horrified to find nothing is being done. A lot of screaming and yelling now takes place and finally General Groves is assigned.More than a year had been lost and we are very lucky today that we don’t have to speak German."

Rhodes starts off at the beginning of 20th century understanding of the atom, going into intricate detail about the lives of Bohr, Rutherford, Szilard, et al. He seems equally happy talking about Kierkegaard's Either/Or philosophy, the Pacific Theatre, or the intricacies of isolating Uranium-235. There's a lot of science in this book - I googled a lot but still felt like I missed enough to justify a second reading sometime - and some coverage of the effects of the bomb, the moral concerns of the scientists and politicians involved in its deployment, and the state of today's world. Rhodes wrote this book in the mid-1980s, but of course, the great, numbing, existential threat of the bomb still looms over us today; even if we think of it less."
277,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14945161-sandy-maguire,5,"Amazing book. The first act is a fantastic set of tableaus about the physicists and progression of science necessary to discover the capabilities of the atom. The second act is somewhat dry, regarding mostly the politicking necessary to have made the bomb happen, but there is some decent engineering spliced in here and there. The third is about the war effort, the Trinity test, and the eventual dropping of the bomb. The last chapter is horrifying and not something I'd describe as the feel-good read of the year, but it helps to drive home just how terrible these things are.I would strongly recommend this book to everyone."
278,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76660175-stephen-clare,5,"An astonishing book, dense as lead and explosive as plutonium. It's 800+ pages of tiny text, but there's not a superfluous sentence to be found. Just a staggering amount of information. And no wonder - this book is a textbook of physics in the first half of the 20th century, a case study of the relationship between science and war (and scientists and soldiers), and a history of the rising tolerability of mass civilian slaughter, combined with multiple biographies of some of history's most characteristic scientists.The climax of the book from Trinity to Nagasaki is awesome, cinematic, and chilling. This is a serious investment, but well worth your time."
279,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1045774-mehrsa,4,This is worth reading just because Rhodes is such a gifted writer. But it's also a fascinating story--both the science and the war part.

Like, uber. Not just an exhaustive regarding the scientific aspects, but the social, political and wartime factors that contributed and led up to the creation of the most destructive weapon ever conceived. Even ample knowledge of the personal lives of the scientists involved is conveyed. There is so much about the development of the bomb that I certainly wasn't aware of and I would venture to say that most people aren't. How close that the Nazi's were to developing their own nuclear device, and the fact that the Japanese were actively researching their own atomic bomb. Overall, its good. Very good. But if you're more broadly interested in the history of the nuke... this book might drive you insane. Its hardcore. Also this book stops directly after the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the surrender of Japan, which seems a shame. So much of interest happens in the next several years, including the development of thermonuclear bomb technology (which is conceptually covered in the book), USSR espionage contributing to their own bomb development and the first stages of the arms race."

While it didn't change my mind about nuclear weapons, it did a lot to deepen my thinking about them. Was reading about the successful Trinity test at the moment my wife's water broke and we went to the hospital to have our first baby, which was pretty timely. "
283,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6871223-aaron-million,4,"Richard Rhodes' monumental undertaking here is both admirable and daunting at the same time. As one might expect, the story of the development of the atomic bomb, and of atomic power in general, does not occur overnight and does not involved just a few individuals. It evolves over decades of often pain-staking work done by scientists who span a wide range of nationalities, specialties, opinions, and motivations. As such, a thorough job requires a lot of work – both for Rhodes and for the reader. Not being well-versed in science, and especially in physics, the sections containing detailed discussions of neutrons, electrons, atomic elements, chain reactions, volts, etc... were not the easiest for me to absorb. But that is due to my limited capacity to understand those things, not to Rhodes' writing or researching skills. In fact, he is not just writing for a scientific audience, but for a general audience. Thus, he cannot delve too far into the weeds of nuclear physics without losing quite a few people. But he cannot, at the same time, brush past very important discoveries and experiments. He does an admirable job of finding middle ground: not too detailed to discourage readers, but not superficial enough to upset scientists who understand these advanced topics. Almost as much of a struggle as the scientific aspect, is the difficulty in keeping all of the main characters (and there is no shortage of these) straight. So many people provided significant contributions to the development of the bomb: scientifically, politically, militarily, economically, that the names start to run together at a certain point. In addition, especially throughout the first half of the book, the scientists are from several different (mainly European) countries, and thus their work is taking place in many different laboratories in different cities. Just remembering which nationality someone is can be difficult at times. This is not a criticism of Rhodes; he could not begin to tell the story without all of these people being in it. But it is something to note for the general reader, especially someone who is unfamiliar with most chemists and physicists aside from Albert Einstein, who plays a minor, but pivotal, role in this drama. The most riveting chapter had to do with the actual dropping of the first atomic bomb, over Hiroshima, Japan on August 6, 1945. Rhodes, as he does throughout the book, allows the people involved in the story to explain their thoughts and feelings as much as possible. In this chapter, the remembrances of Japanese who survived the atomic attack are difficult to read. A sample, from page 722, the description by a thirty-year-old woman of encountering a dead person: “The corpse lying on its back on the road had been killed immediately.... Its hand was lifted to the sky and the fingers were burning with blue flames. The fingers were shortened to one-third and distorted. A dark liquid was running to the ground along the hand.” These types of horrible description go on for several pages. Rhodes does not do this to make a moral statement about the U.S. Dropping the bomb on Japan; in fact, he also notes that the Japanese leaders must share some of the blame as their desperate fighting, literally to the death, undoubtedly contributed to Harry Truman's decision to authorize the bombing. But instead he includes the morbid accounts so as the drive home the total devastation and utter ruin that the A-bomb brought into the world. As he accurately states, the bomb did not just destroy thousands of lives, but it completely wiped out an entire city. Rhodes concludes with a forty page Afterword, primarily focusing on the development of the “Super” (or H) bomb. Towards the end, he delves into a philosophic discussion about nation-states, nuclear policy and control, and warfare. While certainly relevant, after reading the preceding chapters detailing the creation of the bomb, it dropping on Japan, the immediate effects upon its people, and all of the political tugs of war in Los Alamos, NM and Washington, this reads as an anti-climax. This is not to say that it does not belong in the book. But rather, the discussion would have been enhanced by some capsules about what all of the various scientists went on to do following WWII. Los Alamos Director Robert Oppenheimer, as an example, had a painful life – both literally and figuratively – through the 1950s and up to his death in 1967. But Rhodes does not choose to mention any of Oppenheimer's travails. Still, it is hard to see how a more complete and accurate depiction of this world-changing event could be told. "
284,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6431984-antonio-rojas,5,"Monumental and Breathtaking!Is a breathtaking journey through the history of nuclear physics and the development of Atomic Theory. It is a masterpiece where Mr. Rhodes regales us with his gift for presenting difficult and intricate concepts in a very logical, insightful, colorful, and above all entertaining fashion.Loosely speaking, the first part of the book covers the key steps that carved the foundations of atomic theory: we get to witness J.J. Thompson discovering the electron; Ernest Rutherford realizing the existence of the nucleus and postulating his “Solar System” model of the atom; Niels Bohr, with a little help from spectroscopy improving that model and carving his more realistic Shell and Orbital design; Chadwick stalking and finally uncovering the neutron; Henri Becquerel and the Curies discovering radioactivity; Heisenberg working his Uncertainty Principle, Schrodinger developing wave mechanics, Pauli his Exclusion Principle. In addition, we become familiar with de Hevesy, John von Neumann, Wigner, Dirac, Millikan, Max Born, Arnold Sommerfeld, Paul Ehrenfest, in summary, all the big architects of Quantum Mechanics and modern physics. But what makes the book a truly superior piece is that Mr. Rhodes, while impeccably describing the science, he submerges the reader into the very personal and complex psychology of each of the characters and the historic context of the time. We see each of these great scientists come to life and wander through history in front of our eyes immersed in the chaotic social and military storm that surrounded the cataclysmic days of the First and Second World Wars.The second part of the book deals more specifically with the creation and the political steps leading to the use of the first atomic bombs on civilian populations by the United States government. We get to see Leo Szilard, the true brain behind the first idea of the atomic bomb and the first to conceptualize the science behind it and its potential consequences; we see Otto Hahn splitting the atom without realizing it and Lise Meitner and Otto Freisch interpreting and using for the first time the term “fission” to name the event; Enrico Fermi “slowing neutrons” and creating a sustained chain reaction; Wigner creating plutonium and enriching uranium; all of this, leading triumphantly to Los Alamos where we witness Edward Teller, Luis Alvarez, Hans Bethe, Lawrence and above all, Robert Oppenheimer, “I am become death, the destroyer of worlds”, where they orchestrated the biggest human effort and enterprise ever achieved: the ability to create the means of our own destruction. Mr. Rhodes cold and non-judgmental recompilation of first hand witnesses and victims of the explosions is both pathetic and truly horrifying. The harrowing images of children aimlessly wandering and holding strips of their own skin, women without feet walking on their ankles, or a man holding his eye in one hand create an infernal motion picture in our brain whose memory is very hard if not impossible to forget. At 790 comprehensive pages excluding Notes, Bibliography, Photo Credits and Index -886 in total- The Making of the Atomic Bomb is a monumental achievement that deserves all the accolades and awards it has gathered through the years. This book is a veritable must read, a must have, a classic."
285,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/204112-damon,5,"Richard Rhodes does a very impressive job of telling how we got to the atomic bomb. He starts in 1900 when Plank looked into a black box and found a new world. The Making of the Atomic Bomb explores the science that makes the bomb possible, the scientist who worked in breaking the atom, the politics which made people want to do it. In doing so it becomes one of the best introductions to quantum mechanics for the laymen. Much better than other books that try to join mysticism and science, Rhodes goes though, in prose, the basics of quantum mechanics and the people who made it. He has also not shy away from using the scientists metaphors to describe the world of the very small (Rutherford's cannon ball is one of the best), nor does he shy away from explaining the concepts that make the bomb possible, like why natural uranium does not explode and why plutonium is much better than uranium. Rhodes also provides a sense a drama the scientist and engineers in New Mexico start to build the bomb. When the first one is exploded, the reader feels a sense of achievement and pride at what man has wrought. And like all good writers, Rhodes is does not let us off the hook, the last portion of the book is a detailed description of the casualties of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The descriptions of the flash burn victims whose blacked, blistered skin peeled off their body exposing the muscle underneath is more than enough for anyone to appreciate Oppenheimer's quote: I am the creator, I am the destroyer.

Yes, it is very long. Yes, the narrative can feel a bit jumpy, especially in the first half. There are a lot of names being used, some of which never re-appear, and a lot of seemingly minor scientific experiments detailed exhaustively. And yes, Rhodes dedicates many pages to discussions that do not feel very relevant in 2013, but were very much so when it was written in the mid-80s and the idea that Russia might nuke us was not very far removed.But all of these elements come together in incredible fashion when the book builds up to moments of great importance: the confirmation of the splitting of the atom; the first self-sustaining nuclear reactor in Chicago; the attack on Pearl Harbor; the Trinity test; the dropping of Little Boy over Hiroshima. These sections are written beautifully and effectively convey the excitement and the historical ramifications. They would not be the same without all of the comprehensive background that is given beforehand, and it is hard to imagine this book being edited down very much.Strongly recommended to anybody with an interest in the bomb, or World War II in general."

There's much more. Rhodes, gifted with sharp psychological insight and a novelist's ability to convey character, reveals the personalities and emotional dynamics among the scientists and others responsible for conceiving, engineering, testing and ultimately dropping the apocalyptic devices on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In addition he describes the struggle in Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan to make the first bomb, as well as the political and military events that led inexorably to the destruction of the Japanese cities. This is a beautifully written book (Rhodes has written a separate book on the craft of writing) that anyone interested in science or history would enjoy."

The book tells nothing but true stories about the people and events that shaped the making of the atom bomb and in a way that keeps your attention. Other books I read on the subject were very dry and boring, but this book holds your attention, even though it is a long book. If you like Cold War history and 20th century history, this book is a must read. How it actually all came together was so complex, it’s a miracle that it happened at all.I read this book back in 1988, just before I joined the Air Force. Little did I know that I would get a job in the Air Force working on equipment that monitored the world for people making nuclear weapons.

295,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/941349-bob,5,"This is an extraordinary work, one of the finest nonfiction books I've ever read. Its breadth and depth of coverage are incredible. It is engagingly written, truly a book hard to put down. It is full of wonderful anecdotes and photographs. The book is a chronological account of the science, engineering, and politics that created the atomic bomb. It is basically in four parts: physics from around 1880 to 1938, physics from 1939 to 1943, engineering and politics from 1941 to 1945, and the postwar aftermath up to around 1955. The first two parts are largely in Europe, the third and fourth mostly in the US. I was not prepared for the depth of coverage of the period from about 1880 to 1938. It is marvelous story, an epic of human achievement well told. I started out in college as a physics major, so I was familiar with the broad outline of this, and many of the names were familiar. In spite of that, I learned an enormous amount. The book wisely keeps the focus on the people, and succeeds wonderfully in making us feel we know them, at least the major players. In summarizing the book, it's hard to know where to start; Rhodes must have felt the same thing. By 1890 or so it was known that there were tiny particles called electrons that were negatively charged, and that the chemical elements were defined by how many electrons were in each atom. Since atoms are neutral, there must be a corresponding positive charge in each atom, but where? For a while it was thought that the positive charge was a sort of smeared out substrate, like the dough in a muffin, with the electrons stuck in it like blueberries. This was disproven (making a long story short) by Ernest Rutherford, New Zealand born British physicist, a poor boy who grew up on a farm. He showed that the positive charge lies in a ""nucleus"", a very small dense center of the atom, with the electrons much farther out, sort of orbiting around like the planets in the solar system. It wasn't long before the proton was discovered, and the fact that the nucleus contains the same number of protons as there are electrons in the outer shell. It was also not long before it was realized that the planetary analogy would not hold. According to the very well established electromagnetic theory of James Clerk Maxwell, the electrons would simply spiral into the nucleus and the atom would cease to exist. Yet the evidence for protons and the nucleus was undeniable. But the electromagnetic theory of Maxwell was extremely highly regarded. In fact Einstein had just used it (1905) to develop the theory of relativity, also highly regarded. What is the explanation? The explanation is most important development in physics since Newton: quantum theory. Quantum theory began with Max Plank and Einstein around 1890-1900, but really got going after 1915 with the work of Niels Bohr, Erwin Schroedinger, Werner Heisenberg and P. A. M. Dirac. Rhodes does not talk too much about quantum theory itself. He manages to keep the focus on nuclear physics. However, he does point out an essential lesson of quantum theory: light is both a wave and a particle. These seemingly contradictory notions exist at the same time in one thing. Bohr came to call this paraodox-that-is-not-a-paradox ""complementarity."" This abstract idea is important later. Of the four names above, two are extremely significant in the story of the atom bomb: Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg. Bohr was born in Denmark in 1885, so was half a generation younger than Rutherford. He explained the atom by showing how the electrons stayed in well defined ""shells"" rather than orbits like planets. Heisenberg, a German, was half a generation younger yet, born in 1901. He and Schroedinger made huge breakthroughs in the 1920s showing that Bohr's model was still not right. Meanwhile, before 1900, Marie and Pierre Curie had discovered radioactivity. Some elements, notably radium and uranium, decomposed with time by ejecting nuclear particles and becoming lighter elements. Eventually (long story cut short) it was realized that the particles being ejected are often ""neutrons"", the last of the three basic particles to be discovered (James Chadwick, 1932). Neutrons live in the nucleus with protons and seem to be a sort of glue holding the nucleus together.  The first phase of the story ends and the second begins in 1939 with the realization by Otto Hahn, Lise Meitner, and her nephew Otto Frisch that a nucleus could be fractured or split by a neutron being ejected from another atom. The first atom might split into two much lighter atoms -- fission -- and eject two or more neutrons, which could in turn hit and split yet more atoms -- a chain reaction. This was a revolutionary idea, quickly understood by Bohr, who carried the news to the US. Soon, scientists in the US, England, Germany, and Japan (yes Japan) were asking themselves, could this chain reaction become a bomb? Meanwhile, of course, was the hugely important rise of Nazi Germany. Many scientists, especially the Jewish ones, fled Germany by 1939. Meitner fled to Sweden in 1938. Frisch fled to England. Bohr (with only one grandparent Jewish) was at first relatively safe in Denmark, and could travel to England and back, but eventually had to flee to Sweden in 1943. Einstein was long since at Princeton. But, as Rhodes explains, many others, who are not household words, fled Nazi Europe and became key players in the saga of the atomic bomb. Among these are Stanislaw Ulam from Poland, Hans Bethe from Germany, and the Hungarian trio of Leo Szilard, Eugene Wigner, and Edward Teller, all of whom came to the US. All played significant roles in the story of the bomb; Szilard and Teller became big actors in the story. Similarly, physicists were fleeing Italy, including Enrico Fermi and Emilio Segre. The second part of the story surges into high gear with the developments in physics showing that a bomb could really work. In England, Chadwick assembled a group that included Frisch and Rudolf Peierls, recently fled from Germany. It became known as the MAUD committee. Frisch and Peierls produced the Frisch–Peierls memorandum, which was the first document to detail how an atomic explosion could be generated. Bohr soon learned about it, as he was also in England. Long story cut short, a bomb could be made from uranium-235 or from plutonium. Uranium occurs rather commonly in nature, but over 99% of it is the form called 238, abbreviated U-238. You can't make a bomb from that, though you can use it for a nuclear reactor. If enough of the much more radioactive U-235 is gotten together in the right way, a bomb will result. Plutonium does not occur in nature and was first synthesized by Glenn Seaborg in the US in 1940. It is also radioactive enough to make a bomb. About the same time, in 1940 Heisenberg began to understand that uranium 235 could make a bomb. Heisenberg did not like Hitler, but he had no Jewish ancestors and no compelling reason to leave Germany. He was asked by the German army to investigate uses of uranium. Rhodes says that Heisenberg thought that the process of actually getting together enough U-235 would be too expensive and difficult, and that is why the German atomic bomb project never got anywhere. In 2000, Thomas Powers published a book called Heisenberg's War in which he claims that Heisenberg deliberately stalled the German atomic bomb project so that Hitler would never have the bomb. It remains controversial, but Rhodes (writing in 1987) does not talk much about Heisenberg. Nonetheless, the British and Bohr assumed that the Germans would understand everything that they did, and would certainly be doing bomb research. This key idea, that the allies must keep up with the Germans, is the start of the third part of the saga, the engineering and political story of the actual making of the bomb. Americans were working too. Already in 1939, Hungarian emigre Leo Szilard realized that fission could be used to make a nuclear reactor and possibly a bomb. Szilard had known Einstein years before; in fact in 1926 they had patented a refrigerator! He became almost obsessed with the idea that President Roosevelt must understand the threat of the Germans having a bomb. In July 1939, Szilard and Wigner drove to Long Island, where Einstein was staying (how they found him is an interesting story). They convinced Einstein to write the now famous letter to FDR urging that the matter be given the highest priority. FDR was impressed, but it took more than one letter. That's a long story; read the book!  Eventually, especially after the Americans learned of the British MAUD committee work, a high level committee was formed to begin the research and manufacture of a bomb. The leaders of this committee were Vannevar Bush, James Conant, and Arthur Compton. Vannevar Bush (no relation to the presidents Bush) was an older engineer, a longtime influential person in the highest levels of academe and government. James Conant was a chemist and the president of Harvard. Arthur Compton had won the Nobel prize in physics in 1927. All of these people are fleshed out wonderfully in Rhodes's book. The big question for the Americans, as it was for the Germans and Japanese, was could the enormous effort to produce the bomb pay off in time for World War II? First, why ""enormous effort""? As Niels Bohr said around 1940, to actually make such a bomb would take half of the industrial apparatus of the United States for two years. This turned out to be only a modest overstatement. Producing enough U-235 was a huge task. Many tons of uranium ore would have to be processed to produce U-238, then a huge painstaking process (invention of Ernest Lawrence) would have to follow. (The Japanese realized this too, and abandoned the atomic bomb as impractical.) Eventually, processing U-235 was done at the Oak Ridge site in Tennessee, a gigantic complex. The alternative was to use plutonium. Plutonium can be created with a nuclear reactor at lesser cost. However, in 1942 no one was sure how to make a bomb out of plutonium, as it is almost too good. If a critical mass is not brought together VERY promptly, it would ""fizzle"", yielding an explosion scarcely any better than chemical bombs. The atomic bomb, of course, is a hundred thousand times better than that. The decision in the US was to do both approaches, to use both U-235 and plutonium. Plutonium was manufactured at another huge new facility, the Hanford Plant in Washington state. These two plants provided the ""brawn"" for the making of the atomic bomb, and employed thousands of people. But the ""brain"" was the third brand new facility built from scratch, the Los Alamos laboratory in New Mexico. This brings us at last to two of the most important names in this subject, Robert Oppenheimer and Leslie Groves. Robert Oppenheimer was born in New York in 1904, the son of a wealthy Jewish importer. With his rather privileged upbringing, Robert had spent some summers in the high plateaus in northern New Mexico. (Photos of the young Oppenheimer look remarkably like Bob Dylan.) I'll skip over his background in physics and how he came to the attention of the Bush committee, but it was decided to put him in overall charge of the construction of the atomic bomb. This was soon given the name Manhattan Project. Based on Oppenheimer's recommendation, a boys' school at Los Alamos was purchased, along with a hundred square miles of surrounding land. Colonel Leslie Groves was appointed the military leader of the project, who technically was above Oppenheimer. Rhodes does a wonderful job sketching how their relationship evolved. In short, both Oppenheimer and Groves did a wonderful job.  Rhodes' description of the building of the Los Alamos lab and the recruiting of the scientists and their families is perhaps the best part of this uniformly excellent book. The big names came, as well as many unknown today and many who later became famous. Enrico Fermi (who had created the first nuclear reactor in history in Chicago), Segre, Frisch, Bohr, Richard Feynman, Ulam, Lawrence, Seaborg, Bethe, two of Fermi's proteges Leona Woods and Herbert Anderson, Peierls and his colleague Klaus Fuchs from England. All of these went on to distinguished careers in the following decades. (more about Klaus Fuchs later.) Security was tight. Not all could take it. Edward Condon, a physicist ironically born in Alamogordo NM, resigned after six weeks: ""The thing which upsets me the most is the extraordinary close security policy.... In my case I found that the extreme concern with security was morbidly depressing -- especially the censoring mail and telephone calls."" Much later he was the target of the House Un-American Activities Committee because he was a ""follower"" of a ""new revolutionary movement"", quantum mechanics!  To make a long story short again, perhaps the biggest problem they solved at Los Alamos was the plutonium bomb. As mentioned above, the key is to force a critical mass of plutonium into a very small volume very quickly, to harness the vast number of neutrons released in the chain reaction. A young physicist named Seth Neddermeyer had the key idea: implosion. That means, arrange a group of ordinary explosives around a hollow sphere of plutonium. Set off the explosives at the same time and they will compress the plutonium into critical mass. This is easier said than done, and besides Neddermeyer the person who made it work was George Kistiakowsky, an ordinance expert. Implosion is not necessary in a U-235 bomb, but, as mentioned above, plutonium is easier to manufacture. There is one strong lesson from all of this: it is very hard to build an atomic bomb! Good! One more physics topic before we get to the more political aspects. The idea of using the energy from a fission bomb (uranium or plutonium atomic bomb) to initiate a fusion reaction (hydrogen bomb) was first proposed casually by Enrico Fermi to Edward Teller in the fall of 1941. Teller latched onto it and made it his ""baby"" until the first hydrogen bomb was detonated in 1952. During the war years at Los Alamos he insisted on working on it even though most of the others said to let it go until after the war. He was vindicated when it did indeed unleash 1000 times more energy than the atomic bombs. To quickly wrap up this phase, the Manhattan project succeeded in producing two plutonium bombs (the one tested in the New Mexico desert and one that fell on Nagasaki) and one U-235 bomb, the one that fell on Hiroshima. Now to the 500 pound gorilla in the room: was all this necessary? Was it morally correct to build and use the bomb, killing 130,000 people? The physicists who worked on the bomb did so almost entirely to make sure that the Allies would not be behind the Germans, who they felt sure were working on an atomic bomb. Many, perhaps half, of those physicists, had escaped Nazi persecution. This was a real and palpable threat to them. I do not see how anyone can argue with that. But did any of them see farther into the future? One especially did so: Niels Bohr. If reading this book will do nothing else, it will make you respect Niels Bohr. Already in 1943, as Los Alamos was just being built, Bohr was looking ahead to a post-war world with atomic weapons. He was terrified at the idea. He held no illusions that we in the US could keep the weapon for ourselves. Once successfully demonstrated, he had no doubt that the Soviet Union could build one in a few years. Indeed, he assumed they were already aware of the Manhattan Project. His solution was radical openness, his ""principle of complementarity."" Recall that this is the phrase he used twenty years earlier to grasp the apparently contradictory notions of quantum mechanics.  Complementarity means that the atomic bomb is a two-edged sword. On the one hand it is a terrible weapon, having the potential to unleash horrific suffering. On the other hand, since governments will realize that, they will be forced to not use it, to try much harder than ever to maintain peace. To help this along, he wanted the US to not only make it clear to everyone that the Manhattan Project was going on, he wanted the US to share everything we learned. He wanted in essence to give away the blueprints (not to the Germans during the war of course), that we would in this way generate enormous good will.  Making a long story short, in 1944 he gained personal audiences with both FDR and Churchill to push this idea. FDR was sympathetic. Churchill was appalled, to the extent that he wanted Bohr arrested. When FDR and Churchill met later in 1944, Churchill prevailed against the already enfeebled FDR, and that was the end of Bohr's far reaching vision. At least, he was not arrested. What about the idea that dropping the bombs on Japan was unnecessary, that the death toll was unprecedented? Rhodes points out that at least the second half of this statement is incorrect. There were already horrific bombings and killings. We all know about the holocaust, but many people today don't seem to know about the German executions of at least 500,000 prisoners in Russia, or the terrible murders and rapes that the Japanese perpetrated in China, which killed 150,000 civilians, or the Battle of Britain, in which the English lost 40,000, or the Dresden fire bombing that killed 25,000, or the Tokyo fire bombing in which 334 B29 bombers killed 90,000 people. The death toll from Hiroshima and Nagasaki was absolutely not unprecedented. Most Americans who lived through those years think that the atomic bombs ended the war and saved several hundred thousand American lives, and probably 500,000 Japanese. A few comments on the fourth phase of this book, the postwar period: Klaus Fuchs, mentioned above, was a Russian spy. He served nine years in prison in England, later emigrated to East Germany. Rhodes never mentions Julius or Ethel Rosenberg. I find that a bit odd. Oppenheimer had married a woman who had been a member of the communist party. This caused him trouble in 1941, but he was appointed to Los Alamos in spite of it. After the war, he had a very good career at Berkeley and Princeton. In 1949 he lost his security clearance because of his prewar communist sympathies, and because of the struggle with Edward Teller, who was championing the building of the hydrogen bomb. Oppenheimer was seen by the scientific community as a martyr to McCarthyism. He came to represent the struggle between right-wing militarists (symbolized by Teller) and left-wing intellectuals (symbolized by Oppenheimer) over the moral question of nuclear bombs.  To wrap up this already long review, let's return once more to the question of should the US have dropped the bombs on Japan. I will let Leona Woods have the last word. She later went on to a long career as a physicist:  ""I certainly do recall how I felt when the atomic bombs were used. My brother-in-law was captain of the first minesweeper. My brother was a Marine on Okinawa. I'm sure they would not have lasted in an invasion. It was clear the war would continue, with half a million of our fighting men dead not to say how many Japanese. You know and I know that [we] firebombed Tokyo and nobody even mentions the slaughter that happened then. They think Nagasaki and Hiroshima were something [very bad] compared to the firebombing. THEY'RE WRONG! I have no regrets. I think we did right, and we couldn't have done it differently. Yeah, I know it has been suggested the second bomb, Nagasaki, was not necessary. ... when you are in a war, to the death, I don't think you stand around and ask, Is it right?' """

The discovery of how to release nuclear energy, and its application to build weapons of mass destruction, has gradually removed the prejudice on which total war is based: the insupportable conviction that there is a limited amount of energy available in the world to concentrate into explosives, that it is possible to accumulate more of such energy than one’s enemies and thereby militarily to prevail. So cheap, so portable, so holocaustal did nuclear weapons eventually become that even nation-states as belligerent as the Soviet Union and the United States preferred to sacrifice a portion of their national sovereignty—preferred to forego the power to make total war—rather than be destroyed in their fury.First published in 1986, this scrupulously researched and broad narrative by Richard Rhodes is the author’s ultimate account, tracing the expansion of the world’s eventual apocalyptic weapon from its origins as a problem in theoretical physics to its devastating culmination at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The book, at the same time, is also a chronicle of the personalities and greatest minds of the 20th century—especially Robert Oppenheimer, Niels Bohr, Leo Szilard, Enrico Fermi, Edward Teller, and Ernest Lawrence — and their inputs to developing the atomic bomb. Rhodes describes exhaustively the great scientific achievements that led up to the invention of the atomic bomb. Everything of importance is examined, from the discovery of the atomic nucleus and of nuclear fission to the emergence of quantum physics, the invention of the mass-spectroscope and of the cyclotron, the creation of such man-made elements as plutonium and tritium, and implementation of the nuclear chain reaction in uranium. Even more important, Rhodes shows how these achievements were thrust into the arms of the state, which culminated in the unfolding of the nuclear arms race. Often brilliantly, he records the rise of fascism and of anti-Semitism, and the intensification of nationalist ambitions. He traces the outbreak of WW II, which provoked a hysterical rivalry among nations to devise the bomb.Rhodes does a brilliant job in explaining the Manhattan Project, with a host of elements on everything from laboratory experiments to training of bombing pilots.The author prophetically observes : I think of a world without nuclear weapons not as a utopian dream but simply as a world where delivery times have been deliberately lengthened to months or even years, with correspondingly longer periods interim during which to resolve disputes short of war. In such a world, if negotiations fail, if conventional skirmishes fail, if both sides revert to arming themselves with nuclear weapons again—then at worst we will only arrive once more at the dangerous precipice where we all stand now.The discovery of how to release nuclear energy, like all fundamental scientific discoveries, changed the structure of human affairs—permanently.How that happened is the story this book attempts to tell."

It was an immense history of EVERYTHING connected to the atomic weapons program, starting with a great chapter on the ancient philosophy of science, to primers on chemistry and physics, to the evolution of weapons of mass destruction including horrific WWI gas weapons, to post-WWI European politics, to stories of individual scientists and their cumulative discoveries, to stories of the supply chain and secret politics that had to be developed to feed the US atomic weapons program. The book converges to, and ends immediately after the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The Making of the Atomic Bomb was immense, powerful, and comprehensive. I loved the technical depth and the personal stories of the scientists and other actors involved. It feels like I just finished a University course. The pace of scientific discovery in the late 1930s is nothing short of amazing, and the scientists are such interesting characters. In the final chapter, the first-hand accounts of the immediate aftermath of Hiroshima and Nagasaki are graphic and deeply disturbing. It's a big change in tone; you invest hours and hours reading/listening about scientific, political, industrial and engineering progress, making it difficult to face the gut-wrenching, violent outcome. Better understanding of atomic theory and history, but mostly the consequences of nuclear weapons leaves me feeling unsettled over the range and number of nuclear weapons that exist today. They're in the background; we don't think about them. I didn't ever seriously consider or understand the physical damage these weapons can cause, OR the political consequences (ie, the world is locked in an eternal standoff of nuclear powers, even if we don't hear it on the news every day). The audiobook was narrated by Holter Graham. I am brand-new to audiobooks, but I thought it was exceptionally well read. I wonder if dense books are especially well-suited to audiobooks, as a bit of inflection and tone by a careful narrator can really bring a serious, technical and/or dense material to life. "
298,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3816725-larry-bassett,3,"I have to thank audible books for allowing me to actually experience this book. I am pretty sure I never would’ve gotten through even the first half of the book without the help of a skilled reader. I would give the first half of the book 2 stars and the last half of the book 4 stars does arriving at the medium of three stars. The first half or more of the book is way too complicated for my simple science knowledge. It might be very interesting to someone more versed in physics. It goes into great detail about 19th century and early 20th century physics discoveries and it is indefatigable in naming names! Way beyond my ability to compute.The second half of a book is exceedingly more interesting story for the average reader. Some of it you will of heard before but some of the inside stories of the relationships of the scientists Was new information to me. The relationship between science and engineering is something that I am not familiar with. A lot of the story about the development of theory and experimentation. And then an implementation is fascinating. The expansion and development of this $2 billion project beginning with essentially vacant ground in los Alamos and Hartford and Tennessee was very well documented. In the entire book there are about 2600 footnotes. Thank goodness the audible reading skips over those. At the end of the Kindle book there are many photographs of the many characters that appear in starring and supporting roles.I am not sure what the major takeaways of this book are. There is a fair amount of discussion about the debate about the good and evil of the atomic bomb. There was considerable hope among scientists that the bomb might force us to create a world of peace. There was of course some dissension about the use of the bomb but it is clear that once the bomb was created, there was no doubt that it would be used.There are many more pages about the horror of the injuries and deaths in Hiroshima then where necessary. We have read those pages too often. The fact that they were literally getting a third Byam ready when JAPAN finally surrendered is not something I have heard about previously. The argument about the bomb saving American lives was pretty well implanted in this book."
299,0684813785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56863096-jeremy,4,"Excellently told history of the incredible story of the development of the atomic bomb. Rhodes starts with some of the history of modern physics as it relates to different developments that led to the bomb, including the scientists. It was great to see Niels Bohr get his proper due; he commonly seems to be overlooked, at least among the general public, as one of the most important scientists in history (though he wasn't directly involved in the Manhattan Project). The science throughout this book is quite thorough and complex. After a while I gave up trying to see if I could follow it. While I appreciate that this book is trying to be comprehensive, for my taste he could have backed off the science a little bit. That said, the feat was incredible, and it is equally incredible that a chain reaction of splitting atoms can create such enormous destructive power.The last third or so of the book was exciting, as we got a behind the scenes look at the political and scientific progress towards the inevitable, and a front row seat to the first test of an atomic bomb. Rhodes spends some time in Hiroshima describing the awful outcome of the bomb in all its brutal reality. I was unaware that the Japanese would have potentially surrendered conditionally, but the US was demanding unconditional surrender. There were a number of prescient voices, Bohr's included, that understood what nuclear weapons meant for the world, a threat we must all now live with. Many of those working on the project experienced the cognitive dissonance of being successful with their work, and the fact that it meant terrible death and destruction for innocent lives, and changed the world forever."
