There are those who contend that since the brain is a physical object, subject to physical laws, human behavior is pre-determined, and thus the antithesis of free. Does a lesion in one’s frontal lobe give credence to a defense of “The Devil Made Me Do it?” Where lies personal responsibility? Michael S. Gazzaniga - image from 89.3 KPCC - NPRMichael Gazzaniga contends that we are more than the sum, or volume, of our parts and, in the system of human interactions, we are personally responsible for our actions. Duh-uh. I heard that from Sister Raymond in first grade. Of course Gazzaniga offers a bit more persuasion than a stinging yardstick, an alarmingly florid complexion and a peculiar wardrobe. He does this by walking us through the history of how our understanding of the human brain has advanced over time. And in this lies the core value of the book. Did you know that there was a time when it was thought that the brain was a single undifferentiated mass? “Equipotentiality” was the term for this. I like to think of this as the jello model, the same stuff throughout, but with ridges. (and if you are interested in serving your guests a yummy gelatinous dessert in a mindful shape, you might try this link). With more time and research it became clear that, different parts of the brain specialize in different things. This is called “neural specificity.” And here is where brain size falls down as a predictor of intelligence. There are creatures that have larger brains than us naked apes, but ours is arranged differently, with more specialization in its parts. I was particularly smitten with Gazzaniga’s description of how certain reactions have become ingrained, instinctual, while others are not, for example, snakes. I imagine there are some rare individuals, herpetologists I expect, who are not put off by the presence of our slithery fellow-Earthlings, but for most of us, discomfort is the norm. So, there must have been issues with snakes in human history. Early humans who were not put off by such critters were selected out of the gene pool in the usual way, while those who harbored an aversion lived to flee, and breed, another day. And the reverse applies. Say, for example, that after millennia of being preyed upon by clowns, a fear of clowns had become pervasive. Then, over a few thousand years on a remote island where clowns had all died out, that fear would fade from the instinctual default of island residents, as there would be no natural selection advantage to being afraid of clowns. Eventually, people who still carried the instinct to fear clowns might be thought a bit odd. The genes of those whose brains were able to distinguish sweet fruit from poison berries are likely to have made it down the years. The genes of those lacking the ability would not have fared so well. And so on. Another amazing advance was to understand that people in times of ecological disruption are selected for their adaptability, while during periods of stability it is the hard-wired sorts whose genes hold sway. It made me wonder about the genetic inheritance of political orientations. I would expect that there is some part or arrangement of our cranial makeup that orients toward keeping things the same, and another arrangement or part that is oriented more toward adaptability, making those with that trait more comfortable with change. Given the volatile state of the planet these days, I hope the adaptables are having lots of kids. A discussion of a brain function known as “the interpreter” had me riveted. There is so much in this book, and a lot more than I have mentioned here, that is absolutely fascinating that I had to hold myself back from just making a list of them all. It might be lightly informative, but perhaps I do not want my accountant genes to overwhelm the right side of my brain. There is enough food for thought here for a Mensa feast. For large swaths this book had me figuratively resting my cheekbones on my fists and saying “wow, cool.“And lest one fear that this is a med-school text in brain history for budding neuroscientists, I would suggest trying to calm your inherent fears. Gazzzaniga writes in a very easy-to-read manner, quite accessible to the average reader. If it is not already clear, I very much enjoyed this book. That said, I have a few gripes. Gazzaniga presents considerable science in this book, and posits a differentiation between the brain and the mind. Yet, he never gets around to defining what the mind is. Yes, we all know what the mind is, sort of. In a book that is about science, shouldn’t the author offer a definition? Did my sleepy eyes just miss it? He argues against a notion that people are not responsible for their actions because they are part of the physical world. But he offers only one name, Richard Dawkins, as a supporter of such notions. It seemed to me a bit of straw man argument. If you are going to argue against someone else’s theory, one should document where and by whom the challenged position is held. Dawkins alone hardly constitutes a school of thought.If you find learning fun, you will love this book. It qualifies as brain candy. And between you and me, I take full responsibility for recommending Who’s in Charge. =============================EXTRA STUFFA February, 2014 National Geographic item offers a look at the brain as you have never seen it before. Interesting stuff, not least for offering information about just how much computer memory it takes to map our gray matter.January 2018 - National Geographic Magazine - an article that is definitely worth checking out - The Science of Good and Evil, on finding what is innate, and what is learned. The on-line article was re-titled The Science Behind Psychopaths and Extreme Altruists, which is probably more accurate - by Yudhijit Bhattacharjee"
1,0061906107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,3,"The start of this book is pretty much the same as Sam Harris’s Free Will. But this guy comes to the opposite conclusion. A tad frustrating, I guess, but no less interesting for that.Let’s have a look at the problem. In the middle of this book he has a really lovely analogy explaining the barriers that reductionism places in front of our understanding of free will.Let’s say you wanted to understand the problem of traffic congestion. To what extent would understanding the workings of a car’s spark plugs help you to understand traffic flows or traffic jams? Or perhaps a better question to ask is if we were to invent a better spark plug would that help in any way to fix traffic congestion?I assume the answer is that it would not and that to understand traffic congestion by gaining a better understanding the components making up individual cars is really turning to a microscope when we should be getting a telescope. These are matters of scale and often the problem with our analysis is not that we are looking at the wrong things so much, as looking at them from the wrong scale.So, what of free will?Well, the problem is that how we think we live in the world and how we actually live in the world are constantly being shown as quite different things. We prefer to think of ourselves as agents – that the flow of our actions goes something like this: we are engaged in the world, something happens, we consider the various inputs presented by this happening, we propose various alternative actions in response to those inputs, we consider the implications of these alternatives, and then – finally – we choose to act. The uncomfortable fact is that in most studies the exact opposite is shown to happen. Our brains can’t wait around for our conscious awareness before we respond – we have to respond prior to conscious mediation. If there is a snake we need to jump away from it before going through the ‘oh look, what’s that thing over there, gosh, I do believe it might just be a snake. Now, snakes oftentimes tend to be rather dangerous. I guess I really ought to find some way of avoiding it, perhaps I should…” You know, by this stage we would be dead. We respond on autopilot, but our conscious minds don’t like the idea that they are cut out of the loop and so they make up stories that say we decided to act, we chose to act, that our action was willed, but actually our conscious minds decided all this after the event – and we fall for these stories every time. We have a very strong preference for imagining ourselves in control.There is a lovely example related to this idea given in the book (although, it might seem a little off-to-the-side until you think about it). Raise your finger and touch the end of your nose. It seems like you ‘feel’ the sensation on both your fingertip and the tip of your nose at exactly the same time. But for these sensations to be ‘felt’ they really need to be registered in your brain. To ‘feel’ both (that is, to become consciously aware of both sensations) nerve impulses need to travel from either your nose or from your finger to your brain. That is, there needs to be an impulse that travels virtually no distance in the case of your nose or maybe half a metre in case of your finger. The nerve impulse from your finger needs to go up your arm, over to your spine, up your spine and so on. He says the difference in time between your brain receiving the signal from your nose and in receiving the signal from your finger could be as much as a half second’s lag, that is, long enough that it ought to be ‘noticeable’. Yet no one does notice this difference – everyone experiences both sensations occurring at exactly the same time. And why? Well, because out brain makes sense of the big picture and so forces the two things appear to have happened instantaneously. This is an example of what computer programmers refer to as ‘a feature, rather than a fault’.It is this post-hoc explanation of our actions that makes the whole issue of free will problematic. It is as if we are so obsessed with narrative (in creating a story that has the right ‘flow’, that makes sense) that we tend to think that the stories we come up with are the explanations for our actions and that these stories ‘cause’ our actions. Unfortunately, it can be shown experimentally that our actions come first and our explanations (or even our conscious awareness) comes very much later. Now, before we go too much further I think it is important to say that the author of this one is someone who had been involved in neurology for ages and was involved in some of the early work on split-brained patients. A lot of the early parts of this book looks at this work in some detail. I think it is important to know this guy is ‘in the field’, you know, not just an interested journalist or something.We like to think of ourselves as having free will and this means of our having agency. This is our most common opinion of ourselves and as such it defines our relationship with the world. Minute by minute we have the feeling that we could just as easily leave off doing what it is that we are doing and go do something else, something completely different. So, the fact that we succeed or fail is, ultimately, related to the fact we do or do not keep going at a particular task that ought to lead to success. And in those ‘second by seconds’ we constantly need to ‘will’ ourselves to keep going – and so it comes down to our moral fortitude (or lack of such fortitude) that decides whether we succeed in life or not. And this is what makes us feel we are free agents with a free will.But is this feeling justified? To the author the problem is – as I mentioned at the start of this review – a problem of scale. If we try to answer this problem on the basis of an individual making a decision in isolation, then the ‘free will’ answer doesn’t make a lot of sense. But the author believes that free will, in the sense of completely abstract freedom to choose our actions without reference to the real world in which we live makes no sense either. He says the solution is in looking at how the individual relates to other individuals and how the individual has been shaped by evolutionary forces to be a social animal.The author is really seeking to give a place for individual agency – even after it seemed he had taken away much of the ground for this agency in the early discussion in the book. Given there is a real sense in which to be responsible for our actions we need to have willed those actions – and, as the author has already shown, there is reason to doubt we really do will our actions – to what extent should we be held responsible for our actions? To what extent does it make sense to punish people for their actions?This guy wants to say that the limits placed on our free will by the fact that our conscious awareness and justification for our actions so often come after we have already acted, doesn’t take away our fundamental responsibility for those actions. His argument is that we are looking at the problem in the wrong scale – responsibility isn’t so much about individuals acting without context, but individuals acting very much within a social context. He claims that we have evolved to want to punish those who transgress rules, and that punishing such transgressions makes sense and that we want those punishments to be proportionate to the crime. To support this view he attacks determinism – the view that we are not agents, but rather that our actions are determined by outside forces. He does this in a couple of odd ways. One is to show that determinism is no longer acceptable in physics (think Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle). This seems to suffer the same problem that his traffic and car part problem illuminated earlier. Just because there is no determinism in the position or velocity of an electron seems hardly relevant to explaining human legal processes. Yet again, a problem of scale.He ends by effectively saying; look, if you are driving a car on a free way and you see a police car, you will check your speed and, if necessary, slow down. That is, you will do the right thing. You will do what you know to be right. So, therefore, free will exists – you can choose to do the right thing and there are circumstances where you will virtually always do the right thing – so you should be held accountable for your actions at all times, whether there is a police car around or not. Free will exists.Hmm. This is a strange argument given the stuff he explained at the start of the book to prove that our actions come before our conscious justifications for them. However, he claims this is all resolved by focusing on our evolved responses and the fact we are social animals. But this is my main problem with the book. I think he has been tricked by the scale problem he mentioned himself. He makes endless reference to brain structures and to physics and to the impossibility of knowing the impact of a brain legion on mind – all good stuff. However, he makes no mention at all of any social science. This is understandable, in some ways, as social science is very much seen as ‘science-lite’ by those in the hard sciences. But the problem is that if you want to talk about the impact of society on individual free will, then you really are talking about social science. And pretending you are the first person to have thought about these issues may or may not be disingenuous, but if it is not then it does display a breathtaking ignorance.We tend to think that we like particular types of music because we like how it sounds and that it is an expression of our individual taste – but Bourdieu was able to show in his book Distinctions that our tastes, far from being purely subjective (as we like to assume they are) are very much linked to how we belong to various social groups. We wear as a badge of honour our liking of Rap or Mahler or the Classic Hits of the 70s, 80s and 90s (kill me now). But these preferences – which we believe so tellingly reveal our innate personalities – in fact, are mostly predictable from our social location. Does that mean that if you are a university professor you will not like AC/DC? No. But on average it is much more likely that a university professor will know who Bruckner is and that a panel beater will know who Run DMC are. To me, the problem is that our brains are tuned to make us feel as though we are agents, that we have a free will, even when that free will can be shown to be restricted to the point that we can say, with near certainty, that what most people mean by free will simply does not exist. Most people think they are responsible for their actions – but there are so many influences on us, so many forces pushing and pulling on us, forces that we are often almost completely unaware of, that we are anything but reliable witnesses even to our own actions. And because we are so certain we have free will – and because so much evidence points in the opposite direction – if we were sensible, I think we would start from the assumption that we don’t have any free will at all. People get worked up about this because it so clearly goes against ’natural feeling’. But also because they can see that if we are not responsible for our actions then we don’t get to punish people who do wrong – and god knows we do love to punish people who do wrong. But if there is one lesson from religion it does seem to be to forgive your enemies and to leave vengeance to god. I think this isn’t such a bad idea (and I’m an atheist). The fact we keep this idea in our religions (where we can safely ignore it) says something rather sad about us, I think. But imagine for a second if it was true that people tend to act in accordance to the circumstances in which they find themselves. Then surely, rather than punishing people for the ‘bad’ things they do, we should spend more time thinking about how to create social situations where such bad actions would be impossible. You see, our obsession with individuals and free will means we have entire legal structures set up to find the best ways to punish individuals who choose to act in ways that are anti-social. But we don’t ever seem to think about how we could change society to make such behaviour impossible, you know, rather than inevitable. The recent gun massacre in the United States is a case in point (in the sense there will always have been a recent gun massacre in the US this review can be timeless). And that is the problem with this book – it is so terrified of determinism stealing our free will that it spends half of the book trying to find ways to make sure the individual is left to be blamed for their actions. But this is the wrong end of the telescope – even if this is the end of the telescope we rush to every time. This is the end that gives us our most pleasing view of ourselves – even when it makes us look like monsters. The other end of the telescope shows all of the societal influences that act upon us. The societal influences that mean some of us will inevitably act appallingly. It is this end of the telescope that makes us all responsible for the vile acts that occur in our society – not the side that makes us feel comfortably content with having some individual to blame. Even if that individual is us.Maybe we should spend some time thinking about those societal influences and how we could change them. Just for once, just for a change."
2,0061906107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,4,"Michael Gazzaniga is a leading neuroscientist, and he has written a fascinating book on the subject of free will. Interestingly, we want to have free will ourselves, but we don't want others to have it. We want other people to act efficiently, and basically to think the same way that we do.The book examines consciousness and free will from many different perspectives; emergence, evolution, epigenetics, neurons, quantum mechanics, morality, the justice system, split-brain patients, sociology and culture.With all these viewpoints thrown together, the story sometimes gets lost. It's clear that Gazzaniga is not a determinist, but his answer to the question of free will is not a simple one. This is a short book, but definitely not easy to read, despite each chapter being split up into a number of short sections. I think that to really understand the book, it requires multiple readings. "
3,0061906107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5555043-the-pirate-ghost-formerly-known-as-the-curmudgeon,4,"4.5 StarsThis is a very good read. Gazzaniga explains the workings of the brain in terms that rarely get technical. He puts modern understanding of the neurology of our minds into context with history, free will, evolution. Though neurology is a complex subject, Gazzaniga does a very good job of keeping it understandable. It is non-fiction and it is not a story like an autobiography. Gazzaniga does as good a job as he can at telling the story of our brain in a way that is entertaining and easy to read or listen too.Gazzaniga is not ""ha-ha funny"" but he manages to be amusing, has a good, comfortable writing style and even managed to make me laugh a couple of times. He is very interesting and knows how to work a scientific mystery to good effect. I take a half star away because I think he skirted some of the ethical issues with the initial experiments and should have talked openly about them. This is a scientific explanation, not a religious, faith based or even remotely spiritual explanation, though Gazzaniga surely rubs against those things as he unfolds the big picture and the detailed picture of how things work and who's in charge. Good read. "
4,0061906107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5889085-h-wesselius,2,"Gazzaniga provides a succinct enough summary of current research into the brain. However, its when he addresses the notion of free will that the book falls flat. In attempt to find room for free will, he takes a detour into quantum physics and probability theory. Even if one accepts his argument, this only grants free will within a limited range offer by a list of probabilities. To contend that free will on this basis is rather difficulty so he also provides the common sense idea that we do employ choice when we make simple decisions. Secondly cultural context is asserted to be as influential as biology. In the end he follows the evidence and accepts some form of determinism. He then asserts free will and determinism are not odds and can coexist. This is probably true but its not what the evidence states in his book. "
5,0061906107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1072582-kaethe-douglas,0,"Added to my list with some trepidation. For one thing, Tom Wolfe blurbed it, and Wolfe is a reactionary assberet, so that's hardly a glowing recommendation. And then the snippet says ""counters the common wisdom that our lives are wholly determined by physical processes we cannot control. "" And I think, ""Oh, really?"" That ""wholly determined"" looks like a strawman to me, thrown up to give the author a very low standard of proof. Not to mention that ""free will"" is so rich in religious connotation."
6,0061906107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/343908-elizabeth,5,"Here is a book to give your brain a workout! Wow! I listened to it being read by Pete Larkin. He was an outstanding narrator. I only understood a fraction of the content and I would need to read it several times to catch on, I think. The big explode your head premise is that the concepts of free will and responsibility may be fallacies. And our civilization is based on these ideas.Other “subplots” in no certain order were:Your primitive brain is still there; Tension between developing societal standards and understanding individual brains; How much of our life is emotional and how much of our brain is emotional? (and everyone is different!); Complexity of the brain and how an injury can have consequences for everything and everyone; andThe left and right hemispheres of the brain.I wonder how much knowledge of the brain has changed since this book was written in 2011? As we know, learning is happening very rapidly. And this is the quote I loved from the book:“I once asked Leon Festinger, one of the smartest men in the world, whether or not he ever felt inept. He replied, “Of course! That is what keeps you ept.”"

8,0061906107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5223057-aaron,3,"Despite the author's initial claim that some vestige of free will could be salvaged from the jaws of determinism, he does a pretty good job demolishing that claim. All the while, he mucks around in the many very interesting weeds. In fact, the interesting weeds were what propped up this rating to three stars.The author's premise seems to be a form similar to ""god of the gaps,"" wherein the uncertainty of not knowing something or not being able to measure something leaves room for other sorts of dubious concepts. Call me skeptical.However, he does make one case that is important enough to consider. He elaborates on the idea of emergence, the fact that simply looking at, in what is is most used example, parts of a car will not allow one to predict rush hour traffic congestion. That is, a complex system like the brain or like traffic is more than the sum of its constituent parts. He uses this to suggest that free will can't be predicted from studying the brain's components, instead moving it into the realm of social interaction. Once he does this, he continues to undermine the case for free will by presenting all of the constraints that act upon human social relations, until we're left with the idea that there is, after all, no such thing as free will. I'll admit I might have missed something, but I don't really think so. In the end, I think the conclusion we can draw is that while our actions might not be able to be reliably predicted (doing so might actually require a higher level of emergence), neither are they completely unconstrained. Insofar as free will exists, it appears to be a useful illusion that we can treat as real for a good number of purposes. "
9,0061906107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10955711-joseph-monaco,5,"While searching for an appropriate stage setter for the next block of instruction at the School of Advanced Military Studies--Morality and War--I stumbled upon this fine book. I was pleased to discover that Gazzaniga’s metacognitive approach in describing the role of the brain as a complex “systems of systems” overlaps quite well with the evolution of art and science inherent in SAMS. In fact, Who's in Charge?: Free Will and the Science of the Brain overlaps quite well with the creative theorizing necessary to understand, adapt, and solve any complex problem within any body of knowledge.The best way I can describe the book is a cross between key concepts of Retired Colonel John Boyd, Peter L. Berger (The Social Construction of Reality: A Treatise in the Sociology of Knowledge), undergraduate Physics (Newtonian Mechanics and Quantum Theory), and neuroscience. My bias is undergraduate Physics and military (operational level) problem solving so I appreciated his sub-atomic, yet simple approach to outlining the human brain and decision-making. Is there innate moral behavior, and how does reason influence Moral Sentiments? What is the role of the brain as a decision-making device?The brain is clearly not homologous, and is not complex simply because of a lack of knowledge. The brain is complex because it is a complex adaptive system with emergent (“weak” and “strong”) and “conscious” properties. Hello John Boyd (Science, Strategy and War: The Strategic Theory of John Boyd)! The brain’s systems are “distributed,” “layered,” function in parallel, and specialize in tasks. Functioning as a “dynamic chaotic system,” linear models fall short in understanding a “dissipative system” such as the human brain.Conscious thought is by itself an emergent property. However, conscious thought is slow and expensive. Cues and perceptions drive our explanations even when faced with a lack of information, or even worse, faulty information. Insert that long list of logical fallacies studied at institutions of higher learning here too.The non-conscious is where one “makes their money” because these actions are fast and rely on heuristics. These habit patterns drive decision-making. In essence, “control” is an emergent property. However, how does control relate to moral imperatives? Do deterministic laws apply in complex systems? If so, why are there groupings and why is there seemingly a unity in human thought?The interpreter module brings unity and it is only as good as the information it gets. The brain creates a temporal map and is subject to dualism. It is also possible to hijack the interpreter for good and bad, desired and undesired effects. Insert virtual reality and visual illusions here. In any case, through the interpreter, a human brain’s output is a unified and coherent personal narrative. 
Thus, free will and determinism, outside the context of religion and spirituality, of course, are not found in the brain, but in the social construction of reality.
Virtues are not universal. This drives differences in morality between cultures. Studies show that culture and genes affect cognition.Unless you are an aspiring neuroscientist, I recommend a read for gist. Perhaps an audiobook version played at 1.5x while driving across Kansas (hint, hint). This book would be much more painful as a hard copy for the average reader. However, it is loaded with cognitive wealth. I found the following to be the most valuable takeaways: the brain as a complex system of systems, the relationship between the brain’s decision-making and free will (determinism), and how the human brain shapes moral sentiments. I also recommend this book for the “Boyd and Beyond” reading list if it is not already on there."
10,0061906107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5952398-ed,4,"My advice for anyone who reads this book is to be sure and read the entire book carefully. In the first few chapters, Gazzaniga presents neurological determinism so convincingly that a careless reader might mistake it for the author's final position. Gazzaniga may also invite misunderstanding by titling Ch. 4 ""Abandoning the Concept of Free Will,"" when a careful reading of the chapter shows that he really wants to ""reframe the question about what it means to have free will."" By the end of the chapter, he has recast freedom and responsibility as emergent properties of a complex, multi-layered system.Gazzaniga agrees with other neuroscientists in rejecting a pre-scientific notion of free will, the idea that ""YOU, a self with a central command center, are in charge, are free from causation, and are doing things....The modern perspective is that brains enable minds, and that YOU is your vastly parallel and distributed brain without a central command center."" Most of what goes on in the brain is unconscious, and our brains are already initiating actions before we are aware of what we are doing. But unlike many of his colleagues, Gazzaniga does not jump to the conclusion that causality is solely from the bottom up, from brain to mind, so that conscious thought is inconsequential. That would seem to eliminate moral responsibility, an awkward conclusion considering the research suggesting that people actually act better when they believe they are free and responsible! Gazzaniga does not believe that science has to undermine our humanity or moral worth.Gazzaniga points out that much of science has moved beyond determinism, embracing ideas such as unpredictability in complex systems, quantum indeterminacy, and emergence of qualitatively new properties at higher levels of analysis. ""The ones left sitting at the 'hard' determinist table are the neuroscientists and Richard Dawkins."" To illustrate how emergence alters one's perspective, consider a musician playing a note. The musician relies on the deterministic mechanics of the instrument, the brain and the body, and all the necessary causes they entail. But analysis at those levels is insufficient to explain THIS note in this musical context; that requires a more aesthetic and cultural analysis. The lower level enables but doesn't entirely determine the emergent higher level. Similarly, why do I type these words in preference to all the other words I could type without violating any physical laws? A complete answer requires an understanding of the cultural conversation in which I am participating. Gazzaniga rejects neurological determinism because he takes seriously the emergent sociocultural level which constrains individual minds and brains. He rejects bottom-up causality in favor of a complementarity in which the neurological and sociocultural levels influence each other. Within that framework he finds it appropriate and necessary that societies hold individuals responsible for their actions.The book will be most challenging for two groups: those who have a pre-scientific idea of free will, and those at the other extreme who have bought into neurological determinism. The many philosophers and social scientists who never liked either of those extremes in the first place may feel more vindicated than enlightened. While I'm glad that at least one neuroscientist is trying to move beyond determinism, I actually wish he had gone a little farther. Gazzaniga still seems to me to be too much under the spell of the mechanistic metaphor that has dominated so much of our thinking in the Machine Age. When he talks about complex multi-leveled systems, he uses the language of hardware & software, algorithms and feedback loops. For example: ""The social environment is just another factor contributing to the overall environment that is selecting in a downwardly causal way, with a feedback mechanism at work""; and ""...the rules and algorithms that govern all of the separate and distributed modules work together to yield the human condition."" Often he talks as if freedom and responsibility are nothing more than obedience to social feedback, no different than a furnace's obedience to feedback from a thermostat. In the Afterword he suggests that developing a new vocabulary may be the ""scientific problem of this century,"" but he doesn't express any interest in going beyond mechanisms and algorithms to explore something more creative and aesthetic. One scientist whose reflections on agency and self-organization have taken him much deeper is biologist Stuart Kauffman, who argued in Investigations that we need a new synthesis of science and art in order to understand living things. I would think that a serious reflection on freedom and responsibility would require some discussion of creativity. Kauffman criticized the standard ""random variation and natural selection"" model of evolution as not accounting sufficiently for the emergence of novel organization; selection only trims forms, but doesn't create them. Is Gazzaniga's model, which emphasizes neural variation and social selection, creative enough? He acknowledges the emergence of a social level in general, but he may be overlooking the little emergences of novel thoughts that are going on all the time, and which create culture as opposed to just conform to it. I suggest that regarding freedom and responsibility as participation in the creative construction of the world may turn out to be just as compatible with good science as seeing them as responses to societal feedback. I think it may be robbing freedom of too much of its meaning to see it essentially as social constraint on the brain. So while I see the book as a helpful first step beyond neurological determinism, a much deeper understanding is needed. "
11,0061906107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,1,"The author's argument is that reductionist theories about the brain are wrong. Gazzaniga is not a determinist. The mind emerges from the physical brain; that mind is a whole that is greater than its parts. The end result is a feeling that ""someone is in charge."" We have free will and we are responsibile for our actions.Gazzaniga starts out in a way that suggests his alignment with the reductionist and deterministic viewpoints. He divides our mind into its unconscious and conscious roles and states that ""whatever has made it to consciousness has already happened"" so that we build theories of ourselves after the fact. Interestingly, in illustrating these two roles of the brain, Gazzangia in this otherwise heavily cited book does not mention Joseph LeDoux's The Emotional Brain (1996) that uses this very same example to illustrate the role of the amygdala and fear in the specific situation involving whether a shadow on the ground is a snake or a stick.How does Gazzaniga get beyond this ""post hoc process"" to free will? Emergence is the central concept. He starts out easy enough, stating that we are the products of genetic and epigenitic backgrounds. The former provides the ""large-scale"" plan but the specific actions are ""activity-dependent"" so that external factors, not hard-wired genes, influence and modify our behavior, i.e., we have free will. From here he traces our socialization from our ape past with the end result being that we increasingly formulate and follow rules outside the brain. Social rules, laws and norms now govern us, not genes. Then he goes on to say that we are now co-evolving in the sense that the social environment forces us to be even more social and that this in turn affects our survival and reproduction. From that sweeping statement he deduces that we are becoming more social and less determined by genes, that we have choice, and that we are personally accountable to follow social expectations. This is one way to weave together scientific evidence. But there are questions. Gazzaniga gives an account of a brutal murder by a person with an IQ of 59 and argues that ""an abnormal brain does not mean that the person cannot follow rules."" This of course presumes that the low IQ person not only is aware of the consequences of his actions but also presumes that the person cares enough to follow the rules. Again, he says that if a criminal is smart enough to not commit a crime in front of a policeman, ""that person can follow social rules and not commit a crime."" Yes, people can follow the rules but the salient question is why they won't and why they don't. Something is going on that is deeper, much deeper, than the perspective that Gazzaniga puts forward.Finally, Gazzaniga's central point on emergence involves co-evolution. I believe he is correct about the impact of the outside environment on behavior, but I don't think he's accurate in how he accounts for that impact. His argument about our free will hinges on the impact the social environment has on transforming our behavior. Why is that environment different than the physical environment? The social environment is part of the external physical environment. It is something ""mind"" has had to deal with throughout our evolution. The environment, physical as well as social, has forced us to make changes in the way we engage it and has transformed us as a result. We change our behavior (what we do, how we do it) to fit what the external physical as well as social world requires. Isn't this transformation ""emergence?"" We have a dialectical interaction with the whole world, physical as well as social. We go into the world; the world reacts to our action and we then modify our behavior. The resultant synthesis was present in what went before yet is different from each. The emergence of mind, in other words, is not the product of just our interaction with the social sphere. Apart from the evoluton of our mind, that same dialectical interaction transforms species over time, changing them so that they can survive (and reproduce), which is the fixed ""End"" of all life. These transformations, while fixed in genes, might also be seen as expressions of emergence. Our destinctive human quality is this free choice about how we maintain our lives and well-being, but the underlying question is why we choose one way as opposed to another. Gazzaniga has us destined to be good social beings, choosing to accommodate others. That picture flies in the face of history. Our choices serve an underlying core that might be socially good (other-oriented, respectful) or might be the opposite (overly self-oriented). Emergent mind, per se, says nothing about which way we will choose. The criminal uses information to make choices that allow him to do the crimnal act. That's why the criminal does not commit his crime in front of a policeman. That's why a criminal is a good criminal. Core, in the sense of fixed character traits, human nature varies across a continuum. Again, the question is not that the criminal can't follow social rules, but why he does not. Rather than progression to social goodness as Gazzaniga argues, we may have a fixed (biochemically) human nature for a good part of human kind who are fundamentally self-oriented and who do not change over time. This may explain why history tends to repeat itself, even now. "
12,0061906107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2610234-caren,4,"This is not light reading (or, not for me anyway), but it is extremely interesting and profitable. Just last year, in ""Incognito"", David Eagleman indicated that some changes in legal procedures may need to take into account new findings in neuroscience. Toward the end of this book, Mr. Gazzaniga is more specific about the ways in which the unfolding findings of neuroscience are changing proceedings in the courtroom. By studying patients who have had the two hemispheres of the brain severed (usually to prevent seizures), researchers discovered that, while the right brain is quite literal in what it perceives, the left brain has an ""interpreter"" which will construct a story to make sense of the information it perceives. Just as Mr. Eagleman recounted in ""Incognito"", the brain does most of its work on autopilot, outside of our conscious control. In fact, a person may feel he has made a conscious decision, but he probably has acted first and later felt that he decided to act. From such discoveries, the idea of determinism has taken hold in our culture (including in the courts). But Mr. Gazzaniga's understanding of the research goes deeper. After spending much of the book showing how the research has led to determinist conclusions, he expands the scope of our view by showing the ways in which the culture in which we find ourselves influences the tendencies of our individual brains. He says that we in the West have evolved from the ancient Greeks to focus on the individual, while those in the East evolved from the culture of China, in which the individual is seen as a part of the whole society and the goal is harmony, not rugged individualism. Hence, the brains of those living in these cultures have evolved in different directions. He also says that the human brain was able to grow larger than those of other primates when agriculture allowed for a more sedentary (rather than nomadic) culture, with greater calorie intake. (The brain, he says, uses 20% of our caloric intake.) There is a limit to the size of the surrounding society that any individual brain can handle. The author says 150 is the top number of people a brain can keep track of in forming relationships. (As an example, he notes that people who have more than 1,000 friends on Facebook only really keep up with 150 or fewer.) Oh my, there are so many interesting avenues Mr. Gazzaniga explores with us. In the end, his real point if that he does not agree with determinism when considering human consciousness and free will. He wants us to see that we are a part of a bigger picture, that we can indeed be held accountable because, in his words, ""...we now understand that we have to look at the whole picture, a brain in the midst of and interacting with other brains, not just one brain in isolation."" (p.215)This book was written as a result of a series of lectures, the Gifford lectures (which is a Scottish lecture series that has been sponsoring preeminent thinkers for over 100 years to discuss ""natural theology""), which the author gave in Edinburgh in 2009.

13,0061906107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11798908-andris,3,"this book is a wonderful collection of interesting facts and glimpses into probably very complex theories, told by a brilliant neuroscientist in an actually pretty good and easy to read language. and that is very nice.however, the book also slightly suffers structurally because of its ""collection-like"" nature. the arguments are stretched out between descriptions (that are necessary - book is written in a relatively popular language, thus, little knowledge can be assumed on the part of the reader) and humor (some of it's not that bad, actually - story about how Gazzaniga decided to build his own house is pretty cool ^^). so sometimes it is kind of hard to see the relevance of all this to the question of free will, and what is the scientific position on that which Gazzaniga could've presented us.and he actually does that, it's just that his answer might be a little different from what the reader had in mind, when he asked the question about free will. he dismisses any metaphysical aspects of the question (and that is the way it should be done, imo :> ), and gives us a more realistic way of thinking about what it means to have free will. if I dared to try and sum it up, I'd try to condensate it into two points:1) thinking about human action and motives behind it requires several levels of description of the physical system that humans are - thus, human choices and other kinds of behaviour, while essentially being made up by the activity of lower levels - neurons and stuff, can not be properly described by only describing and looking at this lower level.2) responsibility, a core part of the ""free will"", and, arguably, the most important due to its importance in law and to the possibility of human society as a whole, should be thought of not as grounded in some metaphysical considerations, but as based on the social reality - Gazzaniga thinks of responsibility as a kind of or a consequence of a social contract humans have.but since I don't dare pretend I know this book that well, you should take what I have just written here with a pinch of salt.there are also some problematic suggestions by Gazzaniga - the desire for a different language to describe our decisions etc in brain-terms etc is very ill-founded in this book, it is only backed by references to no less mysterious scientists who expressed the same desire for a different language, but actual arguments remain hidden. but perhaps it is only my objection as a person, who is acquainted with philosophy and who thinks that the existing language can be adjusted and redefined to preserve some of its functional and moral value, but replacing metaphysics, hidden in these words, with science, that would be no less hidden than the old metaphysics, but a lot more accurate, when made explicit.none the less, it is a good and interesting read, but it is not and it probably can not yet be conclusive on the topic, but what it does say could be said slightly more accurately and in a more focused manner.3.5/5. rounded down to 3, since I have to rate it like that?"
14,0061906107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1167923-patrick,5,"Amazon review:The father of cognitive neuroscience and author of Human offers a provocative argument against the common belief that our lives are wholly determined by physical processes and we are therefore not responsible for our actionsA powerful orthodoxy in the study of the brain has taken hold in recent years: Since physical laws govern the physical world and our own brains are part of that world, physical laws therefore govern our behavior and even our conscious selves. Free will is meaningless, goes the mantra; we live in a “determined” world.Not so, argues the renowned neuroscientist Michael S. Gazzaniga in this thoughtful, provocative book based on his Gifford Lectures——one of the foremost lecture series in the world dealing with religion, science, and philosophy. Who’s in Charge? proposes that the mind, which is somehow generated by the physical processes of the brain, “constrains” the brain just as cars are constrained by the traffic they create. Writing with what Steven Pinker has called “his trademark wit and lack of pretension,” Gazzaniga shows how determinism immeasurably weakens our views of human responsibility; it allows a murderer to argue, in effect, “It wasn’t me who did it——it was my brain.” Gazzaniga convincingly argues that even given the latest insights into the physical mechanisms of the mind, there is an undeniable human reality: We are responsible agents who should be held accountable for our actions, because responsibility is found in how people interact, not in brains.An extraordinary book that ranges across neuroscience, psychology, ethics, and the law with a light touch but profound implications, Who’s in Charge? is a lasting contribution from one of the leading thinkers of our time."

It's technically popular science, but Gazzaniga write more as if he is writing for entertainment to an audience in his field, or at least field-adjacent.

16,0061906107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/504424-bup,4,"I keep hoping to one day really understand that leap from ""we're computers made of meat"" to consciousness. Gazzaniga got me really close, and went through a lot of the same things other books I've read do: consciousness moves around in the brain constantly, and there is a part of the brain that decides which one or two of the hundreds of processes in the brain goes into the conscious 'slot', and consciousness often is post-facto (we do something, then become conscious of it).Then, it seems like he concludes we're deterministic beings and post-rationalize everything and spends the rest of the book on the implications of that, particularly in what it means for society and laws and justice.Which didn't quite get me to the place of understanding I seek. Maybe it's un-answerable, although a lot of authors think they've answered it. Reducing consciousness to a small thing doesn't change my awe and wonder that we are different from computers, that we are aware, that we experience.Don't get me wrong - I learned a lot, I thought about reductionism and the fact that brains can't be thought of on their own but in context, that it's impossible to predict many systems from their components, and the like. It's a great read overall."
17,0061906107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2159256-andy-oram,4,"This book offers interesting observations on two levels. Scientifically, the author as a leading neuroscientist lays out a sophisticated theory of how we make decisions. Although each individual decision is driven by a complex, interacting set of ""modules"" in the brain, Gazzaniga does not give in to a reductionist, deterministic philosophy. He calls for ""a unique language, which has yet to be developed,"" to help us understand how our decisions affect future brain interactions and how social forces affect each of our brain's behavior, right down to the level of genes. Ethically, this book wades into current debates over how much responsibility can be assigned to criminals (Harvard, for instance, recently created a Center for Law, Brain and Behavior). Gazzaniga criticizes the current overuse of brain scans in deciding court cases and punishments. He believes that criminals can generally be held responsible for their actions, intriguingly suggesting ""accountability"" instead of punishment. Note that there is no particular neurological behavior that clinches any argument. It is interesting to see how much the scientists have learned, and how big the gaps in our knowledge are."

There is a lot to yet be discovered. And who knows what will become of this thing we call free will. The last couple of chapters focus on the legal system and it's relationship to out understanding of neruoscience. This part I found depressing as to how backward our justice system is. "
21,0061906107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20246339-peter-a-van-tilburg,4,"Very interesting book on the issue of the deterministic view ( biological, fysical and chemical,processes determine decisions you take). The empirical evidence shows that decision making is done before issues come to a conscient level in the brain. This suggests the deterministic viewpoint. But especially interesting was the reference to the study of Brass and Haggard. "" To do or not to do"" Their data suggests that a specific area in the dorsal fronto-medial cortex is related to a kind of self control. In the article of 2007 they in summary state that "" In the present study, we investigate the neural correlates of intentionally inhibiting actions using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Our data show that a specific area of the fronto-median cortex is more strongly activated when people prepare manual actions but then intentionally cancel them, compared with when they prepare and then complete the same actions. Our results suggest that the human brain network for intentional action includes a control structure for self-initiated inhibition or withholding of intended actions. The mental control of action has an enduring scientific interest, linked to the philosophical concept of “free will.” Our results identify a candidate brain area that reflects the crucial decision to do or not to do"". Gazzaniga concludes that probably both are true and that there is an interesting interface between the two (downward causation and upward causation). Further he states that we are people not brains ""the mind interacts with the brain"" (points to dualism as I see it). He explains that there is interaction of the layers (mind and brain) that privide us conscious reality. Contrarely to Brass and Haggart he further states with John Doyle that our left logical brain half suggests that there must be some central controlling element we should be able to find. Doyle states that it also can be in the protocols, rules and algoritms. It need not be hard ware in that sense but can also be soft ware. For me this all supports my common sense idea ( probably due to my back ground) that there is free will and personal responsibility. I can very much appreciate the point of view of Gazzaniga that he states that ""downward causation meets upward causation"". As often in life reality is more complex and not black and white. His view offers a good and balanced view on free will which helps again one sighted views on determinisn as described for instance by the Dutch brain surgeon Dick Swaab."
22,0061906107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37546290-bill,4,"Gazzaniga discusses a lot of interesting psychology and neuropsychology research that is more-or-less relevant to the question whether our apparently voluntary behavior is a product of free-will versus being the inevitable result of a chain of causes over which we have no control. Sometimes the thread of his argument gets lost in the details. He suggests that emergent mental process (the result of complex brain processes) can exert downward control on brain processes to change their automatic course and thus change the behavior that would have occurred without this downward mental control. In other words, we can make choices. Nonetheless, it is clear that our choices are heavily influenced by a complex set of interacting causes stemming from our experiences in our social environment, which influence our attitudes and beliefs and opportunities. The most important practical application of the free-will issue concerns how we attribute responsibility for criminal actions. Political and religious conservatives tend to believe that human actions are the product of an independent, free will, and thus criminal behavior should be punished as a retribution for wrongdoing in proportion to the seriousness of the wrong. Liberals acknowledge that our choices are heavily influenced by external causes, and thus society has a responsibility to try to change and improve the conditions that are associated with criminal behavior. One aspect of this involves ensuring that criminal behavior has negative consequences. But rather than inflicting punishment as retribution for criminal behavior, the main goal of punishment should be to protect society by reducing or preventing future criminal behavior. Incarceration prevents the individual from harming society for as long as they are in prison. I would argue that in order to protect innocent people, in some cases violent criminals should be incarcerated for life, even when their crime was not murder. Psychologists and psychiatrists cannot reliably predict which criminals will or will not commit violent acts after they are released from prison. However, this argument should not be taken as justification of the death penalty. Life in prison is more humane and it is sufficient for protection of the public. "

Dennett who carved out a bit of elbow room for free will in a deterministic world, Gazzaniga blows past the idea as miscast and arcane. So while the title does say ""Free Will"" it's a bit misleading. This is a good neuroscience book that plays upon the notion of emergence to talk about personal responsibility and crime and punishment. In other words, minds interacting with minds through the social contract > the false notion of dualism or free will. Very thought-provoking!"

29,0061906107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91261074-chris-esposo,4,"""Who's in Charge"" is an intriguing thesis on a neuroscience theory of the modular functionality of the brain, and it is written sufficiently clear for a general audience. Gazzaniga's claim on the modular functionality is provocative. He claims that the neural matter that form the components of these “functions”, the neural network of dendrites are partitioned in space, though not all necessarily homogeneously concentrated in space, and these “functions” can be mapped to ""higher order"" concepts recognizable by common people. These concepts include personality, including inhibitions (or lack thereof), propensities in habits, manners, or actions, and modes-of-thought etc. Gazzaniga believes these concepts arise (or ‘emerge’ in the formal sense) from these ‘modular functions’ working individually, or in concert, and that this functionality can explain ""most"" (or all, it's unclear what % of attribution the author claims empirically from the material here) of what most societies call agency in individual human beings, colloquially referred to as ‘free will’. One especially interesting implication of this thesis is that individual rationalization of past-behavior is itself also a function of another “governor” mechanism, that seeks to “smooth” an otherwise (purported) discrete nature of the workings of our minds. In effect, our perception of ourselves, as individuals, is partially an illusion of this governor-function. This notion feels uncomfortably close to validating the historical “people-as-atoms” meta-concept, which had permeated the quantitative social sciences in the 20th century, manifesting most profoundly in the subject of economics. Where the author himself falls in that debate is not clear from these writings, though he does mention some game-theoretic analysis to help explain away individual-behavior, he also mentions results from several experimental bargaining games that show that people do not achieve ‘optimal results’ predicted by the basic game theory of negotiating and bargaining (at least under controlled conditions). Though, I do think the results in some controlled-cases are closer to “theory” for certain kinds of repeated-games as observed by previous researchers like Axelrod. Not all of the ideas are well explained or convincing (the detriments of having a short book), Like other books that involve an understanding of a biological system, and how it got the way it is, Gazzaniga leverages the notion of Darwinian selection to explain the evolution of the latent biological mechanisms that inform the operations of our “pseudo-agency” as a competitive adaptation. Yet, as many careful thinkers in this field have observed, including John Tyler Bonner, in his book “Randomness in Evolution” https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1..., not all alleles or morphologies observed in nature can be understood as coming about through the selection-process first described by Darwin. In fact, many morphologies are “neutral”, arising mostly out of randomness. If that is the case however, the author’s argument that these latent machineries which are the real “cause” of many of our sociological/psychological behaviors, and not our free-will, can be seen as propitious for us (since they arise from some sequence of competitive adaption), is much less potent. The book doesn’t just dwell on the science of this matter, however, but also goes into the ethical implications of these ideas, if found to be true or plausible. These include a description of the eponymous trolley scenario of it’s ethical dilemma, where a train-conductor must quickly make a choice to kill either one person or many, that hinges on his choice of rail-switch. This issue has since become an essential question in the subject matter of AI ethics with respect to autonomous vehicles and drone-warfare. The book serves its purpose, which is to make one think deeper about these issues, and although I came in (and go out) more skeptical than not of these notions, I appreciate the author’s informed writings on them. An easy recommend. "

He talks about the different strengths and weaknesses of different parts of the brain, and how there is an 'interpreter' module in the left brain that does its best to make sense of all of the sensory inputs, regardless of whether or not they are, in the strictest sense, true.A central theme of the book is the interplay between determinism, which is, to a degree, the prevailing understanding of how our actions and decisions are fundamentally the result of physical laws, and our ingrained idea of 'free will' - that we have complete autonomy over our actions.Gazzaniga places these topics in context: Determinism in complex systems has been demonstrably foiled by Chaos Theory - it is theoretically impossible to accurately predict the outcomes of systems with many variables. And Free Will is a bit of a misleading moniker - what exactly do we want to be free from? If we wish to fly but are unable because of our biology, is our free will encumbered?Gazzaniga presents a holistic solution, suggesting that the mind (and hence our free will) is an emergent phenomenon from the complexity of our brain structure, but that the mind can constrain the action of the brain, in a circulating feedback loop. This is a much more satisfying explanation than other authors I have read (e.g. Sean Carroll) that suggest that free will is a mere illusion but all that matters is that we feel like we are free.The final chapter is a discussion of the legal implications of free vs determined action and the concomitant responsibilities that should be assigned. Here the author talks about the three main approaches to justice (retributive, incapacitative and rehabilitative) and makes an important distinction between scientific standards for evidence (where proofs need to be rigorous, with ample evidence) and legal standards (where merely a 'reasonable doubt', however well-founded scientifically, is sufficient to derail a conviction). The author frames our legal systems in our evolutionary backstory, discusses differences in approaches between the East and the West and the problematic aspects of admitting averaged brain scans as courtroom evidence. There are no hard conclusions drawn on these topics, but the discussion sheds valuable light on the important issues.Overall, I learned a huge amount from this book, and it has satisfied my search for meaty engagement with these questions. The book is thoroughly well researched, with citations throughout. I will certainly be returning to this book in future."
31,0061906107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32281217-evan-micheals,4,"I found this such a difficult, but interesting book. What I found interesting was that the same neuroscience could be presented to two different neuroscientists and the difference in conclusions the individual neuro-scientists come to. I would love to see Michael Gazzaniga debate Robert Sapolsky about Free Will.Whilst Sapolsky argued for a determinist perspective that we do not have free will (Once neurons begin firing they follow a predetermined path), whereas Gazzaniga sees free will is an emergent phenomena and a phenomena we have some control over (but we cannot prove where consciousness lies). I am such a nerd because I found this intriguing.Gazzaniga perspective is informed by complexity theory, that our minds are more than a collection of its parts. There is no ghost in the machine or homunculus that sits in overall control. He argues the mind and consciousness is an emergent phenomena, not an algorithmGazzaniga adds we are not just one brain (or mind) in isolation. Our brains (and minds) interact and provide the environment for other brains (and minds). The complexity of brains and interactions between neurons is beyond what is understandable from a deterministic model as a collection of parts. The metaphor Gazzaniga repeatedly uses is what does studying a brake pad or piston about the phenomena of traffic?Sapolsky argues that the biggest mistake of our era will be how we do criminal justice, given what we know about neurology. No one can be guilty according to this deterministic view. Gazzaniga provides a rebuttal about why a retributious based criminal justice system and the belief in guilt and free will keeps our science peaceful. It might be sad to say, but fear of negative consequences keeps us behaving socially well (relatively).I would love to sees a debate between Gazzaniga and Sapolsky regarding free will. My own perspective is closer to Gazzaniga in that we do have freewill (although we cannot explain where this occurs, hence the emergent phenomena argument. What particular butterfly flapping its wings caused the cyclone). I would agree with Sapolsky that it does not make sense, and the deterministic view leads itself better to our current scientific understanding. As I said of Sapolsky when I wrote my review for behave. He did not seem to be able to follow his own logic deep enough.I know my life is better is I behave ‘as if’ I have free will. I seem to be able to slow down to avoid a collision with a car when riding my bike. I seem to be able to determine who I drink beer with and who I do not. I consistently arrive at work on time. In spite of the neurological science not being able to provide a good explanation as to why I make these choices. My awareness of the phenomena of self is aware of this experience call consciousness, but you could not say ‘there it is’ on an fMRI (but you could see regions activate, but not a specific and repeatable location)"
32,0061906107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20048724-suncerae,4,"Neuroscientist and Gifford Lecturer Michael S. Gazzinga explores the implications of the latest research in brain research, namely, that we live in a ""determined"" world, that our brains are governed by the laws of the physical world and not our conscious selves. If our conscious selves are not in control, we may not be responsible for our own actions.Despite the title, this book isn't really about free will. But it is a fantastic explanation of how our brains fill in gaps and make guesses, back-filling memories and sensations to create a seamless world in which we live. Studies from patients with ""split-brains"" clearly demonstrate how our conscious awareness, and justification and explanation of our own actions take place well after we have already acted. Gazzinga discusses the ramifications of modern neuroscience, including some psychology, ethics, and law, in addition to proposing his own theory of how and why he thinks our conscious minds are accountable. Gazzinga's postulation is that the conscious mind ""constrains"" the brain, just as cars are constrained by traffic. Our brains are comprised of distinct and separate physical processes of neurons firing, but the brain as a whole, and especially multiple brains together create an emergent property of mind. A murderer cannot argue that he is not responsible for his actions because he lives within a society in which human interactions create the idea of responsibility. There is also a significant comparison to physics, specifically quantum mechanics, because the laws of determinism that work so well in classical mechanics fall apart on such a small scale. Although I follow his comparison, I do not think his interpretation of the laws of physics, which are mathematical models of the behavior of objects of different sizes and at lower temperatures, is correct, nor that they support his theory.Setting aside the physics talk, Gazzinga's postulation that we are responsible for our own actions because we know right from wrong, lawful and unlawful in practice, is a discussion more appropriate to social science, not neuroscience. There is absolutely no science to back up a theory of collective consciousness or that from multiple brains emerges a higher mindset of social responsibility. His argument is philosophy and speculation.Personally, I do not find determinism such a scary notion, but I must be in the minority, as more than half of this book is dedicated to convincing ourselves that we have some sort of free will. Even though I do not agree with the author, I find the subject matter compelling, and his arguments engaging. Highly recommended for fans of the neurological sciences!readwellreviews.com"
33,0061906107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40019240-jan-vantilburg,5,"First chapters describes how the brain functions according to the current knowledge (2011).From there the main question as given in the introduction is explored:“We are personally responsible agents and are to be held accountable for our actions, even though we live in a determined universe”.This is for sure a concept that I would like to be true! (after reading the book I found out this is an innate moral intuition common to all people. I am not special after all)This is a well written book. Conclusions are based upon research and many examples are given. I enjoyed reading it and it gave me more understanding how the brain functions.Interesting to read how he concludesthat the mind, which is somehow generated by the physical processes of the brain, constrains the brain.That is the premise of this book:How the mind relates to the brain, with its implications for personal responsibility, is central for understanding what we humans are experiencing as sentient.The mind is embodied in the brain!Even as the brain is parallel and distributed we feel as in charge and as one.It may be because the brain functions as a complex system. The brain is more then the sum of it’s parts: Emergence!Chaos Theory, Quantum Mechanics and Emergence closed the door to determinism.Gazzaniga thinks conscious thought is an emergent property.He ends that chapter as he begins it: Responsibility is a dimension that comes with social interaction.The last 2 chapters go on how the human social world shaped our brain and hence our judicial system. Conclusion:I like how Philosopher Janet Radcliffe Richards states:“...many people accept that the arguments about free will and ultimate responsibility really do show that no one can ultimately deserve punishment ... If so, punishment cannot be justified on the retributivist grounds that it is ultimately deserved, but only on the consequentialist grounds that is is necessary for deterring antisocial behaviour....if we understand that there are good evolutionary reasons for our wanting people to suffer when they have done us harm, then we can account for our strong feelings about the appropriateness of retribution without presuming they are a guide to moral truth...”.Gazza concludes that ultimately responsibility is a contract between 2 people rather than a property of the brain, and determinism has no meaning in this context. Human nature remains constant (innate good) but out in the social world behaviour can change. Brakes can be put on unconscious intentions."
34,0061906107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/123081-david-gross,4,"If everything, including you and me, is made up of material that blindly obeys the inflexible laws of physics, then everything that happens, including what you and I do, is inevitable, and free will is something of an illusion or a joke.Right?Or are we just thinking of the question the wrong way?The free will conundrum takes a turn for the ridiculous when it assumes that free will is something that must take place outside of the material world that everything else resides in. The thought experiment goes something like this: make some arbitrary decision (say, to raise your left hand), then imagine turning back the clock and resetting the universe so that every single fact about it was the same as it was before you made that decision. When you restart the clock, would it be possible for you to decide any differently?If you try to imagine your will, your decision-making apparatus, as something outside of “every single fact about” the universe, as it has been perennially tempting to do, you end up in a morass of speculation about mind and matter, body and spirit, and where they intersect and how. If you avoid this temptation, you just have to argue with the premise of the thought experiment: if it were possible for me to decide differently, at least one single fact about the universe — that decision, embodied however it is in the material world with its material-world consequences — would have to be different in order for me to do so.That solves the conundrum, sort of, but provokes the worried observation that “that decision, embodied however it is in the material world” is itself an effect of material causes, which does mean (doesn’t it?) that everything is inevitable and predetermined and therefore all of our existential angst is for naught.Or not. There are a couple of ways out of this fix, too. Michael S. Gazzaniga briefly toys with a tempting one — that our understanding of quantum physics demonstrates that deterministic cause and effect does not exist at that fundamental level, and chaos theory shows that tiny changes, such as those exhibited at the quantum level, can have dramatic large-scale effects. I get really skeptical whenever a popular science writer starts waving their hands and saying “the uncertainty principle!” “the butterfly effect!” because usually the next thing they say is “therefore, maybe magic is real!” without bothering with the intervening reasoning.It is true that if the material world is not fundamentaly deterministic, but that this causal determinism only appears true when the material world is viewed at a certain granularity, then to say that our minds and our wills are material and behave according to the laws of matter is not to doom them to plodding along in predetermined, inexorable grooves. But this is different from rescuing a naïve free will: if quantum behavior is, to some extent, not in principle predictible, it is also, to that extent, in principle arbitrary. This would seem to move our minds and wills out of the predetermined & inexorable category only to drop us into one at least as frightening: instead of plodding along a predetermined path that was laid out for us in the first moment of creation, we’re randomly sliding down one of an infinite variety of possible paths, but still with no more control over the process than a marble in a chute.Because the free will we want is not quite so free as that — not a “there’s absolutely no telling what I will do next” sort of free, but an “I’m going to decide what to do next” sort of free. And that sort of free will, Gazzaniga says, we have — as long as we do not try to situate it outside of the physical world or make it somehow immune to the laws of physics. Using our best judgement to make decisions about what to do next is exactly what our brains evolved to accomplish, and they evolved this ability within the real, material world. And that’s OK.Just as “life” is completely embodied in the material world, and is not some extramaterial essence breathed into it; so “ego” and “will” are as well. This doesn’t make them any less wonderful or worth getting excited about.But there’s a catch. While we have free will, of this sort anyway, our intuitive idea of how it operates and of “who” operates it is probably wrong. It seems to me as though “I,” a solitary ego who is the sole occupant of my mind or at least the sovereign of that domain, deliberates, makes a decision, and then the rest of me carries it out as ordered. Gazzaniga thinks that scientific experimentation on this hypothesis has pretty much ruled it out as hogwash. More likely, he says, is that a vast, loosely-connected network of mental modules — some exposed to consciousness and some not — make decisions on their own, and then our conscious “decider” comes up with a story line to explain what happened, putting itself in the driver’s seat out of conceit.We have no access to the inner worlds of other people, and so have to model and predict their behavior as though they were a “black box” — the usual way we do this is to try to model their knowledge, intentions, and reasoning, and make predictions from there. We are so used to doing this that we will even apply this sort of thinking to our predictions of the actions of non-human or even non-living things like robots or marionettes. Our ostensible “decider” — Gazzaniga calls it the “interpreter” — does much the same thing to model the person whose brain it sits inside. In short, the unified decider-ego is not who we are, but is the simplified model that our brain’s interpreter-module makes of us in order to make sense of its behavior and to get insight into what other people must think of us.(This is how Adam Smith described “conscience” — not as the insight by which we discern good & evil or the nagging voice prompting us to resist temptation, but instead the faculty by which we simulate the perspective of an impartial observer who observes our own headspace and behavior, using the same criteria we naturally use when judging others.)Because of this, there are times when we say “I decided to do such-and-such for these reasons” and we are just plain wrong. Even the rest of the time, we’re just guessing. It isn’t that we don’t have free will, of a sort, but that it isn’t transparent to us how this free will operates in us.Which doesn’t mean that it is completely out of our control. We can make decisions that influence the way we will make future decisions: if we educate ourselves, our future decisions will reflect that education; if we practice certain habits, our future decisions will be influenced by those habits; if we stumble upon some creed that agrees with us, we may radically alter our way of being in the world to conform to it. But those decisions themselves are not necessarily under conscious direction: we seem to unconsciously (but note this does not necessarily mean unintelligently or unwisely) become the person we are while at the same time consciously endeavoring to discover the person we have become — and we confuse the one for the other."
35,0061906107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1971718-b-rule,4,"The first 2/3 or so of this book are really great. Gazzaniga is a neuroscientist with extensive experience working with split-brain patients, and his account of how the brain works is well-written and fascinating. Unfortunately, once he ventures off the reservation of his own specialty, things get a lot shakier. Gazzaniga's project is essentially to rescue free will from the hard version of determinism, but his solution is something like, ""1. Emergence is a thing that happens which can't be predicted in its specifics by looking at elements on lower scales. 2. There is a possible mechanism for evolutionary selection pressure for an inherent sense of fairness or ""moral"" behavior. 3. We act like we're moral agents for purposes of law and order, even if it's really deterministic modules receiving a post-hoc explanation by our left-brain ""interpreter module"". 4. ??? 5. Free will!"" He claims there's no free will in the brain, but that it emerges from social situations. Okay, but why isn't that just a higher level determinism?Gazzaniga's philosophical argument is built upon some pretty facile readings of utilitarianism and what he calls ""retributivism"", along with an embarrassingly undercooked understanding of the legal system (he calls Scalia ""Chief Justice"" at one point). He talks about retribution and deterrence modes of justice, but he makes only a handful of throwaway mentions of restorative justice. I wanted to agree with him on his fundamental point, but taken on his own terms, I just didn't find it very convincing. Why isn't retributivism a foundation for moral and legal systems because it satisfies our brains inherent heuristics, even if it doesn't point to some universal code? Why isn't human agency just a problem of determinism with exponentially more variables to track, if it emerges in the interaction of multiple brains? Not that I agree with these positions necessarily, but there are no great answers to them to be found in this book. I wish he would have just written the first part as a primer on neuroscience and left the implications as an exercise for the reader. That said, it kept me thinking and I mostly liked his relaxed writing style. Worth a read for the good parts, and so you can poke holes in the bad ones as a thought experiment."
36,0061906107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16402887-charles-shapiro,4,"The question from Goodreads is 'What did you think?' The book is about thinking, or more accurately how the brain works. While I expected less brain physiology, Gazzaniga is correct in spending much more time on how the brain is organized, and that is the basis for his discussion of free will. He cites many studies over the past that have shown how the two halves of the brain work. Many of the studies are with patients that have had the half separated for medical reasons or with patients that have legions in the brain the reduce the 'wholeness' of the brain. He is a leader in split-brain research and apparently developed the technique of showing only one eye an image for these people and then determining how the brain processes and communicates or not within itself.The book then goes on to cite research on how people react in different situations based on various circumstances. He ends with a focus on the implications for our legal system. If all action is determined by our brain organization then there would be no justification for punishment, but most of us don't believe that, but research has shown we are hard-wired for certain behaviors. I listened to this book as an audiobook, and it was done well. The author has a sense of humor, and that balances some of the science detail. If I were going to learn all the details, I would need a written copy to track all the functions of different areas of the brain.Two specific details that are take away for me: there is no one master brain area that controls everything. He claims that there are many systems that are working simultaneously and the result is our behavior. He also says that we can not predict our actions by looking at one brain. Our actions are part of the social organization of our society. "
37,0061906107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,3,"Michael Gazzaniga is a veteran researcher in neuroscience, and has written on a wide range of topics related to the brain and the mind. However, after he dies, he will be remembered for one thing above all: the split-brain patients. In this book, based on a series of lectures, he takes on topics that get about as Big Picture as you can get: free will. The surprising thing, given the scope of his ambitions in taking on such a fundamental and difficult topic, is that he almost succeeds.Briefly, for those who don't already know: Gazzaniga has for several decades now worked with patients who have had their brains literally split in two, so that the (relatively small) connections between the two halves are missing. This is not a minor thing, but it is done intentionally, in rare cases of major epilepsy that does not respond to pharmaceutical treatment. It works for the intended purpose, because apparently it cuts the mirror-image feedback loop that causes (or perhaps I should say is) the seizure. However, surprisingly, it doesn't seem to have a lot of obvious side-effects.Gazzaniga, however, was among the first researchers to figure out that these patients, who he describes as generous and patient with their time, provided an opportunity to look at what the different halves of the brain did, and did differently from each other. He did this by flashing different images (or words) to different eyes, since each half of the brain receives visual input from a different part of the brain. Then, by asking them to write on a piece of paper (with one hand) that they could not see (or other similar arrangements), he could ask the different halves of the person's brain questions about what they had seen, without the other half knowing. From this basic strategem, an entire (quite productive) career in science has flowed.This book is not primarily about these experiments, however, but they do relate directly to one of his primary discoveries: we don't know what we're doing. Routinely, one half of the brain is doing something which the other half is unaware of (in split-brain patients), but this does not result in people saying ""I don't know why I wrote that,"" or ""I don't know why I laughed at that"". It results in a series of rationalizations and confabulations. What Gazzaniga has come to realize is that this is not so different from what the rest of us do, all the time. We don't know why we do the things that we do, which is interesting enough, but we also don't know that we don't know. We make up reasons for our actions, whatever the most plausible one is that our subconscious can provide, and then we believe that.This is, when one thinks about it, quite like the literal blind spot in our vision. The interesting thing about the blind spot is not that we have a spot in our visual field which is blind, because it is where the nerve endings go back towards the brain. The interesting thing is that we don't see a black spot in our field of view. We see whatever color our subconscious guesses should be there. If the background is checkerboard, we even see a checkerboard pattern in our blind spot. Our brain is not predisposed to say, ""I don't know"". It takes its best guess. Whether it's the blind spot, or what one part of the brain writes when the other part can't see it, or anything else, we rarely if ever say, or even feel, that we don't know why we did that. We make up a reason, and then we believe it.Most often, of course, that reason is likely true. Why did we look up just then? Well, because someone said our name. That's what we think, and it's probably true. We don't notice this subconscious rationalization the great majority of the time, because in mundane and harmless cases it is very nearly always right. But as Gazzaniga goes to some lengths to demonstrate, this is all related to one of the slow-motion train-wrecks of our time: the collision of modern neuroscience and the law.In many ways, our current legal system likes to posit a binary set of options for any given person who has committed an illegal act: they were constrained to do so by a neurological defect, or they were not. If, say, an FMRI brain-scan shows an abnormality in the brain of someone who has committed heinous acts, then there is the very real possibility that a judge and/or jury will decide that they were not responsible for their behavior. In some extreme cases, this may be a plausible interpretation, as for example if someone has an epileptic seizure when holding a firearm and accidentally shoots someone. But it is clear that the more a given person knows about brain-scans such as FMRI, the less comfortable they are with them being used as evidence in court, and not only because of the fact that such brain-scans involve a lot of aggregation and calculated guesswork. There is also a real problem with the very question of free-will vs. determinism. Since we are learning more and more about how the brain works over time, and every decision we make happens in the brain somehow, it might seem that over time every criminal act could be shown to be somehow determined by our neural defects, and thus no one culpable.Gazzaniga's assertion is that our mind can constrain our brain as well as vice versa, in much the same way that society can constrain its individuals, even though the society is itself nothing other than many individuals. Our ideas of responsibility are a product of how we think about each other, and that is a necessary part of how we can live together in large groups, whereas most primates cannot be together in groups that large without continuous conflict. They are not, he says, a feature of how the human mind or brain works, they are a feature of how human society works.I am summarizing several hundred pages of well-written explanation, and he does it better than I can. I must say, however, that in the end I don't quite buy his conclusion that they question of freewill vs. determinism is fundamentally explainable, or perhaps explodable, by looking at how mind and brain (and society and individual) constrain one another. But perhaps it doesn't quite matter if he has totally wrapped up the vexing (and ancient) question of free will in a nice bow by the end of the book. He covers a lot of fascinating research, some of it his own and some of it not, that bears on the question of who and what we are, and he does it in an entertaining and thoroughly readable fashion. Rarely is getting better informed about your own inner nature this painless. Do not choose to miss the opportunity."
38,0061906107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8795422-william,5,The title of the book is “Who’s in Charge?”. So I thought I would get a decent answer to that question. I’m sorry to say I did not. Michael Gazzaniga is a respected name in neuroscience and one would expect that he has a good enough chance of answering that question as anybody else who makes the brain his life’s work. Gazzaniga wants desperately to claim that we have control and we are ultimately in charge of our action because there are emergent properties that can’t be reduced to the rules that govern our micro level structure and function. He claims that at the level of e interpreter module that strives to make sense out of what the body has experienced. I got the feeling that Gazzaniga was hoping that we could keep ourselves at the center of the universe. He was just not able to accept with humility that we are just life forms with no special god like powers to be the one in charge. The book is quite interesting because he covers most of the research that has shown that the body responds to the external world before we are even aware that something has happened. He also gives a thorough summery of the perplexing conundrums that would plague us if we all accepted the notion of no free will. How would we hold criminals responsible if they did not have a free choice in their behavior. I think that that discussion is irrelevant in a discussion of our nature. We have evolved like all other life forms and though we are more complex we are not likely to have the power to choose.
39,0061906107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45331988-armaghan-behlum,5,"No one person can answer the question of ""Does free will exist?"" because, as the author argues, that question is poorly defined. What counts as free will? What are we seeking freedom from when we desire that? You can try to replace that with asking about consciousness but you've just replaced vagueness with more vagueness. However this is a great read because as a researcher combines and presents modern neuroscience with his own opinions on the topic. Also, this is the guy who worked on the original cases showing people with split-brains have two distinct, non-communicating spheres of their brain. It's both interesting to see him retell that first breakthrough moment (which he drags on with great suspense and which I fell right into despite knowing how it ends) and also think on what questions that brings up for our understanding of our own consciousness. What does it mean for our consciousness when literally half of our brain can be cut away without us knowing it? What does it mean that there can be these two independent parts that still think of themselves as one unified whole? If we can lie to ourselves about being one whole consciousness in this case, do we do the same in general without knowing it? I need someone else to read this book and talk with me. There are so many questions and they're the best and worst kind. "
40,0061906107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59537042-frank,4,"An excellent exploration of how our brains function and rationalize.I was hoping for something a bit more ""pop-science"" as I am not well versed in psychology or neuro science but the book does a good job of explaining what a casual observer like myself needs without bogging down into overly intricate explanations of brain function.For example, the author explains which parts of the brain are responsible for interpreting our own actions using the scientifically correct anatomy of the brain but comes to use the label ""interpreter module"" which is both easier to remember, and understand function.The questions raised, and some answered, are deep and intricate and fun to explore as a casual fan of brain science. Philosophical questions relating to the ""ghost in the machine"" theory of mind, explanations on the previously mentioned interpreter module, as well as studies involving split brain patients that examine how the two brain hemispheres interact are all deeply interesting after a brief overly scientific section or two. When I started this book I thought I wouldn't finish but once I got invested in the author's questions and past the deeper science it opens with I found it to be excellent. Wholly enjoyable for a casual reader."
41,0061906107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63873795-julian-stanley,4,"This may be the greatest highly-useful-but-not-enjoyable book I've ever read. That's not a knock on the author. Michael Gazzaniga writes in an engaging conversationalist style that is friendly and fun, and it made the book all the better.The problem for me is the existential crises that emerge from such topics. I slowly progressed feeling like nothing more than a homunculus that was predestined to read the book just due to initial conditions at the start of the Universe and the natural laws of physics. These bothersome thoughts were wiped clean from my attention by Chapter 7: An Afterword. All in all, my worries are moot because we lack the vocabulary, the language, to even describe what it is we ultimately are as humans; neuroscience, biology, all of science, has its limits. I know that all too well from my own education and study.The most enjoyable parts of this book for me was learning about brain structure, networking, and regions which serve different functions in our unconscious and/or conscious existence. Case studies involving neuroscience experiments on brain patients was also a fun hook. There is a wide range of other topics from physics, ethics, sociology, and law that you may also enjoy. That being said, I am glad to finally be finished with it."
42,0061906107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31359013-fenna,3,"Note that I am reviewing the audiobook version of this book.This was an interesting read and my first book on neuroscience. I noticed before starting that several reviews mentioned that the vocab is more geared towards those familiar with neuroscience and was too specific and for the first chapter or two I was starting to agree and was worried it might be a bit much for the layman. Once I got further in the book it lessened and I didn't have any problems. I also started out hating the narrator and thought he sounded condescending in the beginning before getting used to it and not minding his narration by the end. There's some really interesting stories and information here, particularly I enjoyed the chapters about the authors split-brain patients, the social aspects of the brain, and especially the connection between neuroscience with the judicial system towards the end of the book. However, I wouldn't say there's as much about free will as one would expect from the title. I'm not sure I would read it more than once but I did come away with some interesting information and may be looking into more books on neuroscience after this one."

You can predict the likelihood of certain types of processing, and you can identify to a large extent which parts of the brain work in concert and independently, but we are ultimately responsible for our own decisions. We choose how we act and react. Our responses can be far reaching... even affect the contributions we make to the gene pool. But the long and short of it is that our choices make us human, and continue to define us culturally and biologically. There's a lot of neuroscience and chemistry in this book and it's easy to get lost in the jargon, but when Gazzaniga presents his points and draws conclusions, even the most complex discussions are distilled down to a fascinating conclusion about what drives people, and how those drives impact -- and are impacted by -- biochemistry. "
44,0061906107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89147505-pandit,5,"Gazzaniga is one of the researchers who examined 'split brain' patients (whose left and right brain hemispheres are separated in order to treat extreme epilepsy). Remarkable effects were observed, especially as the patients seems to be fully functioning and rational beings, but displayed some strange perceptions and traits once researchers started digging. This led to searching questions on what part of consciousness is actually the 'self', and which parts are hidden processes which cannot be observed (by the 'doer').Gazzaniga focusses on the 'interpreter', or storyteller - the part of the ego that concocts explanations for thoughts and feelings AFTER you have had them. It works like a spin doctor, trying to make sense of the self and world. The latter part of the book looks at the legal culpability of criminals - are they guilty or did their brain make them do it?!Gazzaniga is a good storyteller himself. The book is not as heavy or dense as many cognitive science manuals. He keeps the narrative moving, and provides real world examples and peer reviewed research. "
45,0061906107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105277571-mario,2,"The first 140 pages of this book were really good. Great overview of neuroscience and how it points to determinism. Page 141, the author makes a really erroneous statement: ""What difference does it make if brain activity goes on before we are consciously aware of something? Consciousness is its own abstraction on its own time scale and that time scale is current with respect to it. Thus, Libet's thinking is not correct."" Libet's thinking is correct though. After arguing for chapters about what consciousness is, an emergent sensual property derived from different modules interacting, the author 180's and calls it an abstraction. Then, he claims that even as we prove consciousness does not will actions into being, it doesn't prove anything since they're on their own time scales. That's a nonsensical argument and one that is 100% incorrect if any linearity of time is to be observed. The rest of the chapters have nothing to do with the first half and discuss irrelevant social neuroscience and then the law. Extremely disappointed."
46,0061906107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70607446-fern-f,4,"Technically this is a book about whether or not humans have free will and where that free will comes from, exploring this age-old question from a neuroscience perspective. The book comes out of the author's (Michael Gazzaniga) Gifford lecture in Scotland. I say technically, because while the chapters about free will are interesting, the best part of the book are all the examples from human and animal neuroscience that Gazzaniga puts into the book, particularly the first two chapters. These explore what the brain is like, what areas of brain (and what neurons) may be involved in such processes as consciousness, interpreting, right from wrong, and the effects of lesions in different brain parts. The later chapters are more philosophical, though always rooted in published science, but the book loses steam with them. Oh, also, it's clear that some parts of the book were written with an oral lecture in mind, because there are a few jokes that look silly in writing but would totally land in a lecture. "

So i found this book and want to dig deeper about free will. I was not very satisfied, it's a pity that the author didn't just focus on free will, but rather scattering the whole general brain reactions. Left and right brain thing, Justice (morality), criminal brain with brain damage....etc. It seems to be not specific on the free will, but surely explained what in charge our decision when certain situations happened.On thing is interesting about our fear of snakes, we thought we were taught to be afraid of snakes, but actually it was in our DNA, we evolved to react even before we realized it was a snake, we jump off. if you are looking for general knowledge about brain stuff, this is the book, but free will, not so much."

We still face the mystery of free will. Our brain often takes action before we are consciously aware of why it is happening. This fundamental fact has caused some to think that we have no free will. This author recognizes that consciousness, that part of you reading and understanding this sentence, is an emergent behavior of the connections in our very complex brain. Our conscious selves may invent motives after an action is determined, yet that does not mean that we are in charge of those actions. Much of this reminds me of ancient meditation practices that are designed to drive our autonomous reactions. There is truly nothing new, even though everything is new."

That part of the book was worth 5 stars. The last two chapters are a bit of a disappointment. The author is aware of the philosophical arguments around freedom and responsibility, but he is not particularly good at developing his own philosophical answer. He only manages to vaguely outline a kind of soft-determinism, and tries to explain moral responsibility as a social phenomenon. Nonetheless, this is a thought provoking book, and it does a good job presenting the philosophical questions that arise out of neuroscience, even if the author is not particularly helpful for answering those questions."

It's a thin book and if you just read it carefully it explains complex tough ideas clearly and simply for laymen like me. That in itself is a profound achievement. I also love the fact that he looks at the facts and interprets them but at the same time knows and make you realise as well that he could be wrong on whatever he's proposing which a lot of other writers tend to not do.

The discussion about criminal justice and the misuse of neuroscience in US courts is also interesting.I part company with Gazzaniga on the question of complexity and downward causation, preferring Dennett's ""design stance"" etc. Anyway, this book is a worthy complement to Dennett's books about free will."

It's hard to make the leap from synapses and chemicals to thoughts and action but we do it every day. A happy, functioning society is dependent on the fact that each person is responsible for their actions. We still can't explain how or why but that doesn't negate the responsibility.

I wanted to read about the concept of free will and determinism of human life and the universe. This book was about everything but. It's a mish-mash of anecdotes and topics ranging from evolution to sociology to neurology. What I didn't find was 1) a discussion on free will 2) any coherent conclusion the author wishes to lead the reader or a point he's trying to make.
56,0061906107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27365529-ivan-taylor,4,Very learned book. Much of the detail about neuroscience was hard to follow and understand. Some of the research I had already seen in popular literature and some of the research in the book contradicted earlier research I had seen because it had been updated with the latest findings. The idea that emergence could be used to explain free will makes a lot of sense to me. The last couple of chapters on the legal system and neuroscience seemed like a stretch to me.

87,0061906107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8660033-aaron-thibeault,4,"*A full executive summary of this book is available here: http://newbooksinbrief.com/2012/01/28...As the study of the brain has progressed over the past century (and particularly in the past 40 years), the evidence seems to point more and more towards the idea that our sense of freedom, and of our being in control of our choices, is a mere illusion, and that our thoughts and actions are in fact as determined as the physical world around us. The idea of a determined self not only challenges our traditional understanding of ourselves, but has practical repercussions in terms of our understanding of issues such as agency and responsibility, and forces us to ask whether we can legitimately hold people accountable for their actions. Indeed, if people truly are determined to behave as they do, then they could not reasonably be considered responsible for their behaviour, and hence it would seem to be unjust to punish them for their actions, thus throwing our entire judicial system into question. These issues have already begun to surface in our court systems, and have in fact had an impact on certain court decisions to exercise leniency on convicted offenders where this would not have occurred previously (p. 190-4).According to neuroscientist Michael Gazzaniga, however, this whole line of thinking is both dangerous and misguided. This proves to be the case because, for him, the findings coming out of brain science do not in fact imply a determined self. Indeed, Gazzaniga claims that the idea of a determined self is based on a misinterpretation of the relationship between the mind and the brain, and that the proper interpretation of this relationship reveals that there is room for both responsibility and accountability. To elaborate, the idea of a determined self is based on the notion that the mind and its mental states are no more than a lifeless by-product of neurochemical activity in the brain. Since this neurochemical activity operates according to fixed physical laws, it is argued that the mind itself is a by-product of these fixed physical laws, and hence could not be free.Gazzaniga agrees that the mind and its mental states emerge out of neurochemical activity in the brain. For him, though, the mind is not a lifeless by-product of this neurochemical activity. Rather, he maintains that once the mind emerges from underlying processes it takes on a life of its own, to the point where it becomes an independent force, capable of having a causal effect on the same neurochemical activity out of which it emerged, thus allowing it to influence future brain and mind states. Though this may sound somewhat suspicious, there is in fact plenty of precedent for this type of phenomenon elsewhere in nature. Indeed, it is based on the principle of emergence, which is coming to be appreciated as a major force in explaining how all sorts of complex systems emerge out of more basic building blocks. In this new light, the mind is not a determined entity, but is instead a free agent that is responsible for its actions, and hence capable of being legitimately held accountable for them.This is the argument that Gazzaniga makes in his new book `Who's in Charge? Free Will and the Science of the Brain'. In order to get this argument off the ground though, Gazzaniga takes us on a tour of the brain based on the latest findings from neuroscience (including what neuroscience is revealing about the question of free will), as well as a tour of the evolution of the brain. A full executive summary of the book is available here: http://newbooksinbrief.com/2012/01/28..."
88,0061906107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14948330-philippe,4,"Two main takeaways: 1. Shows why Free Will is an illusion based on the physical underlying of the brain2. Best explanation I've come across as to given our thoughts are predetermined, why do we still have the illusion of having Free Will / choosing our actions - answer: the left hemisphere post-fact ""Interpreter"" who comes up with explanations about our chosen action however absurd or irrational these actions may be."
89,0061906107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17738039-michael,4,"Modern neuroscience has revealed some remarkable insights on what goes on in the mass of cells hidden between our ears. The biggest of these is on that of the homunculus: ""The idea that a person, a little man, a spirit, someone is in charge."" In other words, that thing in our brain that calls the shots, that makes things work. In the movie Men In Black, one particular scene describes the homunculus perfectly:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDObF...But there is no homunculus, no boss in the brain. In Gazzaniga's words:""We all feel we are wonderfully unified, coherent mental machines and that our underlying brain structure must somehow reflect this overpowering sense we all possess. It doesn't. Again, no central command center keeps all other brain systems hopping to the instructions of a five-star general. The brain has millions of local processors making important decisions. It is a highly specialized system with critical networks distributed throughout the 1,300 grams of tissue. There is no one boss in the brain. You are certainly not the boss of the brain. Have you ever succeeded in telling your brain to shut up already and go to sleep?""Touché. Of all the the systems he discusses, Gazzaniga's ""interpreter"" is, to me, the most remarkable. This is in essence our experience of the brain. The interpreter is a module of sorts that takes what's going on (sensory inputs, emotional responses, etc.) and makes a cohesive story out of it, which becomes our conscious experience. Interestingly, it makes things up if it has to in order to be consistent, a process known as confabulation. This reminded me immediately of Robert Cialdini's book Influence, where he discusses the automatic processes that go on in the brain. The striving for consistency being one of them, according to Cialdini. This, then, is the work of the interpreter.Gazzaniga points out the observation that the interpreter's explanations are only as good as the information it receives, and this is strikingly similar to one made by economist, and Nobel Laureate, Daniel Kahneman. HIs WSYIATI (What You See Is All There Is) concept of what he calls System 1 explains some aspects of human behavior (see the book Thinking Fast and Slow). Many of the descriptions of Gazzaniga's interpreter are straight out of the pages of Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky's work. It is interesting, and rather compelling, that the same conclusions about the function of the mind can be reached by social psychology and neuroscience.The ultimate objective, though, is to get to the bottom of free will, which, I'm afraid, we won't do in this book. Whether we have it or not is going to be up to you to decide. Especially in light of very good arguments on both sides. I'm very perplexed by Libet's experiments which were able to detect neuron activity indicative of a decision up to ten seconds (!) before the person was aware of the decision being made. This is truly fascinating work and the book overall was difficult to put down.Until the end. The book would be no worse off with the omission of Chapter 6, which deals with the legal implications of neuroscience's understanding of free will and responsibility. Actually, I will go so far as that it would be improved with the chapter's omission. The state of neuroscience has not reached the point where it has such a full understanding that it can provide useful influence on public policy regarding crime and punishment. "
