0,0670021105,http://goodreads.com/user/show/166376-david,0,"This book seemed a little forbidding at first, The first chapter was readable enough, but Chapter 2, which is clearly critical to an understanding of the rest of the book, got very hairy very fast. Scads of diagrams of the brains from various angles and a veritable cornucopia of fMRI scans, rounded out by that sad, inevitable procession of case studies whose weirdly specific malfunction* proved essential in nailing the link between a particular brain activity and the location of the region that governs it under normal conditions. Not to mention all those slightly creepy latinate names for the different parts of the brain, which, let's face it, most of us would just rather not be thinking about.I'm happy to report that, once I finally got my ass in gear, Chapter 2 turned out to be extremely clearly written and not all that hard to understand. So I'm well on my way. It's pretty cool stuff, too. *: an inability to distinguish the image of one's child from that of a raccoon when seen in the rear view mirror, mistaking one's wife for a common electrodomestic appliance, the belief that Sarah Palin is human, developing an unseemly erotic crush on the tooth fairy, that kind of thing ....

1,0670021105,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,4,"This was a really, really fascinating read, and surprisingly easy to grasp considering the technical subject. I actually read it surprisingly fast, and it was definitely the sort of book that provoked a lot of turning to my partner to ask “did you know that…”. It also made me ask a ton of questions of my mother about how I learned to read, why I learned to read late, etc, and honestly had me wondering if I should volunteer for a study on reading — the methods of reading and learning to read that Dehaene mentions don’t seem to apply to me, despite the studies backing up his hypotheses.I can only really react to this book via my own personal experience/understanding, so this is going to veer off into anecdata a lot. On a purely intellectual level, it seems as if Dehaene’s theories are sound (although I’m not sure his model of synaesthesia is correct). Some of his phrasing was… mildly offensive to me, for example describing synaesthetes as “mostly not crackpots”. Why on earth would an intelligent person, a scientist, even connect synaesthesia with delusions? I know uninformed people sometimes do, but a scientist should know that the brains of synaesthetes genuinely cause them to experience (for example) words in colour, and not talk about them being “convinced” that they do, or describe them as “mostly not crackpots”.Anyway, on an anecdotal level, Dehaene’s model doesn’t fit me at all. I didn’t/couldn’t learn to read via phonics. At all. I was eventually got reading via essentially the Whole Word method, and I still don’t connect graphemes and phonemes well at all. If I see a new word, I don’t actually think at all about how to pronounce it; I get the meaning from context, and mentally tag the image of the word with it. I only think about how to pronounce a word when I eventually find cause to say it (and then I will more often than not get it wrong). Dehaene not only thinks that doesn’t work as a way to learn words, but the model of dyslexia he proposes is essentially focused on that inability to connect phonemes and graphemes. By the logic in this book, I should be a very limited reader — yet from as quickly as a year after finally learning to read (and I was slow), I was routinely getting the reading score of an adult, and reading adult books fast and voraciously.Probably there’s some crossover in the fact that I’m synaesthetic; as a child, I apparently complained that the books school gave me to learn from “tasted bad”. And given how terrible my visual skills (particularly the ones located in the same area of the brain Dehaene identifies as the brain’s word form area) are, I’ve got to wonder if maybe learning to read without the phonetic route caused more of my brain to specialise in reading than average.In any case, it’s a fascinating topic and Dehaene’s book is mostly very readable and, as far as I can tell, mostly inoffensive — though the way he talks about synaesthetes makes me wonder if dyslexic people might also be less than pleased with the descriptions here. I’m definitely going to look up other pop science (or maybe even some studies) about how reading works in the brain; I’d like to know if any other theories describe my way of reading better, and what developments have emerged since this book was written.Originally posted here."
2,0670021105,http://goodreads.com/user/show/757602-lars-guthrie,4,"This joins the go-to books on my shelf for anyone who cares about how we read and how we learn to do it. It's next to Maryanne Wolf's 'Proust and the Squid' and the already-dated 'Understanding Dyslexia' by Sally Shaywitz.It's definitely denser matter than the other two, though, and taking it in requires effort. There were a couple of things that made the task harder than it needed to be. Since 'Reading in the Brain' generally maintains a conversational tone and does not talk down to lay people, since it offers an intriguing and insightful theory of how and why the human brain adapted to what at first appears to be a completely artificial and arbitrary process--since, in other words, I liked it--I'll get my quibbles out of the way first. I know scientists want to be exact and precise in their language, but for the popular audience it would be ever so helpful if, in describing where things are in the brain, directional words like anterior and dorsal could be replaced with front and upper. Especially since there are so many complicated names of parts that are needed. Appendices or footnotes could alert experts to the writer's competence. And those part names and mapping them. It sometimes seems that every book on the human brain is filled with muddy black and white diagramming of cloudy cross-sections inconsistently viewed from a variety of angles and taken from a variety of sources. It would be lovely if Dehaene had used clear color pictures done by one illustrator, with right and left where we usually suppose they are. After all, pictures are intended to make things more understandable. Here, I often became more confused.OK, I've got that off my chest. Dehaene can be funny, engaging and down-to-earth. He loves puns, quotes Alberto Manguel, and is a guy who says stuff like, 'Literacy drastically changes the brain--literally!' He tries.'Reading in the Brain' presents a far more complex model for reading than Shaywitz did. At the same time, and this is the most fascinating thing about the book, Dehaene offers a straightforward, beautifully simple hypothesis to explain why our brains can so readily connect to a complicated activity for which evolution cannot have prepared us. The origins of writing systems--Sumerians counting bushels of grain, for example--are just a tick away on the timeline of human history. When you think about it, reading and writing for the masses have only been around for five hundred years plus. (Thank you, Mr. Gutenberg.) Our brains are hard-wired for hunting and gathering, as well as for helping each other, and for the communication needed to do so. An innate structure for deciphering alphabetic code? Impossible.Shaywitz and others pointed out that fMRIs show an area in the left, lower, back part of the brain that successful emerging readers use, and unsuccesful readers don't. It's where the distinct individual sounds that make up syllables are broken apart and analyzed. Once that happens, we can assign symbols--little black marks called letters--to those sounds. That processing is the key, and the reason why whole language doesn't work. To break the code we have to break the code, not absorb it by some kind of osmosis induced through immersion. How and why were our brains able to do that?Dehaene assigns a perfectly clear name to the back area of the brain that matches articulation to signifier--the letterbox. Then he looks back through evolutionary history, and finds a comparable area in primates that is the basic assembly area for shape recognition. Not just random shapes, but the kind of shapes we see most commonly in nature, like horizontal and vertical lines, half-circles, junctions. You can see where this is going--E's and I's, t's and y's (similar to shapes found in all writing systems).The question shouldn't be how we adapted to printed text, Dehaene says. It should be how we created a solution to a natural desire--increasing our capacity for knowledge with a tool that allowed us to record language--with the equipment we had. He coins another jargon-free term for this--neuronal recycling.The equipment we had enabled most of us (there is growing evidence of dysfunction in the letterbox area of dyslexics) to mash together drawing and speech, and then hold onto this relationship between basic shapes and basic sounds long enough to translate a string of markings into words.Dehaene's hypothesis leads him to all kinds of interesting stuff. For example, we are equipped to recognize objects as they turn. But it is much easier to remember an upside-down tiger than the mirror image of that tiger. Our ancestors needed to instantly identify an erect tiger whether it was coming from the right or left. Our brains usually don't remember which side Jefferson faces on the nickel. As far as we're concerned, either way it's still a nickel. All children have to 'unlearn' this tendency to ignore reversals in order to learn to read.On a deeper level, looking more closely at neuronal recycling might help us to better understand other cultural inventions besides literacy. Science. Math. Art. Religion. Given that brain 'structure keeps a tight rein on cultural constructions' doesn't make those constructions any less wonderful. Really, it's all the more amazing.We are, Dehaene tells us, 'a truly singular species in the cultural sphere' because we have the capability not only to learn, but 'to invent and to transmit cultural objects.' Those sometimes difficult transmissions make our brains struggle to cope with concepts that are not innate. That's a good reason to respect the hard work that children put into learning to read. Those powerful inventions--like reading--are sublime in their intricacy and ingenuity. That's a good reason to read 'Reading in the Brain.' "
3,0670021105,http://goodreads.com/user/show/210421-bart,2,"There is something wonderfully ironical about this book: It purports to defend from enemies everywhere the act of reading, while doing so in a way that makes even the lustiest reader temporarily hate the written word.This book is terribly written; its author encapsulates a goodish number of ideas ""in a nutshell"" and likens three or four sets of ideas to ""tip(s) of the iceberg"" and feels compelled to finish many nearly unreadable sections of chapters with ""in summary."" Its largest value is a reflexive one in the sense of the book acting on itself: In the first 50 or so pages, Stanislas Dehaene provides justification enough for speed reading - bypassing the aural part of reading - that one quickly adapts this explanation as a prescription, gradually improving his speed with this book from 300 words/minute to 800 words/minute, as he realizes nothing will be lost.Even at this incredible speed, a good reader arrives at one essential set of sentences in the book's first third:Overall, although researchers have managed to map several of the relevant brain areas, how meaning is actually coded in the cortex remains a frustrating issue. The process that allows our neuronal networks to snap together and ""make sense"" remains utterly mysterious. (p. 111)There you have it. For each word, the brain takes a large number of dots from the fovea of the eye, reassembles them into a recognizable pattern or ""word"" then sends a query to its lexicon, retrieving meaning and assigning it to something like a temporary memory space, from which it is linked to other words, forming a sentence. Each words takes less than a tenth of a second. How is this done? Magic!If a complete understanding of the human brain is a 300-page book, contemporary neuroscience is nearly to the end of its first sentence, and at least 50 years from completing its first paragraph. When compared to a layman's knowledge of their field, scientists like Dehaene appear immensely knowledgeable. When one considers, however, what percentage of their field they've mastered, one comes away with an entirely different view of them.Most of this book comprises arcane case studies that disprove minutia valued by perhaps a thousand people in the world, or devolves into odd score-settling with those who do not love Charles Darwin. This book will not make you a better reader or help you cure dyslexia, but it might just help you put the wood to a helpless school administrator at your kid's next pool party."
4,0670021105,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4957849-john-brown,5,"I previously read Caplan (Harvard Medical School) in his 1996 book on ""Language"". He discussed the psychology experiments that revealed that the brain contained 8 different dictionaries, organised conceptually into a tree by speech/text, input/output, and whole-word/grapheme_phoneme.This model formed the basis of theories on dyslexia.Now Dehaene updates this psychological model into a neuroscience model, based on functional MRI and other experimental techniques, applied to show brain activities in different areas as words are presented, so that signals encoding them move over time through the different brain areas.Dehaene is completely convincing, and difficulties in matching model to experimental data are openly discussed. It would be unreasonable to expect a complete model at this stage of research, but so many psychological effects are now explained by inter-area wiring and the apparent functional operation of different brain areas.For me as an Artificial Intelligence programmer, this book is a ""must read"". It ought to be also for infant-school teachers, (computational) linguists, speech therapists, carers for seniors, and probably parents of small children, etc."

6,0670021105,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1667021-may-ling,5,"Summary: One of the more comprehensive books about brain science and reading that I have seen. I caught only one area of error, where I think the author is slightly off. P. 94 - He talk about the ""psychological dual route"" model. I'm glad to see this as we put it our speed reading course. P. 109, He talk about how apes do not have the section of the brain that can read. Fascinating.P. 120 - He talks about the concept of shapes. Young children learning whole world are memorizing shapes... fascinating. It speaks to the idea that we do not really read words letter by letter.p. 156 - This is where I know he's really not understanding Chinese. He's trying to suggest that the chinese have to learn more characters to get the sounds right. He's just flat out wrong and this is the first place it shows up as wrong. B/c he clearly doesn't read chinese, he uses this example of the Chinese word for horse and how modern Chinese has simplified this character beyond what a kid could understand. What he misses entirely is that most of these characters are still taught via parables. In other words, actually every single chinese kid looks at that character and sees a horse. Only western people who do not learn Chinese that way do not see a horse. Later in the book he speaks more to Japanese, which is NOT AT ALL like Chinese. So his argument just lacks luster. still, the bulk of the book is correct. I think if he were to learn more about Chinese, he could write a second book and also better appreciate a few of his arguments on pictorial languages, which I think he might actually fully appreciate.P. 159, he again gets it wrong b/c he's trying too hard to make Chinese phonetic. In fact, he is cherry picking words and also, there are tons of words where it would be impossible to figure out which radical carries the sound.P. 179, fascinating idea that the brain's rewiring for reading actually takes up wiring for other things. He uses the example of animal tracks. I don't actually know if this is true. In my experience, the rewiring was about a different way of pattern recognition. As a result, my associative memory i s so strong it makes up for a lot of other stuff. But I think more work should be done and it's an interesting conversation to have.P. 189, fascinating that word length does not slow down the reader. P. 190, we're faster reading lower than upper case. Cool. Also, it speaks to the idea we present as the ""visual library."" it's faster.P. 203, he talks about dyslexia and how it impacts the way people register phonetics. But in his case, he's also talking in terms of the idea they can't see it at all given how they are looking at decode the word. Not just that they must learn proper phonetics. P. 253 - he talks about an issue of mirroring. People have to see letters in the right order. There are examples where he switches it and even though I can read what is meant, it slows me down a lot to read that section. Fascinating.Tons of great reference in the back and also in the acknowledgements. Great book. "
7,0670021105,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4538930-ashish-narain,4,"The contents of this review are more of a way for me to remember some the interesting sections of the book than be a means for others to judge the book itself. Please stop reading if you plan to read this book yourself!Chapter 1: Only the center of the retina called 'fovea' has a fine enough resolution to read print. This is less than a 15 deg view. Our retinal neurons can only grasp a few words with every pause during a scan - called saccades. While reading we are more capable of ignore scale of the letters, than the change in style of writing (fonts). The visual system can easily ignore differences between eight and EIGHT which are physically quite different, but can amplify the difference between eight and sight which are different by just a few pixels. The mind can easily substitute upper/lower cases. Morphemes - the smallest independent portion of a compound word 'un''complicate'. Grapheme - a letter or a series of letters which maps into phoneme in the target language.The mind has two systems which are active during reading as an adult. The phonological and lexical route. Children start out using the phonological route - i.e. reading out loud (and providing a feedback mechanism to reinforce the sound and meaning of words). But it's been proven that the phonological route is less efficient and slower than the lexical route - i.e. mind directly interprets the meaning of a word visually - bypassing the conversion to sound. Both systems are essential. The phonological route allows us to learn new words until we've read a word sufficient number of times where we no longer need to read the words out loud anymore and we automatically switch over the lexical route over time. Debate over English: George Bernard Shaw quoted that absurdity of English using the example that 'fish' can also be written as 'ghoti' (gh from the enough, o as in women, ti from lotion). English sits between German/Italian and Chinese in terms of matching symbols to sounds. Italian is one of the easiest language to read because each character can only have one sound, this gives Italian children an edge over English learning kids. Mandrin is a mix of ideographic (symbols representing concepts) and phonetic markers. The author believe that we need to have a well planned approach to simply English for children, but doesn't endorse sms lingo and advises that having homonyms is actually beneficial for the more efficient lexical path, citing the example that we can easy differentiate the context of the sound 'I' from 'eye', but would've been difficult reading if it were spelt the same. (The hidden logic of our spelling system)Mental Dictionaries - The mind is an amazing - most adults store an excess of 50,000 words excluding proper nouns and accronyms. Any reader easily retrieves a single meaning of a word from the 50000+ candidate words, in a few tenths of a second, based on a few strokes of light on the retina. Pandemonium theory: There are thousands of neurons, each storing just a letter or so (and words in clusters). When we read a word, they all get the same signal from the retinal neurons. Each neuron then claims that it knows the letter/word and the highest weight neuron/cluster wins. "
8,0670021105,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2327558-eric-rasmussen,5,"Reading in the Brain is a very challenging book, but the effort, head-scratching, and re-reading was more than worth it - as an educator, neuro-psychology enthusiast, and appreciator of new and and interesting insights into the ways the people work, this book was one of the more significant texts I've read, ever.From a content perspective, this book wove well-explained data into profound insight into the ways something specific like reading works, which continually built toward much grander and more profound insights into what it means to be human. Dehaene did so very delicately, humbly, yet expertly and convincingly. His ideas of neuronal recycling and what that means to the scope of everything humans have ever invented and are capable of inventing are truly some worldview-altering insights.As for the more technical aspects of the text, this was very challenging, no doubt, but handled in a way that a reader does not need a deep background in neurology or biology to benefit. That, I think, is another hallmark of a gifted author - accessibility on numerous levels, from highly technical and scientific, to pedagogical, to philosophical, and on. If you are not a neurologist, this book will take some work. But there is definitely something here for you, whether your entry point is basic brain physiology, education, or general interest.This is the kind of book that should be required reading in college for teachers, perhaps for everyone. Three thumbs up."
9,0670021105,http://goodreads.com/user/show/666282-nick,5,"My guess is that this book will only be of interest to people who care a great deal about brain research; it's a jargon-heavy, very detailed analysis of what happens in the brain when we read -- and why we can read at all. We evolved to get quick fixes on shapes in nature, for our survival. So when we moved to farming and larger communities, away from hunting and gathering, and we needed to keep records, we used the same simple shapes we saw in nature -- circles, triangles, stick figures. Letters evolved from those simple shapes, and thus it's not really an accident that reading uses the same part of the brain as shape recognition. The only problem, really, is that the brain takes in these shapes, and rotates them, being indifferent to left and right symmetry, so that we can recognize that tiger no matter how its coming at us. But a ""d"" and a ""b"" are mirror images of each other, and so we have to learn to switch off that part of the brain that does that kind of symmetry so well. It's hard, and dyslexics can't do it very well. There's a whole lot more, but you get the idea. If that's the stuff that dreams are made of for you, you will love this book. "

Variability around this mean is rather low—our capital letters, for instance, have either one stroke (C, I, J, O, S, U), two strokes (D, G, L, P, Q, T, V, X), three strokes (A, B, F, H, K, N, R, Y, Z), or four strokes (E, M, W), but never more.""""I would like to propose that the magic formula of three strokes per character was chosen by our forefathers because it corresponds to the way in which the neurons’ receptive field increases across the hierarchy of visual areas.""""Corroborating Leroi-Gourhan’s statement, in Mesopotamia (present-day Iraq), the birthplace of writing, number symbols played an essential role in the emergence of the written code.""""Each of the letters that we routinely use in our Roman alphabet thus contains a small, hidden drawing dating back four thousand years. An “m” symbolizes waves (mem or mayyūma), an “n” is a snake (nahašu), an “l” a goad (lamd), a “k” a hand with outstretched fingers (kaf), an “R” a head (res) . . .""""Learning to read involves connecting two sets of brain regions that are already present in infancy: the object recognition system and the language circuit. Reading acquisition has three major phases: the pictorial stage, a brief period where children “photograph” a few words; the phonological stage, where they learn to decode graphemes into phonemes; and the orthographic stage, where word recognition becomes fast and automatic.""""At the age of five or six, when children are exposed to their first reading lessons, they already have an expert knowledge of phonology. They also possess a vocabulary of several thousand words, and have mastered the basic grammatical structures""""In 1985, the British psychologist Uta Frith introduced a model of reading acquisition that has become a classic and distinguishes three main learning stages.221 This is of course a theoretical simplification, since in fact the three stages are not rigidly partitioned.""""Frith’s three simple steps provide a rough outline of the massive changes that occur in the child’s mind. If nothing else, from the standpoint of pedagogy, they provide a very useful description of the child’s learning curve.""""According to Frith, the first reading stage, which occurs around the age of five or six, is “logographic” or “pictorial.” The child has not yet grasped the logic of writing. The visual system attempts to recognize""""the child’s brain, at this stage, is attempting to map the general shape of words""""directly onto meanings, without paying attention to individual letters and their pronunciation—a sham form of reading.""""The development of a grapheme-to-phoneme conversion procedure is characteristic of the second stage in reading acquisition, the phonological stage. At this point, whole words cease to be processed. The child learns to attend to smaller constituents such as isolated letters and relevant letter groups (“ch,” “ou,” “ay” . . .). He links graphemes to the corresponding speech sounds and practices assembling them into words. He can now even sound out unfamiliar words.""""The first years of reading instruction lead to the emergence of an explicit representation of speech sounds. The key stage is the discovery that speech is made up of atoms or phonemes, which can be recombined at will to create new words. This competence is called “phonemic awareness.” Studies by the psychologist José Morais have shown that the discovery of phonemes is not automatic. It requires explicit teaching of an alphabetic code.224 Even adults, if illiterate, can fail to detect phonemes in words.""""In the final analysis, the relation between grapheme and phoneme development is probably one of constant reciprocal interaction or “spiral causality.” The acquisition of letters draws attention to speech sounds, the analysis of speech sounds refines the understanding of letters, and so on in a never-ending spiral that leads to the simultaneous emergence of the grapheme and phoneme codes.""""clearest feature of the orthographic stage is that word length gradually ceases to play a role. At the phonological stage, children slowly decipher words sequentially, one letter at a time. As a result, reading time increases with the number of letters in a word. At the orthographic stage, as reading becomes increasingly fluent, this length effect slowly vanishes. It is essentially absent in expert adults—we all read words using a parallel procedure that takes in all letters at once, at least in short words (eight letters or fewer)."""

Just if you might be interested.Brain research, which is in its infancy, can safely be described as a guarantee for future surprises and pioneering discoveries. The work sheds light on the wonder of the operation of the control center, with a particular focus on reading, and unearths impressive facts.How the coordinated processes in different areas of the brain work, although slow compared to a computer, but efficient due to the immense interconnection capacity, amaze. Each fragment of the letter, down to the whole word, is made comprehensible through a perfectly coordinated interplay of different brain areas.From the initial contact via visual perception, the fanning of the seen into many individual components, a re-assembly by specialized neurons and the phonological classification pass imperceptible fragments of time, in which enormous is accomplished in the upper room.By way of illustration, Dehaene uses experiments, animal testing, MRI recordings and the consequences of illness or accidental brain damage. However, the acceptable results of surgical intervention and other manipulations of experimental animal brains are even less remarkable than the frightening consequences of individual strokes and accidents.The findings that can be drawn from the observation of the changes caused by diseases in perception and abilities are among the most valuable data of the scientists.Thanks to modern recording methods, the affected, damaged areas can be precisely identified and thus conclusions about the functions and tasks of specific regions of the brain can be drawn. When fortune appeals to the patient, and the incident or affliction has not caused irreversible damage, the human body sometimes counters with a redesign of adjacent areas to resettle lost abilities in other neurons to be reprogrammed.This neuroplasticity is also found in healthy people and was a significant driver of reading. By modifying brain areas dedicated to other tasks, they specialized in the processing of letters and the understanding of the written word. It happened in, concerning development history surprisingly short, a short time since the advent of the first communication attempts some tens of thousands of years ago. This short period was enough to make brain probing and gross character recognition complexes with other areas sophisticated enough to coordinate with each other. How complex this is can be illustrated by the necessary double anchoring. Only by listening, seeing or reading alone learning the letter is very difficult. Only by combining these sensory impressions with stimulation of different brain areas satisfactory results can be achieved. The parallels between all writings and languages are based on the need to incorporate the requirements of our thinking center. Without an understandable and learnable writing system which is tailored to the brain needs, literacy is not possible. The way to the modern alphabets was a correspondingly longer and more complicated, because the right combination of signs, pronunciation, and grammar had to be found, which is learnable and applicable.Cultural history is still in the dark, can be understood from new findings and, as the author's hypotheses, but well as thought building. The further research results will, even from the anthropological point of view, reveal something astounding. However, the insights should be considered not only for a better understanding of our past development but also in the sense of the further evolution of reading. This would include breaking up the rigid and restrictive concepts of the school system, which has the same answer to the individual and correspondingly different reading literacy of a child as it does to most other concerns. Antiquated, the findings of modern medical research not involving concepts, which produces an overwhelming superiority of people who reject any reading as soon as they have left school. At best these are at least not functional illiterates. As if there were no need for further poverty testimony to illustrate the need to modernize and restructure the whole school system. Otherwise, such valuable insights as those of the present work fall unreflected into oblivion.Schön, wie bemerkenswert schon das wenige ist, was bisher über das Gehirn in Erfahrung gebracht wurdeDie in den Kinderschuhen steckende Hirnforschung kann getrost als Garant für zukünftige Überraschungen und bahnbrechende Entdeckungen bezeichnet werden. In diesem Werk wird das Wunder der Funktionsweise des Schaltzentrums unter dem besonderen Fokus auf den Leseerwerb beleuchtet und erstaunliche Fakten zu Tage gefördert.Wie die koordinierten Abläufe in verschiedenen Hirnarealen zwar im Vergleich zu einem Computer langsam, aber durch die immense Kapazität bei Zusammenschaltung effizient funktionieren, animiert zum Staunen. Jedes Buchstabenfragment bis hin zum ganzen Wort wird durch ein, perfekt aufeinander abgestimmtes und koordiniertes, Zusammenspiel verschiedener Hirnareale für das Verständnis greifbar gemacht. Von dem Erstkontakt über optische Wahrnehmung, der Auffächerung des Gesehenen in viele Einzelkomponenten, eines erneuten Zusammenbaus durch spezialisierte Neuronen und der phonologischen Einordnung vergehen unmerkliche Zeitsplitter, in denen im Oberstübchen Immenses vollbracht wird. Zur Veranschaulichung zieht Dehaene Experimente, Tierversuche, MRT-Aufzeichnungen sowie die Konsequenzen von krankheits- oder unfallbedingten Hirnschädigungen heran. Wobei die nachvollziehbaren Resultate von operativen Eingriffen und anderen Manipulationen an Gehirnen von Versuchstieren noch weniger bemerkenswert sind als die erschreckenden Konsequenzen von Schlaganfällen und Unfällen bei Menschen. Die Erkenntnisse, die aus der Beobachtung der Veränderungen durch Krankheiten in Wahrnehmung und Fähigkeiten gezogen werden können, gehören zu den wertvollsten Daten der Wissenschaftler. Dank moderner Aufzeichnungsverfahren lassen sich die betroffenen, geschädigten Areale genau erkennen und damit Rückschlüsse auf die Funktionsweisen und Aufgaben bestimmter Hirnbereiche ziehen. Wenn das Glück dem Patienten hold ist und der Vorfall oder das Gebrechen nicht irreversible Schäden angerichtet haben, kontert der menschliche Körper manchmal mit einer Umwidmung von benachbarten Bereichen, um verlorene Fähigkeiten in anderen, neu zu programmierenden Neuronen wieder anzusiedeln. Diese Neuroplastizität findet sich auch beim gesunden Menschen und war eine wesentliche Triebkraft für den Leseerwerb. Durch die Modifikation von für andere Aufgaben bestimmten Hirnbereichen spezialisierten sich diese auf die Verarbeitung von Buchstaben und der Verständnis des geschriebenen Wortes. Und das in entwicklungsgeschichtlich betrachtet erstaunlich kurzer Zeit seit dem Aufkommen der ersten Kommunikationsversuche vor einigen Zehntausenden Jahren. Dieser kurze Zeitraum reichte aus, um für die Umgebungssondierung und grobe Zeichenerkennung zuständige Hirnareale mit anderen Bereichen komplex genug zu verschalten und in perfekt koordinierte Abstimmung miteinander zu setzen. Wie komplex dies ist, lässt sich an der notwendigen Doppelverankerung veranschaulichen. Nur mithilfe des Hörens, Sehens oder Lesens alleine ist das Erlernen des Schreibens sehr schwer. Erst durch eine Kombination dieser Sinnenseindrücke samt Stimulation unterschiedlicher Hirnareale lassen sich befriedigende Resultate erzielen.Die Parallelen zwischen sämtlichen Schriften und Sprachen fußen auf der Notwendigkeit des Einbezugs der Bedürfnisse unserer Denkzentrale. Ohne ein verständliches, erlernbares und auf die Hirnbedürfnisse zugeschnittenes Schriftsystem ist eine Alphabetisierung nicht möglich. Der Weg zu den modernen Alphabeten war ein entsprechend langer und komplexer, da erst die richtige Kombination aus Zeichen, Aussprache und Grammatik gefunden werden musste, die erlern- und anwendbar ist.Kulturgeschichtlich liegt noch vieles im Dunkeln, lässt sich anhand der neuen Erkenntnisse und, wie an Hypothesen des Autors veranschaulicht, aber gut als Gedankengebäude nachvollziehen. Die weiteren Forschungsergebnisse werden noch, auch vom anthropologischen Standpunkt aus betrachtet, Erstaunliches zu Tage fördern. Doch sollten die Erkenntnisse nicht nur zum besseren Verständnis unserer vergangenen Entwicklung, sondern auch im Sinne einer weiteren Evolution des Lesens betrachtet werden. Dazu gehören würde ein Aufbrechen der rigiden und einschränkenden Konzepte des Schulsystems, das auf die individuelle und entsprechend unterschiedlich zu fördernde Lesebegabung eines Kindes die gleiche Antwort hat wie auf die meisten anderen Belange. Antiquierte, die Erkenntnisse der modernen medizinischen Forschung nicht mit einbeziehende Konzepte, die eine überwältigende Übermacht von jegliche Lektüre ablehnenden Menschen hervorbringt. Diese sind im besten Fall zumindest keine funktionellen Analphabeten.Als würde es nicht noch weiterer Armutszeugnisse bedürfen, um die Notwendigkeit einer Modernisierung und Umstrukturierung des gesamten Schulsystems zu veranschaulichen. Sonst fallen solch wertvolle Erkenntnisse wie die des vorliegenden Werks auch weiters unreflektiert der Vergessenheit anheim."
16,0670021105,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1050800-laurie,4,"Author Dehaene, who has some very impressive credentials, has made an exhaustive exploration of how the human brain reads. What he has concluded is that we ‘recycle’ parts of the brain that were evolved to do other things. Humans have been evolving for several million years, but only reading for a few thousand- a new structure just for reading couldn’t have been created in that time. And reading arose in several geographical areas around the same time- the chances of a special mutation for reading happening in all those places is pretty slim. Hundreds of experiments, from EEGs, fMRIs, split brain surgeries, tests on people who have had strokes or other brain damage, have found how reading works. From how the eye functions, to the recognition of letters on paper, to turning them mentally into sound, and putting those sounds together into words, Dehaene has traced the path. He gives his opinions on what seem to be the best way to teach reading, but also calls for large experiments in teaching reading to resolve, once and for all, what is the best, most efficient way to teach all- not just average children but adult illiterates and people with dyslexia. The book is very interesting, but it can be slow going. He gives the conditions and results of test after test, and tells us what the information gained tells us about reading. What the reader learns about their brain makes it worth sticking with the book. "
17,0670021105,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2438275-diana-sandberg,3,"Dehaene is somewhat difficult to read; he is discursive and not spectacularly well organized. But it’s generally worth wading through the verbiage for the information. This one is about the nitty-gritty details of brain structure and function as they relate to the skill of reading. Recent advances in brain imaging have given us surprising new insights.It is indeed astonishing that readers from all cultures almost invariably use precisely the same relatively minute portion of the brain for this activity. Since it is beyond absurd to suppose this area evolved for this purpose, the question arises as to how it could be so uniquely suitable. Dehaene convincingly demonstrates that it is a question of writing and reading culturally evolving to be most usefully employed by a fortuitous convergence of skills already present and most easily adapted to this function.Dehaene further discusses anomalies in brain function that interfere with this process – strokes and damage, but also the differences in prenatal development that lead to dyslexia. Although I think he is a little too firm in his conclusions about the best way to teach reading, there is a lot that is extremely interesting in this part."
18,0670021105,http://goodreads.com/user/show/699732-scott,3,"Dehaene offers a very technical explanation of what happens in the brain when one reads. He suggests that although there is no specific ""reading gene"", there appears to be evidence that there are structures or mechanisms that facilitate reading within the brain, features that are recycled in the purpose from what nature had originally intended. He is informed by a good deal of research that shows some universal similarities suggesting that human creativity did not come up with the various alphabets, but rather that the neuronal structure of our brains is inherently likely to latch onto certain symbols. He points to similarities in symbols across cultures as his evidence. He also spends some time applying this idea of ""recycling"" of the brain's functions to explain dyslexia. And he adamantly argues for the use of phonics over whole language, claiming that it makes no sense (in terms of brain research) to employ the archaic and misguided practices of whole language when we consider how the brain operates. "
19,0670021105,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4717212-orlando,3,"the book is a bit daunting, and is challenging for people with all kinds of interests in the topic of reading. if you have a psycholinguistics/applied linguistics background, you can just skim over the chapters that contain all the detailed research data about what goes on in the brain. dehaene has some interesting chapters about methodology in teaching reading, like what is wrong with whole language education. if your background is strictly stats and data and neuroscience (not me), you might get confused on some of the details about what goes into teaching reading pedagogy (my background). it's a good reference and definitely something at least all reading teachers should browse through.i would have liked more information on dyslexia issues in non-western, right-to-left readers. also, i think dehaene harps a little bit too much on how simple it is to spell in italian, and hardly mentions spanish as something that is even potentially easier to read and write."
20,0670021105,http://goodreads.com/user/show/970632-mitchell,3,"Ouch. My brain hurts. This was the hardest book to read that I've finished in years. The writing was difficult, the subject more so. And the subject interfered with reading - it was hard to read something about how we read without immediately trying it out on what I was reading. Even the font was difficult. The author's first language is almost certainly not English and that comes through as well.And yet, what it had to say about how we read was incredibly fascinating. Whether on AI or on handwriting recognition or speech recognition or on whole language versus phonics (or on teaching reading in general) or on better alphabetic or language design - I expect to see this subject again and again - in fiction and non-fiction, in computer science and medicine.I highly recommend - but there is a good chance that you will find this book unreadable - but who knows - perhaps I just missed the pre-requisites to make this book easier. 3.5 of 5 (the lowest score of a book I've favorited)"

Come on, people, it's the 21st century.From the intro: ""Nothing in our evolution could have prepared us to absorb language through vision."" So, is he arguing that sign language is as amazing a thing as reading? Checking the index, he doesn't address sign language anywhere.Didn't end up having time to finish before it had to go back to the library; I'll give it a try later when I have more time and when I'm willing to put up with the generic ""he"". (The problem with generic ""he"" in a book like this is that, unless you believe men's brains and women's brains are identical, it's confusing whether ""his brain/a man's brain"" means that X is true of a male brain and not a female brain, or X is true of all human brains. Using gender-neutral constructions can be more challenging writing but results in more accurate communication.)"
22,0670021105,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14943912-nancy,1,"MehReally not much of practical benefit for the classroom teacher, homeschool parent, or a reading tutor to hang their hats on. Lots of scientific jargon and speculation but little useful application for teaching reading. I was pretty disappointed in this book, and even reading it with a group of highly educated dyslexia tutors didn’t yield much that was useful. We already use multi-sensory techniques to teach phonological awareness, phonics, morphology, and comprehension. Overall, it wasn’t worth the time. "
23,0670021105,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1798636-erica,5,"Bravo! This is a marvelous book - clearly and elegantly written (not in the author's native language) and on the cutting edge of the neuroscience of reading.

Some fascinating insights, but also sometimes too much brain-anatomy. So I did skip some parts, including Chapter 6 on the dyslexic brain, because I'm less interested in that.P30 on irregularity of pronunciation in English:?GB Shaw pointed out that ""fish"" might be spelled ghoti: gh as in enough, o as in women, ti as in lotion.P46 in adult expert readers, the time to read a word is essentially independent of its length. As long ad the word does not have more than six or seven letters, its recognition takes an approximately constant amount of time (Lavidor & Ellis, 2002).P104 Dual route model for reading:* Infrequently used words and neologisms move along a phonological route that converts letter strings into speech sounds* Frequently used words, and those whose spelling does not correspond to their pronounciation, are recognized via a mental lexicon that allows us to access their identity and meaningP147 In my hypothesis, cultural invention arises similarly [ie with tinkering, exaptation] from the recombination of ancient neuronal circuits into new cultural objects, selected because they are useful to humans and stable enough to proliferate from brain to brain.P214-215 When we spend time on reading or ornithology, we also trade cortical soace. This obviously reduces the brain resources for other skills - and our face perception abilities may suffer.P266 as Charles Darwin and Stephen Jay Gould observed, the best support for evolution lies in nature's imperfections (...) only the blind operation of evolution can explain these stupid quirks.P327 Science can contribute to teachimg by introducing educators to the demanding concept of experimentation (...) experimentation can significantly improve reading instruction.

32,0670021105,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12439101-jim,4,"Dehaene’s book begins promisingly enough—the introduction lays out, as an introduction should, the scope and sequence of the text. And he makes good on his promise. The first couple of chapters feature accessible language and ideas that most intelligent non-scientists will be able to understand. In describing the complex brain circuitry that reading involves, he clearly shows that reading is not as “simple and effortless” as we might imagine. The second chapter introduces the concept of the “brain’s letterbox”—the portion of the brain where spoken and written language enters and is transformed into meaning. Dehaene also discusses at great length his concept of neuronal recycling, which is the theory that our brains were not necessarily biologically designed for reading but that the organ has evolved for this purpose by appropriating specific parts of itself to interpret and understand language. As he asserts early on in the book, “Reading is nothing but the word-by-word mental restitution of a text through a series of snapshots” (p. 17).Then comes the science—and there is a lot of it. The remainder of the book is quite challenging, especially for those of us who are not brain scientists. Dehaene’s theory, however, was intriguing enough to keep me reading, especially with the expectation that, in chapter 5, he would offer information that teachers would find helpful (he does). His complete and utter destruction of the flawed thinking behind whole language instruction (and he exquisitely demolishes the pseudo-strategy) is simply a delicious bonus."
33,0670021105,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10954350-nancy-white,0,"I had to put this book down a few times because it blew my mind so severely. Ideas that I had always assumed to be true about reading and writing are efficiently and effectively debunked in this book - clearly I didn’t know as much as I thought I knew! This is a fascinating exploration into the evolution of reading and writing from a neuroscience perspective, well-supported by high quality evidence throughout, but ultimately it draws conclusions and has implications for reading instruction that are not at all surprising and are in fact totally in line with current scientific research evidence. It’s nice to know that neuroscience, a field which seems miles away from teaching and speech pathology at times, is finding the same things that we’re finding and reiterating that the only effective and ethical way to teach children to read (at least in an initial literacy education setting) is through synthetic phonics instruction."
34,0670021105,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7491269-melissa,3,"I found the premise intriguing- we weren't wired for reading, but a part of the brain originally designed for another purpose has been recycled into a ""letterbox area"" that has made reading and writing possible. There were a few bits I found quite fascinating and the author keeps a friendly tone in a subject that can be quite difficult for people without the scientific background to understand. That being said, there is still a lot of jargon and wordiness (even the author mentions how wordy he can be at one point). I didn't find most of the black & white photos / drawings of the brain to be very helpful. Finally, as an educator, there wasn't really anything in the book that I could use in the classroom, other than whole language = bad, systematic phonics instruction = good, which I didn't need this book to tell me. All in all, a decent book with an interesting theory about how reading developed."

I've talked more about this book to anyone who would listen and even shared some of the demos in the book with my sixth graders. Therefore no less than 4 stars would be possible, however I was bogged by the chapters in the middle to end droning symmetry for a bit too long. Rest was fascinating. I wish I could remember the vast theories presented in my personal knowledge base. The brain is amazing and reading is weird; excellent job piecing together the beginnings of seeing what goes on when you interpret these words aka little black marks as meaning.

The german translation is good and seems to deal in a meaningful way with the language examples.Mr Dehaene gives a detailed overview on science on reading, focussing on the gray-matter and the primate that carries it. The processes how reading works in the brain, how it's interwoven with language/speech and how we shape these abilities in our first years of live are central.

I was tempted to skip the tough chapters but am glad I didn’t for the sake of my work with dyslexics. I share Dehaene’s hope stated in the last Chapter titled The Future of Reading, “My hope is that...research on teaching, psychology, and neuroscience will merge into a single, unified science of reading.”Big takeaway for teachers: “Neither educators nor psychologists can afford to ignore recent scientific findings. Neuroscience today sheds indispensable light on how a reader’s brain works, and what makes it more or less receptive to different teaching methods.”"

I found Dehaene's book to be a bit more readable and understandable for the layperson. He explains the connections between speech development beginning in the womb, and how that connects to learning to read. He draws the same conclusions as many scientists regarding how phonics helps children to learn reading, and debunks whole-word as being inefficient and hence ineffective, at least for beginning readers, based on various recent studies of the brains of children as they learn to read.An excellent, thoroughly researched exposition of the topic."

50,0670021105,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2664606-k-lincoln,4,"One of the last chapters opens with an epigraph from Umberto Eco ""If God existed, he would be a library.""Which tickled my fancy, but doesn't necessarily portray Dehaene's stance about how inborn structural properties of our brain are co-opted and retrained (neuronal recycling)in order for humans to develop the ability to recognize words and understand them (no matter if Chinese or French.)""Recycling, on the other hand, implies that before cortical regions convert to other uses, they already possess prior structural properties inherited from evolution. Each cortical region starts out with a portfolio of assets and liabilities that are only partially rearranged by learning.""Dehaene uses most of his book to describe in detail the work of various researchers in figuring out where certain processes in the brain reside. His development of a theory of the ""letterbox"", or a parallel series of processes/areas that get activated in order to recognize letters is fascinating stuff. However, for a laywoman like me (I'm from a language acquisition education background, but by no means a scientist)it was heavy duty reading. I slogged through it nonetheless, and emerged with an interesting view on how evolution might have prepared our brain in two important ways: by helping us be expert recognizers of primary geometric shapes and b) giving us the ability to recognize mirror images of objects even if we've only seen a profile.Again, it was heavy technical speak about different sections of the brain, but ultimately manageable. What makes this book most interesting to an educator like me are the last few chapters which talk about implications of Dehaene's research and theories on both first language acquisition and on dyslexia.He spends some time ""debunking"" whole language methods of teaching first language acquisition to speakers of Western Languages based on the innate properties of the brain. He also postulates some reasons behind different types of dyslexia and seems to be a proponent of Montessori-like teaching of phonics and letter shapes employing multiple senses (such as tracing the contours of letters shaped out of sandpaper from a consistently left to right motion.)The purpose of persistently teaching left to right helps our brains (which according to Dehaene need to be trained to by asymmetrical in perception) identify the letters correctly. This made me think of the insistence on stroke order in writing Japanese Kanji charactesr my children fight against in their Saturday Japanese school, although my own experience (and thousands of years of Japanese history) probably support the idea that his ""training"" of the brain by consistent order and direction of writing characters (as well as engaging motor memory) helps acquire kanji in the long run.For any educator or researcher working with literacy skills, this is worthwhile reading, if only for the last coupe of chapters. I appreciated Dehaene, a native French speaker, also attempting to incorporate languages such as Chinese and Japanese into his work. This Book's Snack Rating: Seven layer dip and chips for having to delve down through the technical layers of brain structure to get to the satisfying educational implications at the bottom."
51,0670021105,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10631497-ruth,3,"It's appropriate that this book should test the reader's stamina as it is about the very fact of the amazing human feat of literacy! The main thesis is that our brains recycle circuits and neurons designed by evolution for our survival and use them for reading and writing, and in the larger picture, for inventing culture. Brain studies show areas of the brain which are used in all cultures for responding to and processing written language. All writing uses phoneme and morpheme representations which our brains can interpret into language. Dehaene describes all this in detail, and is fascinating and convincing. Then towards the end of the book he becomes more speculative and discusses what makes our brains able to invent cultural objects such as writing, drawing attention to the size of the human prefrontal cortex and suggesting that this is a powerhouse of connected thoughts and imagination, unavailable to any other species.Dehaene is at his best when he describes the obscure goings on in the brain through metaphor. If you read this book look out for the assembly of daemons, and the merging of chapels into cathedrals - stirring stuff.I read this book because it was quoted as evidence that phonics is the best route to reading for children. Well, it doesn't quite say that. Although Dehaene, in his last chapter, concludes that a phonic route is essential, this over-simplifies what he has said previously in the book. The reader has to be able to respond automatically to whole words, but learning to read by learning whole words seems not to be suited to the way the brain works and Dehaene's arguments for phonics are based on this rejection. However, Dehaene also points out that in English, irregular spellings mean that the brain has to work from more information than from grapheme correspondences alone, and has to compare new words with the growing bank of knowledge of other words available to the reader. So he identifies two routes. There is the phonics route for regular, phonically straightforward words, and there is the lexical route, for letter strings which are problematic. I think Dehaene's championing of phonics is based on an interpretation of phonic teaching which allows for the added lexical route to be exploited whereas supporters of synthetic phonics, in the UK, currently assert that SP is enough on its own.Anyhow, along the way to drawing these conclusions Dehaene treats the reader to a fascinating insight into the mysterious workings of the human brain in general and, more particularly, into the equally fascinating explorations and experimentations of the neoroscientific community. "
52,0670021105,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3024716-geoffrey-fox,4,"Reading requires rapid and successive interpretations of small sets of visual marks (in alphabetic writing, no more than 5-7 letters per saccade) by neurons from several regions of the brain, interrogating the symbols until the most likely hypothesis of their meaning is established. The very first operation in each saccade is to recognize the symbols as letters (rather than corporate logos, or numbers, or something else) and attribute possible sounds to them. If the symbols invariably represent a single sound (as in Italian or German), it is quickly recognized by the phonics neurons. If they may represent several possible sounds (e.g., the letters ""ough"" in English), other neurons from other parts of the brain must apply grammatical rules while others evaluate context (the symbols seen in previous saccades) to narrow the possible interpetations. Recognition of symbols as letters (or phonemes or characters in nonalphabetic systems) occurs in all humans, regardless of culture or writing system, in approximately the same section of the left brain hemisphere, but requires activation of other brain sections to interpret them. Recognition of simplified symbols, or ""proto letters"", evolved millions of years before the invention of writing, inspired by common forms seen in nature: L, Y, T etc. ""…over time, scribes developed increasingly efficient notations that fitted the organization of our brains. In brief, our cortex did not specifically evolve for writing. Rather, writing evolved to fit the cortex."" Thus all writing systems in all cultures, even Chinese or the many Indian scripts, share common features: combinations of symbols of no more than 4 strokes, arranged in straight, regular lines. All (even Chinese) include some signal of sound. Those writing systems that correspond most closely to spoken sounds (e.g., Finnish, Italian, German) are the quickest for children to learn, English is the most difficult of the European languages and reading Chinese takes much longer. Phonics teaching is far superior to ""whole word"" approach for enabling the learner to read unfamiliar words."
53,0670021105,http://goodreads.com/user/show/251555-shinynickel,0,"Off this article: http://www.scientificamerican.com/art...""A classical, although often implicit, view in social science is that the human brain, unlike that of other animals, is a learning machine which can adapt to essentially any novel cultural task, however complex. We humans would be liberated from our past instincts and free to invent entirely new cultural forms.What I am proposing is that the human brain is a much more constrained organ than we think, and that it places strong limits on the range of possible cultural forms. Essentially, the brain did not evolve for culture, but culture evolved to be learnable by the brain. Through its cultural inventions, humanity constantly searched for specific niches in the brain, wherever there is a space of plasticity that can be exploited to “recycle” a brain area and put it to a novel use. Reading, mathematics, tool use, music, religious systems -- all might be viewed as instances of cortical recycling.Of course, this view of culture as a constrained “lego” game isn't that novel. It is deeply related to the structuralist view of anthropology, as exemplified by Claude Levi-Strauss and Dan Sperber. What I am proposing is that the universal structures that recur across cultures are, in fact, ultimately traceable to specific brain systems.In the case of reading, the shapes of our writing systems have evolved towards a progressive simplification while remaining compatible with the visual coding scheme that is present in all primate brains. A fascinating discovery, made by the American researcher Marc Changizi, is that all of the world's writing systems use the same set of basic shapes, and that these shapes are already a part of the visual system in all primates, because they are also useful for coding natural visual scenes. The monkey brain already contains neurons that preferentially respond to an “alphabet” of shapes including T, L, Y. We merely “recycle” these shapes (and the corresponding part of cortex) and turn them into a cultural code for language. """
54,0670021105,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6372258-tara-mc,4,"I started this book having read a few others on the same topic already this year. The new science of reading, introduction and opening chapter didn't disappoint and was a good way into the topic, asking the reader to consider the mystery of the reading ape. I'm intrigued by this topic, so the heavily jargon ,loaded writing style only make things more interesting, as first at least. The quotes and links to the history of reading were useful in illustrating these opening points. I think that the most impressive parts of this book for me were in the first half, through the chapter on how we read, including details on the inadequacy of the human eye to be put to the difficult task of reading, and through the variation between different languages which was informative and readable. As others have commented, this book gets a bit difficult to read through quickly from chapter 2, because of all the technical talk on the areas of the brain and how the brain adapts itself to read in every individual who begins the task of learning to read. The diagrams were complex but necessary. Chapter 3 is again back onthe trail of the mysterious reading ape, and this chapter was a fascinating insight into how far we have come but yet how close we are to the animal kingdom. Closely followed by the chapter on learning to read, this was again a very interesting look at the process of reading, I was particularly interested in the reading history of classroom trends, and some warnings about ways not to teach reading. The dyslexic brain chapter shed new light on a topic I've only learned a little about and then to look at the problems of symmetry in reading was really useful also. In all this book by itself could become a course in reading and I was really impressed by its range. I'll be coming back to the book again for reference. Well worth the time spent getting to the end.

55,0670021105,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1410324-jay-cruz,5,"Review adapted from Tape Noise DiaryReading in the Brain is by the author and cognitive psychologist Stanislas Dehaene. I read his previous book, The Number Sense, and like that book, this one is a bit heavy on brain research and brain mapping. But once you get past the heavy region name dropping like the occipito lobe and the temporal lobe, you’ll see that this is a wonderful book about the amazing ability we humans are lucky to have: reading.One the main thesis of the book is that it’s a “miracle” we can read. Dehaene postulates his theory of neuronal recycling of how the brain region we use today for reading was probably used for something different. In the short period of 2000 years or so since the invention of reading and writing, our brains have recycled and fine tuned neurons to recognize symbols as signifying speech sounds and meaning.Dehaene takes you on a journey on how it all works. From how the eyes see words to were they go in your brain to be processed. He gives a brief history of writing. A big part of the book deals with dyslexia and “mirroring” errors when reading. This is important to understand reading in the brain because it reveals a great deal on what’s happening, particularly before we become fluent readers. One of Dehaene theories is that if it wasn’t for the brains’ plasticity, we would all be mild dyslexics and make mirror errors (confusing b with d) more frequently.I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves reading and to parents and teachers. "
56,0670021105,http://goodreads.com/user/show/650717-linda,4,"I was more interested in the second half of the book, which I thought was excellent in its discussion of the actual process of reading and the nature of dyslexia based on brain structure and function. What pleased me was learning that the structured, systematic, sequential multi sensory approach to teaching reading that I learned thirty-eight years ago is still touted as a most effective way to work with children with dyslexia.Quotations""Italian children, after a few months of schooling, can read practically any word, because Italian spelling is almost perfectly regular....Conversely, French, Danish, and especially British and American children need years of schooling before they converge onto an efficient reading procedure. Even at the age of nine, A French child does not read as well as a seven-year-old German. British children only attain the reading proficiency of their French counterparts after close to two full years of additional teaching"" (230).""In the majority of dyslexics,...reading deficits come from a core impairment in the processing of speech sounds....another smaller number of children probably suffers from a primarily visual impairment. In these cases their problem could be due, at least in part, to the unlearning of symmetry"" (294).""That both the dorsal and ventral pathways need to be trained for reading may explain the remarkable success of teaching methods that emphasize motor gestures....The activity brings together gestures, touch, vision, and a sense of space"" (299)."
57,0670021105,http://goodreads.com/user/show/705887-broodingferret,5,"Excellent book. Well-presented and strongly supported, Dehaene does a great job defending his thesis, which, simply put, is that the ability to read is made possible by recycling brain structures and processes that originally evolved for the purposes of perceiving the natural world. This ""neuronal recycling"" is made evident by such data as the homogeneity across cultures regarding the brain areas used while reading, the large amount of base-line graphical similarity in alphabets as different as English and Kanji, and the systematic and predictable errors that are performed by people (especially children) who are learning to read. His model also provides insight into why it's easier to learn how to read with some languages and not others, and into the pathology and potential treatments for varieties of dyslexia (though he could have done a more thorough job when covering dyslexia treatments). There were a few points where Dehaene's word usage isn't quite accurate, but I figure such mistakes are due to a ""lost in translation""-style issue (English is his second language). Wonderful book; a must for any neuroscience reading list."
58,0670021105,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5923872-garrett-zecker,4,"This fantastic, well-researched, and illuminating book sheds light on the origins and science in our brains on the very activity from which I make my living. The subject is absolutely fascinating, and the resulting science behind it, the methodology of how it is (and was) tested, and the ultimate reflection on our brains and ourselves as thinking, analytic creatures. It is brilliant, and the author and other scholars that contributed to this work deserve tremendous amounts of praise. I only have a couple of complaints - that chapters two and three are heavy-science (with good reason - it is interesting and there are a lot of pictures), but this is certainly overshadowed by the commentary on science- and research-based instruction in the reading classroom. All children need to be surrounded by books in their lives from birth - it is necessary to their ultimate performance and possibly even the ultimate height of their intellect - and it is just as necessary that we use science to guide our intervention, policy, and instruction rather than politicians. A brilliant book that illuminates the history, activity, and behavioral performance of humans and the written word."
59,0670021105,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5422600-kristi-thielen,5,"I began this book half a year ago and put it aside when I found it frustratingly technical. I returned to it this month and found the reading much easier and more enjoyable. (Maybe that says something about reading in MY brain.) Dehaene's most interesting statements are about the evolution of language; he contends that our brains did not adapt to the new concept of reading so much as we created alphabets made up of images that ""fit"" our brain as it already existed. He also takes to task the currently in vogue concept of ""whole language"" learning, stating that it fails kids and that only rigorous study of graphemes and phonemes really teaches kids to do the most important thing a reader does: read words that you are seeing for the first time. There is also a considerable examination of dyslexia, which would be of interest to anyone who has this condition or has a child who does. "
60,0670021105,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4639104-helder,4,"Providing strong evidence, supported by up-to-date brain imaging techniques, Dehaene tries to pinpoint how do we read. The hypothesis is a quite stimulating, interesting and thought-provoking one: the acquisition of such a demanding skill as reading is only possible through a neuronal recycling, that is, we can only read because, through learning, some of our neurons inhabiting the occipito-temporal area in the brain's left hemisphere (or, as the author puts it, the brain's ""letterbox""), are redefined and re-adapted for a new function. Even if not always easy to follow, specially for the reader lacking a neuroscience background, Dehaene's account surely is thorough and well documented. A must-read for anyone who wants to know more about brain functioning and how reading comes to play a role in there. "
61,0670021105,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5861493-michelle,3,"The book covers a wide range of topics from how reading and writing evolved, to how our brains process visual information and transform this into an understanding of writing. There are chapters that cover the biological aspects, highlighted by brain injuries that have unique effects on reading. The book also discusses the process of learning to read, going into phonics versus whole word theories for teaching, and why phonics works better. I found it intriguing that languages with more consistent grammar/spelling lead to earlier proficiency in reading. There is a fair amount of science in the book, which was interesting to me, but might go into to much detail for the less medically/scientifically inclined. It made me appreciate how amazing the process of reading really is. "
62,0670021105,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10364080-heather,4,"Tons of amazing data! He oversimplified the evolution of Egyptian writing systems a lot, and I think his section on the evolution of language could benefit greatly from focusing a lot more on the earliest writing systems, such as those of the Sumerians, Olmecs, and Egyptians, rather than talking about the latin alphabet at first. A lot of what he describes as a very swift evolution from pictographs to stylized alphabets took thousands of years and was not at all inevitable. However, that was one small section in an otherwise excellent book, and his specialty is neuroscience, not the history of writing systems, so this is a minor flaw. I really liked the suggestion that 'reading' the natural world and tracking animals was the cognitive precursor to reading. That makes a lot of sense."

Reading in the brain proved all my reservations unwarranted. Dehaene brilliantly addresses reading as an object recognition task, starting with the basic premises of object recognition. He continues to draw a link between reading and phonological awareness that is fascinating and rigorous, addressing the same issue from multiple points of view (e.g. dyslexia, neural development, and parietal-temporal lobe connections). Dehaene has reignited my fascination with the parietal lobe and neural plasticity in one fell swoop!"

Everyone who loves to read should become familiar with how miraculous this skill really is.

79,0670021105,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2765873-vtalland,2,"He's an amazing thinker, particularly as he is writing about reading in English and that is not his first language. A little too much neuro-anatomy for my taste, but some interesting features. Synesthesia is touched on briefly...I wish he talked more about that."
80,0670021105,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1009522-lb,5,"Not an easy read, but completely worthwhile. Fascinating ideas, some of which I was familiar and some of which were so far out of anything I would have imagined... Not too many writers can accomplish that and still be understood by a layperson to their area of expertise."
81,0670021105,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1077434-elaine,5,"Wow. Anyone teaching early literacy or that has a child on the verge of reading needs to read this book. I will warn that there is a lot of experimental data to get through, but how they conduct the research is fascinating. "
82,0670021105,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2148726-daniel-delappe,0, Great book. This is the first book I have read that takes on the foul BS called whole-language reading. This author gives you a deep ride into the brain and explains why whole language is BS. Got some good stuff on dyslexia.
83,0670021105,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1215054-sarah,3,"I'm probably not the target audience for this book, since I skimmed over a lot of the science (and there was a lot of science). Still, I enjoyed a lot of the ""isn't this cool?!"" examples of how the brain processes language while reading. Now, I'll go back to reading unself-consciously."
84,0670021105,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3991753-peter-galamaga,2,Not what I thought it would be. VERY technical and difficult book written for scientists and medical types. Bottom line - what goes on in your brain while you read is un-freaking-believable.I just saved you 10 hours of misery.
85,0670021105,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15613-edwin,4,A bit of a tough read for those of who aren't very well versed in neuroscience. But perhaps we teachers should have a better grasp of what's going on in our students' brains as they progress from infancy to adulthood. This book has permanently changed my understanding of what reading is-
86,0670021105,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1843025-velma,0,I'd like to read this to compare/contrast it with Proust and the Squid: The Story and Science of the Reading Brain
87,0670021105,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58606-megan,3,"The first half of the book was really interesting, but the last half started to lose me. It was cool to learn about how reading works in the brain and how we can maybe start to teach kids differently. "
88,0670021105,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2348313-diana,0,"An excellent read about how the brain has been able to adapt itself to be able to read by way of the ""The Recycling Hypothesis"" that Dehaene puts forth. At times a bit slow due to some of the brain and neuronal physiology but well worth the work in reading."
89,0670021105,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5723395-isla-mcketta,4,"Fascinating. I'd hoped it would go more into what our brains do with words once we read them, but I learned a lot about how we learn to read and what that means for things like dyslexia and synesthesia."
