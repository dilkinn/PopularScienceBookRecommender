It means ""sun centeredness."" *yawn* The solar system is heliocentric. Hawaiian culture is heliocentric. Big whoop.In the Sixteenth Century, this sh*t was hot news, and really really controversial. Think gay-marriage-level passions inflamed. Heliocentrism meant that the SUN and not God's Perfect Creation The Earth was the center of the Universe. Panic! Riots! Thunderings from dimwitted religiosifiers! Is this sounding familiar yet?And the man who ignited the revolution (which really amounted to observing the real world carefully and reporting on his findings) was a lifelong Polish Catholic churchman. That's right, a predecessor of John Paul II was the one who made the whole Church Edifice of lies and superstitions tremble before the might of reality! Go Copernicus! Right?Except he didn't want to do that. He was a scientist, a man who wasn't content to look at the lunar eclipse and say ""crikey that's purty"" and go on back inside to pray some more. He measured stuff. He worked out mathematical explanations for stuff. He even told a few friends of like mind about his thoughts. And that's what set off the firestorm that still goes on between religion on one side and science on the other. But he was a Churchman, and a darned good and effective one, and he didn't want to rock the boat lest he fall out of it and starve. So he put his papers away, boinked his housekeeper, and prayed a couple times a day. End of revolution...but there were copies floating around and causing sensations...just a matter of time....It was a Lutheran who did it. Wouldn't you know it would be a Protestant, AND a German. So along comes this Protestant German to Poland to look up the writer of the amazing [On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres], which our Lutheran troublemaker has read and is completely blown away by, and tells Canon Copernicus that he mustmustmust publish this marvelous (in the original sense of the word) piece of logic and analysis.Well, we know who won, but it took ages to convince Canon C. to make with the goodies, and he was long dead before the real sh*tstorm hit. Best of all possible outcomes for ol' Copernicus.My Review: Dava Sobel can count on me. I will read, and quite probably enjoy, anything she writes. She's got a knack for finding the interesting angle on stories of greater or lesser public fascination. Her use of research plus imagination is exemplary in its balance.In this book, a beautiful hardcover from Walker & Co., she does something unusual: She writes the story of the German guy, Rheticus, and Copernicus meeting and working together to get the manuscript ready for publication as a play. It's true she won't be getting any Tony awards or getting a production even Off-Off-Broadway, but she wrote a pretty compelling dramedy about the men and their probable conflicts in doing work that simply can't be overestimated in terms of its impact on Western culture. It was a smart move, too, because this way she can't be criticized for making stuff up in the context of non-fiction...she explicitly makes it up, and presents it as fiction, because there are (unsurprisingly) no source documents to write an non-fictional account from.Do *you* take notes of your houseguests' visits just in case future generations might be interested?In the end, this book is the accustomed Sobel experience. It's solidly researched, extensively bibliographized, compendiously endnoted, and charmingly written. It was a pleasure to read. In Walker & Co's capable production and design hands, it's also lovely to look at and easy to read. Bloomsbury, their corporate parent, pays attention to the effect of design on the reading experience, and as a result, the books they publish are always worthy of a moment's reflection and appreciation as objects. So rare in today's world....Very much recommended for history buffs, science readers, and Sobelians like me."
1,0802717934,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793473-clif-hostetler,4,"This is the story of Nicolaus Copernicus and how his book, De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium (On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres) revolutionized astronomy. There are two facts about Copernicus that I found astounding. First, astronomy was his hobby not his occupation. Second, his book was almost NOT published.His job as church canon meant that he worked full time with responsibilities that included tasks such as administering church farm rental lands, negotiating peace terms with the Teutonic Knights and responding to unreasonable demands from his Bishop while acting in the role of physician. Somehow he found time to observe and record locations of the stars, planets, moon and sun. (He apparently didn't need much sleep.) He also combed through early Greek and Roman astronomical records and compared them with observations of his day. Then he applied his math skills to discover that they followed patterns that coordinated with a hypothetical model of the planets, including the earth, orbiting the sun while the earth rotated on a tilted axis and the moon rotated around the earth.He apparently experienced his epiphany regarding heliocentrism in about 1510 and shared his idea with others by way of letters and distributing a sketchy outline. Over the next three decades he continued to collect astronomical observations and perfected his calculations, but refused of publish his theory in a book. This biography of Copernicus seems to suggest the reason for his reticence to publish was his fear of objections from the church and critical scrutiny from other astronomers. I personally picked up an impression of an alternative reason; that he was simply busy with other responsibilities and procrastinated on writing his book.Then, in 1539, a young enigmatic mathematician and aspiring astrologer hamed Rheticus showed up at Copernicus’s door and begged him to publish a book about his heliocentric theory. Apparently Rheticus refused to take no for an answer. For the next couple years Rheticus somehow cajoled Copernicus to collect together his astronomical data and calculations and write his book about the movements of the ""Celestial Spheres."" In 1542 Rheticus delivered the manuscript to a printer of scientific books.Copernicus suffered a stroke soon after finishing the manuscript and was in a partial coma for a number of months. Copernicus died on the same day that the first printed copy of the book was delivered and placed in his hands. One can't help but wonder if he had any idea what a significant contribution he had made to the advancement of science.I found it interesting how the author, Dava Sobel, managed to turn the available information about Copernicus into a book length story. The problem is that most of the surviving documentation regarding Copernicus’ life are business and accounting types of documents which frankly aren’t very interesting and have nothing to do with astronomy. He left no diary describing the details of his epiphany when he first thought of the heliocentric model. And there is no detailed descriptions of how Rheticus managed to talk Copernicus into writing his book. Dava Sobel’s clever solution was to imagine a fictional rendering of the Copernicus/Rheticus encounter and inserted it as Part Two into this book. Her dramatization was written in play/drama format which makes it quite distinctive from the prose of the nonfiction narrative contained in parts one and three of the book. This approach helps the reader to distinguish the fictional part from the nonfiction. I think this approach was well done and managed to convey emotion and setting more clearly than if the book had been all nonfiction narrative. Part One of the book describes Copernicus’ life. Part Three describes the reactions to his book, includes a description of Rheticus’ life, and tells of the later actions of Galileo and Kepler to advance and improve on the details of the heliocentric model.There were contemporaries of Copernicus who agreed that the heliocentric model correctly described the movement of planets and earth. But only Copernicus could published a book that carried convincing credibility because he was the only one who had combined his lifetime of astronomical observations with mathematical calculations to develop tables and formulas that could be used to predict future movements based on the heliocentric model."
2,0802717934,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5650849-alan,3,"Very readable, and chocked with info on Copernicus's life as a Canon in Varmia on the Baltic, after study at U of Krakow, and at least two Italian universities--Bologna (canon law) and Padova (medicine). Copernicus ended up a physician who made his living as a political appointee (canon) at Varmia Cathedral, appointed by the literal nepotism of his uncle the Bishop. But I found the play, ""Interplay,"" inserted in the middle of the book a problem--a fictional account of Copernicus and his Protestant fan and assistant Rheticus, as well as a few others. Perhaps it should have been attached at the end of the book; it would be less damaging, less intrusive, so. Sobel makes just enough non-specialist mistakes to please this specialist. For example, on her very first page she refers to horoscopes and ""birth certtificates"" though they were not used until 1837 in the UK. No idea when in Poland. Of course, the whole thing in the Renaissance was baptism; we have Shakespeare's baptismal day, NOT his birthday, which no-one knows, though everyone celebrates it. (A typical event in popular culture.) I once heard Dava Sobel at Seagrave Observatory west of Providence, RI, where I had also spoken on Giordano Bruno after my Harvard Astrophysics talk. (Google ""Giordano Bruno Harvard Video."") Preparing for that talk, I read most of Copernicus's De Revolutionibus in English, found I could only solve one of his problems in geometry, because they were spherical geometry. My great HS geometry teacher, Miss Parkman (Classical HS, Springfield, MA) prepared me so well I aced the math SATs, beat the future M.I.T. students in her class, though not in calculus the next year."
3,0802717934,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1466146-wayne,5,"Dava Sobel spoke at the Sydney Writers' Festival last weekabout her latest wonderful book.She and the interviewer also performed two excerpts from her playof the conversation between Copernicus the Polish Catholic Astronomer cleric and Rheticus the young German Lutheran Mathematician who had visited Copernicus to urge him to publish and be damned.This brief play forms part of this novel.Dava played Rheticus who as a believer of astrology got some hefty trouncing from his Scientific Better.It was a wonderful, witty, informative dialogue which held you with its drama of exposition and dawning of the light.It turned out that Copernicus was right for the wrong reasons. He used reason alone rather than also adding the necessary but arduous empirical course of collecting data which could go on for years. Have recently read ""Descartes' Bones"" by Russell Shorto, about another philosopher who turned Western Thought on its head,and unwittingly, for all these Great Scientists were solid Christians,who ironically opened up an increasing gap between Reason and Faith,as Theology became less and less relevant in the dialogue about the Universe.Descartes caused my own personal crisis as a young theologising monkwho soon abandoned Theology as so much gobbldeygook, and took up history, science, philosophy and good literature as a surer guidere ""How is One to Live?"".I found the crass conception of a ""Holy Trinity in One God"" simply the shortest thing on ethical substance I have yet encountered. Being poor, I am waiting for the paperback of this book to come out before I purchase it.""All things come to those who wait"",claimed Milton.I'm not so sure about that, but it can be a comfort.And surely will cause a modicum of Character Development,don't you think???P.S. I bought myself the hardback for my Birthday. I hope it was my Lust for Knowledge that made me give in, but I was never unhappy, not even once, when I read another Dava Sobel Classic!!!And as you can see I have awarded this latest from Dava Sobel 5 STARS!   "
4,0802717934,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40823165-yibbie,1," I made it about halfway through this book. Even before the scene that made me quit, I was considering quitting. The description I had of this book never let on that huge sections of this book are fiction. To be specific they are drafts of the author’s play about Copernicus. Even in the non-play sections, the author quoted a novel to fill a gap in the official record. Then the author’s insistence on including the astrological readings for everything was odd because she constantly had to tell us that Copernicus didn’t believe in it.  I did like the section that combined the political history and Copernicus’ business records. I thought that was a very interesting method.  While the non-fiction section made his moral failings quite plain, the play went way beyond that. It delved deeper into a fellow mathematician’s depravity. The language there was also fouler than in the rest of the book. That was when I quit. "
5,0802717934,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30734957-b-rbara,3,"I have mixed feelings about this book. While it was well written and overall well researched, it contained a lot of details that weren't that interesting, and I had to force myself slightely to keep reading through some of it. So I enjoyed it but wasn't crazy about it. I would recommend only for people who are trully interested in the person of Copernicus himself rather than astrology."
6,0802717934,http://goodreads.com/user/show/457745-emily-lakdawalla,3,"As with her previous two books Longitude and Galileo's Daughter, Dava Sobel draws heavily on primary sources for her latest book, A More Perfect Heaven: How Copernicus Revolutionized the Cosmos. With lengthy quotes from personal letters and contemporary records, Sobel paints a picture in words of the life and times of a man whose work literally produced a revolution, changing the static, immovable Earth to one that spun and revolved around the Sun at the center of the cosmos. Sobel's work is challenging, because the very few extant letters that are known to have been written by Copernicus (only 17 of them) do not provide quite enough for her to establish much empathy between the reader and the central characters. The letters that do exist are mostly very formal. By providing a lot of historical context, Sobel shows how important a role the political and religious upheavals of Copernicus' time played in to his decision to delay publishing his work until close to the end of his life. Copernicus was a contemporary of Luther, so his life played out against the backdrop of religious revolution. Georg Rheticus, who assisted the Catholic Copernicus in preparing On the Revolutions for eventual publication, was a young Lutheran, yet the book was eventually dedicated to the Pope. It's a fascinating story but also drier and less emotional, with more Machiavellian princes in various important roles, than Sobel's previous books. The book's formal and occasionally dry story is interrupted at the moment that Rheticus appears on Copernicus' doorstep. In between Part One, in which we see how Copernicus came to his new understanding of the cosmos, and Part Three, in which we see how his work was finally published just before his death, there is a two-act play dramatizing the crucial few months in which Rheticus and Copernicus collaborated. It's an unusual device that I must admit I viewed rather skeptically as I approached the book, but I found that the play succeeded. Although Sobel based the play on some established facts, it's clearly a work of historical fiction, with wholly invented dialogue and character voices. The device provides her with a way to speculate about what sorts of characters these men and women were, driven by what sorts of emotions. At the same time, the play is clearly, structurally separate from the more formally correct history that bookends it. And I must say that, having encountered the play, I found myself much more empathetic to the history's characters in Part Three than I had been in Part One. I should note that I didn't actually read this book; I listened to it in its audiobook format while driving to and from Goldstone. I don't customarily listen to audiobooks so I can't compare it to other productions but I did think this one was very good. The narrator's enunciation was crisp and clear across all of the Latinate words and eastern European surnames and place names. More importantly, when it came time for the play, they cast the six characters with six different actors with distinctive voices, with stage direction read by the book's narrator, making the action very easy to follow. I did find the narration too slow, but speeding it up by a factor of 1.5 solved that problem neatly. A More Perfect Heaven places Copernicus' life into a historical context that I hadn't appreciated before. To whom would I recommend it? I'm sure people interested in the history of science would enjoy it, but beyond that, I think people interested in European history at the beginning of the Reformation would find in this story a new and illuminating angle. It is, however, not as accessible as either Galileo's Daughter or Longitude. And my editor has asked me to warn parents that there are some adult themes discussed in the book, never very explicit but most prominent in the action of the play. She said it should probably have a PG-13 rating. I wouldn't give it to a kid under 13 anyway; but thinking back to myself as a high school senior science nerd taking modern European history, it would certainly have added dimension to my study of a subject that I found tedious. To me, history was all about various rich princes squabbling like children, and I had a hard time understanding why I should care. Copernicus' story, set against the backdrop of the machinations in Europe in the beginning of the 16th century, would have given me reason to pay attention!"
7,0802717934,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37690097-ahmed-r-rashwan,4,"How long I have set aside the Copernican Revolution, only to read it now, renewing my vows with Astronomy. It brings great delight and happiness to my heart reading about the man who is most probably the most important and influencing to my most beloved subject.Copernicus did not only revolutionize the Cosmos, he revolutionized our perspective, how we view ourselves in this world. He is the messiah that delivered us from our self-centered beliefs and our ego-centric point of view of ourselves, and provided us with a universe that dwarfed us. Although the true vastness of our world was not even imagined by Copernicus himself, but the one he had imagined, one that was a billion times smaller, still took us from Gods to mere grains of sand in an endless desert.I can never thank Dava Sobel enough for writing this book and bringing Nicolaus Copernicus to life in the way that she did. Besides the extremely informative, thoroughly researched and passionately written biography of the magnificent character of Copernicus, those around him, and the surrounding areas that encompassing the politics, economics and science of the time, Sobel provides us with a splendidly delightful fictional and beautifully imaginative interplay sandwiched between before and after Copernicus' final moments. At first I was unsure about the play, as it is so clearly fictional (although Sobel had made a point to insert not only actual facts but actual direct quotations from the characters involved, obtained either from their writing or letters) but it proved, after completing it that it was such a beautiful rendition and visualization of what could have possibly been said or had taken place; by the end, I happily allowed Sobel the creative license needed to bring Copernicus' story to life.Historical biographies of such massive characters are always so tricky, having experienced several of them, I expected to perhaps find the same flaws I often found in others within this genre. But Dava Sobel excelled beyond all my expectations; if there ever was a book that perfectly displayed how a historical biography should be written, it is this masterpiece of a book that should be set as the candidate. There is never a moment where you are confused about a person's role or importance in history, or the years in which significant events take place or where in time you were currently placed.Almost as important as the man Copernicus, it is the aftermath his theories created that is equally crucial and is equally expanded on by Sobel. Thinking that the book would be boring after Copernicus' departing, I was pleasantly incorrect in my assumption and was just as amused and attracted to the men that followed in the steps of the great man and further enlarged the universe he had discovered. Perhaps it is now, more than ever, that a voices and convictions as Copernicus, Kepler and Galileo possessed are needed. Men who stand up to what they believe in their hearts is right, regardless of how adamant the majority of our race are towards a certain opinion or belief; men who have the will to dedicate their entire lives towards a certain goal, and what more magical goal can one have than literally reaching for the stars. Beautiful book."
8,0802717934,http://goodreads.com/user/show/283014-jennifer-jc-s,4,"‘The motions of the planets captured Copernicus’s interest from the start of his university studies.’Nicolaus Copernicus (19 February 1473 – 24 May 1543), a Polish mathematician and astronomer, was the first person to formulate a comprehensive heliocentric astronomical model of our solar system. In this book, Ms Sobel provides a biography of Copernicus together with a history of the development of his heliocentric astronomical model. Copernicus was working during a period of change in Europe: the relatively gradual move from the medieval period to the renaissance was accompanied by the more dramatic (and bloody) events of the Protestant Reformation and the Peasant Rebellion, as well as warfare with the Teutonic Knights and the Ottoman Turks.There are three parts to this book: in Part One Ms Sobel presents how Copernicus came to his view of the cosmos; Part Two is a two act play dramatizing the few months of collaboration between Copernicus and his student Georg Joachim von Lauchen (16 February 1514 – 4 December 1574) (known as Rheticus); and Part Three presents the publication of Copernicus’s work just before his death.‘With his book virtually complete by 1535, Copernicus lost courage. He worried that his laboured calculations and tables would not yield the perfect match with planetary positions that he had aimed to achieve.’Understanding the times in which Copernicus lived goes a long way towards explaining why he hesitated to publish his work. Copernicus occupied a privileged but relatively precarious position as a canon at Frauenberg cathedral: privileged because of the income it afforded him but precarious because of marauding Teutonic knights and the rapidly spreading Lutheran ‘heresy’. Ms Sobel brings aspects of this hesitation to life, in the form of a play - an imagined dialogue between Copernicus and Rheticus, who met Copernicus just four years before Copernicus died.‘No one knows what the brilliant, fervent young Rheticus said when he accosted the elderly, beleaguered Copernicus in Frauenberg. It is safe to assume he did not laugh at the idea of the earth in motion.’Ms Sobel’s play builds on the history and background established in the earlier chapters of the work and breathes life into Copernicus and Rheticus by allowing both Copernicus and Rheticus to express their views and concerns directly. I admit that I did not expect this technique to be as effective as it was. While reading the play isn’t essential to appreciate Copernicus’s life and work, it’s interesting to speculate on the content of the conversations between the two men.Those who want more detailed information about Copernicus’s scientific work will not find it here. Readers primarily interested in Copernicus’s life, and the period in which he lived, should find this book interesting reading. Ms Sobel includes some quotes from Copernicus’s writings which share his thoughts directly with us. We know that Copernicus documented his work extensively; I wonder how much of this documentation still exists, and where?Jennifer Cameron-Smith"
9,0802717934,http://goodreads.com/user/show/782114-nathan-albright,4,"My feelings about this book and the author's approach are somewhat complicated and ambivalent.  On the one hand, the book does a good job at presenting the known facts of the life of Copernicus and the way in which he was able to thrive in the morally lax and somewhat corrupt world of pre-Tridentine Roman Catholicism.  On the other hand, this book is an uncomfortable mix of fact and fiction, as the author includes an early version of her play ""And The Sun Stood Still"" in the middle of this book as her way of bridging the gap between what is known to have happened from documentary evidence and what may have accounted for what happened.  Likewise, the adulation given to Copernicus for his idea of the earth moving around the sun doesn't account for the fact that the sun moves around the Milky Way at high speeds and the Milky Way itself moves around a center of gravity in the complex relationship of galaxies within the local group, and the author does not discuss any of these matters of astrophysics.  This is, in other words, a generally good book with genuinely interesting content, but also a book that has a definite and not necessarily benign agenda and an uncomfortable place between fact and fiction.The contents of this book take up a bit more than 200 pages and are divided between three parts.  The first of the book is a prelude to Copernicus' revolution in astronomy (II), with a discussion about his early life and family background and his first published work, a translation of various amorous writings (1), his brief sketch of his ideas (2), his work in dealing with the leases of abandoned farmlands in the area under the control of the diocese for whom he was a minor religious official (3), his writings on the methods minting money (4), his letter against another astronomy named Werner (5), and his efforts to deal with supply and demand for bread in the area (6).  After this comes the rough draft of the two acts of the author's play ""And The Sun Stood Still (II).  The rest of the book consists of six chapters that deal with the aftermath of the publication of Copernicus' views (III) including chapters on the first account by Rheticus (who was a somewhat itinerant soul and one accused of pederasty during his teaching career) (7), the first edition of Copernicus' work and its prologue by Osiander (8), the publication of the Basel edition (9), various epitomes and tables that were used even as the main idea of the book was rejected by most (10), Galileo's writings on the two systems (11), and an annotated census of Copernicus' De Revolutionibus (12).  When reading this book, though, it is easy for the writer to be filled with a strong sense of mixed emotions about the work.  On the one hand, it is easy to celebrate Copernicus' achievement in conceiving the heliocentric theory, but it is less easy to celebrate the immorality and corruption of his life even as one appreciates his obvious intellect and his interest in a variety of problems relating to economics and science.  The same is true of his disciple Rheticus, whose persistence in seeking out Copernicus at some risk to himself is noble and worthwhile, but whose (likely) moral failings are impossible to justify in terms of his abuse of wealth and power to gratify his own selfish and abominable lusts.  If the author appears to indicate that Copernicus' developments were to lead to a more perfect heaven, the fact that his more accurate planetary charts were mainly used by astrologers and the moral failings of most of the people involved demonstrate that no such moral improvement was happening on earth.  Perhaps the author does not think that the moral aspects matter when compared to the advances in scientific understanding, but that is not a view I am willing to endorse."
10,0802717934,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1175951-matt,3,"A fine read about Copernicus.First and foremost, it paints a clear portrayal of the forces Copernicus faced in the Europe of his time: the tensions between Catholic and Protestant forces, small and large powers; the nature of scientific inquiry in the day; the blurred line between astrology and astronomy; and above all, Copernicus's hesitancy to publish, given fears over the public reaction.Copernicus did his best to avoid controversy, but there was no pretty much no chance he could both publish and avoid scrutiny from the Church. He even dedicated his book to the Pope when he did finally publish his findings as he was near death. But the Bible offers a passage indicating that Joshua commanded the Sun to stand still, and only the Holy Fathers of the Church were empowered to probe the meaning of these passages. Sure enough, In 1616, a panel of theologians deemed the ""quiescence of the Sun in the center of the world"" to be ""formally heretical"" because it contradicted Scripture. They further found the heliocentric universe philosophically ""foolish and absurd"".It's also amazing to imagine that only 400 years ago, the science elite in Europe still publicly believed the arrangement of the stars on the day of their birth could predict the fate of their lives. But that's the way it was.So needless to say, it captures the spirit of the day.Capturing Copernicus The Man was a more monumental task. His lifetime of correspondence comes down to just seventeen surviving letters. Sobel does a good job throughout to be clear about what might aspects of his character we can be more certain of, and what items we can only speculate about. The most interesting strategy the author takes on is to turn the middle third into a play, essentially the author's imagined characterization of Copernicus and interaction with others, particularly his student Rheticus. I'm still not sure how I feel about this decision, but it made for easy and somewhat memorable reading."

13,0802717934,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3213193-jason-golomb,4,"Dava Sobels' ""A More Perfect Heaven"" is a biography of Polish mathematician and astronomer Nicholas Copernicus, a history of the development of his theory of a sun-centric solar system, and an engaging look into a Europe on the cusp of transitioning from a dark and paranoid medieval society to an enlightened and brighter renaissance future. While the focus of Sobels' work is her history of Copernicus the man, his science and mathematics, Sobels' biggest victory is her fictionalized drama of how Copernicus' only student, Rheticus, eventually convinced Copernicus to complete his work and share his theory and proofs of a sun-centric universe with the world. I was reticent when I read that Sobel had included a dramatic play smack in the middle of her history. First, I've found plays difficult to read and couldn't imagine how it could seamlessly integrate into Sobels' work. Second...what? A play? In the middle of a history? But it worked. It worked very well as a matter of fact. Sobels' play imagines the interactions between Rheticus, a young mathematics professor from Wittenberg, home of Martin Luther and the Protestant Reformation, and Copernicus in Poland. There's not a lot of action in the drama, so the dialogue-focused interplay successfully blends the historical characterizations into a very believable situation. Sobel peppers the preceding chapters with enough background on medieval Europe of the time as well as the participating characters that the 75 pages or so of the play work extremely well. Surrounding the drama, Sobel serves heaping spoonfuls of a heavily religious dark ages Poland, and medieval astronomy. She best summarizes the dramatic events surrounding Copernicus' work: ""The bold plan for astronomical reform that Copernicus conceived and then nurtured over decades in his spare time struck him as the blueprint for the 'marvelous symmetry of the universe'...He proceeded cautiously, first leaking the idea to a few fellow mathematicians, never trying to proselytize. All the while real and bloody revolutions -- the Protestant Reformation, the Peasant Rebellion, warfare with the Teutonic Knights and the Ottoman Turks -- churned around him. There are two elements of Copernicus' being that particularly impressed me. First, he was an extraordinarily literate man. Some of the quotes that Sobel includes in her book paint him in a uniquely poetic light. He wrote, for example, ""Among the many various literary and artistic pursuits upon which the natural talents of man are nourished, I think the ones above all to be embraced and pursued with the most loving care concern the most beautiful and worthy objects, most deserving to be known. This is the nature of the discipline that deal with the god-like circular movement of the world and the course of the stars."" Second, Copernicus was an extremely detail-oriented individual. If the devil is in the details, then Copernicus, who was schooled in religion and lived in a very religiously oriented society, took that term to heart. Documentation still exists with the exhaustive notations he made while tracking and diagnosing the heavens, as well as his more earth-bound pursuits as an administrator for the Polish government/church. I've read about Galileo before and have always been utterly amazed at the patience and discipline it requires to track the course of the stars and heavenly bodies over the course of years. To remain doggedly at watch every single day, through wars, illness and weather, to gather such a wealth of detailed data reflects tremendous patience, focus and perhaps more than a little obsession. The following was written in an 1878 publication of `Popular Astronomy', ""The great merit of Copernicus, and the basis of his claim to the discovery in question, is that he was not satisfied with a mere statement of his views, but devoted a large part of the labor of a life to the demonstration, and thus laced them in such a light as to render their ultimate acceptance inevitable."" Copernicus first wrote on his concept of a sun-centered universe in 1510, over 30 years before he would finally find the courage and confidence to publish his full ""On the Revolutions."" His initial conclusions, Sobel writes, were reached through ""intuition and mathematics. No astronomical observations were required."" Copernicus wrote, ""All spheres surround the Sun as though it were in the middle of all of them, and therefore the center of the universe is near the Sun. What appear to us as motions of the Sun arise not from its motion but from the motion of the Earth and our sphere, with which we revolve about the Sun like any other planet."" Sobel writes that ""with a wave of his hand, (Copernicus) had made the Earth a planet and set it spinning."" So what was Copernicus doing between 1510 and the publishing of his great work (and his death) in 1543, and why was he unable to be part of his work's impact on the world? The spread of Lutheranism had great impact by creating a wide religious schism, spreading fear and limiting Copernicus' comfort in publishing his work. He was a very practical man and very attuned to the tone of church and politics, and how closely connected they were. Sobel writes, ""With his book virtually complete by 1535, Copernicus lost courage. He worried that his labored calculations and tables would not yield the perfect match with planetary positions that he had aimed to achieve. He feared the public reaction. He empathized with the ancient sage Pythagoras, who had communicated his most beautiful ideas only to kinsmen and friends, and only by word of mouth. Despite the decade of effort invested in the text, Copernicus eschewed publication. If his theory appeared in print, he said, he would be laughed off the stage."" So during this time, he took a whole lot of astronomical measurements. There was not an eclipse, full moon, or shift in the position of the stars that Copernicus missed and documented. He was building his case that the Earth spun, and it and the other planets revolved around the Sun. Copernicus was also a relatively highly placed administrator in the Polish government/church. Sobel points to extant documents that show his judgements in various cases regarding local law and commerce. Naturally, everything he touched was exhaustively detailed. He was also a well-known and respected mathematician. Pope Leo X called on theologians and astronomers to help correct the flaws in the Julian calendar that were pushing Christian holidays further and further from their traditional timeframes. Historical documents confirm Copernicus' role in helping to correct the calendar, but there exists nothing more specific. Sobel concludes that, ""He held off publishing his theory for so long that when his great book, 'On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres', finally appeared in print, its author breathed his last. Copernicus never heard any of the criticism, or acclaim, that attended 'On the Revolutions.' Decades after his death, when the first telescopic discoveries lent credence to his intuitions, the Holy Office of the Inquisition condemned his efforts...The philosophical conflict and change in perception that his ideas engendered are sometimes referred to as the Copernican Revolution."" Sobels' book is enjoyable. Her narrative approach to writing history addresses the nuanced details important in a serious work, while maintaining readability throughout. There are stretches of dry writing where Copernicus orbits the political, religious and military intrigue of Middle Ages Poland. This is a relatively minor complaint of Sobels' tightly written history. And don't fear the authors' fiction. It reads terrifically well while incorporating humor, history and believability. "

I read this to see if this would be a good fit to add into my oldest son's Astronomy unit (homeschool). I think he would enjoy it. I would have liked a bit more on Copernicus' astronomy research. The book was rather enjoyable though."
15,0802717934,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7665938-bethany,2,"This book is weird. There are three “sections”. First is the minutiae the author could dig up about Copernicus. Basically a grocery list out of context. The second part is a stage play, where the author took a lot of liberty with conjecture. The third part is the spread of Copernicus’ ideas. The third section is the only redeeming part of the book. "

Then it dissolved into a soap opera of a play peopled by caricatures with unbelievable motives. Very disappointed. I picked this book up with an interest in science. I really haven't been rewarded.Part 3 redeems it slightly with a followation of astronomical developments. 
17,0802717934,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2171826-tyler-jones,0,"Like many people, my interest in Copernicus has everything to do with my interest in how authority tries to silence or control science in order to serve its own interests. Dava Sobel is the perfect author for people like me - she presents everything in human terms; Copernicus's relationship with his housekeeper is given attention, as his professionalism when filling his duties as a physician. These details, in addition to a play inserted midway through the text, go a long way in bringing Copernicus to life. "
18,0802717934,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3521339-bob,5,"Dava Sobel, author of Longitude and Galileo's Daughter, has taken on another important figure from the Scientific Revolution, Nicholas Copernicus. Sobel's book is unique in that the most dramatic part of Copernicus' life, the writing and publishing of his work ""On the Revolution of the Heavenly Spheres"" which laid out his heliocentric theory of the solar system, is presented as a drama. It is a daring choice and it is one that works well.Copernicus was born in Poland, educated in Italy, and worked nearly all of his life in a part of Poland that would become a part of Prussia. Officially, he was a church canon, an administrative official for a Catholic diocese. However, Copernicus was skilled in many fields. Besides astronomy, Copernicus wrote on economics, medicine, and poetry. But, astronomy was what made him famous. Even if he never knew he was going to be famous because of it.Copernicus formulated his heliocentric fairly early in his life, but he was afraid to publish his findings. Part of this was that the idea was considered so revolutionary, that he would be subjected to ridicule. However, he spent countless nights over decades making meticulous observations. He crunched numbers. There was no doubt. The earth was moving. The sun wasn't. Nothing else made sense.When Copernicus was in his sixties, a young German mathematician named Rheticus paid him a visit. Somehow, Rheticus was able to persuade Copernicus to publish his life work. (A bishop in a neighboring diocese had encouraged Copernicus to do the same also.)Just how did Rheticus persuade Copernicus? We don't know for sure, but Sobel speculates in the books ""interplay."" For about 40 pages, Sobel inserts a brief two act play involving Copernicus, Rheticus, two local bishops, Copernicus' housekeeper (and mistress), and a bishop's young assistant (who has a homosexual dalliance with Rheticus). While the play may seem somewhat hokey, it actually works well. The historical figures seem more alive. Sobel may create dialog, but she is not creating ideas. Copernicus indeed did have an affair with his housekeeper. Rheticus would later be run out of teaching job for improper conduct toward a young male student. Copernicus had to be talked into publishing his ideas. Rheticus had the youthful energy (and publishing connections) to publish Copernicus' work.Copernicus suffered a debilitating stroke shortly after Rheticus left him. Legend has it that a paralyzed Copernicus received a copy of the book shortly before he died. In the end, the world benefited from the bold ideas of Copernicus and the persuasion of a young German mathematician named Rheticus."

20,0802717934,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7724585-callie-leuck,2,"I should preface this review by saying that I read this book for a class and am probably not the intended audience; I probably would not have picked it up on my own. I admire Dava Sobel for taking a risk and trying something new here. This is a nonfiction biography surrounding a fictional play. The play is Dava Sobel's imagining of a key moment in Copernicus' life: when someone convinces him to write and publish his heliocentric-universe idea. I greatly enjoyed the play and would love to see it performed. I did not enjoy the nonfiction biography, which seemed a bit dry and full of information unrelated to Copernicus's astronomy research. Other people in my class felt exactly the opposite, enjoying the nonfiction biography and disliking the play.This is a book that should be approached with an open mind. It did not strike a chord with me, but I can see how other people might greatly enjoy it. I did come away with a strong appreciation for the writer and an interest in reading some of her other works."
21,0802717934,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2860188-eduardo-santiago,4,"Not as enjoyable as Longitude or Galileo's Daughter. The play-within-a-play-biography gimmick didn't really work well for me. Still, four stars because I really did develop a strong feeling for that time period. It can't be easy: we live in a world where heliocentrism is a fundamental tenet, known and understood since we're old enough to say “mama.” We can't really imagine what it was like when this wasn't understood. Sobel does a great job conveying the zeitgeist.(Side rant: Why oh why do I read books like this? Religious idiots squelching knowledge and doing their best to crush intelligent souls. I get that kind of news every day already. It's exasperating to see how little we've grown.)"
22,0802717934,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6414284-vince,4,"An interesting combination of history and fiction. Sobel covers Copernicus' life in the first 1/3 of the book and part of the last third. Most of the last third is devoted to devoted assistant Joachim Rheticus, who was largely responsible for the publication of Copernicus book 'On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres', and the astronomers who followed his work (esp. Brahe, Kepler and Galileo), and the continuing influence it has today. The middle third of the book includes a play about Copernicus written by Sobel. A seemingly odd inclusion in a non-fiction text, but it does serve to get a better feel for the times in which Copernicus lived. To get the most out of the play I recommend the audio version of 'A More Perfect Heaven' since it is capably dramatized by a fine group of audio ""actors"". The print version is lushly illustrated however, with many maps diagrams of the heavens and period portraits of some of the main historical personae. Like me, you may want to have access to both versions to get the most out of it."
23,0802717934,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37541875-beth,4,"Sobel has done extensive research as usual. Not that easy to make the life of Nicolas Copernicus interesting - the über maths geek of his time. You get the impression of a man with a fairly humdrum external life whilst in private he was meticulously calculating mathematical, astronomical truths that would alter humanity's perception of itself and our earth forever. Sobel also portrays the real fear of exposing this controversial truth against a background of religious fundamentalism that was already paranoid about the rise of Protestantism. Plus ça change. This might be a tough read without some background knowledge of Copernicus' work and the era in which he lived but a Wikipedia read should probably cover it. "
24,0802717934,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59252999-roo-phillips,2,"1.5 stars maybe. Readable, but only just. Sobel's ability to find and quote primary sources is spectacular. The problem is, that is all she does. Any sort of narrative, direction, or thesis is completely lost in the tedious details. Too much quoting of letters from seemingly random people and about peripherally ""significant"" events. There is very little original thought from Sobel. It literally is almost entirely made up of excerpts from letters and reports written to and from people that lived around Copernicus throughout his life. Only in the very last pages does Sobel try and give any meaning to Copernicus' work, but only through discussions on Brahe and Keppler."
25,0802717934,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2148115-lydia,2,"Ha, well, as it turns out, the life of Copernicus was pretty ordinary. I expected more storytelling from Dava Sobel. I loved Galileo's Daughter and Longitude, but this I just couldn't get into. It feels like the whole book is ""look at what an ordinary guy Copernicus is"".I guess it is nice to know that Famous People of Science still have to deal with the mundane things of life, at any rate."
26,0802717934,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25353295-carmen,1,"One of the most boring books I have ever read. There is a play (by the author) in the middle. Originally, she wanted to publish the play. But her editor told her she had to flesh it out with more data. Big mistake. Super-boring.

27,0802717934,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1444658-charlie,4,Part one was about the life of a visionary who possessed great faith in the church.

33,0802717934,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81232236-k,3,"I’ve really liked other books by Dava Sobel, but this bio of Copernicus just didn’t do it for me. I found it very hard to follow on a scientific/technical basis, almost nothing about him as an intellectual, and strange conjecture about his personal life. It wasn’t enough of anything, I guess. Still, it’s an engaging book and provides an opening insight on a hugely important person in science history.The lack of information is, of course, somewhat attributable to the lack of actual direct information about Copernicus himself, who lived in the 15th and 16th centuries in what is now Poland but was controlled by the Prussian king at the time. Sobel writes that 17 letters in the handwriting of Copernicus are all that remain, and many of those are about mundane administrative work he did for the church. There’s almost nothing available that gives insight into his thinking – except his published works, of course. And yet, the works are so clear-headed that it seems the author could have teased more out of them analytically. I was struck, for example, by the wonderfully clear writing of Copernicus in his “Brief Sketch,” published in 1510, some 30 years before he went public in a big way on his ideas. Sobel covers the “Brief Sketch” early in the book, but I would have liked a full chapter treatment of it, and from more angles. The discussion of his more famous “On the Revolutions of Heavenly Spheres,” covered near the end of the book because it was written at the end of his life, similarly gets short treatment. In fact, of the six books that made up “Heavenly Spheres,” it seems that Sobel discusses only part of one book – the most revolutionary (pun intended) part.Then there are the digressions on issues such as Copernicus living with a housekeeper who was probably his lover. As a Catholic churchman, this was officially frowned up, and Sobel has letters indicating the displeasure that was expressed to Copernicus on this. But it doesn’t seem to relate to anything else in the book. If the book wanted to really cover his life, then that’s fine. I’d like to know how he had the time to be one of the world’s great astronomers while also handling duties of a canon and physician and even as a negotiator in times of war. I guess without letters, it’s hard to say if Copernicus resented time away from the star-gazing and calculating, or if he found one to be a relief from the other. As a final note, there’s a bizarre middle section of this book in which Sobel has written a play purely from her imagination in which the aging Copernicus is visited by Rheticus (seems like a fictional name, but it was actually given to a real person), who convinces him to put his ideas down in a formal, detailed argument. Historians know this really did happen – remarkable. But to have this strange play, which begins like a Jane Austen novel with a person shivering in the cold and rain in a doorway at night near-death, well it’s weird. And when Sobel throws into it a homosexual affair by Rheticus with a servant (based on the reality that Rheticus years later was accused of homosexuality and fled a university where he was teaching), well, what’s the point? I understand that this thought-experiment of a play was the motivating force behind writing the biography, but still, it’s not necessary. I would have rather had 40 more pages in a traditional biography or the author covering more about how Copernicus went about his work, or more on his discoveries."
34,0802717934,http://goodreads.com/user/show/504424-bup,4,"Well-written, and interesting, but there were some major challenges in writing Copernicus' biography:There isn't a whole lot of original source material.Copernicus went out of his way to not make waves. He made one of the biggest scientific breakthroughs of all time, but didn't publish so as to not offend his employer, the church.He probably escaped more unwanted attention by living at the same time as Martin Luther, who was an even bigger threat to the establishment.He had his famous insight early in his life. Once you've written about the stunning imagination and intelligence it took to realize that the earth is another one of those things called 'wanderers' or 'planets' (or its converse, that they are bodies like the earth), that the earth is spinning at 1000 miles per hour and moving around the sun at some magnitude of speed higher than that, but we can't feel it against all common sense, and that the sun is the thing at the center of the system, and done that in chapter two, what do you do for the rest of the book?Sobel decided to fill in a lot with a thirty scene play about how things might have played out when a mathematician named Rheticus showed up to learn from Copernicus and probably became the one to convince him to publish his theory/model, which only happened as he was dying. It's a pretty jarring change, but I guess did a good job of communicating that how all this stuff played out is speculation.After that, we learn about his legacy, and the legacy of the book. All very interesting stuff, so I give it four stars, but nevertheless came off at times as padding (fascinating padding) because we don't know enough about his life to make a book-length biography."
35,0802717934,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6942304-david-vidaurre,4,"The story of Copernicus and Kepler from the XVI century is oddly relevant in the USA of the XXI century. These great men followed the facts to their ultimate conclusion, even though the facts did not agree with their beliefs or even the accepted common sense of the time. They put scientific honesty and facts above dogma, something that is very rare in this age when people are willfully ignorant and proud of their ignorance and label anything they don't agree with as ""fake"".Also interesting is the life of Copernicus himself, who is claimed by both Poles and Germans. In a time when nationality was secondary to regional and even local loyalties, this controversy is only a modern occurrence. The author of the book comes unambiguously on the German side and I think the facts are clear that Copernicus was mostly German. Even though the nationality of his father is disputable, his mother was definitely German, his lover Anna Shilling was German, his best friend Tiedeman Giese was German and his only pupil Johannes Rheticus was German. Most importantly all that he ever wrote was in either Latin or German. It's hard to argue that Copernicus was Polish other than to point out that city of his birth had passed to the Kingdom of Poland seven years before, but was still a German speaking town.Overall this little book is well worth the time to read it, although I think the play that the author includes as a filler would have been better left off."
36,0802717934,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5530529-steven,4,"Having read Galileo's Daughter and Longitude, I was prepared to enjoy this book, and I did. It opened my eyes to the life of Nicolaus Copernicus. Ms. Sobel transports the reader back to Copernicus' time, and you'll understand his life and struggles to the extent the remaining documentation allows. Also, you'll see the aftermath of his then-revolutionary theory, its effect on those who came afterward.My only criticisms of this fine book are minor. Ms. Sobel inserts, without explanation, the dialogue of a play in the middle of the book. Although her play is interesting, and is well performed by the Recorded Books narrators in the audiobook version, it seems a strange fictional tangent in a nonfiction book.Secondly, the thing I most longed to know about Copernicus, the thing most of us must wonder, is how he even dared to think the Earth might not be in the center of the universe. After all, his idea went against church teachings, all existing astronomy texts, and everyday observation. What caused him to dare to make that mental leap? If Ms. Sobel covered that issue, I missed it. Copernicus wasn't one to write down his thought processes and he kept no diary, so perhaps there's no documentation that would satisfy our curiosity about this. Still, I'm surprised this question wasn't addressed in the book. That said, this book is well worth reading. I recommend it."
37,0802717934,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1188122-kara-babcock,4,"I came across this book while browsing the science section in Waterstones, because that’s where they hide all the good mathematics books as well, and I was looking for an appropriate math book to give to a fellow math friend for her birthday. (I opted for Ian Stewart’s Hoard of Mathematical Treasures.) Having read Dava Sobel’s explication of John Harrison and the marine chronometer in 
Longitude
, I snapped this up without a second thought. Later, I discovered it was already on my to-read list. Serendipity!A More Perfect Heaven is a biography of Nicolas Copernicus. As such, it reveals so much more about him than his importance to the adoption of heliocentric theory. I knew that Copernicus was a Polish mathematician who lived in the early 1500s, and that his work was largely adopted on a mathematical basis rather than a physical one. That was about it. I had no idea of his extensive involvement in the Church, including his canonry and relationships with local bishops. I didn’t know that he developed most of his theory early in his life but held off on publishing until a Lutheran mathematician showed up out of the blue to persuade him to share his theory.So in this respect, Sobel fills in some very large gaps. She brings Copernicus to life, giving names to his parents and friends, setting up the relationships and geography that would define him and influence him as he considered the movements of the heavens. As I mentioned in my review of Longitude, I’m sceptical of the “Great Man” theory of history. It’s undeniable, however, that Copernicus’ book influenced a great many astronomers and mathematicians, a case Sobel makes in the last chapters of the book, with Brahe, Kepler, Galileo, and others. Copernicus was neither the first nor the only great proponent of helocentric theory, but he was in the right place at the right time, and he had the right help, to put it forth. While most of the world wasn’t quite ready to accept it, the idea was now there, ripening in the collective unconsciousness of a generation of scientists.Speaking of which, I felt smug during much of this book. As I read about the Church’s attempts to stifle suggestions that the Earth revolves about the Sun, I mentally giggled at the amount of power religion could wield in the face of scientific discovery. But I laughed much too soon, because while it’s true that heliocentric theory has won the day, there are plenty of contemporary issues that have inherited its political controversy.The sad truth is that not much has changed in the past five centuries. Though the Catholic Church itself is much more friendly towards scientific discoveries than it once was, other elements of religion continue to push against science they see as inimical to their worldview. These deniers rail against everything from global warming to evolution to vaccines. These positions aren’t just quaint throwbacks; they’re actively dangerous. Human nature and human society has not changed all that much since Copernicus’ time, and we should not be fooled into thinking so simply because our scientific understanding has changed since then.Fortunately, A More Perfect Heaven also tells us that, eventually, science will prevail. Copernicus’ calculations were just so accurate that they became the gold standard. That wasn’t quite enough for astronomers to accept his model as fact (cognitive dissonance is a really awesome phenomenon). But it kept the Copernican ideas alive long enough to reach the ears of people like Galileo and Kepler. The former’s discovery of Jupiter’s four largest satellites was a philosophical blow to the idea that everything in the skies must orbit the Earth. The latter’s obsession with finding a beautiful mathematical explanation for certain types of orbital problems led him to expand the Copernican model based on all the data he could obtain from Tycho Brahe’s careful observations. A few centuries on, Copernicus was vindicated, and opinions began to shift.This is probably the exciting part of the story, the part that seem most relevant today. But most of the book is about Copernicus himself and his involvement in Varmia, the Prussian province of his canonry. Sobel recounts Nicolas’ various administrative duties throughout his life as a Varmian canon. I was amazed to learn of his wide interests in everything from medicine to economics, though I shouldn’t be have been so surprised. Copernicus even wrote extensively on money reform! He might not have been a Great Man, depending on your point of view, but he was a great man.Sobel departs from the typical biographical style by presenting the middle of the book as a two-act play, “And the Sun Stood Still”. She dramatizes the interactions between Rheticus and Copernicus that persuade the latter to finish and publish his overall theory. Since little in the way of documentation survives, Sobel has to take certain artistic license with this interpretation. It’s an interesting way to do it, and I was a little sceptical I would enjoy the sudden arrival of a play in the midst of a non-fiction experience. Much to my relief, the play is interesting, easy to follow, and actually rather entertaining.Sobel does it again. Like Longitude, A More Perfect Heaven is the perfect type of popular science history. It’s not too long, yet it’s amazing in its wealth of information. Sobel communicates with a passion for her subject that can’t help but be contagious. She takes the time to lay out exactly why these giants are indeed giants, people who made such a significant and lasting contribution to the way we think and operate in this world. These are the types of books that get me excited and thinking about science even as I marvel at the history of such discoveries.

38,0802717934,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85825923-ivanopinion,2,"This was my first Sobel and I get the impression perhaps I should have started elsewhere.Wow, this book was just so DULL. Sobel is renowned as a populariser of science, so I was expecting something pacy and interesting, but this was largely boring.Despite the book's title, the first third of the book is a general biography of Copernicus and barely mentioned how he revolutionised the cosmos. I wouldn't have a problem with a bit of background, so you can appreciate the difficult environment in which he worked. But there were pages and pages of lists of how he treated feudal tenants, as Canon in charge of this. It was as if Sobel is a PhD student wanting to impress her Professor by demonstrating that she spent days going through dusty records in Poland, regardless of whether what she found was remotely interesting or relevant.The rest was a bit better, but still seemed so dry. Not once did I get any sense of staggering paradigm shift that Copernicus introduced. Sobel seemed to be trying to give this sense, but for me she failed. Close to a DNF."

I learned how Copernicus, a Catholic (sort of) struggled with his own understanding and did not publish his idea (for fear of the drastic consequences) until a young Lutheran student showed up at his door. Rheticus was completely enamored of Copernicus and finally convinced Copernicus to have his book printed. The play or ""dialog"" that Sobel created in the middle of the book, is a wonderful way to illustrate the ideas and issues. And the final chapters about the aftermath of publication sets up the environment into which Tycho Braye, Kepler, and Galileo would arrive."
40,0802717934,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16780315-maureen-neville,3,"During approximately the past 20 years the author, Dava Sobol, has written several books about various famous scientists from different historical eras who have studied astronomy and navigation. This is the first book of Ms. Sobol's that I've read, however. While it did take me a while to read this work about Copernicus, an astronomer (& also canon of the Catholic Church), it continued to hold my interest. Not being very knowledgeable about astronomy, at times I found I wish I knew more, yet it was the historical era when Copernicus lived that I found to be fascinating. The author gives a fairly clear depiction of how much of a role religion played in the lives of the people in those centuries and how science and religion were often at odds. In terms of Copernicus himself, the author includes both personal and professional aspects of his life and likewise the lives of some of his colleagues and friends. To see how other fellow astronomers as well as mathematicians of Copernicus's time (and after) recognized and acknowledged his work was at least gratifying."
41,0802717934,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35624594-sammy-tiranno,3,"There are definitely dull spots throughout, but it was interesting to see some of the communication that occurred among his fellow clergymen and stargazers regarding Copernicus’s research, and their speculation about how it might be considered not only by other astronomers, but by the Pope and/or Luther as well, especially amid the religious turmoil of the time.The two-act drama that appears in the middle as an interplay is the most entertaining part of the work, if not the most historically loose. These scenes of “how it could’ve happened” were a welcomed complement to some of the more mundane minutiae that it separates.Decent info on Copernicus and his major work."
42,0802717934,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32671431-vitak,3," 3.87 stars  Okay... This is a good book. Especially the play! The play is funny, awesome and, at the same time, imaginative and creative. It's like a fanfiction all over again. And I love how Dava made Copernicus invent the machine and all those cool objects. She managed to make Copernicus look funny and amazing at the same time. He would not have been so, I believe, as he had stroke before he died. He must have been a very stressed man. However, I couldn't fall more for Dava's magic of creativity. "
43,0802717934,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26259694-tauras,4,"I've always known about the controversy of heliocentrism back in the day, yet the most mind-boggling part of the book for me was the realisation that it took 100 years for the idea to become ""more popular"" and only after that 100 years the church decided to ban and censor it. It is somewhat fascinating how such an unfamiliar (yet true) idea took an entire century to get more widely known. And at the same time, the ban on the book made it somewhat more popular. Human nature is a funny little thing, once it's banned, people want to taste that forbidden fruit. "
44,0802717934,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18860660-chris-jamison,3,"I listened to the audio version of this. There's a section in the middle where they go from narrative to play-dialog format, with different vocal parts. I found that jarring. It interrupted the flow of the story for me. I'll give credit - it was interesting and different. But I personally didn't care for it.One great insight for me - an ""Ah Ha"" moment - was in understanding how the planets' apparent motion can be retrograde. I could never grasp this until explained in this book (it has to do with the relative sizes of the planet's orbits). Thank you Dava, for that."
45,0802717934,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10141232-fred-kohn,3,This book can be divided roughly into three parts. The first part is Copernicus's history up until the time he met Rheticus. The second part is a short play. The third part is something of a whirlwind history from the time Copernicus took Rheticus in as a student through Galileo. This book didn't totally thrill me. I found the first part of the history tedious compared to the last part which I felt was rushed through. The play was certainly the most enjoyable part of the book.
46,0802717934,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44812807-david-gill,3,"This book was not as good as my previous books by Dava being Longitude and Galileos daughter. I enjoyed the early part of the book, about how Copernicus realised and showed that the earth revolved around the Sun, rather than the other way around, and how this went against all religious teaching by both the Catholic and Protestant churches. Up to the end of the play, I enjoyed it, but then found that it lost pace and meandered a bit."
47,0802717934,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1013402-jennifer,3,"A pretty decent account of how Copernicus mathematically defined the revolutions of the planets around the sun. This historical account has a play inserted in the middle, And the Sun Stood Still , which was an interesting way to illustrate Copernicus' relationship with Rheticus, the student who helped him complete his manuscript and get it to Nuremberg for printing. I also liked the way the connection between Copernicus, Kepler and Galileo was made in the conclusion of the historical account."
48,0802717934,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20595684-ronald-mccoy,5,"Dava Sobel continues to engage us with this comprehensive but accessible and entertaining account of how the great Copernicus changed pur world view forever. The central section of this book is an audio version of a play written around the dramatic events at the end of Copernicus’s life and the eventual publication of this book. The third section follows the impact. Expertly constructed and researched, Sobel continues to show us all how to tell science stories. Just brilliant!"
49,0802717934,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23276004-brandon,3,"An interesting biography of Copernicus, who famously used astronomy and math to claim that the sun, not the earth, was at the center of the solar system. The best part of this book was the middle section where the author wrote in a play format to vividly describe the painstaking work and intriguing events that led up to the publishing of On the Revolutions just before Copernicus' death. "
50,0802717934,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69279590-ludo-krenn,4,"Fine work on CopernicusI enjoyed the part before the play and the part after. The imaginary dialogue between Copernicus and Rheticus his muse, set as a play in the middle of the book, is distracting. The book is as good as Sobel’s work “Longitude” but falls short of “Planets.” I liked the book, just not as much as I had hoped to. "
51,0802717934,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56950965-peter-reczek,4,An interesting blend of the factual and fictional in this account of the origins of the Copernican revolution. Some tidbits about the relationship between Copernicus and the people around him that are generally not mentioned make this a good contribution to the literature about this great Polish Asronomer. A fast read.
52,0802717934,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4393974-leah-k,2,"Meh. That's my best way to describe my thoughts on this book. The writing felt stilted and dry. The middle section of the book just felt weird. It's one of those books I took in the words but they just went out the other side. I have several other books from the author. I will give her another chance and hope for better results. The research and potential is there but, for me, it missed the spot."
53,0802717934,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1642391-cynthia-karl,3,Interesting account of Copernicus life and his times and the aftermath of his discoveries. My objection is the play inserted in the middle of the book which may have been dear to the author but didn’t contribute anything to the book. 
54,0802717934,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38523981-david-ford,3,Copernicus is the guy who first proved that the Earth revolves around the Sun. The most interesting thing I got out of this book was the fact that the Catholic Church banned Copernicus' book (where he put forth this proof) for over 200 years.
55,0802717934,http://goodreads.com/user/show/428680-jeff,3,"Interesting and informative - I really enjoyed most of it. But. There's an important section of the story that is pretty much unknown, so Ms. Sobel fills it in with theater, which means you have a non-fiction narrative interrupted by a play. It's kind of jarring and didn't completely work for me."
56,0802717934,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65686924-wanda-ruzanski-dietrich,3,"This is a good, clear telling of the life and work of Copernicus. The last several chapters take the significance of his work all the way into this century. I enjoyed most of the book, excepting that ridiculous play stuck into the middle of the book. I took away one star for that. "
57,0802717934,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58549034-melissa,3,"This began slow but held my attention. The middle section (the play) seemed a bit too speculative. The final third concerning Copernicus' influence in astronomy was interesting. I'm glad this wasn't my introduction to Sobel's work, it wasn't her best in my opinion. "
58,0802717934,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49601400-camio-dontchaknow,4,"I didn't realise how little I knew about Copernicus and the time period he lived in. Too much info to take in on an impulsive read. Worth revisiting. Although the random switch to a stage play for the second third of the book seemed completely unnecessary, and poorly written."
59,0802717934,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5661042-helena-r-d,5,I have been wanting to read this for awhile and it was worth it. The history and background was important and helped to understand how Copernicus came to his theory and writing his book and the people who helped him. I got this an audiobook and loved the performance as well.
