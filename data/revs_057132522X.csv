0,057132522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3081414-laura,4,"Fans of How to Be a Woman, gender equality or laughing like a simpleton on public transport: I recommend this book to you. People who only like rigorous, unbiased, robust science… maybe you should sit this one out. I usually occupy the middle section of that venn diagram, but because this book was so fun and entertaining I was able to let some of the dodgy evolutionary psychology slide.Sara Pascoe explores the female body in a meandering, science-y, anecdotey and highly enjoyable manner. It’s ostensibly the story of the female body throughout its evolutionary lifetime: the forces that have shaped it, its treatment by different societies and its physiology. The science-y bits were definitely not this book’s strength and I say that with a great deal of respect for Sara Pascoe. While it’s clear that she did a lot of research for this book, I think she made the mistake of assuming that because a theory was once published in some peer reviewed journal or other, it is incontrovertible fact - this is an easy trap to fall into if you’re unused to critiquing academic papers and theories. The various problems with evolutionary psychology have been widely discussed (some interesting/funny articles about it can be found: here and here) but, briefly, the problem with evo-psych is that it’s all speculative, post hoc, and impossible to prove experimentally, which means that you can basically make up an evo-psych theory to back up any agenda. Another problem is that these theories are really easy to believe!; I mean, it makes sense that humans have evolved to love deeply because being pair-bonded would increase the survival of their offspring; it makes sense that women would be more attracted to big burly men with excellent angry fighting genes; it makes sense that women would sleep with multiple men to make paternity confusing and no-one would know who their child was so everyone would help out with childrearing, right? Well it also makes logical sense that Elizabeth married Darcy and Harry defeated Voldemort - but that doesn’t mean either of those things actually happened. They’re stories. And there are other stories in which these things don’t happen. For every evo-psych theory there is a counter-theory which “shows” something completely different. Mostly, I thought the discussions of human evolution were harmless if a bit dull and clearly not very robust. There was only one bit that I found really concerning; and that was the idea that women have evolved to be insecure about the way we look. The rationale seemed to be that for a large part of our evolutionary history, the only bargaining power a woman had was her looks and therefore women who worried about their looks and constantly compared themselves to other women were at an advantage (“Our big fat brains can’t help compartmentalising other women and visually dissecting ourselves because we assess our bodies like a product we’re selling and it’s been that way for millennia”). I find this both worrisome and an example of how evo-psych can be used to back up any subjective opinion. At several points in the book, Pascoe talks about her own struggles with self image (the extent of which are both shocking and harrowing). So she then comes up with this half-baked theory. I don’t buy it (surely the stress of constantly worrying about what you look like would detract from the time you had to find food and firewood and look after your kids?), I don’t identify with it (which is irrelevant but true), and I think it’s dangerous to suggest that women’s body image problems are innate. Much more likely is that women who struggle with body image are victims of societal trends which make them feel that their looks are the only thing of value that they have to contribute. Anyway, that was a much longer rant than I was expecting. You may now be wondering why I gave this book four stars (if you’re still reading, which is increasingly unlikely). And that’s because it was funny! The dodgy science only makes up a small proportion of the book and less so as it goes on. It gradually gives way to more personal and biographical reflections from Pascoe herself, along with Moran-esque rants about the position of women in modern society. There were several parts that had me laughing out loud and I thought the bits from the author’s own life were engaging. She is sweet and intelligent and a genuinely good writer. Perhaps she thought that the world didn’t need another How to be a Woman and so pitched the book as one on evolution rather than her own thoughts and experiences; it still worked, but I think it would have worked much better if she’d had the confidence to just write about herself. Overall, I think it’s a good read if you’re able to take the “science” with a pinch of salt, and it definitely stimulated some interesting discussion in my book club."

2,057132522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21210909-emmy-gregory,2,"The kind of quarterassed evopsych book that makes me cringe. It comes across as though written by a 19-year-old who's just discovered evolution. Virtually every sentence made me want to scream ""it's more complicated than that!"" If you want to write one of these, here's how you do it:- Take an assumption about how men/women operate based on your own halfassed selection of personal experience and prejudice.- Speculate about how this trait could have been selectively beneficial to our prehistoric ancestors (without any actual evidence - everyone always assumes that they just *know* how gender and gender roles worked back then). - Declare that this posthoc analysis supports the initial premise and that the behaviour is therefore hardwired.- Declare that this ""hardwired"" behaviour is what we all actually want. Every now and then mumble about exceptions without really considering the huge wealth of information that indicates that the real world and real human desires are not this simple.- Rinse and repeat.It's the worst kind of paleofantasy bullshit. Want to know what humans want? We're still around. Yes we are animals. Yes we've been shaped by evolution. But that doesn't mean that the experiences of our longdead ancestors are somehow more authentic and meaningful than today's experiences. They're just easier to make shit up about."
3,057132522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49305671-stephanie,5,"This is a bloody marvellous introduction to the myriad of issues faced by women. It is warm, witty and hugely interesting. I imagine it as a giant jumping off point for girls/ young women/ adults/ boys/ teenagers etc etc etc to read and learn and experience MORE. "
4,057132522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39069012-sarra-o-donnell,5,"Because I am inherently lazy, I never write book reviews. But sometimes you read a book that makes you belly laugh so much you feel compelled to write something that might just convince every single person ever, to read it as well. Magazines like Cosmo and Heat would probably call Sara Pascoe's book ""brutally honest"", ""unflinching"" and ""a must read for every teenage girl"" but I am 26 and would say it ""made me laugh like a drain"", is ""toe-curling relatable"" and that ""even my boyfriend wants to read it now"". Sure, Pascoe gets a bit shouty at times and could probably do with stepping down from her soap box somewhere near the end, but what's the point of writing a book if you can't be self-righteous, even for a little bit? Coming from an emotionally constipated family, it would have been so much easier to have a book like this handed to me at age 13. I'm not saying it would have done anything to stop some of the weird shit I did as a teenager, but I might have at least had a better idea why I did it. In fact, I want to buy copies of this book, wrap them up and keep them for any potential future teenage daughters I might have, to reassure them that we're all worried and scared and don't know what we're doing half the time. Honestly, I thought this book was brilliant. It's hilarious and dare I say even ""brave"" *cringes*. It's made me proud of my fat arse and massive hips because that's where babies come from (not my arse, obviously) and that's AMAZING. If you have a vagina or know someone that does, go out and find this book! "
5,057132522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17620211-tras,4,"Not afraid to admit that I LOVE Sara Pascoe! Whenever I've seen her on QI, or heard her on various podcasts - notably QI's No Such Thing as a Fish and The Infinite Monkey Cage - she's never failed to offer thought provoking opinions and knowledge in an engagingly entertaining manner. This book is basically an extension of that approach. It's extremely funny, informative, and fascinating. As the title suggests, Sara has written a part autobiography, part biological history of man (and woman) kind. There's lots of hilarious insights into her own upbringing, and she doesn't shy away from dealing with difficult topics such as abortion, genital mutilation, underage sex, and rape, and how attitudes to these things have altered (or not altered at all, as the case may be) over time. Some of the information she relays is deeply disturbing, and it is plain that she cares intensely (as we all should!). She also provides a list of charitable organisations at the end of the book, together with a reading list.If you like Sara, you'll enjoy this book. Her writing style is warm and friendly, and she isn't afraid of presenting herself in a less than perfect light. I must have relayed about 2/3's of the book to my girlfriend as I was reading it, purely because countless snippets of information lit up my brain and demanded to be shared with another person. It's that kind of book. Enjoy :)"
6,057132522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19017996-grace-croset,3,"I am surprised at myself for reading this book, as I have never particularly liked Sara Pascoe (I don't find her funny), but I'm glad that I did. This is a book I would want my teenage daughter (of the future!) to read, as although I didn't learn anything new from it (I have an interest in behavioural and evolutionary biology), I really enjoyed the way she explained what can at times be quite complex concepts. Although I found the comedy interludes tedious, there was a lot of really good information packed in here. Sara has clearly done her research, and much of the detail related to behavioural biology can be followed up in the writings of Robert Sapolsky."
7,057132522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40583939-caroline-ellis-ballinger,5,"Absolutely fantastic! This is the best book I’ve read on being a woman. It covers everything and it’s all backed up with examples from science and history. It is really funny but also poignant and some of it made me seriously mad! We’ve come a long way, but it’s still very hard to be a woman in modern society with so much pressure and high standards that are often impossible to meet. I loved this book! Everyone should read this book!! "
8,057132522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8386476-alex,5,"This book was... not what I was expecting. I was essentially expecting ""How To Be A Woman"" but with a few more jokes. A pretty base-level feminist gender exploration, by a stand-up comedian. So I was pleasantly surprised to see how in-depth it was, both in terms of detail and also inclusivity. It covers how bodies have evolved, the science behind our chosen sexual and romantic partners, as well as treatment of women within society. It was way more knowledgeable than I was ever expecting, yet still managed to not feel heavy and dry. So that is a pretty high accomplishment.My only slight complaint is with the ordering of sections; specifically the end section. The book ends with the section on 'consent', including some pretty graphic and shocking facts and stats about rape and sexual assault. And then the book pretty much ends. And while I definitely think that these things are important to discuss - and I am so glad they had their place within this book - I think that it felt a little abrupt to discuss the most personal and difficult section, and then just bring the book to a close. "
9,057132522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43507525-beth-hall,4,"I adore Sara Pascoe, even after she startled me that one time at work. This book was informative, witty, and clever- I just wish there were a few extra edits- mainly changing 'both genders' to 'all genders'. Still, this book was refreshing and delightfully rambly (but interestingly so) and I can see myself returning to it, especially after excitedly telling my bookclub all the new things I learned about sperm and startling the new person. "
10,057132522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4713140-heather,4,"A 4.5* read for me and a brilliant audiobook version. Sara Pascoe talks through the history of woman and growing up as girl. It is witty, poignant and at times appropriately angry at the gender imbalance women still face today. Pascoe is honest about how events in her life as a girl and woman have shaped the person she is today. Brilliantly narrated by the author herself "
11,057132522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47323871-sid-nuncius,5,"Animal is brilliant. I like Sara Pascoe very much so I expected to enjoy it, but it was even better than I expected.Sara Pascoe is very funny. She is also very intelligent, thoughtful, well informed, honest and insightful. The result is a very readable, often very funny book about human – especially female – sexuality, the female body, it’s workings and people’s attitudes to it. It is full of insight and genuine science, all of which she relates extremely well to our everyday experience. She is also refreshingly direct about topics like menstruation and engagingly - sometimes almost alarmingly - honest and open about her own experiences, emotions and insecurities. I found the sections about how someone so fabulously attractive as she is can still feel dreadfully insecure about how she looks especially helpful to my understanding, and the section on consent/rape is exceptionally good, too.Pascoe is knowledgeable and intelligent in her approach, while still often being very amusing. For example, she has a genuine grasp of the process of evolution (which is by no means always the case among people who write about it) and she is exceptionally good about acknowledging the things we do not know. This is one of the marks of a true scientist and she refuses to go in for that old, familiar trick of selecting just those (often dubious) bits of evidence which seem to support preconceptions or a political stance and pretending that they form a watertight case. As a result, her conclusions and politics about female sexuality and the way it has been (and still is) misrepresented and abused, body image and so on are all the more powerful, and she makes a very compelling case.Books on these topics are often worthily turgid; this is anything but. Pascoe is rightly angry about a lot of things, but she channels it into a non-aggressive, engaging, honest and very convincing voice which is fascinating, informative and highly entertaining. Everyone should read it, no matter what your age or gender, and this gent in his mid-60s can recommend it very warmly indeed.Oh, and Sara – you know the bits where you talk about how you can be in love with someone you’ve never met…? "
12,057132522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55137572-aimee,3,"I was a bit disappointed by this book having seen and enjoyed Sara Pascoe's stand-up live. There were bits of this book that had me laughing until I cried, and other bits that left me feeling frustrated. It's quite a jumble of different things, certain parts read like a self-help book, other bits are autobiographical and very frank (for me these were the funniest bits) and some of it reads like a Biology essay written by a GCSE student. I enjoyed it over all but I was left wishing she'd just written a straight autobiography as some of it comes across as quite preachy and self-righteous. I preferred Bridget Christie's A Book for Her by a long way because Christie manages to come across as well-educated on the subject without looking down on people who are not, whereas Pascoe sometimes seems like she is shouting ""HOW COME YOU IDIOTS DON'T GET THIS"" at her reader."
13,057132522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7331806-rob-adey,4,"I've seen Sara Pascoe do some fantastic stand-up, so I was really interested to see what this would be like. The rhythm of her delivery is here and works on paper. It's an entertaining mix of autobiographical comedy, feminism and evopsych - a similar experience to Bridget Christie's book, but with more biology. I don't totally trust the science sections, but then I don't think Pascoe's claiming to have the last word in any of this or overstating biological determinism - just that it's not far-fetched to assume our animal nature has some legacies, and it's useful to acknowledge that."
14,057132522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4196863-jayne-lamb,3,"Pascoe comes off as a very ingratiating and funny woman, but I'm a little puzzled as to who this book was actually aimed at (and, god, all the awful evo-psych she talks about as though it's fact rather than theory!)Maybe I would have really appreciated this when I was 17? Some of the relationship advice sounds like it's aimed at women in their 20s or 30s, but who.. I don't know... for some reason don't understand how periods work?Cute. Confused, but cute."
15,057132522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42161224-zabrina-welter,5,It's a book that every woman and man should read... hilarious and in many ways a sexual education handbook for the 21st century.
16,057132522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7255097-rebecca,4,"I ended up really liking this!Sara Pascoe's first book, Animal is an exploration of women's bodies, emotions and sexualities. Pascoe's book is divided into three sections: love, body and consent, and uses scientific and evolutionary theory to explore the problems and vulnerabilities women face today (and throughout history), as well as featuring some personal insights from Pascoe, and of course, comedic commentary. I think the first section, love, was the weakest for me. The scientific exploration of love seemed too simplified and the arguments weren't as sharp. Body and consent, however, were very insightful, and just the right amount of angry. I also think the parts when Pascoe gets personal were some of the best.I think these 'pop feminism' reads have their place in the world. As a teenager, I think I wasn't given an adequate feminist education (possibly resulting from an amazing combination of attending religious school + having working class background). If I'd had something like this at fifteen or sixteen, I think I would have become pissed off earlier (good thing as being pissed off motivates you to want to change things). So yeah, I think they have an important place. And I think this is a good one."
17,057132522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25185380-eleanor,4,"A great book separated into discussions on 'love', 'body', and 'consent'. Pascoe manages to insert humour and charm, but still discusses serious, and upsetting, topics with a sincerity. This is a good book if you want a mix of entertainment, autobiography, well/explained science, and talks on bodies. Of course people who are well versed on the subjects will find fault with some of the scientific facts, but for me it was a perfect balance of digestible science I could understand and Pascoe's own thought. Whilst Pascoe is addressing matters of the 'female body' and does in her footnotes clarify that this can apply to those who do and do not identify as being female or to those who weren't necessarily born in a 'female' body, I think I would have liked more discussion on gender within her 'body' section. Overall the book raises some fantastic points that I definitely support, but for a book on bodies and love I think there should be more discussion dedicated to gender itself. "
18,057132522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/113487-angelique,5,"YES YES YES. It's more of a 4.5 stars for me.It wasn't a whole lot of information that I hadn't already known. I liked the way in which it was presented. And it was funny, especially the spiders/pubes bit. Near the end, I needed to take breaks, because it was making me way too upset/angry/man stabby to continue. I loved her honesty and I loved reading it. I could stand up and clap when she was talking about how the boys should have heard about periods and the analogies with rape and other crime. I loved how unapologetic about her abortion she was and how honest she was about how she felt about her body. And I'm happy to see Fat is a Feminist Issue on her reading list.My only issue is when she explains the ideology behind pro-lifers, via pedophilia. I understand pro-lifers are human, but they are still forcing an issue on another person. This, I have no time for.Well done, Sara! Funny and easy to digest, not preachy and everyone should read this."
19,057132522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32481121-katie-leach,5,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book and wish I'd found it at an earlier age, when I had less confidence but nonetheless it still had an affect on how I view myself and women. And after all Sara wrote it in her mid-thirties so I still have ten years to have my own epiphanies. Anyone looking for sophisticated science or a text book, I'd go elsewhere. This book is through Sara's lens and I can see other reviewers saying the views are 'cringey' or 'immature'. I say she handled big issues that I personally haven't been well-read on with great perception and I enjoyed her opinions and focus on morality. The humour is the kind that had me laughing out loud. To myself. On a busy train. But I'm okay with that..... "
20,057132522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17998977-ciboulette,5,"I want to give this to every single person I know. I want to gently shove this into stranger's laps on the train. I want to leave copies of this book at bus stops, in doctor's waiting rooms, on park benches. I want to sit down with my closest friends and eat and talk and talk and talk about this. I want to buy Sara Pascoe a pint. This was incredibly fascinating to read, but most of all, it gave me so much to think about and talk about and so many incentives to do things differently. I honestly recommend this book with all my heart. "
21,057132522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28916643-bernadette,5,"This should be required reading for every teenager, regardless of gender. It's funny, well-researched and passionate. Best of all, Pascoe gives such beautiful eloquence to feelings and experiences I thought I was alone in having; our lives have been so eerily similar....I think she might just BE me (except I'm not a successful comedian/actor/author in the top tax bracket!) Loved it! "
22,057132522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27686264-izzi-douet,5,"I could not put this book down, yet I never wanted it to end.A brilliant and inciteful (and funny) overview of the biology, history and personal experience (Pascoe's experience) of the female body, focusing particularly on sex and love. "
23,057132522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29466996-ellen,4,I really liked this book! Sara is a fab writer and the ideas were presented w humour and conciseness (not a word but oh well.) Would recommend it if you’re looking for a book about women that delves into the science-y bits of sexuality 
24,057132522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27143847-laura,4,This was such a good book that I've already bought a copy for a friend. I think Sara talks about the female body in such an accessible way that so many people will be able to relate to. I've not really watched much comedy from her so I wasn't entirely sure what to expect but I really enjoyed it!

28,057132522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5858624-beth-bibliobeth,5,"I am so happy that I finally got round to reading this book. I had it on my Amazon wishlist for so long, eventually bought it then it stared at me from my bookshelves for months before I gave in to its demanding ""read me!"" pleas and cracked it open. Now I had an inkling before I started that I was going to love this wonderfully funny piece of non-fiction but I couldn't have anticipated just how much that would be. Sara Pascoe, a British comedian hits the nail on the head every single time when she talks about the female body, sexuality and gender inequality and I found myself nodding along on multiple occasions completely enamoured with every tidbit of information she shared with me, some of it incredibly personal things relating to her own experiences.The tagline for this book is ""Autobiography Of A Female Body,"" and that's the perfect way to describe it if you're wondering what this book is about. After an entertaining, short and snappy little introduction about Sara and her reasons for writing the book it is divided into a few different sections - love, the female body and the very important issue of consent. Each section has a wealth of useful and often hilarious information, some of which Sara has researched for the purpose of the book and knowledge that she has amassed from her own life experiences. Filled with Sara's trademark wit and down to earth approach it's an honest, uplifting and at times, incredibly poignant look into what life as a woman is really like.I honestly can't believe it took me so long to pick up this book and I'm so glad it lived up to every single one of my (very high) expectations. I have seen Sara live before and really enjoyed it but felt I got to explore her personality at a much deeper and more intimate level with Animal. It was side-splittingly funny, sure - that's to be expected from a comedian surely? However, I wasn't prepared for how emotional it would also make me feel, particularly in the final section when Sara explores consent, rape and the (hugely flawed in my opinion) British justice system for rape victims. I finished the book filled with a strange sense of pride for being a woman and a tentative hope for the future where women will be on a more equal footing with men.Please don't shy away from this book thinking it might not be for you if you are a man as well, this book does not discriminate on gender (unlike the world we live in today!) and I think it's a hugely important read for both men and women. I laughed my head off, felt instantly more empowered and learned a few things too. For example, did you realise that modern technology is leading to the death of the glow bug population? Apparently, the male glow bugs keep trying to mate with the street lights thinking it's a female glow bug and are obviously unsuccessful! Thank you Sara Pascoe for that fantastic little nugget of information that I can pull out at random moments! Personally, I think this is such a vitally important book that needs to be read by as many people as possible and I can't recommend it highly enough. It has recently been announced by Faber that Sara will be writing a follow up book about masculinity and considering the brilliance that was Animal, I'll be first in the queue!For my full review and many more please visit my blog at http://www.bibliobeth.com"
29,057132522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5962819-kahn,4,"I genuinely didn't know what I was getting in to when I picked up this book - I mean, I like books, I think Sara is hilarious, this was going to be an absolute hoot right?Well......erm......yes......but also no.You see, rather than just writing about her life, Sara decided to tackle something far simpler - the politics, culturalisation and appropriation of the female body and related sexy times.Light on laughs, you'd think, but Pascoe is both a gifted writer and a gifted comedian (or ""female comedian"" to give her the standard industry disclaimer), and she knows how to tackle this stuff.She does, however, get off to a sticky start. Now this may well be a gender thing, or a personal thing (t'other half told me I was totally wrong and didn't get the section on 'love' - I'm sure this bodes well for the future, nowt to fret about there...), but the opening section is an uncomfortable mix of the personal and the factual. Sara almost lays herself too bare in drawing from personal experience to illustrate some of the points she's making (and I say that now knowing just how personal she gets later on in the book). However, once we hit the section on Body, Pascoe's in top gear and racing off into the distance. Her passion for her subject screams off the page and the laughter is perfectly timed to alleviate the heavier moments.This is an important book for any number of reasons, but if I had to pick one it's the fact it speaks to everyone. Sara has important things to say about sex, consent, body shaming, the right to choose — and she's trying to make a difference and help people. And the best way to help her achieve that is that EVERYONE reads this book. There are men who need to know about consent, there are women who need to know that they're not alone, there are boys and girls who need to know how to actually behave around each other (especially boys), and this book provides much of the guidance for a better world.A good book will make you laugh, or cry, or get angry because it's made you care, or think and form new ideas and opinions. A great book will do all of these things. This is a great book. "

32,057132522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12678156-enricocioni,4,"What a fantastic book! I learned a lot, maybe more so than I thought I would. Even the few things I already knew, mostly contained in the first few chapters--Pascoe is so good at expressing ideas clearly it is a marvel to behold. Very good to listen to the audiobook as well. I'd give this to my nephew if he were at least a decade older (he is 2 at the moment).Also, for what it's worth, I think this is a much better book--more interesting, more comprehensive, better written--than both Catlin Moran's How to Be a Woman or Aziz Ansari's Modern Love--and it has much less filler material and less nostalgia for the olden days than the latter and will age much better than the former (though I realise now part of the reason why I'm now embarrassed that I liked Moran's book at the time is that whole Girls thing, so more the author than the book itself, of which I remember very little--maybe it's better than I remembered! though my wife is reminding me now that I didn't in fact like it at the time--I liked many of its ideas but hated all the pop culture references) (and Modern Love suffered, for me, from the fact that I'd seen Master of None first, and a lot of the ideas Ansari explores in the book he also explores in the show) (so, this is not an entirely fair comparison, but worth making I think).Also, excited to hear that Pascoe has a sequel coming out, looking at porn and sex work! And I'd recommend this interview with the Shakespeare & Co. podcast:https://shakespeareandcompany.com/eve..."
33,057132522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5161060-amy-alice,5,"This book is everything. Every female and female-loving human needs to read this. Young girls need to read this annually until it is second nature to them. Sara Pascoe has combined facts and feminism, science and social justice, humour and brutal honesty to create one of my favourite, most life affirming books ever. It is funny and shocking, heartening and also terrifying. I LOVED the way she spoke about her experiences candidly, in a way that was shocking at first, because we never hear a real someone actually talk about gambling with condoms and then having to have an abortion. We also don't hear enough about WHY we feel love and lust, jealousy and heartbreak. She expertly navigates tough topics rationally but with SO SO much understanding and empathy for why shit happens. If I've put you off with calling it feminist - It's not man hating. If I've put you off by saying science - It's the fun stuff like gloworms humping streetlights. If I've put you off with the abortion thing - read it and then decide how you feel. Have I raved enough about it yet? There are about 85 solid pages that I want tattooed on my body so that when topics come up or if I'm feeling ashamed, I will have her with me. Until I am fat enough and brave enough I will have to read and re-read until I know it off by heart. I want to be her best friend. Let the stalking commence. Seriously buy this book."
34,057132522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19212251-kerry-mcintyre,5,"I cannot recommend this book to anyone more, it is one of the most enjoyable autobiographical books I have ever read. It talks about serious issues and things which many people in todays society still avoid discussing, yet Sara's humour and style make it an enjoyable read, and makes the topics accessible for all. Sara uses her personal experiences as examples and the majority of them are hilarious - my personal favourite involved her mother buying a lot of sanitary products, but I won't ruin it for you!If you're after a great introductory book into the themes of feminism, this is the book for you. It's not just for women - I had this book on in the car and my boyfriend was laughing along to it too. A lot of the information given in the book is fairly basic, which keeps the style light and easy to follow, however if you want to find out more it is easy to research into. I first ""read"" this book by listening to the audiobook, although I am going to buy the physical book as I enjoyed it so much. That being said, I am really glad I listened to this first as hearing the book through Sara really added to the personal feel of the stories."
35,057132522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4848228-giney,5,"Funny, insightful and very honest. Pascoe presents a history of bodies and behaviour and delves into perceptions, projection, cultural bias, fear and misunderstanding.It is, sometimes simultaneously, illuminating and infuriating to read her findings. It's eye-opening to discover how much of what we perceive as attitude or habit actually has roots in our evolutionary past - and how much everyday practices, laws and individual beliefs spring from this same foundation. There seems to be a whole lot going on within our bodies and brains that we are not consciously aware of (anymore).But more than presenting a well-researched thesis on the nature and role of females throughout history, Pascoe uses herself as a case-study in a disarmingly entertaining and genuinely brave manner. Rarely have I read an author more willing to present their own flaws and mistakes, as well as insecurities to analyse ideas and test (once) accepted notions. It's refreshing and it works.Pascoe 's exploration of the female and the female body - and how perspectives are shaped, influenced and changed - is relevant and worth a read whatever sex you are."
36,057132522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27031604-james-elder,5,"I'm not really the target audience but this was excellent: funny, brave, passionate and educational. Included lots of stuff I've really not thought about sufficiently.The audiobook is recommended too, as Sara has a lovely delivery which brings out the humour and the seriousness of her writing.For my friends with teenage daughters, this is definitely one to consider sharing with them.EDIT: I've noticed that there are some negative reviews on this site which disliked the book for, in their view, peddling unevidenced evolutionary psychology (evopsych) explanations for why humans behave as we do. It always intrigues me how two people can read the same book and see different things; to me, the author was very cautious in her assertions - constantly stressing that some idea was just a hypothesis not a fact, that there are other theories and that we may never know the real answer. Moreover I've heard more than one interview with her where it's plain that she has a healthy scepticism about evopsych. My view is that you shouldn't be put off by those reviews."
37,057132522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62790587-helen,4,"This (audio) book surprised me. It started off and I felt it was slightly shambolic but gentle. It wasn't really what I expected (an autobiography of Sara Pascoe) more a combined book of anecdotes and anthropology. It surprised me how brutally honest Sara was about her relationships and attitudes to men. She completely lays herself open. Halfway through and the book is just warmed up and so I find myself nodding and agreeing with her as she dismisses our legal system as not fit for purpose in securing convictions for rape and other major issues. Nothing in here is new to me but it's great to have it all in one place. Also I really appreciated the honesty of the autobiographical parts of the book. It takes a lot of courage as a notable female celebrity, in the world of comedy to be so frank. Enjoyable and surprising,"
38,057132522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16005779-polly,5,"Really enjoyed this. Sara is articulate and has a lovely friendly style of writing. I picked this up after hearing on Adam Buxton’s podcast, where she spoke about the research she did to find answers she was looking for personally, and then wanted to share what she learned. These ideas/statistics/facts are related alongside illustrative anecdotes from her life - which provides a backdrop and context. Definitely recommend - to women who can feel the familiarity and relate to the life-examples, and to men for insight into what it feels like to grow up as and be a woman. Sara does discuss serious issues, but is very readable, and ultimately very positive. I looked forward to being in her company every day whilst reading it and now I’ve finished it I miss her!"
39,057132522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39966417-jo-coleman,4,"I'd got the impression that this was a strident sex manual, but then picked it up in the library and discovered it was actually a mixture of feminism, biology and anecdotes about the bewildering world of growing up as a girl in Romford. Oh, and also very funny. A bit like 'How To Be A Woman' by Caitlin Moran but with more science and self-doubt. I think this was aimed at a younger audience than me, and rather wish we'd had some copies knocking around the school library when I was a teenager. However, she is so engaging and painfully honest that some passages made this middle-aged lady do a blub anyway."
40,057132522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51686742-wendy-jakob,5,"I was fortunate to see Sara Pascoe at a local venue before she became famous and on TV A LOT.This book is written in the stand up style I witnessed. Long, funny monologues. But with a lot of science, common sense and personal insights thrown in. It's hard to categorise the book but it's definitely a must read, especially for men. Yes it's written from a female perspective but, as Sara rightly points out, better education is needed on how our bodies work, what makes us do the, sometime stupid, things we do and how our emotions come into play.It also made me thankful that I've grown up in a developed society although we're still very much a work in progress."
41,057132522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51339139-alex,5,"I thought this was an excellent book. It showed me a completely different angle from which to examine the concept of love, introduced me to many new theories, and discussed many relevant feminist and social issues. It was very personal and moving, and all the while it was insightful and amusing. I thoroughly enjoyed the read, and would recommend it to anyone who has ever been told something they said is sexist and they didn't understand why, or anyone who thinks females or love or consent are worth thinking a bit more about. "
42,057132522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51717119-samantha-williams,5,"THIS IS AN AMAZING BOOK EVERY WOMAN SHOULD READApologies for the caps, but I adored this book.As some young females do I have a complicated love-hate relationship with my body. But after reading this book I have a far greater respect for what it does, and actually my thighs are probably kind of awesome.Dotted with brilliant autobiographical nuggets from Sara, she somehow managed to seamlessly tell me something about herself whilst informing about the female body and our evolution.Bravo Sara, I ruddy loved it!"
43,057132522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51515368-sophie,5,"Bloody fantastic. I want to give it to everyone I know and go back in time to give it to my 15 year old self. Really beautifully dealt with ideas about the female body, sex, violence, societal roles without excluding anyone (example, admitting that the biology of the body she discusses does not belong to everyone who identifies as female). READ IT!! The first person to ever tell me that fat is okay and has a purpose. The human body is a well-designed vessel to carry around our massive brains, it's is society which makes us try and change it or feel bad about it. Thank you Sara!"
44,057132522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36898563-amy-proud,5,"This book is important, I cannot overstate how valuable Sara's voice and message is, while retaining all of her humour and freshness. One day if I have children, girls or boys, I will be showing them this book because I wish I could have reflected some of Sara's kindness and clarifying knowledge onto my self-critical self earlier. I cannot recommend this book highly enough and will be shooting multiple copies through confetti canons for the greater good in a town centre near you very soon"
45,057132522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38053287-eleni,5,you 'd think that being 35 and a woman you know most of what relates to women's body or behaviour... think again! Once I started listening I couldn't stop. The book is enjoyable and extra bonus you get to learn a few things about your body and why you behave the way you behave or feel the way you feel. Especially towards the end I had to stop a few times to think things through and find where I stand on some points. Totally recomend it.
46,057132522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100955-rebecca,5,"This book should be mandatory reading for everyone, regardless of how you identify or whether or not you think you will be interested. It is a majestic, hilarious, touching, honest summary of everything we should know, and consider and be engaged with, but often aren't when it comes to female bodies. I laughed and cried and read it out loud to my partner and talked about it non-stop and then bought copies for anyone I knew who hadn't read it yet. It's incredible. "
47,057132522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50143610-steph,5,"Insightful and thought provokingI'm New to Sara Pascoe, and I found this book to be full of moments that gave me a fresh perspective and Hasbro articulate on issues that are important to me. Actually, I also find her style inspirational. So very glad I discovered such a clear and eloquent voice in feminism today."
48,057132522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7679469-julia,5,"Funny and fascinating, and at times incredibly moving. I want to press this book into the hands of women everywhere. Sara provides incredible insight into the female experience, as well as putting forward some very convincing arguments for changing the status quo. The audio edition is brilliantly read by the author and her delivery makes it all the more hilarious."
49,057132522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48106543-john-wren,5,It shouldn't be education but for many it will beA balanced and candid exploration of our sometimes damaging motivations in relationships. A charge sheet on misogyny. An exposing work.
50,057132522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5064387-claire,5,"An absolutely brilliant book about the female body. So unashamededly honest, and brilliantly written Pascoe's book touches on so many aspects of what it means to have a female body in the 21st century. "
51,057132522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6454474-alyce-hunt,5,"I LOVED this. As I'd studied psychology, I was already familiar with a lot of the theories discussed throughout this book - cuckoldry, paternity certainty, Freud - but the way that Sara talks about them and links them with modern day feminism and societal beliefs is refreshing and uplifting. "
52,057132522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17141870-piers,5,"An important book to read for basically everyone who has any desire to begin to understand the concept of ""female"" in the modern world. Don't expect belly laughs, and it was occasionally very uncomfortable for me, but that's what makes it so powerful."
53,057132522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5886356-jen,3,"I thoroughly enjoyed this, thought provoking yet light hearted, making it very readable and open to anyone. Yes it is simplified, yes it is opinionated, but that's just like me, so it worked perfectly as entertainment with substance. I would recommend it."
54,057132522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61229188-laura,5,"I adored this book; I found myself cracking up in the middle of the night while reading it. The author addresses relevant topics regarding the biology of the female body, love, and consent, in a delightful manner. I wish I had read it when I was younger!"
55,057132522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31401355-liza,5,Thank you Sara Pascoe for writing this book. I wish this had been around when i was younger. This is a brilliant gift for teenagers.

57,057132522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10529227-ali,5,"For me this was revelatory and reassuring. A great leveller.Sara is funny, brave and knowledgeable. I plan to gift this book to my nieces once they reach their teenage years."
58,057132522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5972924-stuart-dredge,5,Funny and wise and blunt and all kinds of good.
59,057132522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7256770-katie,5,I really liked this book. It is full of useful information and illustrated with anecdotes from Sara's experience of growing up in the female form.
