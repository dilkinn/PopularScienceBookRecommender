0,0452289327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/166376-david,2,"This book was a major disappointment. I'd seen an interview with the author on ""The Daily Show"" and wasn't that impressed, but bought the book anyway because of the promise inherent in its subject matter. Sadly, that promise remains largely unfulfilled in this pedestrian, and often irritating effort by LeVay. The book is arranged in twelve chapters, each considering a specific instance of what LeVay deems to be 'scientific failure'. These specific aspects of the book bothered me:1. Several vignettes (e.g. the 1928 St Francis dam break, a 1961 nuclear reactor explosion at the Idaho National Laboratory) clearly deal with  engineering, rather than scientific, failures. But throughout the book, LeVay makes little distinction among science, engineering and technology, which makes the title misleading. 2. ""I had hoped to find out more about this from Tudor herself but ... she had died a few weeks earlier""""Dyer ... seems to have disappeared from public view""""Williams ... didn't respond to my requests for an interview""The book is studded with this kind of admission. Failure to represent all points of view adequately may be inevitable in an exercise like this, and LeVay does acknowledge this difficulty. Nonetheless, the reader is left with some niggling doubts about his credibility. In a story about an experiment conducted almost 70 years ago, to miss obtaining testimony of the main protagonist by three weeks seems unfortunate, to say the least. And in almost every chapter, it seems, LeVay is forced to admit that testimony of at least one key person was unavailable.3. One chapter, about the 'failure' of the BBC Met Office to predict a severe storm in 1988 has no discernibly useful comment to make about science, except maybe that computer weather prediction models are often inadequate. But it does give the unsettling impression that LeVay constructed a 'story' where none existed, then collected a bunch of selective quotes to buttress his preformed prejudices. Several times I found myself wondering about LeVay's status as a neutral observer, not the feeling one wants to come away with after reading a book like this. Similarly, the reason for including a vignette about a patient with late-stage Parkinson's disease, who flies to China for fetal-implant surgery forbidden in the U.S., with predictably disastrous consequences, is murky. What point is LeVay trying to make - that submitting to experimental surgery under poor supervision in an inadequately equipped facility is a bad idea? Well, duh! This type of pandering to lurid curiosity seemed better suited to World Weekly News than to a serious book.4. Maddeningly, in several vignettes, on feels that an opportunity is being missed to write a far more interesting story. A story about confusion of units leading to the loss of the Mars Climate Orbiter and its aftermath suggests at least two more interesting possibilities: an analysis of the culture at NASA which made such errors possible, even likely, or a discussion of the high prevalence (with often deadly consequences) of serious dosing errors in U.S. hospitals. Similarly, LeVay's account of the death of Jesse Gelsinger in the now-infamous gene therapy trial at U. Penn was an even-handed presentation of the facts of the case, but left me wishing for a more illuminating discussion of its implications. The reader is left with the impression that the case dealt a death blow to the future of gene therapy (which seems unlikely). Several interesting questions raised by the case are left largely unexamined, e.g.:* how scientific ambition can corrupt the scientific process* the potentially destructive hegemony of the status quo in the biomedical and scientific establishment* direct funding of clinical research by pharmaceutical companies and associated issues* the appropriate balance of risk and caution in the regulation of biomedical researchPointing out cases where things have gone wrong is necessary and useful. But ultimately, unless it fuels a discussion of how things can be improved in the future, it starts to feel like a slightly smug exercise in playing Gotcha! LeVay's idiosyncratic selection of case studies, his conflation of science, technology, and engineering, as well as a repeated failure to explore the more interesting questions raised by his examples combine to make this book a real disappointment."
1,0452289327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28825839-stephie-williams,2,"This book looks at twelve mistakes in the history of science. Most of these mistakes were made in applied science (or technology). Unfortunately, I have misplaced my copy of the book and the few notes I took. Seeing this, I have no synopsis or commentary to offer.I will say from the title of the book, that I was disappointed with the content of the book. I thought the book was not really on how science goes wrong, but how applied science and technology can go wrong.Still the book should be of interest to anyone that wants to learn some of the mistakes made in the name of science with the understanding, that except for a few of the twelve tales, basic science is not really covered.PS - I had mark this book as read already, but do not recall reading it before, and none of the text looked familiar to me."
2,0452289327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/316102-krista-the-krazy-kataloguer,4,"This was a fascinating book. Couldn't put it down. LeVay details twelve instances of scientific mistakes, fraud, and just plain bad science. I had only heard of two of them, the St. Francis dam disaster and the eruption of the volcano Galeras in Colombia, before. The rest were new to me. I was struck with the fact that, in many of these cases, the responsible parties failed to take responsibility, opting to pass the buck instead. I can't believe how the victims of the medical treatments gone awry continued to believe they were being cured despite all the negative effects of the treatment. I suppose when you run out of options, all you have to cling to is hope. Particularly interesting to me was chapter 7, ""Nuclear Physics: Meltdown,"" about a little-known nuclear accident in Idaho in 1961. They know that the mistake was made by one of a crew of 3 men, but they don't to this day know why. That man, by the way, happened to be from Utica, New York, where I work! Funny how you find local connections in the most unexpected places. I hope LeVay writes another book like this, both enlightening and entertaining. Recommended! "
3,0452289327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32116714-sally,4,"I thoroughly enjoyed this. It's everything you want from a lay person's science novel. A romp through some infamous and obscure science screw ups. The main thing though, is unlike many other novels of its type, it's done respectfully. LeVay, a scientist himself, does not take this novel as an opportunity to badmouth, criticise or humiliate his scientific colleagues. If it is schadenfreude that you're looking for, you'll not find it here. LeVay covers these often truly tragic mishaps with a sense of poise and and accuracy and a thorough reporting of the facts. My absolute favourite part of this though, is that it gives you just enough information, context and intrigue to want to go and find out more. Since finishing it, I've found a couple of interesting documentaries on a couple of the subjects, and that's always an added bonus.Definitely a wonderful use of a spare couple of days that will leave you with further obscure and interesting facts to liven up a dinner party, or perhaps that winning edge at trivial pursuit. "
4,0452289327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1040998-thomas,3,"In these accounts, ""science"" per se did not go wrong. Science being a process and discipline of applying observation, measurement, logic, and reason to a specific issue, had it been followed well would not have produced some of the stories in this book. The accounts in this book were of science and technology woefully misapplied."
5,0452289327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/118361-jennifer,4,"This book is a really good reason for being pro-IRB. While all almost all of science works for advances for the good of man-kind, here are a few good examples of why regulation and oversite are EXTREMELY important. The first story about the guy who grows a fetus in his brain... READ IT!"
6,0452289327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50895231-michelle-michelledevoursbooks,1,"I have been vacillating through this entire book about whether to give 1 or 2 stars. Upon finishing, I have decided upon 1. You might ask, ""then why the hell did you read the whole thing, Michelle?"" My answer is that most of the described incidences were quite interesting. Simon Levay in When Science Goes Wrong discusses twelve disasters that resulted during experiments in various fields of science and engineering. These events were varied and well-described. However, I do not recommend that anyone read this book. I have several reasons.1. The title and subject matter are misleading. The book should be titled When Scientists Do Wrong since the majority of the events described were due to the hubris, attitudes, naivety, and inexperience of scientific professionals. Science in itself is a process of rigorous testing to disprove hypotheses. In fact, science often went *right* in several cases (for example, the ecstasy study) when scientists took criticism seriously, did *science*, and retracted/changed their conclusions with new data. What was described was often not science, just people being idiots.2. The evidence provided by the author was often unsubstantiated hearsay. He made statements and then identified he was never able or willing to corroborate or prove them. In one instance, he cited an article by the Daily Mail. That would have been fine if the discussion was based on the media's contribution to the aftermath of a disaster; however, it read as if it was a source of facts in the aftermath, along with eye witness accounts (which, in a later section, he discussed were poor pieces of evidence anyways). The author including literally every piece of gossip (often derogatory statements about scientists made by other scientists) made this book out to be one big gossipy fest and not a scientific discussion.3. The scientific explanations were too technical and sometimes verging on incorrect. First, no lay person will have the background to understand details of neurosurgery, civil engineering, space flight, and nuclear chemistry. It's not a book that is accessible to the general public, although someone with scientific background should be fine. Second, I found his attitude and explanations to several subjects disappointing. Particularly in the last section about nuclear chemistry and the discovery of superheavy elements. Granted, this book was published in 2006 and may be out of date for much of the science discussed, but all elements 107-118 have been discovered and confirmed, with other isotopes detected but still unconfirmed. In fact, the ""magic number"" and ""island of stability"" that seemed too implausible to the author are common subjects taught in the chemistry curriculum (I should know, I've taught them). As of yet, they're still theoretical, but so were all other man-made elements.All in all, I do not recommend this book. The title leads one to believe that the disasters described would actually be due to science. In fact, the author describes many great examples in his epilogue. Instead, what you learn about are people going into active volcanoes and getting blown up because they lack common sense, foresight, and respect for their colleagues and the scientific process."
7,0452289327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7665938-bethany,4,"“It is often just one such misstep...that leads to disaster.”I enjoyed these thoroughly researched screw ups. It makes me feel human. I think we can learn a lot from these good efforts gone wrong, more Han you can by successes. Success seems to be happenstance in comparison to all the ways you can fuck up science, or anything involving humans really. "
8,0452289327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27036257-julie-depaulo,2,Some of the stories are quite interesting while others seems to be filled with unnecessary fluff and details. I skipped over some pages in each chapter as they didn't really add to the stories. Other stories seemed like a bit of a stretch that ended up not really being a consequential. Pick and choose your chapters and it's at least entertaining. 
9,0452289327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22670745-bridget,3,"Terrible title, but some interesting stories that I haven’t heard before "
10,0452289327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26207090-ray-savarda,4,"Actually pretty good. Multiple stories of science gone wrong, by ignorance or malice."
11,0452289327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8058285-hannah,3,"Interesting, but a little loosely held together. Definitely learned a lot of fun stuff, though! Could have wished for a little more science detail in a couple of chapters, but others made up for it."
12,0452289327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15815492-andrea,3,"There were no expectations when I started reading this. It was done in no time, good for a train trip. The stories are interesting, but not detailed enough, in my opinion. Some of them have very little to do with science and more with human stubbornness. "
13,0452289327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1714801-yael,5,"The subtitle is, Twelve Tales From the Dark Side of Discovery, and a very dark side it is. The scientific disasters included in this book include:A surprise hurricane makes a violent appearance on land despite repeated assurances that the hurricane doesn't exist (LeVay says that Michael Fish, Britain's best-known and most arrogant weatherman, who told Britain that the hurricane ""didn't exist,"" should have been hanged; eighteen people died because of it, and the damage caused by the hurricane mounted into the billions of pounds).A team of scientists hike into the crater of Galeras, a volcano in Columbia that their leader, Stanley Williams, has assured them is dormant, ignoring the signs of an imminent eruption. Several members of the team died horribly; Williams himself was badly injured; and the only member of the team to avoid serious injury, Andy Adams, came out of it relatively unscathed because of his fireproof clothing and hard hat, leaving him with only some minor burns on the back of his neck.A patient who underwent cutting-edge brain surgery involving a fetal-cell transplant is found in a post-mortem autopsy to have hair growing inside his brain.Other scientific horror-stories documented in this volume include a study on the effects of the drug Ecstasy vs. that of meth on the human brain that later could not be duplicated; the collapse of the St. Francis dam near Los Angeles, CA on March 12, 1928, due to the fact that the dam had been built on a dangerous earthquake fault, that its abutments were made of soft, soluble sandstone rather than concrete, and that it was not built to the specifications and safety factors that had been planned for it before construction began; gene therapy with a lethal twist; a runaway nuclear reactor that killed several people and sickened many others; genegineered microbes that decided to go on vacation from their testing facility, thanks to a helpful wind and a lab accident; the arrest, prosecution, and imprisonment of a black teenager for a rape he did not commit, and could not have done; and further disasters of space science, speech pathology, and nuclear chemistry. Some of these cases involved serious injuries, deaths, and massive destruction; others were just embarrassments and money down the drain for the taxpayers. All of them illustrate the principle that regarding science and scientists as infallible is not the smartest -- or safest -- attitude in the world.Beautifully written, the book is a treat to read, except maybe for the really scary bits. Extensively documented and annotated, it presents some aspects of modern history that many scientists don't want to talk about -- but which actually happened."
14,0452289327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4685740-allison,4,"From The Book Wheel:When I first picked up this book I immediately went to Goodreads to see what other people thought. One of the biggest complaints is that it was too “sciency” or technical, which baffled me because it’s about science going wrong. That’s right – science. Of course it is going to have some scientific jargon! A chapter about hurricanes would be incomplete without a mention of the Coriolis effect, so I didn’t factor these complaints into my decision to read it. But while most of the scientific sections were about things I learned in high school, there were parts of the book that were really heavy on the technical terms. To be fair, they were necessary to understanding how and why things went wrong, but I did find myself skimming over the chapters about engineering and chemistry.Not that that detracted from the book whatsoever. In the end, morbid curiosity and extremely approachable writing by Simon LeVay propelled me through the book. If you had asked me a week ago whether I thought human experiments were actually happening with catastrophic implications, I would have said no. Between the FDA, the review boards, and the internet, there couldn’t possibly be genetic testing that resulted in an ear bone growing in someone’s brain or blatantly ignoring FDA regulations, right?Wrong. Dead wrong. For the full review, including the Top 5 Lessons I learned,click here. "
15,0452289327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2201886-mike,3,"Mostly I enjoyed reading this book and I wish there was a ""3.5"" to award to it. The topic, ""science mistakes"" was the incentive for me to pick it up. Although I have not read any other books by the author, he has developed a clear and informative writing style that makes the book easy to pick up and follow along. I know that this is supposed to be a collection of notable, some might say 'spectacular', failures of science, but I consider at least three of them to be engineering errors, rather than science errors.What is the difference? Maybe not a lot, but science is a methodology whereby we conduct basic (and possibly applied) research into the physical world, abstractions, human action and interactions and so on. Engineering, on the other hand, takes previously discovered rules, theories, ""laws"" (like gravitation), material properties, or processes and uses them to produce artifacts, devices, etc.Although I feel a few of the stories to be not fully ""science"", I was interested in each one and all of them are ""science-related"". So, if you are looking for a good non-fiction, science-related book, I do recommend this one. And I commend the author for his investigative skills in revisiting events that may have been difficult to research (both because of the age of the story, as well as the reluctance of individuals to comment on it.)"
16,0452289327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4248590-rudrangshu-das,4,"It is a book of real misadventures in the field of science. But contrary to what the title would suggest, the science was not so much wrong in most case, as were the scientists, the people applying the science. In that sense science can sometimes be fallible because it is handled by fallible creatures.It is one of the best science books I have read. the 1st chapter - The runner's brain is still vivid in my memory. The author being a neurologist himself wrote this 1st story on Parkisnon's disease with utmost care and detail. The story is a good testimony to how difficult being a doctor is. On the one hand doctors have the power to heal, but their deep understanding of the human body sometimes tempts them to experiment with treatments, as any scientist would want to do, but with doctors that can sometimes turn detrimental for their patient.There were other good pieces like the accidental spread of anthrax bacteria from a lab somewhere in UK. "
17,0452289327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1255266-stefanie,3,"My gut reaction to this book is ""meh."" The stories in it are objectively interesting, but the delivery is quite bland. It reads a lot like a series of scientific reviews- there's an attempt to make it accessible to a layman, but this falls short frequently. I found myself having to look back to re-read certain sections fairly often, which is a bad sign in a person who actually reads scientific papers on a regular basis. A few of the stories lacked credible sources- though this was exhaustively documented, which is good, I sort of felt like, ""why bother?"" since the details were hearsay.I don't feel enthusiastic enough about this book to recommend it. I love some horror stories about nuclear meltdown as much as the next person, but the writing was too dense to make reading about it very interesting. From a scientist's perspective, it's a good read, if only to remind you to be accountable for your actions. But really, there's probably other, better stuff out there."
18,0452289327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/778299-michele-lee,3,"Review by Jason Lush Really should have been called ""When Humans with College Educations To Really Stupid Things"", but I guess that wouldn't be sensational enough.When Science Goes Wrong is informative and engaging, but I believe it may have been rushed to press to capitalize on some event. The book covers twelve events in recent history in which seemingly smart people committed decidedly careless or outright stupid deeds, always at the cost of others. Each of the twelve stories are factual and informative, but every one of them is jam-packed with worthless fluff and personal anecdotes that distract from the point. My advice is read the first three and last three pages of each chapter and you'll get all the relevant information you need."
19,0452289327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/101007-molly,1,"The concept of this book is incredibly interesting and, given the direction of my thesis, could have been valuable, but the writing in it was so impressively f-l-a-t that I couldn't bring myself to enjoy it. Reading it was tedium (I have a fastidious habit of wanting to finish books I start, no matter what, as one cannot know if it gets better in the end). I knew from my husband, who read it first, this wouldn't be the case, that I would feel as if I were reading my freshmen comp students' essays. It was a bit sad as the stories themselves are entirely interesting and compelling, but not the way LeVay tells it.Here is the author's appearance on The Daily Show:http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/tue..."

Each of the twelve horror stories presented were directly caused by the laziness/hubris/ambition of the people behind the projects. I admit to skimming and skipping around through a lot of this book. Although I tried hard, I'm just not interested in the failed mathematics behind an industrial engineering catastrophe. It didn't help that LeVay seemed to write with the assumption that his readers were experts in a great many subjects, not bothering to keep things simple for the laymen. "
21,0452289327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14662398-melissa,4,"First, b/c of character limits (I'm assuming) the email l got from my library that this book was ready for pick up had it subtitled, ""Twelve Tales From the Dark Side of Disco."" Which is a book I would totally read!This book is a series of short stories about various scientific mishaps. What I enjoyed most was each story was very detailed b/c often one must understand some background to understand how the mistake in question happened. Because this background is done so well i enjoyed reading the physics and civil engineering stories the most. "
22,0452289327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1053537-liz-zmoos,5,"Ok, this book is not for everyone... it's got a lot of science content! The book describes 12 situations in which scientist got a little too cocky and make some serious mistakes. Like the meteorologist that said that said a hurricane didn't exist then it hit land and was one of the most devastating in Briton's history killing 18 people. Genius!!! The writer is very funny in a dry scientist kind of way."
23,0452289327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1710696-michelle,3,"Interesting book. The author takes a more in-depth look at some high profile cases of research and/or technical projects that have gone awry. He covers several different fields--neuroscience, volcanology, meteorology, etc. and the background information is sometimes a bit too technical and convoluted to be easily understood without careful reading (and re-reading!) but overall it was an entertaining read."
24,0452289327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1055545-kendra,1,"Despite the one star this wasn't a horrible book. I just wouldn't recommend it :) I liked reading the stories of the crazy mixed up science problems, but I didn't like how there was so much SCIENCE! Don't laugh :) I had to skim many things because I didn't understand them or just didn't care about the history. It was like reading a science book, ugh. But, I did read the whole chapter on stuttering :) So if you like science-type things, I could see this being a very entertaining book."
25,0452289327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1279264-dan,3,"This is an odd little book, in part because it doesn't really seem to have much of a point. It's not anti-science, nor does it really make much attempt to delve into the lessons learned from each of the twelve mistakes described in its stories. When things go horribly wrong, it can make for an entertaining story, and LeVay does a good job describing these stories. But it never really rises above grim fascination, and at the end of the book it seems a bit lurid to have enjoyed it."
26,0452289327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2459103-ogi-ogas,4,"My ratings of books on Goodreads are solely a crude ranking of their utility to me, and not an evaluation of literary merit, entertainment value, social importance, humor, insightfulness, scientific accuracy, creative vigor, suspensefulness of plot, depth of characters, vitality of theme, excitement of climax, satisfaction of ending, or any other combination of dimensions of value which we are expected to boil down through some fabulous alchemy into a single digit."
27,0452289327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2588430-david-r,4,"LeVay's twelve essays on ""science gone wrong"" are really much more about mistakes made in various realms of scientific inquiry (vulcanology, speech pathology, meteorology, neurology, etc.) What is more disturbing is that in these accounts the mistake, or those making the mistake receive the benefits of some kind of coverup. This circle-the-wagons mindset has and always shall vex the growth of science, and that's especially true in the modern age."

What I found amazing, apart from the details in each of the cases, was that LeVay, a neuroscientist by training, made himself enough of an expert in diverse, unconnected scientific disciplines (meteorology, volcanology, geology, nuclear physics an chemistry) to be able to write cogently, insightfully and with full explanations that were available to the general reader.A fascinating series of true stories."
29,0452289327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28591332-tegan,4,"A good collection (better than I was expecting) of major scientific disasters. This was presented well in easy to read and interesting formats. I liked that it covered a range of disasters – from the meteorological inaccuracies – there is no hurricane coming to the Uk. Or the idiots that decided to scale an active volcano, to a human experiment that was unethical and really badly done. Thanks for bringing this fascinating stories to our attention. "
30,0452289327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1101812-jeff-toner,3,Overall the book was interesting; however I’m not too sure if the title is appropriate. Majority of stories relate to man’s psychological problems –especially on the subject of one’s ego. The author should continue with a follow-up book based on the same concept but using industrial chemistry as a backdrop.
31,0452289327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1342778-kim,4,"This is totally fascinating! Author's writing style is a bit dry, but otoh he doesn't sensationalize either.

This was written by a scientist and goes into some detail about what actually happened to cause the problem.

Additionally, some of the writing was so technical that I found myself skimming. (I have a biology degree and read ""popular"" science books frequently; I imagine the technicality of some of it would be very off-putting to a general audience.)"
34,0452289327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1014705-crescentm,4,This book was very interesting. It was kind of disheartening reading about how niggardly people are about other people's lives but it's reality so it's best to read about the truth. It was also chock full of scientific information in many different disciplines.
35,0452289327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/294631-glenda,2,"It was okay, some of the stories more interesting and engaging than others (to me). Lots of science/math details for those of you who are interested in that.
