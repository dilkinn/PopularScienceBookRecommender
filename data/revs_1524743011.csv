Carroll confirms this in his insistence that quantum physics is, in his words, not an ‘epistemic’ but an ‘ontological’ discipline His claim is that current quantum theory is a description of the way the world really is not merely a way of understanding the world. This is the traditional position of theologians who would like us all to consider God as the ultimate reality even if we find this reality to be not what we perceive it to be.In fact Carroll defines science in general, not just physics, in theological terms. For him, the essential presumption of science is the intelligibility of the universe. This implies not just that there is a pre-existing order to be discovered but also that such order in some sense wants itself to be discovered. These implications are precisely those of what is called fundamental theology, the study of how God can be known about at all.*The similarity between Carroll’s view of quantum physics and fundamental theology is important because in both there is no distinction possible between epistemology and ontology. How we know about the world, or God, is indistinguishable from what the world, or God, actually is. Theology has a term for referring to this knowledge of being (or Being) - revelation. Essentially, you either get revelation or you don’t. It can’t be argued about because the presuppositions about what constitute both existence and knowledge about existence are contained simultaneously within it.Thomas Aquinas is perhaps the most well-known theologian to defend the presuppositions of revelation. In doing so, his preferred approach is cosmological, that is, treating the entire universe as an entity to be explained in terms of its existence and its history. At such a level of analysis, ordinary logic (like that of cause and effect and their priority in time) start to break down. Thus, Aquinas asks, if every effect must have a cause, what is the ultimate cause? And if human beings exhibit free will and purpose as an effect of that ultimate cause, is it not reasonable to attribute will and purpose to that cause. QED, the universe is a consequence of divine action with some divine purpose toward which it is drawn.Carroll makes a parallel case for quantum physics and the Many-Worlds theory of Hugh Everett, formulated in the 1950’s. First, just like Aquinas, he adopts a cosmological position. The universe, he says, is one vast quantum state, a wave function of enormous complexity. This is not inconsistent with the theory of quantum physics even if it could never be empirically verified. And it fits with the strange results of quantum experimentation. QED, reality is composed 0f an indeterminate number of simultaneous universes. In other words, Everett’s theory qualifies as a revelation.If this is the case, then this wave function will evolve according to the mathematics of the Schrödinger equations, just as it has always done. Not according to the logic of Newtonian (or Aristotelian) cause and effect but the logic of probability and entanglement. This wave function is not something temporary or local that might transform into something else, say a particle, or ‘collapse’ upon observation. Within it is not only the universe we know about but an infinite number of others that exist simultaneously. The wave function, in other words, is the very stuff, the ultimate reality of the universe; and it doesn’t make distinctions between observer and observed or between possible and actual. Our brains and the farthest galaxies as well as everything in between, including any number of other worlds, must be part of this wave function, since there can be nothing else. So the conventional ‘Copenhagen interpretation,’ despite its usefulness, is wrong. The wave function is the Alpha and the Omega, the source and giver of not just life but also existence, the Ground of Being (as modern theologians like to say). If it explicitly isn’t called godly, it’s only because the divine has suffered a significant reduction in brand-value in recent centuries.That all sounds logically fine, if more than a tad baroque. But the reason it all sounds fine is the same reason that Aquinas sounds fine to the Pope. Once ontology and epistemology are conflated, that is, when that which is is presumed to confirm that which we know, we have entered the realm of religion. At that point, we simply assume a cosmological guarantor in what we take as revelation. Revelation is its own assurance; it proves itself. And at that point Aquinas is about as credible as Carroll* The most important Christian theologian of the 20th century, Karl Barth, devoted himself almost exclusively to this issue. The intellectual machinations he had to employ in order to establish the intelligibility of God are really important for scientists like Carroll to consider before casually presuming an even more diffuse source of such an attribute.Postscript 16Sep19.

2,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,3,"This book is about the ""Many-Worlds"" hypothesis of quantum mechanics. It is a deep description of the hypothesis, and its context in quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics does not violate logic; its precise predictions are correct, and among the most accurate of any scientific theory. But its foundations are still quite controversial, especially when it comes to understanding the role of gravitation. The Many-Worlds hypothesis is a simple way to explain some of the seeming paradoxes of quantum mechanics. There are alternative hypotheses, and the book covers these as well.I can't say that I learned anything (I am a physicist), but the book did focus my attention on a few key ideas. First, it is incorrect to say that atoms are made up mostly of empty space; particles are not tiny points, but are wave functions that are spread out in space. Another example: The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle does not say that the act of measuring a quantity disturbs the system. In addition it does not say that you cannot simultaneously measure position and momentum perfectly at the same time. Instead, it says that a definite position and momentum (velocity) do not even exist simultaneously. The wave function solution to the Schrodinger Equation acts as a wave, and so it can be analyzed like a Fourier Transform. Think of a sudden audible transient--like a click. The click occurs at a definite point in time, but it has no specific pitch because its spectrum is broadband. Likewise, a pure audible tone must occur over a span of time; it does not occur at a specific, definite time.Here's the problem with the book. Like many technical books that are aimed at non-specialists, it gets deep into jargon and concepts that are totally unfamiliar. The non-specialist can understand all the words, and maybe even entire sentences. But it comes off sounding like a foreign language. And, there is an additional problem with this book. Much of the book focuses on the Schrodinger Equation, which is a typical type of partial differential equation. But unless you have studied similar equations, you cannot really understand the physical concepts described in this book. A general form of the equation is written in the book, but it is so simplified, that to a mathematician it doesn't convey much of anything, and to a non-mathematician it is gibberish.This book is an excellent attempt at explaining some of the deepest mysteries of quantum mechanics. But the fundamentals are not covered well enough for a general reader to grasp all the arguments presented here."
3,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,5,"This book puts up an intellectual defense of the many-worlds interpretation of Quantum Mechanics first proposed by Hugh Everett III in 1957. I was sold on this interpretation a long time ago but I like the way Carroll presents his case. The Everettian view is the most conservative metaphysical view of quantum mechanics with the fewest ad hoc additions to squeeze the theory into our common-sense notions. Because of this, the conclusions of this conservative framework are the most counterintuitive shocking commonsense so radically that many will balk at it. The many-worlds interpretation leads to the weird idea that every possible measurement of with a probability is realized in myriad branching realities when a quantum measurement takes place and all the time in the universe. Carroll shows that the simplest assumption set leads to this conclusion and one may be tempted to dismiss this as repugnant but that is where the simplest understanding of QM leads. Maybe it is a reductio absurdum and a bridge too far but commonsense has taken a beating in 20th and 21st-century physics and mathematics maybe this time we might not want to listen to our gut.  Carroll also talks about a newer approach to quantum gravity. In the past, we worked with relativity and tried to quantize it. Carroll wants to start with quantum mechanics and quantum entanglement and try to get relativistic spacetime to fall out of it. Approaching Quantum gravity from the quantum end rather than the gravity end.

He writes well, and the history of the hostile reception to new research on the roots of quantum theory is deeply disturbing. Make no mistake, no one doubts that quantum mechanics works. And is deeply weird. Feynman once said something like ""I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics."" Still true, sfaict.Carroll prefers Many-Worlds as the best theoretical basis for QM. And he is a physics prof at Cal Tech, Feynman's old home base. But gosh: one wave function for the entire universe? And a new ""world"" is created every time there's a subatomic interaction? The number of new ""worlds"" created would far exceed the number of atoms in the universe.... And no way to experimentally test any of this? Good grief. Angels dancing on the heads of pins?Well. Since the book is already overdue, I think I'll call it good and go on to something else. I read about half of the book, and kept getting lost, rereading sections and trying again. My usual problem with trying to understand theoretical physics. 2.5 stars for what I read, rounded up for the good writing, interesting science history and provocative philosophizing. Do note that I'm not qualified to judge the physics -- but I do have a finely-tuned BS detector, which kept going off in this book.Here's Manuel Antão's fine review, pointing out these problems (and many more!), which is when I realized I should give up:https://manuelaantao.blogspot.com/201...He is better qualified than me to judge the physics. Well-read guy, too.Nature's review: https://www.nature.com/articles/d4158...Sample:Six decades on, the theory is one of the most bizarre yet fully logical ideas in human history, growing directly out of the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics without introducing extraneous elements. It has become a staple of popular culture, although the plots of the many films and television series inspired by it invariably flout the theory by relying on contact between the parallel worlds, as in the 2011 movie Another Earth.In Something Deeply Hidden, Carroll cogently explains the many-worlds theory and its post-Everett evolution, and why our world nevertheless looks the way it does. Largely because of its purely logical character, Carroll calls Everett’s brainchild “the best view of reality we have”. . . .Carroll argues that the many-worlds theory is the most straightforward approach to understanding quantum mechanics. It accepts the reality of the wave function. In fact, it says that there is one wave function, and only one, for the entire Universe. Further, it states that when an event happens in our world, the other possibilities contained in the wave function do not go away. Instead, new worlds are created, in which each possibility is a reality. The theory’s sheer simplicity and logic within the conceptual framework of quantum mechanics inspire Carroll to call it the “courageous” approach. Don’t worry about those extra worlds, he asserts — we can’t see them, and if the many-worlds theory is true, we won’t notice the difference. The many other worlds are parallel to our own, but so hidden from it that they “might as well be populated by ghosts”. . . .Something Deeply Hidden is aimed at non-scientists, with a sidelong glance at physicists still quarrelling over the meaning of quantum mechanics. Carroll brings the reader up to speed on the development of quantum physics from Max Planck to the present, and explains why it is so difficult to interpret, before expounding the many-worlds theory. Dead centre in the book is a “Socratic dialogue” about the theory’s implications. This interlude, between a philosophically sensitive physicist and a scientifically alert philosopher, is designed to sweep away intuitive reservations that non-scientists might have. . . ."

I think there is something in my brain that associates the bleeding edge of physics with poetry and art. I'm not the only one. Authors like Thomas Pynchon and Cormac McCarthy are constantly using physics as a springboard into literary ideas and explorations. I think one of the big connections between theoretical physics and literature is the fact that both seek to explain the world through imagery and metaphor. Physics are hard science's poets.Sean Carrol does a fantastic job of describing the many-worlds interpretation (MWI) as initially suggested by Hugh Everett. The entire price of admission to this book was paid when I discovered in this book that Hugh Everett is the father of EELS' lead singer and song-writer Mark Oliver Everett (also known as E).

6,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,4,"In this book Carroll fully embraces the reality of quantum mechanics. He doesn’t accept that it’s just useful for calculations. Carroll says that the quantum world is the real world. Rather than proceed from classical physics to explain the quantum world Carroll starts with the quantum world to find out how it builds the world described by classical physics. Carroll’s approach leads to what many consider outlandish conclusions.Carroll is a theoretical physicist at Caltech and an award winning author of physics books. Here he makes a case for the Many-Worlds theory of quantum mechanics calling it “the most promising formulation of quantum mechanics”. Quantum mechanics is proven science. It is fundamental to the way the universe works. But what it tells us about the nature of reality is disputed. The different takes on this question have been commonly called interpretations, but Carroll considers this term misleading since it implies the answer is subjective. He uses the more recent description, the foundations of quantum mechanics. Here, I’ll stick with the more familiar and less cumbersome word, interpretation.The Many-Worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics was first espoused in 1957 by physicist Hugh Everett in his PhD thesis under the guidance of Noble Prize winner John Wheeler. The Many-Worlds interpretation was at first widely dismissed as nonsense but has gained more support over time. In the quantum state particles are in superposition meaning they are in a combination of positions all at the same time, both here and there, an electron spinning both up and down, a photon both vertically and horizontally polarized, etc. While strange we know it is true. Quantum computers are being built that operate taking advantage of those extra states to process calculations at unheard of speed. Every quantum object has a wave function which tells us the probability of finding it in a particular state. When we measure we get a distinct answer. But what is the fundamental reality, the quantum state of superposition or the measurement yielding a specific position? Carroll believes it is the quantum state. The measurement is just what we observe. This belief pits Carroll against the standard theory also known as the Copenhagen interpretation. Carroll says the Many-Worlds theory is consistent with the science while the traditional interpretation is not. First Many-Worlds avoids the measurement problem that plagues the Copenhagen interpretation. The Copenhagen interpretation holds that the wave function collapses when we measure yielding a specific value. Carroll holds there is no reason to believe that the wave function does collapse. Physicists commonly accept that the evolution of the wave function is defined by Schrodinger’s equation. That equation does not indicate the collapse of the wave function. Nor is there any other support for the collapse. According to Carroll it was just made up to explain why measurement gives a specific outcome. An implication of the Copenhagen interpretation is that particles in the quantum world only become real when they are measured. This makes no sense. Carroll holds that all the possible outcomes are real, but in different universes. The Many-Worlds theory holds that for every possible outcome the universe splits accommodating each. Carroll believes there is one wave function for the universe and we are all in superposition with it. So if we are betting on a coin toss, in one universe we win but in another we lose. We are entangled with the coin and go together in both universes, each universe forever completely separate from the other. A second problem with the Copenhagen interpretation is that it claims the quantum world only exits at the micro level of fundamental particles, even though experiments now show that larger objects display quantum characteristics. So where is the dividing line between where quantum mechanics rules and classical physics rules. Any such line is arbitrary. Carroll considers the entire universe to be part of the quantum world defined by a quantum wave function, just as are fundamental particles. He holds that the everyday world we encounter, the universe described by classical physics, is an emergent property of the universe’s wave function. Carroll says that the Many-Worlds interpretation best explains the reality of the quantum. There is no measurement problem, no arbitrary distinction between quantum and classical worlds, and no mysterious making something real by measuring it. Every outcome is real and consistent with the quantum world.Carroll points to entanglement, an idea that came out of quantum mechanics that has been proven in experiments. When two particles become entangled they become one quantum system, a change in one means the other also changes instantaneously even if they are light years apart. Carroll believes every object can become entangled. For example the equipment or people measuring particles or anything else become entangled with them and also are in superposition with them. Photons, electrons or other particles will inevitably interact with a macroscopic object. Thus macroscopic objects are necessarily entangled with their environment and thus with the entire universe and are part of its wave function. The Many-Worlds formulation also offers an explanation for the famous two slit experiment. When electrons pass through both slits of the testing apparatus they hit a screen forming an interference pattern because they are waves. But when we set up a detector to measure them they pass straight through to the screen showing up as if they were particles. Carroll holds that this is because any interaction including measurement, in this case between the detector and electron, causes what is known in quantum mechanics as decoherence. The electron’s quantum state has been altered. In the Many-Worlds theory decoherence causes the electron and its shared wave function with the universe to branch into different universes thus the electron can no longer interfere with itself as it passes through the detector. Carroll briefly explores some alternative quantum theories: the GRW theory of dynamical collapse, the Bohmian mechanics model using pilot waves and QBism an epistemic model that holds the wave function is purely informational and not real. Carroll sticks with Many-Worlds calling it “simple and elegant” but indicates he will switch if something better comes along. In the final chapters he explains quantum field theory describing quantum fields that fill the universe creating locality and becoming entangled. In a fascinating discussion he shows how entanglement of quantum fields could yield space. He also discusses the search for quantum gravity and looks at black holes from a quantum perspective. These sections were quite involved, but I enjoyed his unique presentation. Central to all of Carroll’s thinking is starting with quantum mechanics to create the world of classical physics. In his own words:Nature is quantum from the start, described by a wave function evolving according to an appropriate version of the Schrodinger equation. Things like ‘space’ and ‘fields’ and ‘particles’ are useful ways of talking about that wave function in an appropriate classical limit. We don’t want to start with space and fields and quantize them; we want to extract them from an intrinsically quantum wave function.From a Many-Worlds perspective that treats quantum states as fundamental and everything else as emergent, this suggests that we should really turn things around, ‘positions in space’ are the variables in which interactions look local. Space isn’t fundamental; it’s just a way to organize what’s going on in the underlying wave function.I don’t have any idea whether Many-Worlds turns out to be a great contribution to physics or just a bizarre dead end. But I don’t dismiss an idea just because it sounds crazy. Regardless of the fate of Many-Words, I learned much about quantum mechanics from Carroll’s presentation. For example, he offered the clearest explanation I have read for why it is not possible to measure position and momentum at the same time in quantum mechanics. I’ve read several of Carroll’s books and enjoyed them all. In this one I found myself frequently paging back and forth. It definitely is for someone with a strong interest in the subject and an open mind. "

In the textbook view, there is a probability that one or another outcome happens when we observe a quantum system, while in Many-Worlds all outcomes happen, weighted by the amplitude squared of the wave function. Does the existence of all those extra worlds have implications for how we should act, personally or ethically? It’s not hard to imagine that it might, but upon careful consideration it turns out to matter much less than you might guess.”"

Review
According to quantum mechanics, it’s entirely possible that there are multiple copies of you reading multiple copies of this review. The many worlds approach to quantum mechanics says that the world decoheres into various branches. Branching reality is a difficult subject, but it is one that makes sense when interpreting exactly what quantum physics represent. Physicist, author, and podcaster, Sean Carroll attempts to explain these subtle and difficult philosophical questions in his latest book, Something Deeply Hidden, from Dutton. This is a book of big ideas explained to an audience of anyone. It doesn’t spoon feed the reader answers, but nor does it put concepts too far out of reach. For anyone interested in quantum mechanics, this is a must read.
Review: Something Deeply Hidden
I’m a fan of Sean Carroll. I like his podcasts and his appearances on Joe Rogan’s podcast. He’s entertaining while still conveying complex knowledge. So, this review is biased from the start. I don’t understand quantum mechanics, and for most of my studies, I’ve been told I don’t need to understand it because the math works. It’s an odd way to approach physics. To quote Richard Feynman, “…I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics.” Certain physicists like Sean Carroll have decided to change that. Something Deeply Hidden largely succeeds for our current best understanding. It doesn’t rely on the fact that the math works out; it attempts to explain reality, which was physics original purpose.The book reads well; it’s not full of equations, though there are some. Dr. Carroll’s style of explanation is clear enough without equations. He’s funny and fills the book with good examples and easy to follow illustrations. Dr. Carroll lays down a foundation of quantum mechanics history before moving onto cutting edge physics and then to the weird stuff. Something Deeply Hidden is an intensely philosophical book that I’m still thinking about.The book focuses on Schrödinger’s equation and the Everettian interpretation, which is also known as the many worlds interpretation. In short, Schrödinger’s equation describes the wave function of the universe, and there is no collapsing of the equation. Instead of superpositions collapsing into a measured reality, the measurement causes a branching of the universe. Let me repeat that a branching of the universe. One where outcome A happens and another where outcome B happens. And guess what, we branch when the universe does as well.
The Many Worlds Interpretation
Decoherence, branching, and superposition are difficult concepts to understand. Honestly, I’m not sure I grasp it fully. Dr. Carroll does a good job explaining it in a way that I could start to understand. (This is a book that I will have to reread.) The idea that the universe branches has long been a popular idea in science fiction (see the TV show Sliders). But it’s much more complex than simply a person’s decision causes the universe to split. In fact, Dr. Carroll deliberately debunks this idea. The universe branches, but an individual’s decision doesn’t cause the branching.Dr. Carroll explains the many worlds interpretation in plain terms that at the same time make you scratch your head. In Chapter Seven, Dr. Carroll writes a short story that’s a dialogue between father and daughter physicists. In a way, it reminded me of What We Talk About When We Talk About Love by Raymond Carver. This chapter was unexpected yet effective in conveying difficult topics around probability. It was an odd chapter in a physics nonfiction book, but it helped convey the information. Something Deeply Hidden is well written.
Part Three
Something Deeply Hidden is organized into three parts with a prologue, epilogue, and appendix. I kept up easily with part one; part two stretched the limits of my intellect; and part three simultaneously blew my mind and broke my brain. I don’t think I can adequately review this section without reading it again. And I will definitely read it again. In my review copy, one of the chapters in part three is titled, “Breathing in Empty Space.” A chapter title like that deserves re-reading.
Multiple Me's
One consequence of branching is that when the universe decoheres and branches, so does the person. In other words, there are many copies of each of us on various branches out in the multiverse. Maybe. Dr. Carroll treats this as no big deal, and really after thinking about it for a while, it isn’t. Since we can’t interact with these other branches, contemplating the other me’s that exist is much the same as contemplating how many angels dance on the head of a pin. But I never did shake the weirdness of me branching with the universe.This branching has direct consequences to conservation of energy and the concept of entropy. I’m not entirely convinced of the answer provided, but it’s an interesting answer. This is one of the rare moments in the book where I don’t think the answer conveys a physical meaning. Or, at the very least, one that I can understand. If the universe branches enough, does that mean it’s possible to lower the energy of the many worlds to almost zero? If so, what happens to all the me’s in those branches?
Competing Theories
Dr. Carroll states plainly that he subscribes to Hugh Everett III’s interpretation of quantum mechanics. But he does devote time to competing theories and gives them fair treatment. Then, he explains why he thinks the alternate interpretations are wrong but in respectful manner. Maybe I’ve been reading too much politics lately, but this was really refreshing. It’s important to see a thoughtful summary of and argument against a competing philosophy without a need to ‘win’ – whatever that means in physics circles.This section also serves as a starter for investigating more about the interpretation of quantum mechanics. In this section, I learned the phrase quantum Bayesianism, which is just fun to say. Dr. Carroll’s description is quite interesting, and I might look into the topic in the future.
Conclusion
Sean Carroll’s Something Deeply Hidden broke my brain in the best way possible. This insightful, philosophical book explains difficult, complex concepts in understandable language. Based on the arguments, I’m now an Everettian convert. Somewhere out in the multiverse, there’s an Eric writing a better review of this book. In a different branch, there’s an Eric who didn’t get to read this book, and he’s all the poorer for it.9 out of 10!"
9,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14487581-deniz-yuret,3,"I eagerly waited for this book for a year. Having read Deutsch, Albert, Aaronson, Becker, I had very high expectations about the insights Carroll would add. The book fell short on introducing and justifying quantum concepts. Entangled pairs are presented without the obvious comparison to correlated classical objects (like two pieces of a torn card, as soon as I look at mine the one you have is determined faster than the speed of light ;) Bell’s theorem is not explained at all, when there are so many simple examples. Basically if you didn’t know why the world has to be different from our classical conceptions, you still wouldn’t know after reading this book. Becker’s book does a better job at this.I also have a beef with some of the terminology that is not specific to this book. I don’t know why physicists still use the word “measurement” when it has confused so many generations - wouldn’t “interaction” work just as well without invoking conscious observers in lab coats? Similarly “wave function” misleads when you are not talking about the position of a single particle: in what way does the spin of an electron wave? How about just calling it a “state vector”? Aaron’s book does a better job at this.I would recommend this book for the speculative but provocative ideas about tying quantum theory with spacetime.It is a pity, Sean is usually such a great explainer. I suspect some draft of the book had parts that gave good intro insights but were somehow voted off. I wish I had access to earlier drafts."
10,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4461733-paperclippe,3,"This was definitely one of Carroll's more technical works. While his language as always as simple as it can be for the layman, there's only a certainly level of simplicity to which quantum theory can be broken down. That said, Carroll does good work interspersing all of the necessary technicalities with a more story-form description of the ideas behind quantum gravity, Many Worlds, and quantum physics, so if only half of the book sticks with you, you're still bound to learn something. Carroll's trademark humor, too, shines through in a lot of places, and serves as a good anchor point to bring even the most baffled reader back from the brink. Definitely not for beginners to the ideas behind quantum theory, but an excellent book to build on what a fan of popsci might already know. "
11,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20923295-anton,3,First third is fantastic! The latter bits get quite meandering... It seems I am always very curious about the scope of Carroll’s books but never quite getting what I expect. Nowhere near as engrossing as Rovelli’s stuff. So... a very reserved recommendation. 
12,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6243880-gary-beauregard-bottomley,5,"Do not multiple entities unnecessarily. The Copenhagen Interpretation necessitates the additional entity of an observer or a detection device, take away that added entity you will have the world described by the wave function and that’s how Hugh Everett III (remember that name, if you don’t already know who he is) gets at in his MWI (multi-world-interpretation).Is gravity real? Or is it just a label we put on the mathematics which aids us in understanding the world. Do we appeal to the epistemological or the ontological in scientific exploration? Hume believes we only see the effect and we conjecture the cause through habit, tradition and expectations. The math/physics explains the phenomena but is what we know about what we see the thing-behind-the-thing itself. Most people lean towards thinking that gravity is a real thing, a-thing-in-itself. That logic and Occam’s razor (essentially, the first sentence in this review) will make the Schrodinger’s Wave function real and give us Hugh Everett III’s MWI. Not as far out from standard physics as some who have not read this book will naively believe. I would rank this book as an outstanding pop-science book. I would highly recommend it to all. I usually get bored by most of the pop-science crap I read (Sturge’s Law: 90% of everything is crap). This book fired on all eight cylinders and didn’t miss a beat while explaining complicated physics with a focus toward understanding MWI and the epistemological and ontological (his words) foundations of physics including whether space and time are fundamental to the universe or are emergent properties. [A bracketed aside: the themes within in this book surprisingly correlate highly with the book German Idealism by Beiser]."

If you don't look at the math, you don't have a problem. So although I have loved several of Carroll's other books, I think this one is a failure. He spends the whole book trying to describe mathematical problems, and their (possible) mathematical solutions, without any mathematics. Which can't be done, so the reader learns very little about either the problems or the solutions. Read ""The Big Picture,"" and skip this one."
14,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22356256-kyle,5,"I think this is probably closer to a 4.5 star than 5 star rating for me, but I only have integer values. I have a lot of things I don't agree with Professor Carroll, but he has great explanations and makes it clear where he is speculating. That gets it the final star for me.Carroll is a very clear and lucid writer, and that is very helpful for a book like this. He goes over quantum mechanics, quantum interpretations, and a possible way to look at quantum gravity. This is all written excellently and engagingly. Carroll is a proponent of the Many Worlds Interpretation (MWI) or Everett interpretation. This interpretation says that we have the wavefunction, and when we apply the Schrödinger equation and get superposition, that is what happens. Our entire universe is a superposition of eigenstates of the Schrödinger equation. There are many branches that effectively never affect each other, and so we call each branch a separate universe. Hence many worlds/universes. I tend not to find this to be as convincing. I like Chad Orzel's Metaphorical Worlds Interpretation better, because this seems like a better way of understanding what is going on. MWI advocates tend to claim that this version is the simplest, because all we have is the Schrödinger equation. I think that they add extra suppositions about how to understand measurements as axioms. When we do measurements we don't see superpositions (whatever that would even mean), we see something happen with 100% probability. As Sabine Hossenfelder (and Peter Woit, and others) point out, the MWI proponent doesn't really solve this problem by saying on some branch the detector will see the measurement with 100%. But then, you need to update your calculations using the detector on the branch where the process did happen, then do calculations from there. Notice that figuring out which branch you are on does not involve solving the Schrödinger equation. There are reasonable ways of doing calculations from looking at branches, but this requires rules. Thus, saying that MWI only uses the Schrödinger equation seems incorrect to me. You still have to figure out which branch you are on in order to make predictions. The main point that everything is quantum (so we should try and derive classical results from quantum phenomena) seems sound though.I also am not so sure on the quantum foundations investigating people being looked down on angle. I'd like more historical proof than the anecdotes given in the book. Also, Peter Woit and others have shown that the quote about quantum foundations papers being blanket rejected by Physical Review is missing context that I think is crucial. It was not just about quantum foundations papers, but any papers and it is not clear it was implemented because of quantum foundations. (See the blog Not Even Wrong on ""Regarding Papers about Fundamental Theories"")My other critiques are that ""taking equations seriously"" seems like a slogan rather than a good thing. Maybe it is because I was trained as a computational physicist, but trusting equations often leads to numerical gobbledygook for solutions. You trust number crunching like that at your own risk, as you need initial conditions and all sorts of things to be right to ensure your equations go to the correct solution in the regime you are interested in. Equations seem to be approximations of reality no matter how deep we go, and so I remain distrustful of those who say we should trust the Schrödinger equation because it is ""exact"" (how would we know? clearly it is only an approximation, anyway, because of gravity...). Besides, if we think there is more than the Schrödinger equation to nature, then why would we take it as the equation to base all our physical intuitions off of?While I think looking at quantum foundations is a good thing, I don't think differing quantum interpretations seem all that much of a problem yet. When they yield different experimental results that can be tested, then I think it's a problem. Also, despite people loving to say that Newtonian physics doesn't have interpretational issues, I think there are big interpretational issues, it's just they have been superseded because we have better theories (special and general relativity and quantum physics) . Newtonian physics allows infinite velocities (thus you must know the state of everything in the universe to be sure that you can figure out what happens in the future or the past. Also, I mean that objects can be accelerated to arbitrary velocities in finite time), it can have solutions that are not unique (see Norton's dome), and as touched on in the book, force at a distance is a problem for gravitation in Newtonian physics if you believe in a certain type of locality. The quantum suicide discussion and problems of identity struck me as okay but not totally convincing. If you are okay with a being with essentially the same history and memories as you continuing to be conscious (whatever that means to you), then that will occur in the MWI and you can exploit that. If you are the type that is okay with a being with your memories (""you"" in probably all relevant senses), then the suicide experiment will work, but I see no reason why you would want to do it. You'd still hurt others that care about you and if you don't care about that, then you can just wait it out as you get old. You should expect to be the oldest person because the only beings with your memories that will remain will be those who grow to be the oldest person in their universe.A side question I have is why people don't worry about merging of branches. The book answers my question in one way, using an entropy metaphor (entropy must increase). But that is for the whole universe, and I can believe that about the MWI. But aren't there local cases where similar branches ""recohere""? Just as I can have a subsystem have its entropy decrease, but the overall entropy of the system increases?Despite my critiques, I would definitely recommend the book. It comes from an MWI advocate angle, but Carroll is usually careful about what he says and is simply an advocate and doesn't straw man his opponents. He even talks about superdeterminism without calling it a ""cosmic conspiracy"" which wins points from me (I'm not really an advocate of superdeterminism, but I think it gets an undeserved bad reputation). Plus the quantum gravity part is excellent. It points out it is speculative when it needs to, and explains fields and particles very well. Carroll answers many questions I have had about the MWI, and he certainly outlines why it's a reasonable position to take. I just don't think it's clear that it is the best interpretation. If you'd like to know more about MWI and quantum mechanics, this book is an excellent addition."

Something Deeply Hidden delivers what I was looking for. It strikes exactly the right tone as his breezy demeanor encompasses a deep dive that does not shy away from equations and competing theories.  Carroll is really rather heroic, clearly the in-group at physics conferences have disdain for those spending time talking about philosophical implications of discoveries on the quantum level. In addition, I can imagine his publisher reacting in horror upon seeing actual equations appear in a book meant to be friendly. Neither of these roadblocks deter him from coming through for us, his readers.  This clear-eyed courageous approach is also fundamental to the theory he adheres to. Kicking away the crutches of additional variables and boundaries meant to placate our unease at the seeming disconnect between our experience and quantum reality, Carroll goes all in. He cheerfully and logically gravitates to (sorry, had to do that) the Many Worlds theory because it is the most unencumbered and elegant.  “If we train ourselves to discard our classical prejudices, and take the lessons of quantum mechanics at face value, we may eventually learn how to extract our universe from the wave function.”"

One learns fair number of disparate facts but at least I failed to get even a vague understanding of his answer to the main question he raised at the start (I admit though that that could be due to my own deficiencies.There is a lot of interesting episodic material which reveals the uncritical conservative utilitarian bent of mainstream quantum physics."

At first glance, the subject matter seems too dense for a basic human without any scientific background. As you read, it slowly starts to make sense until you’re nodding along at things you never thought you’d learn.

"
23,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,4,"Something Deeply Hidden is a difficult book. I had to go through it twice back to back to understand only a small fraction of all that it tries to teach and convey. Only the first two paragraphs below are a review of the book, while the rest are my reflections on what I understood, I learned, I doubt and where I disagree.The book is not for the starters. The subject matter assumes extreme pre-knowledge of the early twentieth-century quantum mechanic ideas and evolution. For those well prepared too, there is a lot in the book which could prove incomprehensible. At times, the author is deliberately vague on the concrete meaning of the Everettian interpretation, the topic at the heart of the book. At others, the discussions on highly esoteric subjects like entanglement entropy, gravity quantization, or black hole radiation are so brief that only those extremely familiar have any hope of appreciating the points made.These are the same factors that make the book a wonderful one to learn from and reflect on. There are numerous radical and intriguing points made in every section. Anything straightforward, oft-repeated or universally accepted in other popular books is almost painstakingly kept out. Even without the usual anecdotal stories of how discoveries came about or various scientists' life stories, the author can keep even the most complex subject matter quite engaging.Now on to my thoughts and importantly, disagreements based on what I understood. I am an amateur on the subject. All my knowledge is non-technical and from popular books. The arguments must be full of errors. If nothing else, the amateurish language could cause many purists to suffer heart-attacks. However, it would be an unpardonable waste if I don't put down my thoughts after reading such a gem.A. Let's start at the beginning. The world is quantum.The book makes this point thoroughly. In common parlance, at the most fundamental microscopic level, fields, particles, space, and time are all digital. Nothing is continuous or analog. Let's call these basic quantum blocks of fundamental entities generically as ""quantas"" for the rest of this review.B. The quantum world is also randomThere is a probabilistic nature to the behavior of these quantas, including fields. This, in itself, is not random as quantum mechanics does a fantastic job explaining the contours of the probable modes of most quantas. However, somewhere - or somewhen - quantas move away from a superposition of probable modes or potentialities to definite states or actualities. We have little knowledge of how a particular mode comes into existence at the elimination of all other potentialities and what drives the transformation.In simpler terms, our world is a giant, unpredictably shape-shifting wave function. The function is fairly well known/knowable when the world or its constituents are in their probabilistic modes. The reality we experience is a single manifestation at micro and macro levels. We have no methods to understand how potentialities transform into specific manifestations.C. Does everything have to have human language epistemology?Quantum Mechanics works. The world is perhaps quite sufficiently described in its mathematical equations. Yet, understanding it, or converting the mathematical equations into a human language form has been proven impossible. The book tries hard by relying on the Everettian ""conversion"" for a common man understanding. It imparts a lot of knowledge and fails in even more!Before we return to some of these problems, we need to ask the question not asked in the book: is quantum mechanics necessarily understandable beyond its mathematical equations? Not everything is explainable in every language. Math cannot describe human feelings through equations. We do not attempt rational, existential discussion on why certain DNA base pair combinations result in certain diseases. No philosophers have spent a long time asking why hydrogen and oxygen molecules combine to give a water molecule of characteristics we observe. Many practitioners strongly believe that quantum mechanical equations are also in similar ontological domains. In their views, one cannot do much better than observe and learn from the details. Asking why for every quantum equation evolution is not much different from asking why on every phenomenal emergence one experiences in physics, chemistry or biology. The attempted human language answers appear silly to all but most ardent fans. The skeptics also wonder whether these forced and imposed - always unproven if not unprovable - understandings have any ability to enhance the real science. The proponents strongly differ, mainly on account of the failure of the theory in explaining gravity. The proponents feel that epistemological progress would help narrow the search on how we move towards the more encompassing theories, the way early-twentieth-century scientists did.D. The collapse, the entanglement, the decoherence, and so many words!As explained above, the epistemologists are stuck on the quantas' transformation from probabilistic stages to actual states. Experiments have repeatedly thrown highly counter-intuitive or unorthodox outcomes that do not require changes in the mathematical expressions but make our human language based understandings appear like deeply flawed. The explanations of the earliest and most famous such epistemologists, widely referred as the Copenhagen interpreters, are by now comprehensively dismissed. They mumbled about the ""collapse"" of the ""probabilistic wave function"" with ""observations"" of a ""conscious"" mind into a ""particular state.""To a cynic, The author's favorite Many World or Everettian interpretation does little other than have a new set of words...about the ""decoherence"" (instead of a ""collapse"") of a ""many world in superimpositions"" (another word for probabilistic wave function) with ""entanglements"" with ""macro environment"" into ""many world states"" of which only one we can observe.E. What is decoherence? And what is entanglement with the macro environment?One place where many world interpretation is different is in its post-collapse outcome: the branching and the existence of many worlds after the decoherence. Let's return to this vital difference later.To eliminate the Copenhagen consciousness, Many World resorts to entanglement with the macro environment without ever defining any of the terms. Decoherence explains hardly anything more than collapse based on what I understood in the book. If any interaction with the environment causes decoherence, one or both of the following issues arise:Environment or macro environment - that causes the entanglement, which leads to the decoherence - is everywhere as such. There is no existence without environment so when do quantas actually entangle and when do they not? Why do we observe any interference in a double slit as some or the other environment element should have ""entangled"" the spreading wave function even in the absence of observation devices and caused the traveling quantas' wave functions to decohere the way they do with observation devices? Or why are observation devices the right enough macro ""environment"" with which quantas entangle and decohere but your atmosphere in the lab is not?From a decohered state, when does a single field or particle recohere and again exhibit wave-like properties? Without recoherence, everything should have decohered right at the first Big Bang moment when everything interacted with anything or everything else and it was one big, thick environment where quantas had little space to be all alone in the cohered state?F. Many Worlds: what do they do?Everettians strongly believe in branching and continuous existence of probabilistic modes post the decoherence - although no longer in superposition post the entanglement but in their splendid and parallel isolation.And they fail to see why the rest of us fail to see the futility of creations of 2^10^122 or more worlds?Our world is a state of the evolving universal wave function as it settles on a set of actualities from erstwhile probabilities. Many World either means the other potential actuality sets are in existence and evolution or simply a convenient way of thinking. The author and his Many World believing philosophers deliberately choose not to answer this simple question of belief one way or the other.If the near-infinite or infinite parallel worlds are uncountable, unobservable, and unusable, how are they any less fanciful or more useful than the Copenhageners' consciousness? One spends an enormous amount of time debating the size of the Hilbert Space rather than trying to guess the theories that might attempt to explain the collapse and the observed state after.Everettians claim that their interpretation is an austere quantum theory. It allows one to accept the quantum field equations as fully explained without the need to add any more variables. One wonders how this is different from the ""shut up and calculate"" practitioners when the interpretation is so much nothing more than just a set of fanciful, untestable words.Alternate theories that rely on only observations or attempt to introduce an additional probabilistic function for decoherence make far more sense.G. Entanglement entropy is not the same as ordinary entropyThe author goes at great length in drawing parallels between thermodynamic entropy with a relatively new quantum concept of entanglement entropy. There is a fascinating chapter of a discussion between Alice and her Dad where the author asserts that entanglement entropy, as driven by the entanglements responsible for decoherence, was low to start with and is continuously increasing. Despite the strong arguments, this might be a promising and extremely unbaked concept. It is anything but a proven fact like the celebrated thermodynamic counterpart.Quantum theory, as we know, is yet to accommodate gravity. It is a theory of particles in a particular space rather than one of space. It treats time differently within this space. It does not have any flexibility as it stands now to equate time to space. The author does well in stretching the theory of quantum fields to speculate on how gravity could come in. But the discussion turns extremely cumbersome due to the lack of concrete evidence as the final chapters wear on.Quantum fields don't have a single wave function as a classical field. A quantum field has modes of different waves with the modes having their own probabilistic quantum wave function. They decohere randomly to assume a specific observed classical field quation with entanglements although these field entanglements/decoherence are even less specified than the much-discussed quantum particle decoherence. In quantum entropy, the author begins by describing how quantum fields are entangled with other quantum fields and defines distance (and hence space) as the level or the extent of entanglement between fields. The approach is used to conjecture how gravity could come in with this method in the same global wave function. I hope to read the author's future work, where he further develops the details of decoherence and entanglement or entanglement entropy to overcome all the doubts I have at the end of this book. A great new subject matter, but incomplete."
24,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17468009-galen-weitkamp,4,"Something Deeply Hidden: Quantum Worlds and the Emergence of Spacetime By Sean Carroll.Review by Galen Weitkamp.Sean Carroll is a Research Professor of Physics at Caltech and the Santa Fe Institute. I remember waiting, back in 2004, for the publication of his textbook (Spacetime and Geometry) on general relativity. In spite of the mathematical intricacies of tensor calculus, Professor Carroll’s exposition is clear and intuitive. It has become my standard reference on matters of gravity. Something Deeply Hidden has no mathematics. It is both a book for a more general audience, and also a serious book addressed to current researchers. Regardless of the audience to which you belong, if this book is on your reading list, then you are likely already aware that quantum theory is associated with a number of perplexing interpretative issues, paradoxes and problems: the measurement problem, wave function collapse, cats in superposition, non-locality, hidden variables and multiple worlds to list a few. These are often considered annoying philosophical problems which have little bearing on the practical applications and the everyday work of research in physics. In this book, Dr. Carroll suggests this is not the case and urges his colleagues to pay closer attention to the foundational issues.Most physicists will agree that the spin of an electron may simultaneously be both clockwise and counterclockwise around a given axis. Until the spin around that axis is measured the spin of such an electron is neither one nor the other but a weighted superposition of both. On the scale of ordinary objects such descriptions make little sense. We’ve never seen a spinning figure skater in that kind of quantum superposition. Yet one can imagine a physicist figure skater who measures the spin of just such an electron to decide whether to twirl clockwise or counterclockwise. If the measurement and pirouette are executed in an isolated setting did the measurement collapse the electron’s superposition or is the figure skater too (like Schrodinger’s Cat) now in quantum superposition? Is she spinning clockwise and counterclockwise until her colleague walks in observes the direction of her spin? Does the colleague collapse the superposition or is the colleague now in quantum superposition too; i.e., both in the state of seeing his colleague twirl in one direction and the state of seeing her spin in the other direction? It’s easy to see that wave function collapse is a problematic concept. Is it even a thing? Dr. Carroll would say no, it isn’t a thing; that wave collapse, hidden variables and epistemic approaches to resolving the measurement problem offend Occam’s maxim of minimality either by making additional assumptions (in the case of wave function collapse) or by making additional ontological commitments (in the case of hidden variables). For Dr. Carroll, the only two things quantum theory requires is a state space (of wave functions) and a deterministic transition function (the Schrodinger equation) that determines how a given state evolves through time. All else is at best superfluous, at worst problematic or inconsistent. If this is the case, then measurements don’t collapse wave functions. Observing that your colleague is spinning clockwise doesn’t change the fact that her spin-state is actually a weighted superposition of both clockwise and counterclockwise. But how does one square this description of her spin with your observation that she’s spinning clockwise? The answer is that you’re in superposition too, and the two components of your state are demonstrably incommunicado. Technically you, your colleague, the skating rink , etc., have become entangled with the electron’s spin and the wave function has decohered. Entanglement and decoherence are not extra-quantum concepts added to the theory to explain the measurement problem but are phenomena that are derivable from the minimal apparatus consisting of the state-space and the Schrodinger equation. So there is one component of the evolving wave-function that describes you seeing your colleague twirling clockwise and another component that describes you observing the opposite. This is what is known as the many-worlds interpretation of quantum theory (first proposed by Hugh Everett in 1955).What I like (what Dr. Carroll likes) about the many-worlds scenario is its logical efficacy. It uses a minimal number of assumptions. It may seem, however, that it has a maximal ontology (i.e., lots and lots of branching worlds). But the existence of these worlds is not presumed. The only ontological presumption is that there is only one wave-function. It just happens to evolve deterministically and predictably via the Schrodinger equation into multiple branching components that are best interpreted, treated or thought of as distinct worlds. I must admit that it’s tempting to treat all the other components of the wave function (i.e., all the other worlds) as unimportant mathematical fictions. Just ignore them. Pretend only the observed component exists and go on from there. Dr. Carroll disagrees.We have been able to formulate field theories consistent with quantum theory by tweaking the classical formulations. However, all attempts to ‘quantize’ Einstein’s classical theory of gravity have, so far, failed to reconcile general relativity with quantum theory. Nevertheless the two theories have had some friendly encounters, Hawking’s analysis of blackhole evaporation for example. In 1995 Ted Jacobson demonstrated that Einstein’s field equations can be derived from an assumption relating quantum entanglement entropy to the areas of infinitesimal volumes. Carroll suggests we may make progress by starting with quantum theory first and deriving a theory of the gravitational field from it. Perhaps the spatial metric (which is the classical gravitational field) can be derived from the wave-function using Jacobson’s assumption that connects the entanglement entropy of the wave-function with the metric via the areas of infinitesimal volumes. Perhaps, and this is Carroll’s greater hope, the notion of space itself emerges from the wave-function of the universe when viewed on the appropriate scale. But, Carroll warns, such an approach requires researchers to take the foundations of quantum theory seriously.As always, Carroll’s writing is cheerful, lucid, insightful and captivating. Something Deeply Hidden is a worthwhile read. "
25,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34033-john-devlin,3,"So you think you know quantum and then this guy comes along or the next chapter appears. The thesis is there’s nothing wrong with the many world theorem simply because our human brains aren’t fond of the notion of alternate Realities. That’s not invalidating and doesn’t make it wrong or incomplete.I agree. The same argument could be made against certain areas of relativity.My questions arise when the idea of many worlds bumps up against Martin Rees book on the singular qualities that this universe needs to exist and create sentient beings. Don’t misunderstand, the measuring phenomenon of quantum doesn’t need a human at a microscope, where I become extremely skeptical is when physicists simply dismiss the singularity of a functioning universe by claiming there are near infinite or infinite worlds and we are just suffering from the bias of being the one universe that we exist in.Saying that seems contrived is an understatement. Is there a universe where I have the powers of Thor? What about one where a portal opens up and sucks me in to a world similar to marvels endgame. I’m not wrong that quantum posits that those worlds exist, but I don’t think they do, which brings us back to one world vs the fuzziness of quantum."

He highlights how this approach is the natural, straightforward response to the remarkable success of the quantum formalism. Despite its apparent profligacy of multiple worlds (multiple diverging branches of reality), it's actually a lean and austere interpretation of quantum mechanics. Unique among interpretations of quantum mechanics, it adds in *nothing* beyond the wave equation itself.Back in the 1980s I spent four years mulling the philosophical implications of quantum mechanics. Over time, against my initial inclinations (and hopes), I came to have an increasing respect for the Everett understanding - an outcome I wrote about at https://dw2blog.com/2008/11/16/schrod.... Alongside my grudging respect for that interpretation, I retained the view that it still faced many hard questions. However, Carroll's book has convinced me that these questions aren't particularly hard. In other words, the book has strengthened my conviction that these ""Many Worlds"" do come into being whenever quantum transactions are macroscopically magnified.In terms of the history of the topics covered, and the pros and cons of the different interpretations reviewed, I see Carroll as being overwhelmingly correct. I particularly liked his demolition of the idea that there's such a thing as a coherent ""Copenhagen interpretation"" of quantum mechanics. The only area where I wanted to see the argument extended was that more could have been said about how all the non-Everett interpretations of quantum mechanics have to accept one or other kind of radical non-locality (despite the attempts of various writers to ""have their cake and eat it"").The final third of the book may be the most important. It reviews the possibility for progress in an area of physics that has long experienced troubles: quantum gravity. Carroll argues that the best hopes for us obtaining a correct quantum theory of gravity (that works at all energy scales) is to take quantum mechanics itself more seriously. This part of the book is more speculative than the earlier parts, but it has raised my interest in delving more into these topics.This final part of the book also underlines the difficulties faced by the non-Everett interpretations of quantum mechanics in dealing, not with particles, but with the relativistic fields which modern physics views as being more fundamental than particles. This part also reviews how space and time should emerge from the theory of quantum gravity, rather than being presupposed as the canvas upon which the theory would operate. Some of the potential implications for black holes (and maybe even the Big Bang) are mind-stretching.It's a shocking possibility that each of us exist alongside with numerous different versions of ourselves, in the overall multiverse - versions that have increasingly divergent experiences. This possibility is one of the most important insights to have arisen from humanity's millennia-long exploration into science. It's an insight that takes time to sink in. It's a good question how much this insight should change our day-to-day behaviour. Carroll has an answer to that too: not as much as we might first think. Personally I find it a humbling realisation.For another book that addresses some of the same topics - inside an even larger set of profound ideas - I recommend ""Our mathematical universe"" by Max Tegmark https://dw2blog.com/2014/01/30/a-bril...."

31,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2167338-david-agranoff,4,"This book is not for everyone. Sean Carroll is an author I reviewed before with his epic book about the universe the Big Picture. I feel more deeply connected to this author because I know his voice well. I listen every week to his podcast mindscape that I often describe as Sean Carrol talks to other geniuses. I was familiar with these ideas and the many-worlds theories before not just as a Carroll podcast listener but as a huge Sci-fi nerd and Philip K Dick Podcaster. We have talked about Many-worlds in a pseudo-science 60's way a lot.I am not going to pretend for one minute that I am able to process more than the basic ideas here. I read this book quickly because whenever math or the Nitty-Gritty of how particles spin. I really enjoyed the history of discovery and how Carroll weaves the methods that the greats in science came to the various theories that make Quantum science. I know this will sound corny but my love for this topic has roots in my favorite childhood horror movie John Carpenter's Prince of Darkness that was the first place that a young me heard of Quantum psychics. This is primarily an introduction to one of the most debated issues in the study of spacetime, as such I think it is a good introduction but the big bottom line in this review do you enjoy this stuff? I do and still felt the need to skip a few parts. I enjoy Sean Carroll's books because he helps takes universe-spanning Ideas and boils them down. Separated into three sections, part one is where we get the majority of the history. This part is called Spooky based on the idea that even Einstein in the early days found these issues to be hard to deal with. In this section, Carroll sets up the questions that we are going to ponder. The second part is called Splitting and gets into what it all means. Part three Spacetime is where most of the interesting theories happen. The most interesting concepts for me were near the end. ""It is plausible that the symmetry between space and time that we are familiar with from relativity isn't built into Quantum Gravity."" Oh no he didn't? Was there more to the universe than Einstein could see? sure and towards the end Carroll questions if Space is even part of the equation and this tiny level. Another part I enjoyed was one of the last chapters that explained more of the science behind Black holes, as Hawking was quoted in the book Black holes ain't so black. I enjoyed Carroll's last book more than this one but that could have as much to do with the epic themes of that one. This one was designed to be a purely academic exercise, while the Big Picture dealt with the point where the rubber meets the road between cosmology and philosophy. "
32,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6953429-elazar,2,"I had high hopes for this book especially because I am a long-time listener and admirer of Sean‘s podcasts. Unfortunately, I felt like I was reading a preacher’s sermon on why the Many Worlds theory is the “truth” and why every other theory is wrong. I wasn’t convinced. "
33,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85852005-sato,5,"I personally find Everettian quantum mechanics, and all the many worlds that it implies, to be by far the most plausible version of quantum theory that I know of. And this book mainly tries to present an understandable version of quantum mechanics and to show that everything is basically quantum and drawing a line between the classical world and quantomic world is not quiet sensible. But the other notion that Sean Carroll tries to show us is this Feynman’s famous quote: “ No one truly understands Quantum mechanics”, and we already have a lot to know about it specially when we try to describe spacetime and the notions in the quantum field theory and the quantum theory of gravity. For many years now, the search for a complete and compelling quantum theory of gravity has been recognized as an important scientific goal.Here is a general idea of Quantum mechanics 1.Set up the system by fixing a specific wave function Ψ.2. Evolve the system using Schrödinger’s equation.3. There are certain observable quantities we can choose to measure, such as position, and when we do measure them, we obtain definite results.4. The probability of getting any one particular result can be calculated from the wave function. The wave function associates an amplitude with every possible measurement outcome; the probability for any outcome is the square of that amplitude.5. Upon measurement, the wave function collapses. However spread out it may have been pre-measurement, afterward it is concentrated on the result we obtained(Measurement Problem). To get a general idea of Everett’s Many-Worlds interpretation as an alternative to the measurement problem and equally as the gist of Sean’s efforts all along the book, I tried to bring the general approach of Everettian quantum mechanics in Sean Carol’s words(slightly changed). Many-Worlds Before the measurement happens, there is one electron and one observer. After they interact, however, rather than thinking of that one observer having evolved into a superposition of possible states, we could think of them as having evolved into multiple possible observers. The right way to describe things after the measurement, in this view, is not as one person with multiple ideas about where the electron was seen, but as multiple worlds, each of which contains a single person with a very definite idea about where the electron was seen.Here’s the big reveal: what we’ve described as austere quantum mechanics is more commonly known as the Everett, or Many-Worlds, formulation of quantum mechanics, first put forward by Hugh Everett in 1957. The Everett view arises from a fundamental annoyance with all of the special rules about measurements that are presented as part of the standard textbook quantum recipe, and suggests instead that there is just a single kind of quantum evolution. The price we pay for this vastly increased elegance of theoretical formalism is that the theory describes many copies of what we think of as “the universe,” each slightly different, but each truly real in some sense. Whether the benefit is worth the cost is an issue about which people disagree. (It is.)"
34,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47544933-jose-rodriguez,5,"I think that Sean Carroll is one of the best “popularizers” of physics I have ever encountered. One could argue that such popularizations are like cartoon versions of literature classics, and in some ways they are. But if done well, they can bring an understanding of the “forest” that could be lost when engaged in the particularities of the mathematical “trees.” On this book, Carroll tackles the foundations of quantum mechanics, a problem from the very beginning of the field and which many physicists feel is not relevant to the calculations and experiments they carry out. Who cares if we can’t figure out what is the wave function collapse that happens after a measurement, as proposed by the so-called “Copenhagen interpretation”, if we have done extremely well without worrying about it?But some people would find this attitude deeply unsatisfactory, since it results in no understanding of the nature of reality, and the judgement by Richard Feynman that nobody really understands quantum mechanics.One of the most popular solutions has been the Many Worlds interpretation that Hugh Everett III proposed in the 1950’s, which was ignored or ridiculed by many physicists, resulting in Everett working in the defense industry after his PhD, and maybe contributing to his early death due to alcohol and other unhealthy habits, But recently there has been a resurgence of interest in these ideas, partly due to their relevance to a formulation of quantum gravity. And Sean Johnson comes out in this book as a major proponent of the Everett interpretation. It is a very difficult endeavor, and I’m not sure that he was completely successful in achieving the goal. And because he only uses words, I found that some of the concepts remained unclear, which made me wish for a lot of equations on the pages. Things get worse when the discussion turns into philosophical issues of ontology and epistemology, in which I found it very difficult to “disentangle” my thinking. The rock bottom is the chapter that tackles whether this view impacts our thinking about morality (it doesn’t). I wish that he would have stayed the course along the lines of his statement at different points that we are not really required to think about many worlds in the Everett picture. The main point is that we accept a universal wave function which evolves in accordance with Schroedinger’s equation, and from which descriptions of measurements, particles, and even space emerge (emergence is discussed in detail in his previous book “The Big Picture”). What convinced me to give this book five stars is its provocative discussion about new ways of thinking about reality. The last chapters discussing space, time, black holes, holographic picture, etc. of course do not present new solutions (they do not exist at this point), but are very successful in raising questions and introducing concepts that continue to make physics such an exciting field, at least for me.Now I should look for the equations, except that I don’t think I have the time nor the energy to do so."
35,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1680974-alex-zakharov,4,"A good non-technical introduction to quantum mechanics with heavy emphasis on Everettian interpretation. Carroll gives a brief history of the field including the 1927 Solvay conference, Einstein-Bohr debates, and personalities of the key players (Pauli, Schrodinger, Heisenberg, de Broglie). He then quickly goes over the basics that you need to follow the rest of the book – superposition, entanglement, Born rule, Wave Function, Hamiltonian, decoherence.Carroll quickly moves on to the measurement problem and describes both its well-known interpretations (“Copenhagen”, “Pilot Wave/Hidden Variables”, “Many Worlds”) and the relatively more recent Dynamical collapse and QBism theories. You get a good intuition for the theories themselves and pros/cons of each.As expected, he spends a fair amount of time on Everettian interpretation, of which he is a well-known proponent. Here we get a healthy dose of branching, decoherence, and wave function evolution. Carroll makes a case that technically the approach is pure (“austere” is his go-to word), and acknowledges that the amount of cognitive dissonance from reconciling this purity with observable reality is uncanny. He suggests a few cognitive tricks to reduce that dissonance, and some of them almost help. In the last part of the book we revisit quantum field theory (which is very nicely covered in his previous books btw), and start talking about theoretical physicists’ holy grail - quantum gravity. Carroll briefly explains how other fundamental forces were quantized, and why quantizing gravity is damn hard. We get a mention of String theory and a classy dis of AdS/CFT correspondence (field’s only lamp post in a drunken man’s parking garage). But there is hope still. Carroll is part of the wave of physicists who are becoming increasingly convinced that quantizing gravity will not happen. Instead we should derive spacetime itself from quantum mechanics, which would give us gravity on a quantum mechanical platter. Susskind & Maldacena’s 2013 “ER=EPR” paper is an obvious step in that direction, and Carroll’s thinking runs along similar lines. Space and locality is sorta-kinda like entanglement, and time is sorta-kinda like growth of the entanglement. (In Susskind’s case time is sorta-kinda like growth of quantum complexity). The first half of the book gets 5 stars – informative, mostly clear, fun to read. But, as we get into the second half, explanations start running away a bit. Carroll brings some back, but many escape. The fix is obvious - include equations in the text. Fine, if you don’t include equations in a popular science book so be it, but then providing more pictorial illustrations is a must."
36,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41901229-gary-moreau,4,"Given all the hoopla about science and technology of late, I set off about a year ago to find books that might help me to understand just exactly how far along scientists are in truly understanding our universe and thus being able to manipulate its course. And what could be more cutting edge than quantum physics, although the basics have been around for a century or more.Carroll is an accomplished theoretical physicist at the California Institute of Technology and a well-established author. He is also a proponent of the Many-Worlds school of the quantum world. (Yes, you exist in many worlds but you will never meet yourself.) The book is well written and intended for an audience broader than the professional physicist. And bravo for that. Alas, however, try as he might, this book will be a slog for the average lay reader. The physics that most of us learned in school is all about particles. Quantum physics, on the other hand, is all about waves and fields. In such a fluid world, the sheer act of measuring something, changes whatever it is we’re measuring. (Akin to trying to catch the proverbial greased pig.)Part of the problem that scientists, particularly physicists, face is that their only vehicle for communicating what they learn is language. But language is a human convention. It is not of nature like oxygen and rain. And it is, by definition, symbolic. That’s why we invented it, to facilitate communication.The universe, however, is not a human convention. It is nature itself. Nor is it symbolic. It is the universe. That’s about as real as it gets.Scientists attempt to get around this by creating their own language and system of notation. It sounds impressive, but it doesn’t quite bridge the gap. “Is the picture we’ve sketched, where the entanglement between degrees of freedom somehow comes together to define the geometry of our approximately classical spacetime, actually on the right track?” He ultimately answers that complex question with the simplest of answer. “Nobody knows for sure.”In the end, my conclusion is that scientists are not as far along as many would have us believe. They know a lot, and there are many brilliant minds working through the issues, but “a lot” is a relative calibration. There is much they don’t know. In a way, I admit, that is reassuring to me. I am not a religious man. I am, however, a philosopher. I am comfortable with the unknown. The great unknown gives us something to think about. And it’s the thinking, rather than the ultimate conclusion, which I have come to believe is the true essence of knowledge.A very worthwhile book but you have to be willing to put in the effort."
37,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5469227-d-l-morrese,4,"Sean Carroll is a well-known and respected theoretical physicist, and I am in no way qualified to review his book. I did read it, however, and I did enjoy it, in a way. What I enjoyed mostly, I think, was the thought that some very clever people probably understand it. Sadly, I can't say I'm one of them. There are three reasons for this: I don't have a background in quantum mechanics, I'm not especially brilliant, and I don't think my mind is flexible enough to wrap around most of the ideas presented. None of these are the fault of the book, hence my 4-star rating. The point Dr. Carroll is making, as best I can tell, is that reality, in all its apparent wild complexity and diversity is, in fact, simply the wave function of the universe evolving in accordance with Schrödinger's equation. Like, duh! Why didn't I think of that?Just kidding. I have only a vague idea what that even means. What Dr. Carrol thinks it means (or at least what I think he thinks it means) is that truly quantum phenomena cause the universal wave function to split or branch, which results in two equally real universes where before there was only one...not that anyone notices, or can notice, or even know which one they are in.... I can understand the idea of branching. Actually, it's what the late, great Terry Pratchett used as a premise in his books Jingo and Night Watch. (Excellent stories with cops, robbers, revolution, and a special, magical kind of physics set in a wonderfully imaginative fantasy world. I highly recommend them. But, I digress. Back to the subject at hand...) The creation of multiple worlds every time an entangled particle is seen to spin one way when it could equally have been observed to spin another seems to be a rather inefficient way of constructing a universe, but I'm willing to go along with it if it's all backed up with a sound theory and some supporting observations. After reading this book, I'm still not sure it is. Again, probably not the fault of the book, and it makes a great premise for a good story."
38,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/106439976-axel-brambila,4,"Since the dawn of time, humans have tried to figure out how the world works. Countless theories have been created to simplify the world for us. This book talks about how the world looks quantumly, or to the smallest spectrum. For instance, we know that Earth turns counter-clockwise to the sun but what are the atoms doing when this happens. Quantum physics in this book is explained well enough for anyone to understand what we've learned. However, it is a matter of how motivated you are to learn about the subject, because you will oftentimes find yourself rereading paragraphs in order to fully understand. The book sometimes even surfaces starter physics topics, which might affect the reading of an experienced physics student. The contents of the book range from how much we don't know, different theorys, and space-time. I enjoyed the book as it was a great learning experience. The many different theories were enjoyable to learn about; with the many-worlds theory being my favorite because of its craziness. The world splitting into different realities like a cell dividing is a real possibility, and it is scary finding out how little we know about the world. The state of quantum physics now is like the average person using a phone. We know how to use it, but we don't know what is actually going on in the inside. Overall, I gave this book a 4/5 because it made learning quantum physics enjoyable."
39,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98493136-martin-reader,4,"This is a good book. It covers not only the subject of quantum mechanics, but the history as well. He provides a reach history of the discussions between Neils Bohr and Albert Einstein. Bohr favored using quantum mechanics to drive innovation. And it certainly did – from nuclear weapons, to computes to electronics advancements, quantum mechanics has delivered much. But Einstein’s issue was not with what quantum mechanics could explain, he wanted to know why quantum mechanics worked. The field of quantum foundations – why the world behaves in a quantum fashion – was largely ignored for decades. It was not until 1957 when Hugh Everett developed the many worlds approach, that the topic began to be discussed again. Carroll explains how observations and experiments continue to support the Everett model of many worlds. The arguments are sometimes difficult to follow, but as he points out, Richard Feynman once said “I think I can safely say that no one understands quantum mechanics.” "
40,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15709090-cole,3,"As some other reviewers have remarked, I found the first third (maybe even half?) of Carroll’s latest book to be an enthralling ride, but it quickly took off without me thereafter. Things become pretty impenetrable for a book marketed as a popular science read, even taking into consideration the unintuitive nature of any discussion of quantum mechanics.It’s a shame, as Carroll has proven himself capable at explaining complex topics with ease and charm, and the concept of Many Worlds is fascinating to say the least. What I’m missing here is that quality being consistent across the book. (To be clear, I can’t imagine what an incredible challenge this would be.)For readers with more than an armchair physics nerd’s knowledge, I’m sure this could easily be a 4 or 5 star read."

I'm not sure why. The content was somewhat interesting, but ""Many Worlds"" reminds me a bit of String Theory in that they are both a bit far-fetched. I'm not saying that they can't be. I'm just saying that it's a bit much to swallow. Maybe classic Physics and a slight lean toward empiricism is holding me back a bit. I believe Carroll knew when he wrote this book that many would suffer from my affliction.But hey... there are stranger things and all that, Horatio. ;)"

Disclaimer: I had not been familiar with anything concerning quantum physics before reading this.This book introduces to you a theory of many worlds, which is on its own really amazing. The problem is in our human brains - it is not that easy for us to grasp the concept of spatial infinity. Even harder problem is accepting the concept of branching. But when you admit it could be true (I still have no idea if everything is as described or everything works completely differently), a world... Wait, many worlds of amazing possibilities opened up.

But I think it is still ok to read: ""I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics."" - Richard FeynmanIt is a bit hard to accept Many-Worlds interpretation with our (at least my) current understandings of our mind, our life and our world.

57,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73419547-doctor-moss,5,"Quantum theory is frustrating. That’s probably a laughable understatement, especially for a non-physicist like me. After all, Richard Feynman famously said, “I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics.”As Sean Carroll points out, physicists are themselves encouraged to treat quantum mechanics as a basis for calculations more than as a description of reality. Those who venture into questions about the reality that quantum theory describes or the “meaning” of quantum mechanics are venturing into “quantum foundations,” a potentially disreputable and risky neighborhood.That’s what Carroll does here, presenting and arguing for the Everett or “Many Worlds” interpretation of quantum theory. We owe Hugh Everett credit for originating that interpretation in 1957, by contrast with the traditionally dominant Copenhagen interpretation, championed by Werner Heisenberg in collaboration if not always agreement with Niels Bohr. According to the Copenhagen interpretation and the Everett interpretation as well, quantum phenomena, e.g., the position, momentum, or spin of a particle such as an electron, are described by a wave function rather than, classically, by determinate, discrete values. I won’t try to explain why this is so — that would strain both the limits of a review and my understanding. For that, Carroll’s book does a good job. The wave function spreads such values as position, momentum, and spin across possible values, and it is not until a property such as those is “measured” that the value becomes determinate and distinct. It is not just that we don’t know the value until it is measured — it doesn’t exist until it is measured.Part of the difficulty in understanding this aspect of quantum theory, as Carroll explains, is that we tend to cling to a classical description of reality as made up of tiny bits of matter — “particles” in that classical sense. But particles, at least on some readings of quantum theory, really are wave functions. Their behavior isn’t just described by a wave function — they ARE wave functions. That’s where, I think, the difficulty in understanding quantum mechanics as a true description of reality begins. A wave function, after all, is a mathematical entity.But that’s just the beginning. Next comes “entanglement.” Again, please excuse the compressed explanation — Carroll does a much better job. Two particles, e.g., photons or electrons, can become “entangled” via various naturally occurring methods. Photons for example can create “entangled” pairs of electrons and positrons when passing through the nucleus of an atom. The two particles comprise a system with a net neutral charge and zero spin. If we then measure the spin of the electron and find it clockwise, we know that if we measure the spin of the positron, it will be counterclockwise. The tricky part is, of course, that the spin of the electron, before it is measured is neither clockwise nor counterclockwise. It becomes one or the other only upon measurement. Now, suppose that the electron and positron pair, since their generation, have grown far apart in distance from one another. The measurement of one of the pair, given their entangled state, will not only determine the spin of that one particle, but also, apparently instantaneously, the spin of the other. This is what upset Einstein as “spooky action at a distance.” It seems to defy both common sense and the constraint set by the speed of light as the maximum speed at which a causal influence can be transmitted — in this case, the effect (the direction of spin of the second particle) seems to be generated instantaneously by the cause (the direction of spin of the first particle).It is at this point that the Copenhagen and Everett interpretations diverge. On the Copenhagen interpretation, when the measurement occurs (which could be performed by a human observer or by an instrument of one sort or another), the wave function of the particle is said to “collapse.” It resolves uniquely to the value obtained by the measurement. End of story (except for entanglement and other difficult to swallow aspects of the theory as a whole).According to the Everett interpretation, the wave function does not collapse to a unique, single value — rather it “branches” into multiple worlds in which different possible values hold. In one world, the one we continue in, the electron has a clockwise spin, but in another that branches away from ours, it has a counterclockwise spin.That may sound outrageous and “metaphysical,” but there is, Carroll maintains, a solid rationale behind it. The Copenhagen interpretation treats the measurement, and the entanglement as a separate system from the observer or measuring device. In fact, the measuring device or observer is treated as part of a classically defined physical space, without entanglement with the quantum phenomenon being measured. By contrast, the Everett interpretation imposes no such seemingly ad hoc boundary between the measuring and the phenomenon measured. Rather than a wave function confined to the measured system, Everett’s wave function is “universal” — all phenomena in the universe are treated as at least potentially in entangled relationships comprising a single system. When a measurement is made, that universe is branched, and values not obtained in this universe are realized in other worlds. Since measurement itself — the fixing of a value on a quantum phenomenon — happens naturally and frequently (many, many, many times per second), the number of worlds, or branchings, that have taken place since the time of the Big Bang, is very, very, very large — Carroll gives a quick approximate calculation of two to the tenth to the 112 worlds. Hence the name “Many Worlds.”In fact, as Carroll explains, entanglement is a pervasive property, at the submicroscopic quantum level. The natural processes that produce it are part of the equally pervasive interactions among the quantum particles that underlie the experienced universe.His arguments in favor of the Everett interpretation, you may begin to realize, are methodological, even philosophical. Carroll is well-versed in some of the relevant works in philosophy of science and logic, giving him the background support he needs in order to make an Occam’s Razor inspired defense of the Everett interpretation as one that hews most closely to the well-ordered and empirically validated core of quantum theory — the wave function and entanglement. Other interpretations, including not only the Copenhagen interpretation but others briefly discussed in a chapter on alternatives, tend to introduce ad hoc entities, values, or assumptions in order to make the theory more containable within expectations and mathematical standards. I should mention in passing that one of these alternative interpretations that Carroll discusses is an “epistemic” interpretation. An “epistemic” interpretation is one in which the theory is viewed not so much as describing reality as describing our knowledge of reality. Interpretations that claim that quantum theory describes reality per se are called “ontic” by contrast. Epistemic interpretations, including the Copenhagen interpretation as read by many, draws back from what you might call a realist or even metaphysical claim (using “metaphysical” in the philosophical sense of pertaining to a reality independent of our ideas, thoughts, or knowledge of it). But Carroll is answering, in part, a challenge posed by Einstein in his objections to the Copenhagen interpretation. Einstein had objected both to its violation of “locality” (i.e., instantaneous action over distances) and to its failure to provide a comprehensible description of reality. The Everett interpretation does accept the violation of locality, so Einstein would not be pleased.Does it provide a comprehensible description of reality? It’s hard to say so, until we understand what “many worlds” really means. How do we give that concept itself an “ontic” interpretation? I don’t know, and that’s something that Carroll doesn’t venture far into. He does, in a footnote, distinguish “Many Worlds” from “Multiverse” where the latter has a quasi-spatial understanding, as separate regions of or domains of a kind of meta-space (or spacetime). He means something else. And he includes a chapter that attempts to resolve some of the vertigo we get when we imagine ourselves as part of this universe that is constantly branching into more and more worlds. What becomes of me? Well, there’s another me, but a different me, experiencing some other world. There are certainly uses of “world” that would seem to resonate with this idea of “many worlds” — the “possible worlds” discussed in philosophical logic and the mathematical spaces discussed in theoretical math. But none of those are going to meet a middling standard of intuitiveness or provide a kind of realist “ontic” feel. And I don’t think Carroll really helps us with that problem.The final third or so of the book carries on from the Everett interpretation to an even more speculative discussion of how spacetime itself might be generated from quantum theory. The discussion brings back the Einsteinian concept of locality to generate an idea of spatial separation as a matter of decreasing entanglement — in simplistic terms, spatial distance is generated as a decrease in the degree of entanglement of the particles making up the universe. As with much of quantum theory, in this speculative story about the origin of spacetime, it’s difficult to tell where we are telling a story of how the math that describes reality is generated and where we are telling a story that describes how the reality itself is generated. In any case, maybe despite the book’s subtitle, the heart of the book is Carroll’s presentation and argument for the Everett interpretation.Who is this book for? It’s going to be taxing for anyone who wants to read casually. As with any book on quantum theory, it is conceptually demanding. This stuff is hard to think about. And the concepts come fast and hard at times. You’ll have to put some effort into it. It isn’t mathematically challenging. There are, as I noticed them anyway, only two mathematical formulas in the book — Schrodinger’s wave function formula and Einstein’s for the curvature of spacetime. But these are offered really only as illustrations, not as formulas the reader needs to understand in any detail.I’m not a specialist, so I won’t try to say much about the interest that physicists themselves may take. I think, for many, it may be a broadening experience to reflect on the “meaning” of quantum theory.I enjoyed the book. There are a lot of books on quantum theory that rely heavily on metaphor and attempts to reduce the unintuitive to the intuitive. Carroll doesn’t do that, so I believe I’m actually experiencing how he, as a quantum theorist, thinks about what he is working on. The cost may be that, although my understanding of quantum theory and its “meaning” are much greater for having read the book, the holes in my understanding (and in the account I’ve given here) are more glaring to me."
58,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29467608-serro,2,"This might have been too technical for me, or otherwise for really advanced science readers which I might not be.Quantum mechanics and quantum field theory is central to the book and the author expands a lot on the many worlds theory. I was lost on the concept of branching and how it could progressively produce multiple copies of ourselves on different branches. Still, this lead me to the idea of a multiverse and that is mind-blowing whichever way you look at it.Style-wise the author has tried indeed to the extent that he decided to integrate a dialogue on quantum mechanics between a father and his daughter, simply to make it more literary elegant with mixed effect."
59,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57803005-tomas-sedovic,5,"I wish my first introduction to Quantum Mechanics was with this book.Most approaches focus on the utter weirdness, elevating our misled intuitions and ignorance to a mysticism. What is the nature of the observer? Why is everything a both a wave and a particle? How is the can both alive and dead at the same time? Why the divide between the quantum realm and our everyday reality? And where does human consciousness come into all this?You hear people talk about QM with such an air of mystery, there's no wonder charlatans like Deepak Chopra take hold in the confusion.This book cuts right through the bullshit, focusing on what we know, why we know it, what we don't know and what are we doing about it.Things aren't a particle and a wave at the same time. Everything's waves. There's nothing special about an observer and absolutely nothing special about consciousness (from the QM point of view). QM has almost certainly nothing to do with your thought processes (other than the driving all the underlying chemistry that is). The act of ""observing"" is simply an entanglement of (what we perceive as) a particle with the measuring equipment and its environment. What you decide for lunch has no fundamental effect on the shape of the universe.It is a breath of fresh air to hear some definite answers in the field that's commonly so muddled. And seeing how we got there. You don't need to be versed in QM, physics or even maths to be able to follow it. It does call for an attentive reader, however. One who is willing to pause and think, maybe re-read a paragraph or two.Moreover, Something Deeply Hidden tries to impart as much genuine understanding as is possible without dealing with complex numbers and matrix calculations. It goes right up to the maths wall, but it doesn't cross it.Popular explanations of scientific topics often resort to similes that seem to provide an understanding, but leave the audience confused on the underlying issues, building wrong intuitions instead of a coherent picture.Not this book. If you get it, you're genuinely close to *really* getting it and if you don't get it, you at least know.Quantum mechanics is a very young science, developed extremely quickly (most of the fundamentals having been laid down in the span of two decades) with twisted, colourful history full of fascinating characters. The book mostly ignores this.As such, Adam Becker's What Is Real? which came out earlier in the same year is a perfect companion to Sean Carroll's Something Deeply Hidden. The former paints the historical context while the latter dives into the science.The book begins with the outline for why we needed QM in the first place, followed by describing the wavefunction and its evolution governed by the Schrödinger equation and describing the various experiments and what they mean.It highlights that the deepest underpinnings of the theory are not understood at all (hence the proliferation of ""interpretations"" of QM), outlines why that might be the case and then selects a particular approach through which to make sense of all the observations.That explanation framework is the Hugh Everett's or Many-Worlds theory. It highlights its stark simplicity: ""The entire universe is a wave function evolving according to the Schrödinger equation. Period."" It is a deterministic theory as well, nothing random or unpredictable about it.It makes a good case that even if it doesn't turn out to be the ultimate answer, it is the purest thing we've got and it serves as a very nice lens to look at the quantum behaviour through. All the other theories need to postulate more stuff: elements other than the wave function, deviations from the Schrödinger equation, etc.It goes through ways which we might one day be able to experimentally determine one from the other (showing that these really aren't interpretations as much as genuinely different theories with different predictions).The common criticisms and misunderstandings are addressed in a really good chapter that's basically a Socratic dialogue between a many-worlds sceptic and a scientist studying it.It does highlight the other popular theories and tries to compare them with many-worlds, but it's explicitly clear what the main focus is. That said, even if you find many worlds unpalatable, problematic or plain weird, the will leave you with a much better understanding of quantum physics.The final section of the book focuses on the big unanswered question: what is the quantum theory of gravity? We've successfully quantised all the other fundamental forces. And we've got a really good picture of gravity in realms where it is fairly weak (i.e. the vast majority of the universe). But what's really going on in strong gravitational fields (black holes, the big bang) is still a huge unknown.The author goes over some interesting directions (some of which he was an active participant in) suggesting that since the traditional approach to quantising gravity has not worked out that well yet, maybe we should start looking at QM at its purest form and trying to derive spacetime and gravity that way. A bottom-up approach instead of the top-down one we've been doing so far.I really liked how this seems to be the culmination of the author's writing career to date. It tackles spacetime, geometry, entropy as well as morality in the face of our laws of physics -- all topics he'd written excellent books about before.There have been multiple cases where I was following the argument being laid out in front of me and a nagging question has arisen. Most books, these are left unanswered. Here? It was directly addressed a couple paragraphs later.I've read it as an audiobook (always a risky endeavour in a scientific topic) and it was excellent. Narrated by the author himself (to whom I could listen to constantly) and really well put together. The printed book had diagrams and equations, but these were described so well that it took me a while to realise they must have been there.Most similar audiobooks provide you with a PDF of all the pictures (if you're lucky) and you're supposed to have them handy while you listen. There was no need for any of that here. It stands perfectly on its own.PS: Just like the What Is Real? it paints Albert Einstein as fiercely smart person who understand QM as well as anyone and who's questions and criticisms cut right to the meat of the matter. He's been instrumental in building the theory and indeed it is his work in QM (quantisation of light) that resulted in his Nobel price (not relativity as people think). Instead of losing touch (as is the popular depiction) what he lost instead was the PR battle with Niels Bohr.I like this picture better than the popular one. Einstein was one sharp fucking cookie and this just makes so much more sense."

This is practically a book arguing that the many worlds hypothesis is our best escape from the Copenhagen interpretation. It is evidently a much more robust theory than all of our present alternatives. Recommended for those thinking about 'quantum foundations'. Well complimented by Tegmark's :https://www.google.com/search?client=...and smolin's https://www.google.com/search?client=...There were some things about this book that bothered me, but it did what it needed to do pretty decently."
61,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2167338-david-agranoff,4,"This book is not for everyone. Sean Carroll is an author I reviewed before with his epic book about the universe the Big Picture. I feel more deeply connected to this author because I know his voice well. I listen every week to his podcast mindscape that I often describe as Sean Carrol talks to other geniuses. I was familiar with these ideas and the many-worlds theories before not just as a Carroll podcast listener but as a huge Sci-fi nerd and Philip K Dick Podcaster. We have talked about Many-worlds in a pseudo-science 60's way a lot.I am not going to pretend for one minute that I am able to process more than the basic ideas here. I read this book quickly because whenever math or the Nitty-Gritty of how particles spin. I really enjoyed the history of discovery and how Carroll weaves the methods that the greats in science came to the various theories that make Quantum science. I know this will sound corny but my love for this topic has roots in my favorite childhood horror movie John Carpenter's Prince of Darkness that was the first place that a young me heard of Quantum psychics. This is primarily an introduction to one of the most debated issues in the study of spacetime, as such I think it is a good introduction but the big bottom line in this review do you enjoy this stuff? I do and still felt the need to skip a few parts. I enjoy Sean Carroll's books because he helps takes universe-spanning Ideas and boils them down. Separated into three sections, part one is where we get the majority of the history. This part is called Spooky based on the idea that even Einstein in the early days found these issues to be hard to deal with. In this section, Carroll sets up the questions that we are going to ponder. The second part is called Splitting and gets into what it all means. Part three Spacetime is where most of the interesting theories happen. The most interesting concepts for me were near the end. ""It is plausible that the symmetry between space and time that we are familiar with from relativity isn't built into Quantum Gravity."" Oh no he didn't? Was there more to the universe than Einstein could see? sure and towards the end Carroll questions if Space is even part of the equation and this tiny level. Another part I enjoyed was one of the last chapters that explained more of the science behind Black holes, as Hawking was quoted in the book Black holes ain't so black. I enjoyed Carroll's last book more than this one but that could have as much to do with the epic themes of that one. This one was designed to be a purely academic exercise, while the Big Picture dealt with the point where the rubber meets the road between cosmology and philosophy. "
62,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6953429-elazar,2,"I had high hopes for this book especially because I am a long-time listener and admirer of Sean‘s podcasts. Unfortunately, I felt like I was reading a preacher’s sermon on why the Many Worlds theory is the “truth” and why every other theory is wrong. I wasn’t convinced. "
63,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85852005-sato,5,"I personally find Everettian quantum mechanics, and all the many worlds that it implies, to be by far the most plausible version of quantum theory that I know of. And this book mainly tries to present an understandable version of quantum mechanics and to show that everything is basically quantum and drawing a line between the classical world and quantomic world is not quiet sensible. But the other notion that Sean Carroll tries to show us is this Feynman’s famous quote: “ No one truly understands Quantum mechanics”, and we already have a lot to know about it specially when we try to describe spacetime and the notions in the quantum field theory and the quantum theory of gravity. For many years now, the search for a complete and compelling quantum theory of gravity has been recognized as an important scientific goal.Here is a general idea of Quantum mechanics 1.Set up the system by fixing a specific wave function Ψ.2. Evolve the system using Schrödinger’s equation.3. There are certain observable quantities we can choose to measure, such as position, and when we do measure them, we obtain definite results.4. The probability of getting any one particular result can be calculated from the wave function. The wave function associates an amplitude with every possible measurement outcome; the probability for any outcome is the square of that amplitude.5. Upon measurement, the wave function collapses. However spread out it may have been pre-measurement, afterward it is concentrated on the result we obtained(Measurement Problem). To get a general idea of Everett’s Many-Worlds interpretation as an alternative to the measurement problem and equally as the gist of Sean’s efforts all along the book, I tried to bring the general approach of Everettian quantum mechanics in Sean Carol’s words(slightly changed). Many-Worlds Before the measurement happens, there is one electron and one observer. After they interact, however, rather than thinking of that one observer having evolved into a superposition of possible states, we could think of them as having evolved into multiple possible observers. The right way to describe things after the measurement, in this view, is not as one person with multiple ideas about where the electron was seen, but as multiple worlds, each of which contains a single person with a very definite idea about where the electron was seen.Here’s the big reveal: what we’ve described as austere quantum mechanics is more commonly known as the Everett, or Many-Worlds, formulation of quantum mechanics, first put forward by Hugh Everett in 1957. The Everett view arises from a fundamental annoyance with all of the special rules about measurements that are presented as part of the standard textbook quantum recipe, and suggests instead that there is just a single kind of quantum evolution. The price we pay for this vastly increased elegance of theoretical formalism is that the theory describes many copies of what we think of as “the universe,” each slightly different, but each truly real in some sense. Whether the benefit is worth the cost is an issue about which people disagree. (It is.)"
64,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47544933-jose-rodriguez,5,"I think that Sean Carroll is one of the best “popularizers” of physics I have ever encountered. One could argue that such popularizations are like cartoon versions of literature classics, and in some ways they are. But if done well, they can bring an understanding of the “forest” that could be lost when engaged in the particularities of the mathematical “trees.” On this book, Carroll tackles the foundations of quantum mechanics, a problem from the very beginning of the field and which many physicists feel is not relevant to the calculations and experiments they carry out. Who cares if we can’t figure out what is the wave function collapse that happens after a measurement, as proposed by the so-called “Copenhagen interpretation”, if we have done extremely well without worrying about it?But some people would find this attitude deeply unsatisfactory, since it results in no understanding of the nature of reality, and the judgement by Richard Feynman that nobody really understands quantum mechanics.One of the most popular solutions has been the Many Worlds interpretation that Hugh Everett III proposed in the 1950’s, which was ignored or ridiculed by many physicists, resulting in Everett working in the defense industry after his PhD, and maybe contributing to his early death due to alcohol and other unhealthy habits, But recently there has been a resurgence of interest in these ideas, partly due to their relevance to a formulation of quantum gravity. And Sean Johnson comes out in this book as a major proponent of the Everett interpretation. It is a very difficult endeavor, and I’m not sure that he was completely successful in achieving the goal. And because he only uses words, I found that some of the concepts remained unclear, which made me wish for a lot of equations on the pages. Things get worse when the discussion turns into philosophical issues of ontology and epistemology, in which I found it very difficult to “disentangle” my thinking. The rock bottom is the chapter that tackles whether this view impacts our thinking about morality (it doesn’t). I wish that he would have stayed the course along the lines of his statement at different points that we are not really required to think about many worlds in the Everett picture. The main point is that we accept a universal wave function which evolves in accordance with Schroedinger’s equation, and from which descriptions of measurements, particles, and even space emerge (emergence is discussed in detail in his previous book “The Big Picture”). What convinced me to give this book five stars is its provocative discussion about new ways of thinking about reality. The last chapters discussing space, time, black holes, holographic picture, etc. of course do not present new solutions (they do not exist at this point), but are very successful in raising questions and introducing concepts that continue to make physics such an exciting field, at least for me.Now I should look for the equations, except that I don’t think I have the time nor the energy to do so."
65,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1680974-alex-zakharov,4,"A good non-technical introduction to quantum mechanics with heavy emphasis on Everettian interpretation. Carroll gives a brief history of the field including the 1927 Solvay conference, Einstein-Bohr debates, and personalities of the key players (Pauli, Schrodinger, Heisenberg, de Broglie). He then quickly goes over the basics that you need to follow the rest of the book – superposition, entanglement, Born rule, Wave Function, Hamiltonian, decoherence.Carroll quickly moves on to the measurement problem and describes both its well-known interpretations (“Copenhagen”, “Pilot Wave/Hidden Variables”, “Many Worlds”) and the relatively more recent Dynamical collapse and QBism theories. You get a good intuition for the theories themselves and pros/cons of each.As expected, he spends a fair amount of time on Everettian interpretation, of which he is a well-known proponent. Here we get a healthy dose of branching, decoherence, and wave function evolution. Carroll makes a case that technically the approach is pure (“austere” is his go-to word), and acknowledges that the amount of cognitive dissonance from reconciling this purity with observable reality is uncanny. He suggests a few cognitive tricks to reduce that dissonance, and some of them almost help. In the last part of the book we revisit quantum field theory (which is very nicely covered in his previous books btw), and start talking about theoretical physicists’ holy grail - quantum gravity. Carroll briefly explains how other fundamental forces were quantized, and why quantizing gravity is damn hard. We get a mention of String theory and a classy dis of AdS/CFT correspondence (field’s only lamp post in a drunken man’s parking garage). But there is hope still. Carroll is part of the wave of physicists who are becoming increasingly convinced that quantizing gravity will not happen. Instead we should derive spacetime itself from quantum mechanics, which would give us gravity on a quantum mechanical platter. Susskind & Maldacena’s 2013 “ER=EPR” paper is an obvious step in that direction, and Carroll’s thinking runs along similar lines. Space and locality is sorta-kinda like entanglement, and time is sorta-kinda like growth of the entanglement. (In Susskind’s case time is sorta-kinda like growth of quantum complexity). The first half of the book gets 5 stars – informative, mostly clear, fun to read. But, as we get into the second half, explanations start running away a bit. Carroll brings some back, but many escape. The fix is obvious - include equations in the text. Fine, if you don’t include equations in a popular science book so be it, but then providing more pictorial illustrations is a must."
66,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41901229-gary-moreau,4,"Given all the hoopla about science and technology of late, I set off about a year ago to find books that might help me to understand just exactly how far along scientists are in truly understanding our universe and thus being able to manipulate its course. And what could be more cutting edge than quantum physics, although the basics have been around for a century or more.Carroll is an accomplished theoretical physicist at the California Institute of Technology and a well-established author. He is also a proponent of the Many-Worlds school of the quantum world. (Yes, you exist in many worlds but you will never meet yourself.) The book is well written and intended for an audience broader than the professional physicist. And bravo for that. Alas, however, try as he might, this book will be a slog for the average lay reader. The physics that most of us learned in school is all about particles. Quantum physics, on the other hand, is all about waves and fields. In such a fluid world, the sheer act of measuring something, changes whatever it is we’re measuring. (Akin to trying to catch the proverbial greased pig.)Part of the problem that scientists, particularly physicists, face is that their only vehicle for communicating what they learn is language. But language is a human convention. It is not of nature like oxygen and rain. And it is, by definition, symbolic. That’s why we invented it, to facilitate communication.The universe, however, is not a human convention. It is nature itself. Nor is it symbolic. It is the universe. That’s about as real as it gets.Scientists attempt to get around this by creating their own language and system of notation. It sounds impressive, but it doesn’t quite bridge the gap. “Is the picture we’ve sketched, where the entanglement between degrees of freedom somehow comes together to define the geometry of our approximately classical spacetime, actually on the right track?” He ultimately answers that complex question with the simplest of answer. “Nobody knows for sure.”In the end, my conclusion is that scientists are not as far along as many would have us believe. They know a lot, and there are many brilliant minds working through the issues, but “a lot” is a relative calibration. There is much they don’t know. In a way, I admit, that is reassuring to me. I am not a religious man. I am, however, a philosopher. I am comfortable with the unknown. The great unknown gives us something to think about. And it’s the thinking, rather than the ultimate conclusion, which I have come to believe is the true essence of knowledge.A very worthwhile book but you have to be willing to put in the effort."
67,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5469227-d-l-morrese,4,"Sean Carroll is a well-known and respected theoretical physicist, and I am in no way qualified to review his book. I did read it, however, and I did enjoy it, in a way. What I enjoyed mostly, I think, was the thought that some very clever people probably understand it. Sadly, I can't say I'm one of them. There are three reasons for this: I don't have a background in quantum mechanics, I'm not especially brilliant, and I don't think my mind is flexible enough to wrap around most of the ideas presented. None of these are the fault of the book, hence my 4-star rating. The point Dr. Carroll is making, as best I can tell, is that reality, in all its apparent wild complexity and diversity is, in fact, simply the wave function of the universe evolving in accordance with Schrödinger's equation. Like, duh! Why didn't I think of that?Just kidding. I have only a vague idea what that even means. What Dr. Carrol thinks it means (or at least what I think he thinks it means) is that truly quantum phenomena cause the universal wave function to split or branch, which results in two equally real universes where before there was only one...not that anyone notices, or can notice, or even know which one they are in.... I can understand the idea of branching. Actually, it's what the late, great Terry Pratchett used as a premise in his books Jingo and Night Watch. (Excellent stories with cops, robbers, revolution, and a special, magical kind of physics set in a wonderfully imaginative fantasy world. I highly recommend them. But, I digress. Back to the subject at hand...) The creation of multiple worlds every time an entangled particle is seen to spin one way when it could equally have been observed to spin another seems to be a rather inefficient way of constructing a universe, but I'm willing to go along with it if it's all backed up with a sound theory and some supporting observations. After reading this book, I'm still not sure it is. Again, probably not the fault of the book, and it makes a great premise for a good story."
68,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/106439976-axel-brambila,4,"Since the dawn of time, humans have tried to figure out how the world works. Countless theories have been created to simplify the world for us. This book talks about how the world looks quantumly, or to the smallest spectrum. For instance, we know that Earth turns counter-clockwise to the sun but what are the atoms doing when this happens. Quantum physics in this book is explained well enough for anyone to understand what we've learned. However, it is a matter of how motivated you are to learn about the subject, because you will oftentimes find yourself rereading paragraphs in order to fully understand. The book sometimes even surfaces starter physics topics, which might affect the reading of an experienced physics student. The contents of the book range from how much we don't know, different theorys, and space-time. I enjoyed the book as it was a great learning experience. The many different theories were enjoyable to learn about; with the many-worlds theory being my favorite because of its craziness. The world splitting into different realities like a cell dividing is a real possibility, and it is scary finding out how little we know about the world. The state of quantum physics now is like the average person using a phone. We know how to use it, but we don't know what is actually going on in the inside. Overall, I gave this book a 4/5 because it made learning quantum physics enjoyable."
69,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98493136-martin-reader,4,"This is a good book. It covers not only the subject of quantum mechanics, but the history as well. He provides a reach history of the discussions between Neils Bohr and Albert Einstein. Bohr favored using quantum mechanics to drive innovation. And it certainly did – from nuclear weapons, to computes to electronics advancements, quantum mechanics has delivered much. But Einstein’s issue was not with what quantum mechanics could explain, he wanted to know why quantum mechanics worked. The field of quantum foundations – why the world behaves in a quantum fashion – was largely ignored for decades. It was not until 1957 when Hugh Everett developed the many worlds approach, that the topic began to be discussed again. Carroll explains how observations and experiments continue to support the Everett model of many worlds. The arguments are sometimes difficult to follow, but as he points out, Richard Feynman once said “I think I can safely say that no one understands quantum mechanics.” "
70,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15709090-cole,3,"As some other reviewers have remarked, I found the first third (maybe even half?) of Carroll’s latest book to be an enthralling ride, but it quickly took off without me thereafter. Things become pretty impenetrable for a book marketed as a popular science read, even taking into consideration the unintuitive nature of any discussion of quantum mechanics.It’s a shame, as Carroll has proven himself capable at explaining complex topics with ease and charm, and the concept of Many Worlds is fascinating to say the least. What I’m missing here is that quality being consistent across the book. (To be clear, I can’t imagine what an incredible challenge this would be.)For readers with more than an armchair physics nerd’s knowledge, I’m sure this could easily be a 4 or 5 star read."

I'm not sure why. The content was somewhat interesting, but ""Many Worlds"" reminds me a bit of String Theory in that they are both a bit far-fetched. I'm not saying that they can't be. I'm just saying that it's a bit much to swallow. Maybe classic Physics and a slight lean toward empiricism is holding me back a bit. I believe Carroll knew when he wrote this book that many would suffer from my affliction.But hey... there are stranger things and all that, Horatio. ;)"

It is not that kind of book you should take to the beach or read it on subway. Disclaimer: I had not been familiar with anything concerning quantum physics before reading this.This book introduces to you a theory of many worlds, which is on its own really amazing. The problem is in our human brains - it is not that easy for us to grasp the concept of spatial infinity. Even harder problem is accepting the concept of branching. But when you admit it could be true (I still have no idea if everything is as described or everything works completely differently), a world... Wait, many worlds of amazing possibilities opened up. So there is a universe where I am a sort of Hugh Hefner or Warren Buffet. Or even worse, Justin Bieber. "

This is not a criticism: I actually think Carroll did a very good job of dressing modern physics up in a way that is accessible for non-physicists, but you have to work for it (I didn't consistently do, so the rating can be understood as one of my job as a reader too).

I still don't fully understand this stuff, but reading more about it is exciting and makes the world (universe, really) a really fascinating place to live.The moral of this story is most of the shit you worry about is not a big deal.

But I think it is still ok to read: ""I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics."" - Richard FeynmanIt is a bit hard to accept Many-Worlds interpretation with our (at least my) current understandings of our mind, our life and our world.

87,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73419547-doctor-moss,5,"Quantum theory is frustrating. That’s probably a laughable understatement, especially for a non-physicist like me. After all, Richard Feynman famously said, “I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics.”As Sean Carroll points out, physicists are themselves encouraged to treat quantum mechanics as a basis for calculations more than as a description of reality. Those who venture into questions about the reality that quantum theory describes or the “meaning” of quantum mechanics are venturing into “quantum foundations,” a potentially disreputable and risky neighborhood.That’s what Carroll does here, presenting and arguing for the Everett or “Many Worlds” interpretation of quantum theory. We owe Hugh Everett credit for originating that interpretation in 1957, by contrast with the traditionally dominant Copenhagen interpretation, championed by Werner Heisenberg in collaboration if not always agreement with Niels Bohr. According to the Copenhagen interpretation and the Everett interpretation as well, quantum phenomena, e.g., the position, momentum, or spin of a particle such as an electron, are described by a wave function rather than, classically, by determinate, discrete values. I won’t try to explain why this is so — that would strain both the limits of a review and my understanding. For that, Carroll’s book does a good job. The wave function spreads such values as position, momentum, and spin across possible values, and it is not until a property such as those is “measured” that the value becomes determinate and distinct. It is not just that we don’t know the value until it is measured — it doesn’t exist until it is measured.Part of the difficulty in understanding this aspect of quantum theory, as Carroll explains, is that we tend to cling to a classical description of reality as made up of tiny bits of matter — “particles” in that classical sense. But particles, at least on some readings of quantum theory, really are wave functions. Their behavior isn’t just described by a wave function — they ARE wave functions. That’s where, I think, the difficulty in understanding quantum mechanics as a true description of reality begins. A wave function, after all, is a mathematical entity.But that’s just the beginning. Next comes “entanglement.” Again, please excuse the compressed explanation — Carroll does a much better job. Two particles, e.g., photons or electrons, can become “entangled” via various naturally occurring methods. Photons for example can create “entangled” pairs of electrons and positrons when passing through the nucleus of an atom. The two particles comprise a system with a net neutral charge and zero spin. If we then measure the spin of the electron and find it clockwise, we know that if we measure the spin of the positron, it will be counterclockwise. The tricky part is, of course, that the spin of the electron, before it is measured is neither clockwise nor counterclockwise. It becomes one or the other only upon measurement. Now, suppose that the electron and positron pair, since their generation, have grown far apart in distance from one another. The measurement of one of the pair, given their entangled state, will not only determine the spin of that one particle, but also, apparently instantaneously, the spin of the other. This is what upset Einstein as “spooky action at a distance.” It seems to defy both common sense and the constraint set by the speed of light as the maximum speed at which a causal influence can be transmitted — in this case, the effect (the direction of spin of the second particle) seems to be generated instantaneously by the cause (the direction of spin of the first particle).It is at this point that the Copenhagen and Everett interpretations diverge. On the Copenhagen interpretation, when the measurement occurs (which could be performed by a human observer or by an instrument of one sort or another), the wave function of the particle is said to “collapse.” It resolves uniquely to the value obtained by the measurement. End of story (except for entanglement and other difficult to swallow aspects of the theory as a whole).According to the Everett interpretation, the wave function does not collapse to a unique, single value — rather it “branches” into multiple worlds in which different possible values hold. In one world, the one we continue in, the electron has a clockwise spin, but in another that branches away from ours, it has a counterclockwise spin.That may sound outrageous and “metaphysical,” but there is, Carroll maintains, a solid rationale behind it. The Copenhagen interpretation treats the measurement, and the entanglement as a separate system from the observer or measuring device. In fact, the measuring device or observer is treated as part of a classically defined physical space, without entanglement with the quantum phenomenon being measured. By contrast, the Everett interpretation imposes no such seemingly ad hoc boundary between the measuring and the phenomenon measured. Rather than a wave function confined to the measured system, Everett’s wave function is “universal” — all phenomena in the universe are treated as at least potentially in entangled relationships comprising a single system. When a measurement is made, that universe is branched, and values not obtained in this universe are realized in other worlds. Since measurement itself — the fixing of a value on a quantum phenomenon — happens naturally and frequently (many, many, many times per second), the number of worlds, or branchings, that have taken place since the time of the Big Bang, is very, very, very large — Carroll gives a quick approximate calculation of two to the tenth to the 112 worlds. Hence the name “Many Worlds.”In fact, as Carroll explains, entanglement is a pervasive property, at the submicroscopic quantum level. The natural processes that produce it are part of the equally pervasive interactions among the quantum particles that underlie the experienced universe.His arguments in favor of the Everett interpretation, you may begin to realize, are methodological, even philosophical. Carroll is well-versed in some of the relevant works in philosophy of science and logic, giving him the background support he needs in order to make an Occam’s Razor inspired defense of the Everett interpretation as one that hews most closely to the well-ordered and empirically validated core of quantum theory — the wave function and entanglement. Other interpretations, including not only the Copenhagen interpretation but others briefly discussed in a chapter on alternatives, tend to introduce ad hoc entities, values, or assumptions in order to make the theory more containable within expectations and mathematical standards. I should mention in passing that one of these alternative interpretations that Carroll discusses is an “epistemic” interpretation. An “epistemic” interpretation is one in which the theory is viewed not so much as describing reality as describing our knowledge of reality. Interpretations that claim that quantum theory describes reality per se are called “ontic” by contrast. Epistemic interpretations, including the Copenhagen interpretation as read by many, draws back from what you might call a realist or even metaphysical claim (using “metaphysical” in the philosophical sense of pertaining to a reality independent of our ideas, thoughts, or knowledge of it). But Carroll is answering, in part, a challenge posed by Einstein in his objections to the Copenhagen interpretation. Einstein had objected both to its violation of “locality” (i.e., instantaneous action over distances) and to its failure to provide a comprehensible description of reality. The Everett interpretation does accept the violation of locality, so Einstein would not be pleased.Does it provide a comprehensible description of reality? It’s hard to say so, until we understand what “many worlds” really means. How do we give that concept itself an “ontic” interpretation? I don’t know, and that’s something that Carroll doesn’t venture far into. He does, in a footnote, distinguish “Many Worlds” from “Multiverse” where the latter has a quasi-spatial understanding, as separate regions of or domains of a kind of meta-space (or spacetime). He means something else. And he includes a chapter that attempts to resolve some of the vertigo we get when we imagine ourselves as part of this universe that is constantly branching into more and more worlds. What becomes of me? Well, there’s another me, but a different me, experiencing some other world. There are certainly uses of “world” that would seem to resonate with this idea of “many worlds” — the “possible worlds” discussed in philosophical logic and the mathematical spaces discussed in theoretical math. But none of those are going to meet a middling standard of intuitiveness or provide a kind of realist “ontic” feel. And I don’t think Carroll really helps us with that problem.The final third or so of the book carries on from the Everett interpretation to an even more speculative discussion of how spacetime itself might be generated from quantum theory. The discussion brings back the Einsteinian concept of locality to generate an idea of spatial separation as a matter of decreasing entanglement — in simplistic terms, spatial distance is generated as a decrease in the degree of entanglement of the particles making up the universe. As with much of quantum theory, in this speculative story about the origin of spacetime, it’s difficult to tell where we are telling a story of how the math that describes reality is generated and where we are telling a story that describes how the reality itself is generated. In any case, maybe despite the book’s subtitle, the heart of the book is Carroll’s presentation and argument for the Everett interpretation.Who is this book for? It’s going to be taxing for anyone who wants to read casually. As with any book on quantum theory, it is conceptually demanding. This stuff is hard to think about. And the concepts come fast and hard at times. You’ll have to put some effort into it. It isn’t mathematically challenging. There are, as I noticed them anyway, only two mathematical formulas in the book — Schrodinger’s wave function formula and Einstein’s for the curvature of spacetime. But these are offered really only as illustrations, not as formulas the reader needs to understand in any detail.I’m not a specialist, so I won’t try to say much about the interest that physicists themselves may take. I think, for many, it may be a broadening experience to reflect on the “meaning” of quantum theory.I enjoyed the book. There are a lot of books on quantum theory that rely heavily on metaphor and attempts to reduce the unintuitive to the intuitive. Carroll doesn’t do that, so I believe I’m actually experiencing how he, as a quantum theorist, thinks about what he is working on. The cost may be that, although my understanding of quantum theory and its “meaning” are much greater for having read the book, the holes in my understanding (and in the account I’ve given here) are more glaring to me."
88,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29467608-serro,2,"This might have been too technical for me, or otherwise for really advanced science readers which I might not be.Quantum mechanics and quantum field theory is central to the book and the author expands a lot on the many worlds theory. I was lost on the concept of branching and how it could progressively produce multiple copies of ourselves on different branches. Still, this lead me to the idea of a multiverse and that is mind-blowing whichever way you look at it.Style-wise the author has tried indeed to the extent that he decided to integrate a dialogue on quantum mechanics between a father and his daughter, simply to make it more literary elegant with mixed effect."
89,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57803005-tomas-sedovic,5,"I wish my first introduction to Quantum Mechanics was with this book.Most approaches focus on the utter weirdness, elevating our misled intuitions and ignorance to a mysticism. What is the nature of the observer? Why is everything a both a wave and a particle? How is the can both alive and dead at the same time? Why the divide between the quantum realm and our everyday reality? And where does human consciousness come into all this?You hear people talk about QM with such an air of mystery, there's no wonder charlatans like Deepak Chopra take hold in the confusion.This book cuts right through the bullshit, focusing on what we know, why we know it, what we don't know and what are we doing about it.Things aren't a particle and a wave at the same time. Everything's waves. There's nothing special about an observer and absolutely nothing special about consciousness (from the QM point of view). QM has almost certainly nothing to do with your thought processes (other than the driving all the underlying chemistry that is). The act of ""observing"" is simply an entanglement of (what we perceive as) a particle with the measuring equipment and its environment. What you decide for lunch has no fundamental effect on the shape of the universe.It is a breath of fresh air to hear some definite answers in the field that's commonly so muddled. And seeing how we got there. You don't need to be versed in QM, physics or even maths to be able to follow it. It does call for an attentive reader, however. One who is willing to pause and think, maybe re-read a paragraph or two.Moreover, Something Deeply Hidden tries to impart as much genuine understanding as is possible without dealing with complex numbers and matrix calculations. It goes right up to the maths wall, but it doesn't cross it.Popular explanations of scientific topics often resort to similes that seem to provide an understanding, but leave the audience confused on the underlying issues, building wrong intuitions instead of a coherent picture.Not this book. If you get it, you're genuinely close to *really* getting it and if you don't get it, you at least know.Quantum mechanics is a very young science, developed extremely quickly (most of the fundamentals having been laid down in the span of two decades) with twisted, colourful history full of fascinating characters. The book mostly ignores this.As such, Adam Becker's What Is Real? which came out earlier in the same year is a perfect companion to Sean Carroll's Something Deeply Hidden. The former paints the historical context while the latter dives into the science.The book begins with the outline for why we needed QM in the first place, followed by describing the wavefunction and its evolution governed by the Schrödinger equation and describing the various experiments and what they mean.It highlights that the deepest underpinnings of the theory are not understood at all (hence the proliferation of ""interpretations"" of QM), outlines why that might be the case and then selects a particular approach through which to make sense of all the observations.That explanation framework is the Hugh Everett's or Many-Worlds theory. It highlights its stark simplicity: ""The entire universe is a wave function evolving according to the Schrödinger equation. Period."" It is a deterministic theory as well, nothing random or unpredictable about it.It makes a good case that even if it doesn't turn out to be the ultimate answer, it is the purest thing we've got and it serves as a very nice lens to look at the quantum behaviour through. All the other theories need to postulate more stuff: elements other than the wave function, deviations from the Schrödinger equation, etc.It goes through ways which we might one day be able to experimentally determine one from the other (showing that these really aren't interpretations as much as genuinely different theories with different predictions).The common criticisms and misunderstandings are addressed in a really good chapter that's basically a Socratic dialogue between a many-worlds sceptic and a scientist studying it.It does highlight the other popular theories and tries to compare them with many-worlds, but it's explicitly clear what the main focus is. That said, even if you find many worlds unpalatable, problematic or plain weird, the will leave you with a much better understanding of quantum physics.The final section of the book focuses on the big unanswered question: what is the quantum theory of gravity? We've successfully quantised all the other fundamental forces. And we've got a really good picture of gravity in realms where it is fairly weak (i.e. the vast majority of the universe). But what's really going on in strong gravitational fields (black holes, the big bang) is still a huge unknown.The author goes over some interesting directions (some of which he was an active participant in) suggesting that since the traditional approach to quantising gravity has not worked out that well yet, maybe we should start looking at QM at its purest form and trying to derive spacetime and gravity that way. A bottom-up approach instead of the top-down one we've been doing so far.I really liked how this seems to be the culmination of the author's writing career to date. It tackles spacetime, geometry, entropy as well as morality in the face of our laws of physics -- all topics he'd written excellent books about before.There have been multiple cases where I was following the argument being laid out in front of me and a nagging question has arisen. Most books, these are left unanswered. Here? It was directly addressed a couple paragraphs later.I've read it as an audiobook (always a risky endeavour in a scientific topic) and it was excellent. Narrated by the author himself (to whom I could listen to constantly) and really well put together. The printed book had diagrams and equations, but these were described so well that it took me a while to realise they must have been there.Most similar audiobooks provide you with a PDF of all the pictures (if you're lucky) and you're supposed to have them handy while you listen. There was no need for any of that here. It stands perfectly on its own.PS: Just like the What Is Real? it paints Albert Einstein as fiercely smart person who understand QM as well as anyone and who's questions and criticisms cut right to the meat of the matter. He's been instrumental in building the theory and indeed it is his work in QM (quantisation of light) that resulted in his Nobel price (not relativity as people think). Instead of losing touch (as is the popular depiction) what he lost instead was the PR battle with Niels Bohr.I like this picture better than the popular one. Einstein was one sharp fucking cookie and this just makes so much more sense."

This is practically a book arguing that the many worlds hypothesis is our best escape from the Copenhagen interpretation. It is evidently a much more robust theory than all of our present alternatives. Recommended for those thinking about 'quantum foundations'. Well complimented by Tegmark's :https://www.google.com/search?client=...and smolin's https://www.google.com/search?client=...There were some things about this book that bothered me, but it did what it needed to do pretty decently."
91,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2167338-david-agranoff,4,"This book is not for everyone. Sean Carroll is an author I reviewed before with his epic book about the universe the Big Picture. I feel more deeply connected to this author because I know his voice well. I listen every week to his podcast mindscape that I often describe as Sean Carrol talks to other geniuses. I was familiar with these ideas and the many-worlds theories before not just as a Carroll podcast listener but as a huge Sci-fi nerd and Philip K Dick Podcaster. We have talked about Many-worlds in a pseudo-science 60's way a lot.I am not going to pretend for one minute that I am able to process more than the basic ideas here. I read this book quickly because whenever math or the Nitty-Gritty of how particles spin. I really enjoyed the history of discovery and how Carroll weaves the methods that the greats in science came to the various theories that make Quantum science. I know this will sound corny but my love for this topic has roots in my favorite childhood horror movie John Carpenter's Prince of Darkness that was the first place that a young me heard of Quantum psychics. This is primarily an introduction to one of the most debated issues in the study of spacetime, as such I think it is a good introduction but the big bottom line in this review do you enjoy this stuff? I do and still felt the need to skip a few parts. I enjoy Sean Carroll's books because he helps takes universe-spanning Ideas and boils them down. Separated into three sections, part one is where we get the majority of the history. This part is called Spooky based on the idea that even Einstein in the early days found these issues to be hard to deal with. In this section, Carroll sets up the questions that we are going to ponder. The second part is called Splitting and gets into what it all means. Part three Spacetime is where most of the interesting theories happen. The most interesting concepts for me were near the end. ""It is plausible that the symmetry between space and time that we are familiar with from relativity isn't built into Quantum Gravity."" Oh no he didn't? Was there more to the universe than Einstein could see? sure and towards the end Carroll questions if Space is even part of the equation and this tiny level. Another part I enjoyed was one of the last chapters that explained more of the science behind Black holes, as Hawking was quoted in the book Black holes ain't so black. I enjoyed Carroll's last book more than this one but that could have as much to do with the epic themes of that one. This one was designed to be a purely academic exercise, while the Big Picture dealt with the point where the rubber meets the road between cosmology and philosophy. "
92,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6953429-elazar,2,"I had high hopes for this book especially because I am a long-time listener and admirer of Sean‘s podcasts. Unfortunately, I felt like I was reading a preacher’s sermon on why the Many Worlds theory is the “truth” and why every other theory is wrong. I wasn’t convinced. "
93,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85852005-sato,5,"I personally find Everettian quantum mechanics, and all the many worlds that it implies, to be by far the most plausible version of quantum theory that I know of. And this book mainly tries to present an understandable version of quantum mechanics and to show that everything is basically quantum and drawing a line between the classical world and quantomic world is not quiet sensible. But the other notion that Sean Carroll tries to show us is this Feynman’s famous quote: “ No one truly understands Quantum mechanics”, and we already have a lot to know about it specially when we try to describe spacetime and the notions in the quantum field theory and the quantum theory of gravity. For many years now, the search for a complete and compelling quantum theory of gravity has been recognized as an important scientific goal.Here is a general idea of Quantum mechanics 1.Set up the system by fixing a specific wave function Ψ.2. Evolve the system using Schrödinger’s equation.3. There are certain observable quantities we can choose to measure, such as position, and when we do measure them, we obtain definite results.4. The probability of getting any one particular result can be calculated from the wave function. The wave function associates an amplitude with every possible measurement outcome; the probability for any outcome is the square of that amplitude.5. Upon measurement, the wave function collapses. However spread out it may have been pre-measurement, afterward it is concentrated on the result we obtained(Measurement Problem). To get a general idea of Everett’s Many-Worlds interpretation as an alternative to the measurement problem and equally as the gist of Sean’s efforts all along the book, I tried to bring the general approach of Everettian quantum mechanics in Sean Carol’s words(slightly changed). Many-Worlds Before the measurement happens, there is one electron and one observer. After they interact, however, rather than thinking of that one observer having evolved into a superposition of possible states, we could think of them as having evolved into multiple possible observers. The right way to describe things after the measurement, in this view, is not as one person with multiple ideas about where the electron was seen, but as multiple worlds, each of which contains a single person with a very definite idea about where the electron was seen.Here’s the big reveal: what we’ve described as austere quantum mechanics is more commonly known as the Everett, or Many-Worlds, formulation of quantum mechanics, first put forward by Hugh Everett in 1957. The Everett view arises from a fundamental annoyance with all of the special rules about measurements that are presented as part of the standard textbook quantum recipe, and suggests instead that there is just a single kind of quantum evolution. The price we pay for this vastly increased elegance of theoretical formalism is that the theory describes many copies of what we think of as “the universe,” each slightly different, but each truly real in some sense. Whether the benefit is worth the cost is an issue about which people disagree. (It is.)"
94,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47544933-jose-rodriguez,5,"I think that Sean Carroll is one of the best “popularizers” of physics I have ever encountered. One could argue that such popularizations are like cartoon versions of literature classics, and in some ways they are. But if done well, they can bring an understanding of the “forest” that could be lost when engaged in the particularities of the mathematical “trees.” On this book, Carroll tackles the foundations of quantum mechanics, a problem from the very beginning of the field and which many physicists feel is not relevant to the calculations and experiments they carry out. Who cares if we can’t figure out what is the wave function collapse that happens after a measurement, as proposed by the so-called “Copenhagen interpretation”, if we have done extremely well without worrying about it?But some people would find this attitude deeply unsatisfactory, since it results in no understanding of the nature of reality, and the judgement by Richard Feynman that nobody really understands quantum mechanics.One of the most popular solutions has been the Many Worlds interpretation that Hugh Everett III proposed in the 1950’s, which was ignored or ridiculed by many physicists, resulting in Everett working in the defense industry after his PhD, and maybe contributing to his early death due to alcohol and other unhealthy habits, But recently there has been a resurgence of interest in these ideas, partly due to their relevance to a formulation of quantum gravity. And Sean Johnson comes out in this book as a major proponent of the Everett interpretation. It is a very difficult endeavor, and I’m not sure that he was completely successful in achieving the goal. And because he only uses words, I found that some of the concepts remained unclear, which made me wish for a lot of equations on the pages. Things get worse when the discussion turns into philosophical issues of ontology and epistemology, in which I found it very difficult to “disentangle” my thinking. The rock bottom is the chapter that tackles whether this view impacts our thinking about morality (it doesn’t). I wish that he would have stayed the course along the lines of his statement at different points that we are not really required to think about many worlds in the Everett picture. The main point is that we accept a universal wave function which evolves in accordance with Schroedinger’s equation, and from which descriptions of measurements, particles, and even space emerge (emergence is discussed in detail in his previous book “The Big Picture”). What convinced me to give this book five stars is its provocative discussion about new ways of thinking about reality. The last chapters discussing space, time, black holes, holographic picture, etc. of course do not present new solutions (they do not exist at this point), but are very successful in raising questions and introducing concepts that continue to make physics such an exciting field, at least for me.Now I should look for the equations, except that I don’t think I have the time nor the energy to do so."
95,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1680974-alex-zakharov,4,"A good non-technical introduction to quantum mechanics with heavy emphasis on Everettian interpretation. Carroll gives a brief history of the field including the 1927 Solvay conference, Einstein-Bohr debates, and personalities of the key players (Pauli, Schrodinger, Heisenberg, de Broglie). He then quickly goes over the basics that you need to follow the rest of the book – superposition, entanglement, Born rule, Wave Function, Hamiltonian, decoherence.Carroll quickly moves on to the measurement problem and describes both its well-known interpretations (“Copenhagen”, “Pilot Wave/Hidden Variables”, “Many Worlds”) and the relatively more recent Dynamical collapse and QBism theories. You get a good intuition for the theories themselves and pros/cons of each.As expected, he spends a fair amount of time on Everettian interpretation, of which he is a well-known proponent. Here we get a healthy dose of branching, decoherence, and wave function evolution. Carroll makes a case that technically the approach is pure (“austere” is his go-to word), and acknowledges that the amount of cognitive dissonance from reconciling this purity with observable reality is uncanny. He suggests a few cognitive tricks to reduce that dissonance, and some of them almost help. In the last part of the book we revisit quantum field theory (which is very nicely covered in his previous books btw), and start talking about theoretical physicists’ holy grail - quantum gravity. Carroll briefly explains how other fundamental forces were quantized, and why quantizing gravity is damn hard. We get a mention of String theory and a classy dis of AdS/CFT correspondence (field’s only lamp post in a drunken man’s parking garage). But there is hope still. Carroll is part of the wave of physicists who are becoming increasingly convinced that quantizing gravity will not happen. Instead we should derive spacetime itself from quantum mechanics, which would give us gravity on a quantum mechanical platter. Susskind & Maldacena’s 2013 “ER=EPR” paper is an obvious step in that direction, and Carroll’s thinking runs along similar lines. Space and locality is sorta-kinda like entanglement, and time is sorta-kinda like growth of the entanglement. (In Susskind’s case time is sorta-kinda like growth of quantum complexity). The first half of the book gets 5 stars – informative, mostly clear, fun to read. But, as we get into the second half, explanations start running away a bit. Carroll brings some back, but many escape. The fix is obvious - include equations in the text. Fine, if you don’t include equations in a popular science book so be it, but then providing more pictorial illustrations is a must."
96,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41901229-gary-moreau,4,"Given all the hoopla about science and technology of late, I set off about a year ago to find books that might help me to understand just exactly how far along scientists are in truly understanding our universe and thus being able to manipulate its course. And what could be more cutting edge than quantum physics, although the basics have been around for a century or more.Carroll is an accomplished theoretical physicist at the California Institute of Technology and a well-established author. He is also a proponent of the Many-Worlds school of the quantum world. (Yes, you exist in many worlds but you will never meet yourself.) The book is well written and intended for an audience broader than the professional physicist. And bravo for that. Alas, however, try as he might, this book will be a slog for the average lay reader. The physics that most of us learned in school is all about particles. Quantum physics, on the other hand, is all about waves and fields. In such a fluid world, the sheer act of measuring something, changes whatever it is we’re measuring. (Akin to trying to catch the proverbial greased pig.)Part of the problem that scientists, particularly physicists, face is that their only vehicle for communicating what they learn is language. But language is a human convention. It is not of nature like oxygen and rain. And it is, by definition, symbolic. That’s why we invented it, to facilitate communication.The universe, however, is not a human convention. It is nature itself. Nor is it symbolic. It is the universe. That’s about as real as it gets.Scientists attempt to get around this by creating their own language and system of notation. It sounds impressive, but it doesn’t quite bridge the gap. “Is the picture we’ve sketched, where the entanglement between degrees of freedom somehow comes together to define the geometry of our approximately classical spacetime, actually on the right track?” He ultimately answers that complex question with the simplest of answer. “Nobody knows for sure.”In the end, my conclusion is that scientists are not as far along as many would have us believe. They know a lot, and there are many brilliant minds working through the issues, but “a lot” is a relative calibration. There is much they don’t know. In a way, I admit, that is reassuring to me. I am not a religious man. I am, however, a philosopher. I am comfortable with the unknown. The great unknown gives us something to think about. And it’s the thinking, rather than the ultimate conclusion, which I have come to believe is the true essence of knowledge.A very worthwhile book but you have to be willing to put in the effort."
97,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5469227-d-l-morrese,4,"Sean Carroll is a well-known and respected theoretical physicist, and I am in no way qualified to review his book. I did read it, however, and I did enjoy it, in a way. What I enjoyed mostly, I think, was the thought that some very clever people probably understand it. Sadly, I can't say I'm one of them. There are three reasons for this: I don't have a background in quantum mechanics, I'm not especially brilliant, and I don't think my mind is flexible enough to wrap around most of the ideas presented. None of these are the fault of the book, hence my 4-star rating. The point Dr. Carroll is making, as best I can tell, is that reality, in all its apparent wild complexity and diversity is, in fact, simply the wave function of the universe evolving in accordance with Schrödinger's equation. Like, duh! Why didn't I think of that?Just kidding. I have only a vague idea what that even means. What Dr. Carrol thinks it means (or at least what I think he thinks it means) is that truly quantum phenomena cause the universal wave function to split or branch, which results in two equally real universes where before there was only one...not that anyone notices, or can notice, or even know which one they are in.... I can understand the idea of branching. Actually, it's what the late, great Terry Pratchett used as a premise in his books Jingo and Night Watch. (Excellent stories with cops, robbers, revolution, and a special, magical kind of physics set in a wonderfully imaginative fantasy world. I highly recommend them. But, I digress. Back to the subject at hand...) The creation of multiple worlds every time an entangled particle is seen to spin one way when it could equally have been observed to spin another seems to be a rather inefficient way of constructing a universe, but I'm willing to go along with it if it's all backed up with a sound theory and some supporting observations. After reading this book, I'm still not sure it is. Again, probably not the fault of the book, and it makes a great premise for a good story."

Countless theories have been created to simplify the world for us. This book talks about how the world looks quantumly, or to the smallest spectrum. For instance, we know that Earth turns counter-clockwise to the sun but what are the atoms doing when this happens. Quantum physics in this book is explained well enough for anyone to understand what we've learned. However, it is a matter of how motivated you are to learn about the subject, because you will oftentimes find yourself rereading paragraphs in order to fully understand. The book sometimes even surfaces starter physics topics, which might affect the reading of an experienced physics student. The contents of the book range from how much we don't know, different theorys, and space-time. I enjoyed the book as it was a great learning experience. The many different theories were enjoyable to learn about; with the many-worlds theory being my favorite because of its craziness. The world splitting into different realities like a cell dividing is a real possibility, and it is scary finding out how little we know about the world. The state of quantum physics now is like the average person using a phone. We know how to use it, but we don't know what is actually going on in the inside. Overall, I gave this book a 4/5 because it made learning quantum physics enjoyable."
99,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98493136-martin-reader,4,"This is a good book. It covers not only the subject of quantum mechanics, but the history as well. He provides a reach history of the discussions between Neils Bohr and Albert Einstein. Bohr favored using quantum mechanics to drive innovation. And it certainly did – from nuclear weapons, to computes to electronics advancements, quantum mechanics has delivered much. But Einstein’s issue was not with what quantum mechanics could explain, he wanted to know why quantum mechanics worked. The field of quantum foundations – why the world behaves in a quantum fashion – was largely ignored for decades. It was not until 1957 when Hugh Everett developed the many worlds approach, that the topic began to be discussed again. Carroll explains how observations and experiments continue to support the Everett model of many worlds. The arguments are sometimes difficult to follow, but as he points out, Richard Feynman once said “I think I can safely say that no one understands quantum mechanics.” "

Things become pretty impenetrable for a book marketed as a popular science read, even taking into consideration the unintuitive nature of any discussion of quantum mechanics.It’s a shame, as Carroll has proven himself capable at explaining complex topics with ease and charm, and the concept of Many Worlds is fascinating to say the least. What I’m missing here is that quality being consistent across the book. (To be clear, I can’t imagine what an incredible challenge this would be.)For readers with more than an armchair physics nerd’s knowledge, I’m sure this could easily be a 4 or 5 star read."

I'm just saying that it's a bit much to swallow. Maybe classic Physics and a slight lean toward empiricism is holding me back a bit.

The problem is in our human brains - it is not that easy for us to grasp the concept of spatial infinity. Even harder problem is accepting the concept of branching. But when you admit it could be true (I still have no idea if everything is as described or everything works completely differently), a world... Wait, many worlds of amazing possibilities opened up.

117,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73419547-doctor-moss,5,"Quantum theory is frustrating. That’s probably a laughable understatement, especially for a non-physicist like me. After all, Richard Feynman famously said, “I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics.”As Sean Carroll points out, physicists are themselves encouraged to treat quantum mechanics as a basis for calculations more than as a description of reality. Those who venture into questions about the reality that quantum theory describes or the “meaning” of quantum mechanics are venturing into “quantum foundations,” a potentially disreputable and risky neighborhood.That’s what Carroll does here, presenting and arguing for the Everett or “Many Worlds” interpretation of quantum theory. We owe Hugh Everett credit for originating that interpretation in 1957, by contrast with the traditionally dominant Copenhagen interpretation, championed by Werner Heisenberg in collaboration if not always agreement with Niels Bohr. According to the Copenhagen interpretation and the Everett interpretation as well, quantum phenomena, e.g., the position, momentum, or spin of a particle such as an electron, are described by a wave function rather than, classically, by determinate, discrete values. I won’t try to explain why this is so — that would strain both the limits of a review and my understanding. For that, Carroll’s book does a good job. The wave function spreads such values as position, momentum, and spin across possible values, and it is not until a property such as those is “measured” that the value becomes determinate and distinct. It is not just that we don’t know the value until it is measured — it doesn’t exist until it is measured.Part of the difficulty in understanding this aspect of quantum theory, as Carroll explains, is that we tend to cling to a classical description of reality as made up of tiny bits of matter — “particles” in that classical sense. But particles, at least on some readings of quantum theory, really are wave functions. Their behavior isn’t just described by a wave function — they ARE wave functions. That’s where, I think, the difficulty in understanding quantum mechanics as a true description of reality begins. A wave function, after all, is a mathematical entity.But that’s just the beginning. Next comes “entanglement.” Again, please excuse the compressed explanation — Carroll does a much better job. Two particles, e.g., photons or electrons, can become “entangled” via various naturally occurring methods. Photons for example can create “entangled” pairs of electrons and positrons when passing through the nucleus of an atom. The two particles comprise a system with a net neutral charge and zero spin. If we then measure the spin of the electron and find it clockwise, we know that if we measure the spin of the positron, it will be counterclockwise. The tricky part is, of course, that the spin of the electron, before it is measured is neither clockwise nor counterclockwise. It becomes one or the other only upon measurement. Now, suppose that the electron and positron pair, since their generation, have grown far apart in distance from one another. The measurement of one of the pair, given their entangled state, will not only determine the spin of that one particle, but also, apparently instantaneously, the spin of the other. This is what upset Einstein as “spooky action at a distance.” It seems to defy both common sense and the constraint set by the speed of light as the maximum speed at which a causal influence can be transmitted — in this case, the effect (the direction of spin of the second particle) seems to be generated instantaneously by the cause (the direction of spin of the first particle).It is at this point that the Copenhagen and Everett interpretations diverge. On the Copenhagen interpretation, when the measurement occurs (which could be performed by a human observer or by an instrument of one sort or another), the wave function of the particle is said to “collapse.” It resolves uniquely to the value obtained by the measurement. End of story (except for entanglement and other difficult to swallow aspects of the theory as a whole).According to the Everett interpretation, the wave function does not collapse to a unique, single value — rather it “branches” into multiple worlds in which different possible values hold. In one world, the one we continue in, the electron has a clockwise spin, but in another that branches away from ours, it has a counterclockwise spin.That may sound outrageous and “metaphysical,” but there is, Carroll maintains, a solid rationale behind it. The Copenhagen interpretation treats the measurement, and the entanglement as a separate system from the observer or measuring device. In fact, the measuring device or observer is treated as part of a classically defined physical space, without entanglement with the quantum phenomenon being measured. By contrast, the Everett interpretation imposes no such seemingly ad hoc boundary between the measuring and the phenomenon measured. Rather than a wave function confined to the measured system, Everett’s wave function is “universal” — all phenomena in the universe are treated as at least potentially in entangled relationships comprising a single system. When a measurement is made, that universe is branched, and values not obtained in this universe are realized in other worlds. Since measurement itself — the fixing of a value on a quantum phenomenon — happens naturally and frequently (many, many, many times per second), the number of worlds, or branchings, that have taken place since the time of the Big Bang, is very, very, very large — Carroll gives a quick approximate calculation of two to the tenth to the 112 worlds. Hence the name “Many Worlds.”In fact, as Carroll explains, entanglement is a pervasive property, at the submicroscopic quantum level. The natural processes that produce it are part of the equally pervasive interactions among the quantum particles that underlie the experienced universe.His arguments in favor of the Everett interpretation, you may begin to realize, are methodological, even philosophical. Carroll is well-versed in some of the relevant works in philosophy of science and logic, giving him the background support he needs in order to make an Occam’s Razor inspired defense of the Everett interpretation as one that hews most closely to the well-ordered and empirically validated core of quantum theory — the wave function and entanglement. Other interpretations, including not only the Copenhagen interpretation but others briefly discussed in a chapter on alternatives, tend to introduce ad hoc entities, values, or assumptions in order to make the theory more containable within expectations and mathematical standards. I should mention in passing that one of these alternative interpretations that Carroll discusses is an “epistemic” interpretation. An “epistemic” interpretation is one in which the theory is viewed not so much as describing reality as describing our knowledge of reality. Interpretations that claim that quantum theory describes reality per se are called “ontic” by contrast. Epistemic interpretations, including the Copenhagen interpretation as read by many, draws back from what you might call a realist or even metaphysical claim (using “metaphysical” in the philosophical sense of pertaining to a reality independent of our ideas, thoughts, or knowledge of it). But Carroll is answering, in part, a challenge posed by Einstein in his objections to the Copenhagen interpretation. Einstein had objected both to its violation of “locality” (i.e., instantaneous action over distances) and to its failure to provide a comprehensible description of reality. The Everett interpretation does accept the violation of locality, so Einstein would not be pleased.Does it provide a comprehensible description of reality? It’s hard to say so, until we understand what “many worlds” really means. How do we give that concept itself an “ontic” interpretation? I don’t know, and that’s something that Carroll doesn’t venture far into. He does, in a footnote, distinguish “Many Worlds” from “Multiverse” where the latter has a quasi-spatial understanding, as separate regions of or domains of a kind of meta-space (or spacetime). He means something else. And he includes a chapter that attempts to resolve some of the vertigo we get when we imagine ourselves as part of this universe that is constantly branching into more and more worlds. What becomes of me? Well, there’s another me, but a different me, experiencing some other world. There are certainly uses of “world” that would seem to resonate with this idea of “many worlds” — the “possible worlds” discussed in philosophical logic and the mathematical spaces discussed in theoretical math. But none of those are going to meet a middling standard of intuitiveness or provide a kind of realist “ontic” feel. And I don’t think Carroll really helps us with that problem.The final third or so of the book carries on from the Everett interpretation to an even more speculative discussion of how spacetime itself might be generated from quantum theory. The discussion brings back the Einsteinian concept of locality to generate an idea of spatial separation as a matter of decreasing entanglement — in simplistic terms, spatial distance is generated as a decrease in the degree of entanglement of the particles making up the universe. As with much of quantum theory, in this speculative story about the origin of spacetime, it’s difficult to tell where we are telling a story of how the math that describes reality is generated and where we are telling a story that describes how the reality itself is generated. In any case, maybe despite the book’s subtitle, the heart of the book is Carroll’s presentation and argument for the Everett interpretation.Who is this book for? It’s going to be taxing for anyone who wants to read casually. As with any book on quantum theory, it is conceptually demanding. This stuff is hard to think about. And the concepts come fast and hard at times. You’ll have to put some effort into it. It isn’t mathematically challenging. There are, as I noticed them anyway, only two mathematical formulas in the book — Schrodinger’s wave function formula and Einstein’s for the curvature of spacetime. But these are offered really only as illustrations, not as formulas the reader needs to understand in any detail.I’m not a specialist, so I won’t try to say much about the interest that physicists themselves may take. I think, for many, it may be a broadening experience to reflect on the “meaning” of quantum theory.I enjoyed the book. There are a lot of books on quantum theory that rely heavily on metaphor and attempts to reduce the unintuitive to the intuitive. Carroll doesn’t do that, so I believe I’m actually experiencing how he, as a quantum theorist, thinks about what he is working on. The cost may be that, although my understanding of quantum theory and its “meaning” are much greater for having read the book, the holes in my understanding (and in the account I’ve given here) are more glaring to me."

Still, this lead me to the idea of a multiverse and that is mind-blowing whichever way you look at it.Style-wise the author has tried indeed to the extent that he decided to integrate a dialogue on quantum mechanics between a father and his daughter, simply to make it more literary elegant with mixed effect."

What is the nature of the observer? Why is everything a both a wave and a particle? How is the can both alive and dead at the same time? Why the divide between the quantum realm and our everyday reality? And where does human consciousness come into all this?You hear people talk about QM with such an air of mystery, there's no wonder charlatans like Deepak Chopra take hold in the confusion.This book cuts right through the bullshit, focusing on what we know, why we know it, what we don't know and what are we doing about it.Things aren't a particle and a wave at the same time. Everything's waves. There's nothing special about an observer and absolutely nothing special about consciousness (from the QM point of view). QM has almost certainly nothing to do with your thought processes (other than the driving all the underlying chemistry that is). The act of ""observing"" is simply an entanglement of (what we perceive as) a particle with the measuring equipment and its environment. What you decide for lunch has no fundamental effect on the shape of the universe.It is a breath of fresh air to hear some definite answers in the field that's commonly so muddled. And seeing how we got there. You don't need to be versed in QM, physics or even maths to be able to follow it. It does call for an attentive reader, however. One who is willing to pause and think, maybe re-read a paragraph or two.Moreover, Something Deeply Hidden tries to impart as much genuine understanding as is possible without dealing with complex numbers and matrix calculations. It goes right up to the maths wall, but it doesn't cross it.Popular explanations of scientific topics often resort to similes that seem to provide an understanding, but leave the audience confused on the underlying issues, building wrong intuitions instead of a coherent picture.Not this book. If you get it, you're genuinely close to *really* getting it and if you don't get it, you at least know.Quantum mechanics is a very young science, developed extremely quickly (most of the fundamentals having been laid down in the span of two decades) with twisted, colourful history full of fascinating characters. The book mostly ignores this.As such, Adam Becker's What Is Real? which came out earlier in the same year is a perfect companion to Sean Carroll's Something Deeply Hidden. The former paints the historical context while the latter dives into the science.The book begins with the outline for why we needed QM in the first place, followed by describing the wavefunction and its evolution governed by the Schrödinger equation and describing the various experiments and what they mean.It highlights that the deepest underpinnings of the theory are not understood at all (hence the proliferation of ""interpretations"" of QM), outlines why that might be the case and then selects a particular approach through which to make sense of all the observations.That explanation framework is the Hugh Everett's or Many-Worlds theory. It highlights its stark simplicity: ""The entire universe is a wave function evolving according to the Schrödinger equation. Period."" It is a deterministic theory as well, nothing random or unpredictable about it.It makes a good case that even if it doesn't turn out to be the ultimate answer, it is the purest thing we've got and it serves as a very nice lens to look at the quantum behaviour through. All the other theories need to postulate more stuff: elements other than the wave function, deviations from the Schrödinger equation, etc.It goes through ways which we might one day be able to experimentally determine one from the other (showing that these really aren't interpretations as much as genuinely different theories with different predictions).The common criticisms and misunderstandings are addressed in a really good chapter that's basically a Socratic dialogue between a many-worlds sceptic and a scientist studying it.It does highlight the other popular theories and tries to compare them with many-worlds, but it's explicitly clear what the main focus is. That said, even if you find many worlds unpalatable, problematic or plain weird, the will leave you with a much better understanding of quantum physics.The final section of the book focuses on the big unanswered question: what is the quantum theory of gravity? We've successfully quantised all the other fundamental forces. And we've got a really good picture of gravity in realms where it is fairly weak (i.e. the vast majority of the universe). But what's really going on in strong gravitational fields (black holes, the big bang) is still a huge unknown.The author goes over some interesting directions (some of which he was an active participant in) suggesting that since the traditional approach to quantising gravity has not worked out that well yet, maybe we should start looking at QM at its purest form and trying to derive spacetime and gravity that way. A bottom-up approach instead of the top-down one we've been doing so far.I really liked how this seems to be the culmination of the author's writing career to date. It tackles spacetime, geometry, entropy as well as morality in the face of our laws of physics -- all topics he'd written excellent books about before.There have been multiple cases where I was following the argument being laid out in front of me and a nagging question has arisen. Most books, these are left unanswered. Here? It was directly addressed a couple paragraphs later.I've read it as an audiobook (always a risky endeavour in a scientific topic) and it was excellent. Narrated by the author himself (to whom I could listen to constantly) and really well put together. The printed book had diagrams and equations, but these were described so well that it took me a while to realise they must have been there.Most similar audiobooks provide you with a PDF of all the pictures (if you're lucky) and you're supposed to have them handy while you listen. There was no need for any of that here. It stands perfectly on its own.PS: Just like the What Is Real? it paints Albert Einstein as fiercely smart person who understand QM as well as anyone and who's questions and criticisms cut right to the meat of the matter. He's been instrumental in building the theory and indeed it is his work in QM (quantisation of light) that resulted in his Nobel price (not relativity as people think). Instead of losing touch (as is the popular depiction) what he lost instead was the PR battle with Niels Bohr.I like this picture better than the popular one. Einstein was one sharp fucking cookie and this just makes so much more sense."

This is practically a book arguing that the many worlds hypothesis is our best escape from the Copenhagen interpretation. It is evidently a much more robust theory than all of our present alternatives. Recommended for those thinking about 'quantum foundations'. Well complimented by Tegmark's :https://www.google.com/search?client=...and smolin's https://www.google.com/search?client=...There were some things about this book that bothered me, but it did what it needed to do pretty decently."
121,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2167338-david-agranoff,4,"This book is not for everyone. Sean Carroll is an author I reviewed before with his epic book about the universe the Big Picture. I feel more deeply connected to this author because I know his voice well. I listen every week to his podcast mindscape that I often describe as Sean Carrol talks to other geniuses. I was familiar with these ideas and the many-worlds theories before not just as a Carroll podcast listener but as a huge Sci-fi nerd and Philip K Dick Podcaster. We have talked about Many-worlds in a pseudo-science 60's way a lot.I am not going to pretend for one minute that I am able to process more than the basic ideas here. I read this book quickly because whenever math or the Nitty-Gritty of how particles spin. I really enjoyed the history of discovery and how Carroll weaves the methods that the greats in science came to the various theories that make Quantum science. I know this will sound corny but my love for this topic has roots in my favorite childhood horror movie John Carpenter's Prince of Darkness that was the first place that a young me heard of Quantum psychics. This is primarily an introduction to one of the most debated issues in the study of spacetime, as such I think it is a good introduction but the big bottom line in this review do you enjoy this stuff? I do and still felt the need to skip a few parts. I enjoy Sean Carroll's books because he helps takes universe-spanning Ideas and boils them down. Separated into three sections, part one is where we get the majority of the history. This part is called Spooky based on the idea that even Einstein in the early days found these issues to be hard to deal with. In this section, Carroll sets up the questions that we are going to ponder. The second part is called Splitting and gets into what it all means. Part three Spacetime is where most of the interesting theories happen. The most interesting concepts for me were near the end. ""It is plausible that the symmetry between space and time that we are familiar with from relativity isn't built into Quantum Gravity."" Oh no he didn't? Was there more to the universe than Einstein could see? sure and towards the end Carroll questions if Space is even part of the equation and this tiny level. Another part I enjoyed was one of the last chapters that explained more of the science behind Black holes, as Hawking was quoted in the book Black holes ain't so black. I enjoyed Carroll's last book more than this one but that could have as much to do with the epic themes of that one. This one was designed to be a purely academic exercise, while the Big Picture dealt with the point where the rubber meets the road between cosmology and philosophy. "
122,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6953429-elazar,2,"I had high hopes for this book especially because I am a long-time listener and admirer of Sean‘s podcasts. Unfortunately, I felt like I was reading a preacher’s sermon on why the Many Worlds theory is the “truth” and why every other theory is wrong. I wasn’t convinced. "
123,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85852005-sato,5,"I personally find Everettian quantum mechanics, and all the many worlds that it implies, to be by far the most plausible version of quantum theory that I know of. And this book mainly tries to present an understandable version of quantum mechanics and to show that everything is basically quantum and drawing a line between the classical world and quantomic world is not quiet sensible. But the other notion that Sean Carroll tries to show us is this Feynman’s famous quote: “ No one truly understands Quantum mechanics”, and we already have a lot to know about it specially when we try to describe spacetime and the notions in the quantum field theory and the quantum theory of gravity. For many years now, the search for a complete and compelling quantum theory of gravity has been recognized as an important scientific goal.Here is a general idea of Quantum mechanics 1.Set up the system by fixing a specific wave function Ψ.2. Evolve the system using Schrödinger’s equation.3. There are certain observable quantities we can choose to measure, such as position, and when we do measure them, we obtain definite results.4. The probability of getting any one particular result can be calculated from the wave function. The wave function associates an amplitude with every possible measurement outcome; the probability for any outcome is the square of that amplitude.5. Upon measurement, the wave function collapses. However spread out it may have been pre-measurement, afterward it is concentrated on the result we obtained(Measurement Problem). To get a general idea of Everett’s Many-Worlds interpretation as an alternative to the measurement problem and equally as the gist of Sean’s efforts all along the book, I tried to bring the general approach of Everettian quantum mechanics in Sean Carol’s words(slightly changed). Many-Worlds Before the measurement happens, there is one electron and one observer. After they interact, however, rather than thinking of that one observer having evolved into a superposition of possible states, we could think of them as having evolved into multiple possible observers. The right way to describe things after the measurement, in this view, is not as one person with multiple ideas about where the electron was seen, but as multiple worlds, each of which contains a single person with a very definite idea about where the electron was seen.Here’s the big reveal: what we’ve described as austere quantum mechanics is more commonly known as the Everett, or Many-Worlds, formulation of quantum mechanics, first put forward by Hugh Everett in 1957. The Everett view arises from a fundamental annoyance with all of the special rules about measurements that are presented as part of the standard textbook quantum recipe, and suggests instead that there is just a single kind of quantum evolution. The price we pay for this vastly increased elegance of theoretical formalism is that the theory describes many copies of what we think of as “the universe,” each slightly different, but each truly real in some sense. Whether the benefit is worth the cost is an issue about which people disagree. (It is.)"
124,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47544933-jose-rodriguez,5,"I think that Sean Carroll is one of the best “popularizers” of physics I have ever encountered. One could argue that such popularizations are like cartoon versions of literature classics, and in some ways they are. But if done well, they can bring an understanding of the “forest” that could be lost when engaged in the particularities of the mathematical “trees.” On this book, Carroll tackles the foundations of quantum mechanics, a problem from the very beginning of the field and which many physicists feel is not relevant to the calculations and experiments they carry out. Who cares if we can’t figure out what is the wave function collapse that happens after a measurement, as proposed by the so-called “Copenhagen interpretation”, if we have done extremely well without worrying about it?But some people would find this attitude deeply unsatisfactory, since it results in no understanding of the nature of reality, and the judgement by Richard Feynman that nobody really understands quantum mechanics.One of the most popular solutions has been the Many Worlds interpretation that Hugh Everett III proposed in the 1950’s, which was ignored or ridiculed by many physicists, resulting in Everett working in the defense industry after his PhD, and maybe contributing to his early death due to alcohol and other unhealthy habits, But recently there has been a resurgence of interest in these ideas, partly due to their relevance to a formulation of quantum gravity. And Sean Johnson comes out in this book as a major proponent of the Everett interpretation. It is a very difficult endeavor, and I’m not sure that he was completely successful in achieving the goal. And because he only uses words, I found that some of the concepts remained unclear, which made me wish for a lot of equations on the pages. Things get worse when the discussion turns into philosophical issues of ontology and epistemology, in which I found it very difficult to “disentangle” my thinking. The rock bottom is the chapter that tackles whether this view impacts our thinking about morality (it doesn’t). I wish that he would have stayed the course along the lines of his statement at different points that we are not really required to think about many worlds in the Everett picture. The main point is that we accept a universal wave function which evolves in accordance with Schroedinger’s equation, and from which descriptions of measurements, particles, and even space emerge (emergence is discussed in detail in his previous book “The Big Picture”). What convinced me to give this book five stars is its provocative discussion about new ways of thinking about reality. The last chapters discussing space, time, black holes, holographic picture, etc. of course do not present new solutions (they do not exist at this point), but are very successful in raising questions and introducing concepts that continue to make physics such an exciting field, at least for me.Now I should look for the equations, except that I don’t think I have the time nor the energy to do so."
125,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1680974-alex-zakharov,4,"A good non-technical introduction to quantum mechanics with heavy emphasis on Everettian interpretation. Carroll gives a brief history of the field including the 1927 Solvay conference, Einstein-Bohr debates, and personalities of the key players (Pauli, Schrodinger, Heisenberg, de Broglie). He then quickly goes over the basics that you need to follow the rest of the book – superposition, entanglement, Born rule, Wave Function, Hamiltonian, decoherence.Carroll quickly moves on to the measurement problem and describes both its well-known interpretations (“Copenhagen”, “Pilot Wave/Hidden Variables”, “Many Worlds”) and the relatively more recent Dynamical collapse and QBism theories. You get a good intuition for the theories themselves and pros/cons of each.As expected, he spends a fair amount of time on Everettian interpretation, of which he is a well-known proponent. Here we get a healthy dose of branching, decoherence, and wave function evolution. Carroll makes a case that technically the approach is pure (“austere” is his go-to word), and acknowledges that the amount of cognitive dissonance from reconciling this purity with observable reality is uncanny. He suggests a few cognitive tricks to reduce that dissonance, and some of them almost help. In the last part of the book we revisit quantum field theory (which is very nicely covered in his previous books btw), and start talking about theoretical physicists’ holy grail - quantum gravity. Carroll briefly explains how other fundamental forces were quantized, and why quantizing gravity is damn hard. We get a mention of String theory and a classy dis of AdS/CFT correspondence (field’s only lamp post in a drunken man’s parking garage). But there is hope still. Carroll is part of the wave of physicists who are becoming increasingly convinced that quantizing gravity will not happen. Instead we should derive spacetime itself from quantum mechanics, which would give us gravity on a quantum mechanical platter. Susskind & Maldacena’s 2013 “ER=EPR” paper is an obvious step in that direction, and Carroll’s thinking runs along similar lines. Space and locality is sorta-kinda like entanglement, and time is sorta-kinda like growth of the entanglement. (In Susskind’s case time is sorta-kinda like growth of quantum complexity). The first half of the book gets 5 stars – informative, mostly clear, fun to read. But, as we get into the second half, explanations start running away a bit. Carroll brings some back, but many escape. The fix is obvious - include equations in the text. Fine, if you don’t include equations in a popular science book so be it, but then providing more pictorial illustrations is a must."
126,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41901229-gary-moreau,4,"Given all the hoopla about science and technology of late, I set off about a year ago to find books that might help me to understand just exactly how far along scientists are in truly understanding our universe and thus being able to manipulate its course. And what could be more cutting edge than quantum physics, although the basics have been around for a century or more.Carroll is an accomplished theoretical physicist at the California Institute of Technology and a well-established author. He is also a proponent of the Many-Worlds school of the quantum world. (Yes, you exist in many worlds but you will never meet yourself.) The book is well written and intended for an audience broader than the professional physicist. And bravo for that. Alas, however, try as he might, this book will be a slog for the average lay reader. The physics that most of us learned in school is all about particles. Quantum physics, on the other hand, is all about waves and fields. In such a fluid world, the sheer act of measuring something, changes whatever it is we’re measuring. (Akin to trying to catch the proverbial greased pig.)Part of the problem that scientists, particularly physicists, face is that their only vehicle for communicating what they learn is language. But language is a human convention. It is not of nature like oxygen and rain. And it is, by definition, symbolic. That’s why we invented it, to facilitate communication.The universe, however, is not a human convention. It is nature itself. Nor is it symbolic. It is the universe. That’s about as real as it gets.Scientists attempt to get around this by creating their own language and system of notation. It sounds impressive, but it doesn’t quite bridge the gap. “Is the picture we’ve sketched, where the entanglement between degrees of freedom somehow comes together to define the geometry of our approximately classical spacetime, actually on the right track?” He ultimately answers that complex question with the simplest of answer. “Nobody knows for sure.”In the end, my conclusion is that scientists are not as far along as many would have us believe. They know a lot, and there are many brilliant minds working through the issues, but “a lot” is a relative calibration. There is much they don’t know. In a way, I admit, that is reassuring to me. I am not a religious man. I am, however, a philosopher. I am comfortable with the unknown. The great unknown gives us something to think about. And it’s the thinking, rather than the ultimate conclusion, which I have come to believe is the true essence of knowledge.A very worthwhile book but you have to be willing to put in the effort."
127,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5469227-d-l-morrese,4,"Sean Carroll is a well-known and respected theoretical physicist, and I am in no way qualified to review his book. I did read it, however, and I did enjoy it, in a way. What I enjoyed mostly, I think, was the thought that some very clever people probably understand it. Sadly, I can't say I'm one of them. There are three reasons for this: I don't have a background in quantum mechanics, I'm not especially brilliant, and I don't think my mind is flexible enough to wrap around most of the ideas presented. None of these are the fault of the book, hence my 4-star rating. The point Dr. Carroll is making, as best I can tell, is that reality, in all its apparent wild complexity and diversity is, in fact, simply the wave function of the universe evolving in accordance with Schrödinger's equation. Like, duh! Why didn't I think of that?Just kidding. I have only a vague idea what that even means. What Dr. Carrol thinks it means (or at least what I think he thinks it means) is that truly quantum phenomena cause the universal wave function to split or branch, which results in two equally real universes where before there was only one...not that anyone notices, or can notice, or even know which one they are in.... I can understand the idea of branching. Actually, it's what the late, great Terry Pratchett used as a premise in his books Jingo and Night Watch. (Excellent stories with cops, robbers, revolution, and a special, magical kind of physics set in a wonderfully imaginative fantasy world. I highly recommend them. But, I digress. Back to the subject at hand...) The creation of multiple worlds every time an entangled particle is seen to spin one way when it could equally have been observed to spin another seems to be a rather inefficient way of constructing a universe, but I'm willing to go along with it if it's all backed up with a sound theory and some supporting observations. After reading this book, I'm still not sure it is. Again, probably not the fault of the book, and it makes a great premise for a good story."
128,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/106439976-axel-brambila,4,"Since the dawn of time, humans have tried to figure out how the world works. Countless theories have been created to simplify the world for us. This book talks about how the world looks quantumly, or to the smallest spectrum. For instance, we know that Earth turns counter-clockwise to the sun but what are the atoms doing when this happens. Quantum physics in this book is explained well enough for anyone to understand what we've learned. However, it is a matter of how motivated you are to learn about the subject, because you will oftentimes find yourself rereading paragraphs in order to fully understand. The book sometimes even surfaces starter physics topics, which might affect the reading of an experienced physics student. The contents of the book range from how much we don't know, different theorys, and space-time. I enjoyed the book as it was a great learning experience. The many different theories were enjoyable to learn about; with the many-worlds theory being my favorite because of its craziness. The world splitting into different realities like a cell dividing is a real possibility, and it is scary finding out how little we know about the world. The state of quantum physics now is like the average person using a phone. We know how to use it, but we don't know what is actually going on in the inside. Overall, I gave this book a 4/5 because it made learning quantum physics enjoyable."
129,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98493136-martin-reader,4,"This is a good book. It covers not only the subject of quantum mechanics, but the history as well. He provides a reach history of the discussions between Neils Bohr and Albert Einstein. Bohr favored using quantum mechanics to drive innovation. And it certainly did – from nuclear weapons, to computes to electronics advancements, quantum mechanics has delivered much. But Einstein’s issue was not with what quantum mechanics could explain, he wanted to know why quantum mechanics worked. The field of quantum foundations – why the world behaves in a quantum fashion – was largely ignored for decades. It was not until 1957 when Hugh Everett developed the many worlds approach, that the topic began to be discussed again. Carroll explains how observations and experiments continue to support the Everett model of many worlds. The arguments are sometimes difficult to follow, but as he points out, Richard Feynman once said “I think I can safely say that no one understands quantum mechanics.” "
130,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15709090-cole,3,"As some other reviewers have remarked, I found the first third (maybe even half?) of Carroll’s latest book to be an enthralling ride, but it quickly took off without me thereafter. Things become pretty impenetrable for a book marketed as a popular science read, even taking into consideration the unintuitive nature of any discussion of quantum mechanics.It’s a shame, as Carroll has proven himself capable at explaining complex topics with ease and charm, and the concept of Many Worlds is fascinating to say the least. What I’m missing here is that quality being consistent across the book. (To be clear, I can’t imagine what an incredible challenge this would be.)For readers with more than an armchair physics nerd’s knowledge, I’m sure this could easily be a 4 or 5 star read."

I'm not sure why. The content was somewhat interesting, but ""Many Worlds"" reminds me a bit of String Theory in that they are both a bit far-fetched. I'm not saying that they can't be. I'm just saying that it's a bit much to swallow. Maybe classic Physics and a slight lean toward empiricism is holding me back a bit. I believe Carroll knew when he wrote this book that many would suffer from my affliction.But hey... there are stranger things and all that, Horatio. ;)"

It is not that kind of book you should take to the beach or read it on subway. Disclaimer: I had not been familiar with anything concerning quantum physics before reading this.This book introduces to you a theory of many worlds, which is on its own really amazing. The problem is in our human brains - it is not that easy for us to grasp the concept of spatial infinity. Even harder problem is accepting the concept of branching. But when you admit it could be true (I still have no idea if everything is as described or everything works completely differently), a world... Wait, many worlds of amazing possibilities opened up.

This is not a criticism: I actually think Carroll did a very good job of dressing modern physics up in a way that is accessible for non-physicists, but you have to work for it (I didn't consistently do, so the rating can be understood as one of my job as a reader too).

I still don't fully understand this stuff, but reading more about it is exciting and makes the world (universe, really) a really fascinating place to live.The moral of this story is most of the shit you worry about is not a big deal.

Need some more knowledge in quantum mechanics. But I think it is still ok to read: ""I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics."" - Richard FeynmanIt is a bit hard to accept Many-Worlds interpretation with our (at least my) current understandings of our mind, our life and our world.

147,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73419547-doctor-moss,5,"Quantum theory is frustrating. That’s probably a laughable understatement, especially for a non-physicist like me. After all, Richard Feynman famously said, “I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics.”As Sean Carroll points out, physicists are themselves encouraged to treat quantum mechanics as a basis for calculations more than as a description of reality. Those who venture into questions about the reality that quantum theory describes or the “meaning” of quantum mechanics are venturing into “quantum foundations,” a potentially disreputable and risky neighborhood.That’s what Carroll does here, presenting and arguing for the Everett or “Many Worlds” interpretation of quantum theory. We owe Hugh Everett credit for originating that interpretation in 1957, by contrast with the traditionally dominant Copenhagen interpretation, championed by Werner Heisenberg in collaboration if not always agreement with Niels Bohr. According to the Copenhagen interpretation and the Everett interpretation as well, quantum phenomena, e.g., the position, momentum, or spin of a particle such as an electron, are described by a wave function rather than, classically, by determinate, discrete values. I won’t try to explain why this is so — that would strain both the limits of a review and my understanding. For that, Carroll’s book does a good job. The wave function spreads such values as position, momentum, and spin across possible values, and it is not until a property such as those is “measured” that the value becomes determinate and distinct. It is not just that we don’t know the value until it is measured — it doesn’t exist until it is measured.Part of the difficulty in understanding this aspect of quantum theory, as Carroll explains, is that we tend to cling to a classical description of reality as made up of tiny bits of matter — “particles” in that classical sense. But particles, at least on some readings of quantum theory, really are wave functions. Their behavior isn’t just described by a wave function — they ARE wave functions. That’s where, I think, the difficulty in understanding quantum mechanics as a true description of reality begins. A wave function, after all, is a mathematical entity.But that’s just the beginning. Next comes “entanglement.” Again, please excuse the compressed explanation — Carroll does a much better job. Two particles, e.g., photons or electrons, can become “entangled” via various naturally occurring methods. Photons for example can create “entangled” pairs of electrons and positrons when passing through the nucleus of an atom. The two particles comprise a system with a net neutral charge and zero spin. If we then measure the spin of the electron and find it clockwise, we know that if we measure the spin of the positron, it will be counterclockwise. The tricky part is, of course, that the spin of the electron, before it is measured is neither clockwise nor counterclockwise. It becomes one or the other only upon measurement. Now, suppose that the electron and positron pair, since their generation, have grown far apart in distance from one another. The measurement of one of the pair, given their entangled state, will not only determine the spin of that one particle, but also, apparently instantaneously, the spin of the other. This is what upset Einstein as “spooky action at a distance.” It seems to defy both common sense and the constraint set by the speed of light as the maximum speed at which a causal influence can be transmitted — in this case, the effect (the direction of spin of the second particle) seems to be generated instantaneously by the cause (the direction of spin of the first particle).It is at this point that the Copenhagen and Everett interpretations diverge. On the Copenhagen interpretation, when the measurement occurs (which could be performed by a human observer or by an instrument of one sort or another), the wave function of the particle is said to “collapse.” It resolves uniquely to the value obtained by the measurement. End of story (except for entanglement and other difficult to swallow aspects of the theory as a whole).According to the Everett interpretation, the wave function does not collapse to a unique, single value — rather it “branches” into multiple worlds in which different possible values hold. In one world, the one we continue in, the electron has a clockwise spin, but in another that branches away from ours, it has a counterclockwise spin.That may sound outrageous and “metaphysical,” but there is, Carroll maintains, a solid rationale behind it. The Copenhagen interpretation treats the measurement, and the entanglement as a separate system from the observer or measuring device. In fact, the measuring device or observer is treated as part of a classically defined physical space, without entanglement with the quantum phenomenon being measured. By contrast, the Everett interpretation imposes no such seemingly ad hoc boundary between the measuring and the phenomenon measured. Rather than a wave function confined to the measured system, Everett’s wave function is “universal” — all phenomena in the universe are treated as at least potentially in entangled relationships comprising a single system. When a measurement is made, that universe is branched, and values not obtained in this universe are realized in other worlds. Since measurement itself — the fixing of a value on a quantum phenomenon — happens naturally and frequently (many, many, many times per second), the number of worlds, or branchings, that have taken place since the time of the Big Bang, is very, very, very large — Carroll gives a quick approximate calculation of two to the tenth to the 112 worlds. Hence the name “Many Worlds.”In fact, as Carroll explains, entanglement is a pervasive property, at the submicroscopic quantum level. The natural processes that produce it are part of the equally pervasive interactions among the quantum particles that underlie the experienced universe.His arguments in favor of the Everett interpretation, you may begin to realize, are methodological, even philosophical. Carroll is well-versed in some of the relevant works in philosophy of science and logic, giving him the background support he needs in order to make an Occam’s Razor inspired defense of the Everett interpretation as one that hews most closely to the well-ordered and empirically validated core of quantum theory — the wave function and entanglement. Other interpretations, including not only the Copenhagen interpretation but others briefly discussed in a chapter on alternatives, tend to introduce ad hoc entities, values, or assumptions in order to make the theory more containable within expectations and mathematical standards. I should mention in passing that one of these alternative interpretations that Carroll discusses is an “epistemic” interpretation. An “epistemic” interpretation is one in which the theory is viewed not so much as describing reality as describing our knowledge of reality. Interpretations that claim that quantum theory describes reality per se are called “ontic” by contrast. Epistemic interpretations, including the Copenhagen interpretation as read by many, draws back from what you might call a realist or even metaphysical claim (using “metaphysical” in the philosophical sense of pertaining to a reality independent of our ideas, thoughts, or knowledge of it). But Carroll is answering, in part, a challenge posed by Einstein in his objections to the Copenhagen interpretation. Einstein had objected both to its violation of “locality” (i.e., instantaneous action over distances) and to its failure to provide a comprehensible description of reality. The Everett interpretation does accept the violation of locality, so Einstein would not be pleased.Does it provide a comprehensible description of reality? It’s hard to say so, until we understand what “many worlds” really means. How do we give that concept itself an “ontic” interpretation? I don’t know, and that’s something that Carroll doesn’t venture far into. He does, in a footnote, distinguish “Many Worlds” from “Multiverse” where the latter has a quasi-spatial understanding, as separate regions of or domains of a kind of meta-space (or spacetime). He means something else. And he includes a chapter that attempts to resolve some of the vertigo we get when we imagine ourselves as part of this universe that is constantly branching into more and more worlds. What becomes of me? Well, there’s another me, but a different me, experiencing some other world. There are certainly uses of “world” that would seem to resonate with this idea of “many worlds” — the “possible worlds” discussed in philosophical logic and the mathematical spaces discussed in theoretical math. But none of those are going to meet a middling standard of intuitiveness or provide a kind of realist “ontic” feel. And I don’t think Carroll really helps us with that problem.The final third or so of the book carries on from the Everett interpretation to an even more speculative discussion of how spacetime itself might be generated from quantum theory. The discussion brings back the Einsteinian concept of locality to generate an idea of spatial separation as a matter of decreasing entanglement — in simplistic terms, spatial distance is generated as a decrease in the degree of entanglement of the particles making up the universe. As with much of quantum theory, in this speculative story about the origin of spacetime, it’s difficult to tell where we are telling a story of how the math that describes reality is generated and where we are telling a story that describes how the reality itself is generated. In any case, maybe despite the book’s subtitle, the heart of the book is Carroll’s presentation and argument for the Everett interpretation.Who is this book for? It’s going to be taxing for anyone who wants to read casually. As with any book on quantum theory, it is conceptually demanding. This stuff is hard to think about. And the concepts come fast and hard at times. You’ll have to put some effort into it. It isn’t mathematically challenging. There are, as I noticed them anyway, only two mathematical formulas in the book — Schrodinger’s wave function formula and Einstein’s for the curvature of spacetime. But these are offered really only as illustrations, not as formulas the reader needs to understand in any detail.I’m not a specialist, so I won’t try to say much about the interest that physicists themselves may take. I think, for many, it may be a broadening experience to reflect on the “meaning” of quantum theory.I enjoyed the book. There are a lot of books on quantum theory that rely heavily on metaphor and attempts to reduce the unintuitive to the intuitive. Carroll doesn’t do that, so I believe I’m actually experiencing how he, as a quantum theorist, thinks about what he is working on. The cost may be that, although my understanding of quantum theory and its “meaning” are much greater for having read the book, the holes in my understanding (and in the account I’ve given here) are more glaring to me."
148,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29467608-serro,2,"This might have been too technical for me, or otherwise for really advanced science readers which I might not be.Quantum mechanics and quantum field theory is central to the book and the author expands a lot on the many worlds theory. I was lost on the concept of branching and how it could progressively produce multiple copies of ourselves on different branches. Still, this lead me to the idea of a multiverse and that is mind-blowing whichever way you look at it.Style-wise the author has tried indeed to the extent that he decided to integrate a dialogue on quantum mechanics between a father and his daughter, simply to make it more literary elegant with mixed effect."
149,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57803005-tomas-sedovic,5,"I wish my first introduction to Quantum Mechanics was with this book.Most approaches focus on the utter weirdness, elevating our misled intuitions and ignorance to a mysticism. What is the nature of the observer? Why is everything a both a wave and a particle? How is the can both alive and dead at the same time? Why the divide between the quantum realm and our everyday reality? And where does human consciousness come into all this?You hear people talk about QM with such an air of mystery, there's no wonder charlatans like Deepak Chopra take hold in the confusion.This book cuts right through the bullshit, focusing on what we know, why we know it, what we don't know and what are we doing about it.Things aren't a particle and a wave at the same time. Everything's waves. There's nothing special about an observer and absolutely nothing special about consciousness (from the QM point of view). QM has almost certainly nothing to do with your thought processes (other than the driving all the underlying chemistry that is). The act of ""observing"" is simply an entanglement of (what we perceive as) a particle with the measuring equipment and its environment. What you decide for lunch has no fundamental effect on the shape of the universe.It is a breath of fresh air to hear some definite answers in the field that's commonly so muddled. And seeing how we got there. You don't need to be versed in QM, physics or even maths to be able to follow it. It does call for an attentive reader, however. One who is willing to pause and think, maybe re-read a paragraph or two.Moreover, Something Deeply Hidden tries to impart as much genuine understanding as is possible without dealing with complex numbers and matrix calculations. It goes right up to the maths wall, but it doesn't cross it.Popular explanations of scientific topics often resort to similes that seem to provide an understanding, but leave the audience confused on the underlying issues, building wrong intuitions instead of a coherent picture.Not this book. If you get it, you're genuinely close to *really* getting it and if you don't get it, you at least know.Quantum mechanics is a very young science, developed extremely quickly (most of the fundamentals having been laid down in the span of two decades) with twisted, colourful history full of fascinating characters. The book mostly ignores this.As such, Adam Becker's What Is Real? which came out earlier in the same year is a perfect companion to Sean Carroll's Something Deeply Hidden. The former paints the historical context while the latter dives into the science.The book begins with the outline for why we needed QM in the first place, followed by describing the wavefunction and its evolution governed by the Schrödinger equation and describing the various experiments and what they mean.It highlights that the deepest underpinnings of the theory are not understood at all (hence the proliferation of ""interpretations"" of QM), outlines why that might be the case and then selects a particular approach through which to make sense of all the observations.That explanation framework is the Hugh Everett's or Many-Worlds theory. It highlights its stark simplicity: ""The entire universe is a wave function evolving according to the Schrödinger equation. Period."" It is a deterministic theory as well, nothing random or unpredictable about it.It makes a good case that even if it doesn't turn out to be the ultimate answer, it is the purest thing we've got and it serves as a very nice lens to look at the quantum behaviour through. All the other theories need to postulate more stuff: elements other than the wave function, deviations from the Schrödinger equation, etc.It goes through ways which we might one day be able to experimentally determine one from the other (showing that these really aren't interpretations as much as genuinely different theories with different predictions).The common criticisms and misunderstandings are addressed in a really good chapter that's basically a Socratic dialogue between a many-worlds sceptic and a scientist studying it.It does highlight the other popular theories and tries to compare them with many-worlds, but it's explicitly clear what the main focus is. That said, even if you find many worlds unpalatable, problematic or plain weird, the will leave you with a much better understanding of quantum physics.The final section of the book focuses on the big unanswered question: what is the quantum theory of gravity? We've successfully quantised all the other fundamental forces. And we've got a really good picture of gravity in realms where it is fairly weak (i.e. the vast majority of the universe). But what's really going on in strong gravitational fields (black holes, the big bang) is still a huge unknown.The author goes over some interesting directions (some of which he was an active participant in) suggesting that since the traditional approach to quantising gravity has not worked out that well yet, maybe we should start looking at QM at its purest form and trying to derive spacetime and gravity that way. A bottom-up approach instead of the top-down one we've been doing so far.I really liked how this seems to be the culmination of the author's writing career to date. It tackles spacetime, geometry, entropy as well as morality in the face of our laws of physics -- all topics he'd written excellent books about before.There have been multiple cases where I was following the argument being laid out in front of me and a nagging question has arisen. Most books, these are left unanswered. Here? It was directly addressed a couple paragraphs later.I've read it as an audiobook (always a risky endeavour in a scientific topic) and it was excellent. Narrated by the author himself (to whom I could listen to constantly) and really well put together. The printed book had diagrams and equations, but these were described so well that it took me a while to realise they must have been there.Most similar audiobooks provide you with a PDF of all the pictures (if you're lucky) and you're supposed to have them handy while you listen. There was no need for any of that here. It stands perfectly on its own.PS: Just like the What Is Real? it paints Albert Einstein as fiercely smart person who understand QM as well as anyone and who's questions and criticisms cut right to the meat of the matter. He's been instrumental in building the theory and indeed it is his work in QM (quantisation of light) that resulted in his Nobel price (not relativity as people think). Instead of losing touch (as is the popular depiction) what he lost instead was the PR battle with Niels Bohr.I like this picture better than the popular one. Einstein was one sharp fucking cookie and this just makes so much more sense."

Sean Carroll is an author I reviewed before with his epic book about the universe the Big Picture. I feel more deeply connected to this author because I know his voice well. I listen every week to his podcast mindscape that I often describe as Sean Carrol talks to other geniuses. I was familiar with these ideas and the many-worlds theories before not just as a Carroll podcast listener but as a huge Sci-fi nerd and Philip K Dick Podcaster. We have talked about Many-worlds in a pseudo-science 60's way a lot.I am not going to pretend for one minute that I am able to process more than the basic ideas here. I read this book quickly because whenever math or the Nitty-Gritty of how particles spin. I really enjoyed the history of discovery and how Carroll weaves the methods that the greats in science came to the various theories that make Quantum science. I know this will sound corny but my love for this topic has roots in my favorite childhood horror movie John Carpenter's Prince of Darkness that was the first place that a young me heard of Quantum psychics. This is primarily an introduction to one of the most debated issues in the study of spacetime, as such I think it is a good introduction but the big bottom line in this review do you enjoy this stuff? I do and still felt the need to skip a few parts. I enjoy Sean Carroll's books because he helps takes universe-spanning Ideas and boils them down. Separated into three sections, part one is where we get the majority of the history. This part is called Spooky based on the idea that even Einstein in the early days found these issues to be hard to deal with. In this section, Carroll sets up the questions that we are going to ponder. The second part is called Splitting and gets into what it all means. Part three Spacetime is where most of the interesting theories happen. The most interesting concepts for me were near the end. ""It is plausible that the symmetry between space and time that we are familiar with from relativity isn't built into Quantum Gravity."" Oh no he didn't? Was there more to the universe than Einstein could see? sure and towards the end Carroll questions if Space is even part of the equation and this tiny level. Another part I enjoyed was one of the last chapters that explained more of the science behind Black holes, as Hawking was quoted in the book Black holes ain't so black. I enjoyed Carroll's last book more than this one but that could have as much to do with the epic themes of that one. This one was designed to be a purely academic exercise, while the Big Picture dealt with the point where the rubber meets the road between cosmology and philosophy. "
152,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6953429-elazar,2,"I had high hopes for this book especially because I am a long-time listener and admirer of Sean‘s podcasts. Unfortunately, I felt like I was reading a preacher’s sermon on why the Many Worlds theory is the “truth” and why every other theory is wrong. I wasn’t convinced. "
153,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85852005-sato,5,"I personally find Everettian quantum mechanics, and all the many worlds that it implies, to be by far the most plausible version of quantum theory that I know of. And this book mainly tries to present an understandable version of quantum mechanics and to show that everything is basically quantum and drawing a line between the classical world and quantomic world is not quiet sensible. But the other notion that Sean Carroll tries to show us is this Feynman’s famous quote: “ No one truly understands Quantum mechanics”, and we already have a lot to know about it specially when we try to describe spacetime and the notions in the quantum field theory and the quantum theory of gravity. For many years now, the search for a complete and compelling quantum theory of gravity has been recognized as an important scientific goal.Here is a general idea of Quantum mechanics 1.Set up the system by fixing a specific wave function Ψ.2. Evolve the system using Schrödinger’s equation.3. There are certain observable quantities we can choose to measure, such as position, and when we do measure them, we obtain definite results.4. The probability of getting any one particular result can be calculated from the wave function. The wave function associates an amplitude with every possible measurement outcome; the probability for any outcome is the square of that amplitude.5. Upon measurement, the wave function collapses. However spread out it may have been pre-measurement, afterward it is concentrated on the result we obtained(Measurement Problem). To get a general idea of Everett’s Many-Worlds interpretation as an alternative to the measurement problem and equally as the gist of Sean’s efforts all along the book, I tried to bring the general approach of Everettian quantum mechanics in Sean Carol’s words(slightly changed). Many-Worlds Before the measurement happens, there is one electron and one observer. After they interact, however, rather than thinking of that one observer having evolved into a superposition of possible states, we could think of them as having evolved into multiple possible observers. The right way to describe things after the measurement, in this view, is not as one person with multiple ideas about where the electron was seen, but as multiple worlds, each of which contains a single person with a very definite idea about where the electron was seen.Here’s the big reveal: what we’ve described as austere quantum mechanics is more commonly known as the Everett, or Many-Worlds, formulation of quantum mechanics, first put forward by Hugh Everett in 1957. The Everett view arises from a fundamental annoyance with all of the special rules about measurements that are presented as part of the standard textbook quantum recipe, and suggests instead that there is just a single kind of quantum evolution. The price we pay for this vastly increased elegance of theoretical formalism is that the theory describes many copies of what we think of as “the universe,” each slightly different, but each truly real in some sense. Whether the benefit is worth the cost is an issue about which people disagree. (It is.)"
154,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47544933-jose-rodriguez,5,"I think that Sean Carroll is one of the best “popularizers” of physics I have ever encountered. One could argue that such popularizations are like cartoon versions of literature classics, and in some ways they are. But if done well, they can bring an understanding of the “forest” that could be lost when engaged in the particularities of the mathematical “trees.” On this book, Carroll tackles the foundations of quantum mechanics, a problem from the very beginning of the field and which many physicists feel is not relevant to the calculations and experiments they carry out. Who cares if we can’t figure out what is the wave function collapse that happens after a measurement, as proposed by the so-called “Copenhagen interpretation”, if we have done extremely well without worrying about it?But some people would find this attitude deeply unsatisfactory, since it results in no understanding of the nature of reality, and the judgement by Richard Feynman that nobody really understands quantum mechanics.One of the most popular solutions has been the Many Worlds interpretation that Hugh Everett III proposed in the 1950’s, which was ignored or ridiculed by many physicists, resulting in Everett working in the defense industry after his PhD, and maybe contributing to his early death due to alcohol and other unhealthy habits, But recently there has been a resurgence of interest in these ideas, partly due to their relevance to a formulation of quantum gravity. And Sean Johnson comes out in this book as a major proponent of the Everett interpretation. It is a very difficult endeavor, and I’m not sure that he was completely successful in achieving the goal. And because he only uses words, I found that some of the concepts remained unclear, which made me wish for a lot of equations on the pages. Things get worse when the discussion turns into philosophical issues of ontology and epistemology, in which I found it very difficult to “disentangle” my thinking. The rock bottom is the chapter that tackles whether this view impacts our thinking about morality (it doesn’t). I wish that he would have stayed the course along the lines of his statement at different points that we are not really required to think about many worlds in the Everett picture. The main point is that we accept a universal wave function which evolves in accordance with Schroedinger’s equation, and from which descriptions of measurements, particles, and even space emerge (emergence is discussed in detail in his previous book “The Big Picture”). What convinced me to give this book five stars is its provocative discussion about new ways of thinking about reality. The last chapters discussing space, time, black holes, holographic picture, etc. of course do not present new solutions (they do not exist at this point), but are very successful in raising questions and introducing concepts that continue to make physics such an exciting field, at least for me.Now I should look for the equations, except that I don’t think I have the time nor the energy to do so."
155,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1680974-alex-zakharov,4,"A good non-technical introduction to quantum mechanics with heavy emphasis on Everettian interpretation. Carroll gives a brief history of the field including the 1927 Solvay conference, Einstein-Bohr debates, and personalities of the key players (Pauli, Schrodinger, Heisenberg, de Broglie). He then quickly goes over the basics that you need to follow the rest of the book – superposition, entanglement, Born rule, Wave Function, Hamiltonian, decoherence.Carroll quickly moves on to the measurement problem and describes both its well-known interpretations (“Copenhagen”, “Pilot Wave/Hidden Variables”, “Many Worlds”) and the relatively more recent Dynamical collapse and QBism theories. You get a good intuition for the theories themselves and pros/cons of each.As expected, he spends a fair amount of time on Everettian interpretation, of which he is a well-known proponent. Here we get a healthy dose of branching, decoherence, and wave function evolution. Carroll makes a case that technically the approach is pure (“austere” is his go-to word), and acknowledges that the amount of cognitive dissonance from reconciling this purity with observable reality is uncanny. He suggests a few cognitive tricks to reduce that dissonance, and some of them almost help. In the last part of the book we revisit quantum field theory (which is very nicely covered in his previous books btw), and start talking about theoretical physicists’ holy grail - quantum gravity. Carroll briefly explains how other fundamental forces were quantized, and why quantizing gravity is damn hard. We get a mention of String theory and a classy dis of AdS/CFT correspondence (field’s only lamp post in a drunken man’s parking garage). But there is hope still. Carroll is part of the wave of physicists who are becoming increasingly convinced that quantizing gravity will not happen. Instead we should derive spacetime itself from quantum mechanics, which would give us gravity on a quantum mechanical platter. Susskind & Maldacena’s 2013 “ER=EPR” paper is an obvious step in that direction, and Carroll’s thinking runs along similar lines. Space and locality is sorta-kinda like entanglement, and time is sorta-kinda like growth of the entanglement. (In Susskind’s case time is sorta-kinda like growth of quantum complexity). The first half of the book gets 5 stars – informative, mostly clear, fun to read. But, as we get into the second half, explanations start running away a bit. Carroll brings some back, but many escape. The fix is obvious - include equations in the text. Fine, if you don’t include equations in a popular science book so be it, but then providing more pictorial illustrations is a must."
156,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41901229-gary-moreau,4,"Given all the hoopla about science and technology of late, I set off about a year ago to find books that might help me to understand just exactly how far along scientists are in truly understanding our universe and thus being able to manipulate its course. And what could be more cutting edge than quantum physics, although the basics have been around for a century or more.Carroll is an accomplished theoretical physicist at the California Institute of Technology and a well-established author. He is also a proponent of the Many-Worlds school of the quantum world. (Yes, you exist in many worlds but you will never meet yourself.) The book is well written and intended for an audience broader than the professional physicist. And bravo for that. Alas, however, try as he might, this book will be a slog for the average lay reader. The physics that most of us learned in school is all about particles. Quantum physics, on the other hand, is all about waves and fields. In such a fluid world, the sheer act of measuring something, changes whatever it is we’re measuring. (Akin to trying to catch the proverbial greased pig.)Part of the problem that scientists, particularly physicists, face is that their only vehicle for communicating what they learn is language. But language is a human convention. It is not of nature like oxygen and rain. And it is, by definition, symbolic. That’s why we invented it, to facilitate communication.The universe, however, is not a human convention. It is nature itself. Nor is it symbolic. It is the universe. That’s about as real as it gets.Scientists attempt to get around this by creating their own language and system of notation. It sounds impressive, but it doesn’t quite bridge the gap. “Is the picture we’ve sketched, where the entanglement between degrees of freedom somehow comes together to define the geometry of our approximately classical spacetime, actually on the right track?” He ultimately answers that complex question with the simplest of answer. “Nobody knows for sure.”In the end, my conclusion is that scientists are not as far along as many would have us believe. They know a lot, and there are many brilliant minds working through the issues, but “a lot” is a relative calibration. There is much they don’t know. In a way, I admit, that is reassuring to me. I am not a religious man. I am, however, a philosopher. I am comfortable with the unknown. The great unknown gives us something to think about. And it’s the thinking, rather than the ultimate conclusion, which I have come to believe is the true essence of knowledge.A very worthwhile book but you have to be willing to put in the effort."
157,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5469227-d-l-morrese,4,"Sean Carroll is a well-known and respected theoretical physicist, and I am in no way qualified to review his book. I did read it, however, and I did enjoy it, in a way. What I enjoyed mostly, I think, was the thought that some very clever people probably understand it. Sadly, I can't say I'm one of them. There are three reasons for this: I don't have a background in quantum mechanics, I'm not especially brilliant, and I don't think my mind is flexible enough to wrap around most of the ideas presented. None of these are the fault of the book, hence my 4-star rating. The point Dr. Carroll is making, as best I can tell, is that reality, in all its apparent wild complexity and diversity is, in fact, simply the wave function of the universe evolving in accordance with Schrödinger's equation. Like, duh! Why didn't I think of that?Just kidding. I have only a vague idea what that even means. What Dr. Carrol thinks it means (or at least what I think he thinks it means) is that truly quantum phenomena cause the universal wave function to split or branch, which results in two equally real universes where before there was only one...not that anyone notices, or can notice, or even know which one they are in.... I can understand the idea of branching. Actually, it's what the late, great Terry Pratchett used as a premise in his books Jingo and Night Watch. (Excellent stories with cops, robbers, revolution, and a special, magical kind of physics set in a wonderfully imaginative fantasy world. I highly recommend them. But, I digress. Back to the subject at hand...) The creation of multiple worlds every time an entangled particle is seen to spin one way when it could equally have been observed to spin another seems to be a rather inefficient way of constructing a universe, but I'm willing to go along with it if it's all backed up with a sound theory and some supporting observations. After reading this book, I'm still not sure it is. Again, probably not the fault of the book, and it makes a great premise for a good story."
158,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/106439976-axel-brambila,4,"Since the dawn of time, humans have tried to figure out how the world works. Countless theories have been created to simplify the world for us. This book talks about how the world looks quantumly, or to the smallest spectrum. For instance, we know that Earth turns counter-clockwise to the sun but what are the atoms doing when this happens. Quantum physics in this book is explained well enough for anyone to understand what we've learned. However, it is a matter of how motivated you are to learn about the subject, because you will oftentimes find yourself rereading paragraphs in order to fully understand. The book sometimes even surfaces starter physics topics, which might affect the reading of an experienced physics student. The contents of the book range from how much we don't know, different theorys, and space-time. I enjoyed the book as it was a great learning experience. The many different theories were enjoyable to learn about; with the many-worlds theory being my favorite because of its craziness. The world splitting into different realities like a cell dividing is a real possibility, and it is scary finding out how little we know about the world. The state of quantum physics now is like the average person using a phone. We know how to use it, but we don't know what is actually going on in the inside. Overall, I gave this book a 4/5 because it made learning quantum physics enjoyable."
159,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98493136-martin-reader,4,"This is a good book. It covers not only the subject of quantum mechanics, but the history as well. He provides a reach history of the discussions between Neils Bohr and Albert Einstein. Bohr favored using quantum mechanics to drive innovation. And it certainly did – from nuclear weapons, to computes to electronics advancements, quantum mechanics has delivered much. But Einstein’s issue was not with what quantum mechanics could explain, he wanted to know why quantum mechanics worked. The field of quantum foundations – why the world behaves in a quantum fashion – was largely ignored for decades. It was not until 1957 when Hugh Everett developed the many worlds approach, that the topic began to be discussed again. Carroll explains how observations and experiments continue to support the Everett model of many worlds. The arguments are sometimes difficult to follow, but as he points out, Richard Feynman once said “I think I can safely say that no one understands quantum mechanics.” "
160,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15709090-cole,3,"As some other reviewers have remarked, I found the first third (maybe even half?) of Carroll’s latest book to be an enthralling ride, but it quickly took off without me thereafter. Things become pretty impenetrable for a book marketed as a popular science read, even taking into consideration the unintuitive nature of any discussion of quantum mechanics.It’s a shame, as Carroll has proven himself capable at explaining complex topics with ease and charm, and the concept of Many Worlds is fascinating to say the least. What I’m missing here is that quality being consistent across the book. (To be clear, I can’t imagine what an incredible challenge this would be.)For readers with more than an armchair physics nerd’s knowledge, I’m sure this could easily be a 4 or 5 star read."

I'm not sure why. The content was somewhat interesting, but ""Many Worlds"" reminds me a bit of String Theory in that they are both a bit far-fetched. I'm not saying that they can't be. I'm just saying that it's a bit much to swallow. Maybe classic Physics and a slight lean toward empiricism is holding me back a bit. I believe Carroll knew when he wrote this book that many would suffer from my affliction.But hey... there are stranger things and all that, Horatio. ;)"

It is not that kind of book you should take to the beach or read it on subway. Disclaimer: I had not been familiar with anything concerning quantum physics before reading this.This book introduces to you a theory of many worlds, which is on its own really amazing. The problem is in our human brains - it is not that easy for us to grasp the concept of spatial infinity. Even harder problem is accepting the concept of branching. But when you admit it could be true (I still have no idea if everything is as described or everything works completely differently), a world... Wait, many worlds of amazing possibilities opened up. So there is a universe where I am a sort of Hugh Hefner or Warren Buffet. Or even worse, Justin Bieber. "

This is not a criticism: I actually think Carroll did a very good job of dressing modern physics up in a way that is accessible for non-physicists, but you have to work for it (I didn't consistently do, so the rating can be understood as one of my job as a reader too).

I still don't fully understand this stuff, but reading more about it is exciting and makes the world (universe, really) a really fascinating place to live.The moral of this story is most of the shit you worry about is not a big deal.

Need some more knowledge in quantum mechanics. But I think it is still ok to read: ""I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics."" - Richard FeynmanIt is a bit hard to accept Many-Worlds interpretation with our (at least my) current understandings of our mind, our life and our world. Multiverse looks fun in Hollywood movies though. Anyways, it is just hypothesis."

177,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73419547-doctor-moss,5,"Quantum theory is frustrating. That’s probably a laughable understatement, especially for a non-physicist like me. After all, Richard Feynman famously said, “I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics.”As Sean Carroll points out, physicists are themselves encouraged to treat quantum mechanics as a basis for calculations more than as a description of reality. Those who venture into questions about the reality that quantum theory describes or the “meaning” of quantum mechanics are venturing into “quantum foundations,” a potentially disreputable and risky neighborhood.That’s what Carroll does here, presenting and arguing for the Everett or “Many Worlds” interpretation of quantum theory. We owe Hugh Everett credit for originating that interpretation in 1957, by contrast with the traditionally dominant Copenhagen interpretation, championed by Werner Heisenberg in collaboration if not always agreement with Niels Bohr. According to the Copenhagen interpretation and the Everett interpretation as well, quantum phenomena, e.g., the position, momentum, or spin of a particle such as an electron, are described by a wave function rather than, classically, by determinate, discrete values. I won’t try to explain why this is so — that would strain both the limits of a review and my understanding. For that, Carroll’s book does a good job. The wave function spreads such values as position, momentum, and spin across possible values, and it is not until a property such as those is “measured” that the value becomes determinate and distinct. It is not just that we don’t know the value until it is measured — it doesn’t exist until it is measured.Part of the difficulty in understanding this aspect of quantum theory, as Carroll explains, is that we tend to cling to a classical description of reality as made up of tiny bits of matter — “particles” in that classical sense. But particles, at least on some readings of quantum theory, really are wave functions. Their behavior isn’t just described by a wave function — they ARE wave functions. That’s where, I think, the difficulty in understanding quantum mechanics as a true description of reality begins. A wave function, after all, is a mathematical entity.But that’s just the beginning. Next comes “entanglement.” Again, please excuse the compressed explanation — Carroll does a much better job. Two particles, e.g., photons or electrons, can become “entangled” via various naturally occurring methods. Photons for example can create “entangled” pairs of electrons and positrons when passing through the nucleus of an atom. The two particles comprise a system with a net neutral charge and zero spin. If we then measure the spin of the electron and find it clockwise, we know that if we measure the spin of the positron, it will be counterclockwise. The tricky part is, of course, that the spin of the electron, before it is measured is neither clockwise nor counterclockwise. It becomes one or the other only upon measurement. Now, suppose that the electron and positron pair, since their generation, have grown far apart in distance from one another. The measurement of one of the pair, given their entangled state, will not only determine the spin of that one particle, but also, apparently instantaneously, the spin of the other. This is what upset Einstein as “spooky action at a distance.” It seems to defy both common sense and the constraint set by the speed of light as the maximum speed at which a causal influence can be transmitted — in this case, the effect (the direction of spin of the second particle) seems to be generated instantaneously by the cause (the direction of spin of the first particle).It is at this point that the Copenhagen and Everett interpretations diverge. On the Copenhagen interpretation, when the measurement occurs (which could be performed by a human observer or by an instrument of one sort or another), the wave function of the particle is said to “collapse.” It resolves uniquely to the value obtained by the measurement. End of story (except for entanglement and other difficult to swallow aspects of the theory as a whole).According to the Everett interpretation, the wave function does not collapse to a unique, single value — rather it “branches” into multiple worlds in which different possible values hold. In one world, the one we continue in, the electron has a clockwise spin, but in another that branches away from ours, it has a counterclockwise spin.That may sound outrageous and “metaphysical,” but there is, Carroll maintains, a solid rationale behind it. The Copenhagen interpretation treats the measurement, and the entanglement as a separate system from the observer or measuring device. In fact, the measuring device or observer is treated as part of a classically defined physical space, without entanglement with the quantum phenomenon being measured. By contrast, the Everett interpretation imposes no such seemingly ad hoc boundary between the measuring and the phenomenon measured. Rather than a wave function confined to the measured system, Everett’s wave function is “universal” — all phenomena in the universe are treated as at least potentially in entangled relationships comprising a single system. When a measurement is made, that universe is branched, and values not obtained in this universe are realized in other worlds. Since measurement itself — the fixing of a value on a quantum phenomenon — happens naturally and frequently (many, many, many times per second), the number of worlds, or branchings, that have taken place since the time of the Big Bang, is very, very, very large — Carroll gives a quick approximate calculation of two to the tenth to the 112 worlds. Hence the name “Many Worlds.”In fact, as Carroll explains, entanglement is a pervasive property, at the submicroscopic quantum level. The natural processes that produce it are part of the equally pervasive interactions among the quantum particles that underlie the experienced universe.His arguments in favor of the Everett interpretation, you may begin to realize, are methodological, even philosophical. Carroll is well-versed in some of the relevant works in philosophy of science and logic, giving him the background support he needs in order to make an Occam’s Razor inspired defense of the Everett interpretation as one that hews most closely to the well-ordered and empirically validated core of quantum theory — the wave function and entanglement. Other interpretations, including not only the Copenhagen interpretation but others briefly discussed in a chapter on alternatives, tend to introduce ad hoc entities, values, or assumptions in order to make the theory more containable within expectations and mathematical standards. I should mention in passing that one of these alternative interpretations that Carroll discusses is an “epistemic” interpretation. An “epistemic” interpretation is one in which the theory is viewed not so much as describing reality as describing our knowledge of reality. Interpretations that claim that quantum theory describes reality per se are called “ontic” by contrast. Epistemic interpretations, including the Copenhagen interpretation as read by many, draws back from what you might call a realist or even metaphysical claim (using “metaphysical” in the philosophical sense of pertaining to a reality independent of our ideas, thoughts, or knowledge of it). But Carroll is answering, in part, a challenge posed by Einstein in his objections to the Copenhagen interpretation. Einstein had objected both to its violation of “locality” (i.e., instantaneous action over distances) and to its failure to provide a comprehensible description of reality. The Everett interpretation does accept the violation of locality, so Einstein would not be pleased.Does it provide a comprehensible description of reality? It’s hard to say so, until we understand what “many worlds” really means. How do we give that concept itself an “ontic” interpretation? I don’t know, and that’s something that Carroll doesn’t venture far into. He does, in a footnote, distinguish “Many Worlds” from “Multiverse” where the latter has a quasi-spatial understanding, as separate regions of or domains of a kind of meta-space (or spacetime). He means something else. And he includes a chapter that attempts to resolve some of the vertigo we get when we imagine ourselves as part of this universe that is constantly branching into more and more worlds. What becomes of me? Well, there’s another me, but a different me, experiencing some other world. There are certainly uses of “world” that would seem to resonate with this idea of “many worlds” — the “possible worlds” discussed in philosophical logic and the mathematical spaces discussed in theoretical math. But none of those are going to meet a middling standard of intuitiveness or provide a kind of realist “ontic” feel. And I don’t think Carroll really helps us with that problem.The final third or so of the book carries on from the Everett interpretation to an even more speculative discussion of how spacetime itself might be generated from quantum theory. The discussion brings back the Einsteinian concept of locality to generate an idea of spatial separation as a matter of decreasing entanglement — in simplistic terms, spatial distance is generated as a decrease in the degree of entanglement of the particles making up the universe. As with much of quantum theory, in this speculative story about the origin of spacetime, it’s difficult to tell where we are telling a story of how the math that describes reality is generated and where we are telling a story that describes how the reality itself is generated. In any case, maybe despite the book’s subtitle, the heart of the book is Carroll’s presentation and argument for the Everett interpretation.Who is this book for? It’s going to be taxing for anyone who wants to read casually. As with any book on quantum theory, it is conceptually demanding. This stuff is hard to think about. And the concepts come fast and hard at times. You’ll have to put some effort into it. It isn’t mathematically challenging. There are, as I noticed them anyway, only two mathematical formulas in the book — Schrodinger’s wave function formula and Einstein’s for the curvature of spacetime. But these are offered really only as illustrations, not as formulas the reader needs to understand in any detail.I’m not a specialist, so I won’t try to say much about the interest that physicists themselves may take. I think, for many, it may be a broadening experience to reflect on the “meaning” of quantum theory.I enjoyed the book. There are a lot of books on quantum theory that rely heavily on metaphor and attempts to reduce the unintuitive to the intuitive. Carroll doesn’t do that, so I believe I’m actually experiencing how he, as a quantum theorist, thinks about what he is working on. The cost may be that, although my understanding of quantum theory and its “meaning” are much greater for having read the book, the holes in my understanding (and in the account I’ve given here) are more glaring to me."
178,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29467608-serro,2,"This might have been too technical for me, or otherwise for really advanced science readers which I might not be.Quantum mechanics and quantum field theory is central to the book and the author expands a lot on the many worlds theory. I was lost on the concept of branching and how it could progressively produce multiple copies of ourselves on different branches. Still, this lead me to the idea of a multiverse and that is mind-blowing whichever way you look at it.Style-wise the author has tried indeed to the extent that he decided to integrate a dialogue on quantum mechanics between a father and his daughter, simply to make it more literary elegant with mixed effect."
179,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57803005-tomas-sedovic,5,"I wish my first introduction to Quantum Mechanics was with this book.Most approaches focus on the utter weirdness, elevating our misled intuitions and ignorance to a mysticism. What is the nature of the observer? Why is everything a both a wave and a particle? How is the can both alive and dead at the same time? Why the divide between the quantum realm and our everyday reality? And where does human consciousness come into all this?You hear people talk about QM with such an air of mystery, there's no wonder charlatans like Deepak Chopra take hold in the confusion.This book cuts right through the bullshit, focusing on what we know, why we know it, what we don't know and what are we doing about it.Things aren't a particle and a wave at the same time. Everything's waves. There's nothing special about an observer and absolutely nothing special about consciousness (from the QM point of view). QM has almost certainly nothing to do with your thought processes (other than the driving all the underlying chemistry that is). The act of ""observing"" is simply an entanglement of (what we perceive as) a particle with the measuring equipment and its environment. What you decide for lunch has no fundamental effect on the shape of the universe.It is a breath of fresh air to hear some definite answers in the field that's commonly so muddled. And seeing how we got there. You don't need to be versed in QM, physics or even maths to be able to follow it. It does call for an attentive reader, however. One who is willing to pause and think, maybe re-read a paragraph or two.Moreover, Something Deeply Hidden tries to impart as much genuine understanding as is possible without dealing with complex numbers and matrix calculations. It goes right up to the maths wall, but it doesn't cross it.Popular explanations of scientific topics often resort to similes that seem to provide an understanding, but leave the audience confused on the underlying issues, building wrong intuitions instead of a coherent picture.Not this book. If you get it, you're genuinely close to *really* getting it and if you don't get it, you at least know.Quantum mechanics is a very young science, developed extremely quickly (most of the fundamentals having been laid down in the span of two decades) with twisted, colourful history full of fascinating characters. The book mostly ignores this.As such, Adam Becker's What Is Real? which came out earlier in the same year is a perfect companion to Sean Carroll's Something Deeply Hidden. The former paints the historical context while the latter dives into the science.The book begins with the outline for why we needed QM in the first place, followed by describing the wavefunction and its evolution governed by the Schrödinger equation and describing the various experiments and what they mean.It highlights that the deepest underpinnings of the theory are not understood at all (hence the proliferation of ""interpretations"" of QM), outlines why that might be the case and then selects a particular approach through which to make sense of all the observations.That explanation framework is the Hugh Everett's or Many-Worlds theory. It highlights its stark simplicity: ""The entire universe is a wave function evolving according to the Schrödinger equation. Period."" It is a deterministic theory as well, nothing random or unpredictable about it.It makes a good case that even if it doesn't turn out to be the ultimate answer, it is the purest thing we've got and it serves as a very nice lens to look at the quantum behaviour through. All the other theories need to postulate more stuff: elements other than the wave function, deviations from the Schrödinger equation, etc.It goes through ways which we might one day be able to experimentally determine one from the other (showing that these really aren't interpretations as much as genuinely different theories with different predictions).The common criticisms and misunderstandings are addressed in a really good chapter that's basically a Socratic dialogue between a many-worlds sceptic and a scientist studying it.It does highlight the other popular theories and tries to compare them with many-worlds, but it's explicitly clear what the main focus is. That said, even if you find many worlds unpalatable, problematic or plain weird, the will leave you with a much better understanding of quantum physics.The final section of the book focuses on the big unanswered question: what is the quantum theory of gravity? We've successfully quantised all the other fundamental forces. And we've got a really good picture of gravity in realms where it is fairly weak (i.e. the vast majority of the universe). But what's really going on in strong gravitational fields (black holes, the big bang) is still a huge unknown.The author goes over some interesting directions (some of which he was an active participant in) suggesting that since the traditional approach to quantising gravity has not worked out that well yet, maybe we should start looking at QM at its purest form and trying to derive spacetime and gravity that way. A bottom-up approach instead of the top-down one we've been doing so far.I really liked how this seems to be the culmination of the author's writing career to date. It tackles spacetime, geometry, entropy as well as morality in the face of our laws of physics -- all topics he'd written excellent books about before.There have been multiple cases where I was following the argument being laid out in front of me and a nagging question has arisen. Most books, these are left unanswered. Here? It was directly addressed a couple paragraphs later.I've read it as an audiobook (always a risky endeavour in a scientific topic) and it was excellent. Narrated by the author himself (to whom I could listen to constantly) and really well put together. The printed book had diagrams and equations, but these were described so well that it took me a while to realise they must have been there.Most similar audiobooks provide you with a PDF of all the pictures (if you're lucky) and you're supposed to have them handy while you listen. There was no need for any of that here. It stands perfectly on its own.PS: Just like the What Is Real? it paints Albert Einstein as fiercely smart person who understand QM as well as anyone and who's questions and criticisms cut right to the meat of the matter. He's been instrumental in building the theory and indeed it is his work in QM (quantisation of light) that resulted in his Nobel price (not relativity as people think). Instead of losing touch (as is the popular depiction) what he lost instead was the PR battle with Niels Bohr.I like this picture better than the popular one. Einstein was one sharp fucking cookie and this just makes so much more sense."

This is practically a book arguing that the many worlds hypothesis is our best escape from the Copenhagen interpretation. It is evidently a much more robust theory than all of our present alternatives. Recommended for those thinking about 'quantum foundations'. Well complimented by Tegmark's :https://www.google.com/search?client=...and smolin's https://www.google.com/search?client=...There were some things about this book that bothered me, but it did what it needed to do pretty decently."
181,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2167338-david-agranoff,4,"This book is not for everyone. Sean Carroll is an author I reviewed before with his epic book about the universe the Big Picture. I feel more deeply connected to this author because I know his voice well. I listen every week to his podcast mindscape that I often describe as Sean Carrol talks to other geniuses. I was familiar with these ideas and the many-worlds theories before not just as a Carroll podcast listener but as a huge Sci-fi nerd and Philip K Dick Podcaster. We have talked about Many-worlds in a pseudo-science 60's way a lot.I am not going to pretend for one minute that I am able to process more than the basic ideas here. I read this book quickly because whenever math or the Nitty-Gritty of how particles spin. I really enjoyed the history of discovery and how Carroll weaves the methods that the greats in science came to the various theories that make Quantum science. I know this will sound corny but my love for this topic has roots in my favorite childhood horror movie John Carpenter's Prince of Darkness that was the first place that a young me heard of Quantum psychics. This is primarily an introduction to one of the most debated issues in the study of spacetime, as such I think it is a good introduction but the big bottom line in this review do you enjoy this stuff? I do and still felt the need to skip a few parts. I enjoy Sean Carroll's books because he helps takes universe-spanning Ideas and boils them down. Separated into three sections, part one is where we get the majority of the history. This part is called Spooky based on the idea that even Einstein in the early days found these issues to be hard to deal with. In this section, Carroll sets up the questions that we are going to ponder. The second part is called Splitting and gets into what it all means. Part three Spacetime is where most of the interesting theories happen. The most interesting concepts for me were near the end. ""It is plausible that the symmetry between space and time that we are familiar with from relativity isn't built into Quantum Gravity."" Oh no he didn't? Was there more to the universe than Einstein could see? sure and towards the end Carroll questions if Space is even part of the equation and this tiny level. Another part I enjoyed was one of the last chapters that explained more of the science behind Black holes, as Hawking was quoted in the book Black holes ain't so black. I enjoyed Carroll's last book more than this one but that could have as much to do with the epic themes of that one. This one was designed to be a purely academic exercise, while the Big Picture dealt with the point where the rubber meets the road between cosmology and philosophy. "
182,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6953429-elazar,2,"I had high hopes for this book especially because I am a long-time listener and admirer of Sean‘s podcasts. Unfortunately, I felt like I was reading a preacher’s sermon on why the Many Worlds theory is the “truth” and why every other theory is wrong. I wasn’t convinced. "
183,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85852005-sato,5,"I personally find Everettian quantum mechanics, and all the many worlds that it implies, to be by far the most plausible version of quantum theory that I know of. And this book mainly tries to present an understandable version of quantum mechanics and to show that everything is basically quantum and drawing a line between the classical world and quantomic world is not quiet sensible. But the other notion that Sean Carroll tries to show us is this Feynman’s famous quote: “ No one truly understands Quantum mechanics”, and we already have a lot to know about it specially when we try to describe spacetime and the notions in the quantum field theory and the quantum theory of gravity. For many years now, the search for a complete and compelling quantum theory of gravity has been recognized as an important scientific goal.Here is a general idea of Quantum mechanics 1.Set up the system by fixing a specific wave function Ψ.2. Evolve the system using Schrödinger’s equation.3. There are certain observable quantities we can choose to measure, such as position, and when we do measure them, we obtain definite results.4. The probability of getting any one particular result can be calculated from the wave function. The wave function associates an amplitude with every possible measurement outcome; the probability for any outcome is the square of that amplitude.5. Upon measurement, the wave function collapses. However spread out it may have been pre-measurement, afterward it is concentrated on the result we obtained(Measurement Problem). To get a general idea of Everett’s Many-Worlds interpretation as an alternative to the measurement problem and equally as the gist of Sean’s efforts all along the book, I tried to bring the general approach of Everettian quantum mechanics in Sean Carol’s words(slightly changed). Many-Worlds Before the measurement happens, there is one electron and one observer. After they interact, however, rather than thinking of that one observer having evolved into a superposition of possible states, we could think of them as having evolved into multiple possible observers. The right way to describe things after the measurement, in this view, is not as one person with multiple ideas about where the electron was seen, but as multiple worlds, each of which contains a single person with a very definite idea about where the electron was seen.Here’s the big reveal: what we’ve described as austere quantum mechanics is more commonly known as the Everett, or Many-Worlds, formulation of quantum mechanics, first put forward by Hugh Everett in 1957. The Everett view arises from a fundamental annoyance with all of the special rules about measurements that are presented as part of the standard textbook quantum recipe, and suggests instead that there is just a single kind of quantum evolution. The price we pay for this vastly increased elegance of theoretical formalism is that the theory describes many copies of what we think of as “the universe,” each slightly different, but each truly real in some sense. Whether the benefit is worth the cost is an issue about which people disagree. (It is.)"
184,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47544933-jose-rodriguez,5,"I think that Sean Carroll is one of the best “popularizers” of physics I have ever encountered. One could argue that such popularizations are like cartoon versions of literature classics, and in some ways they are. But if done well, they can bring an understanding of the “forest” that could be lost when engaged in the particularities of the mathematical “trees.” On this book, Carroll tackles the foundations of quantum mechanics, a problem from the very beginning of the field and which many physicists feel is not relevant to the calculations and experiments they carry out. Who cares if we can’t figure out what is the wave function collapse that happens after a measurement, as proposed by the so-called “Copenhagen interpretation”, if we have done extremely well without worrying about it?But some people would find this attitude deeply unsatisfactory, since it results in no understanding of the nature of reality, and the judgement by Richard Feynman that nobody really understands quantum mechanics.One of the most popular solutions has been the Many Worlds interpretation that Hugh Everett III proposed in the 1950’s, which was ignored or ridiculed by many physicists, resulting in Everett working in the defense industry after his PhD, and maybe contributing to his early death due to alcohol and other unhealthy habits, But recently there has been a resurgence of interest in these ideas, partly due to their relevance to a formulation of quantum gravity. And Sean Johnson comes out in this book as a major proponent of the Everett interpretation. It is a very difficult endeavor, and I’m not sure that he was completely successful in achieving the goal. And because he only uses words, I found that some of the concepts remained unclear, which made me wish for a lot of equations on the pages. Things get worse when the discussion turns into philosophical issues of ontology and epistemology, in which I found it very difficult to “disentangle” my thinking. The rock bottom is the chapter that tackles whether this view impacts our thinking about morality (it doesn’t). I wish that he would have stayed the course along the lines of his statement at different points that we are not really required to think about many worlds in the Everett picture. The main point is that we accept a universal wave function which evolves in accordance with Schroedinger’s equation, and from which descriptions of measurements, particles, and even space emerge (emergence is discussed in detail in his previous book “The Big Picture”). What convinced me to give this book five stars is its provocative discussion about new ways of thinking about reality. The last chapters discussing space, time, black holes, holographic picture, etc. of course do not present new solutions (they do not exist at this point), but are very successful in raising questions and introducing concepts that continue to make physics such an exciting field, at least for me.Now I should look for the equations, except that I don’t think I have the time nor the energy to do so."
185,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1680974-alex-zakharov,4,"A good non-technical introduction to quantum mechanics with heavy emphasis on Everettian interpretation. Carroll gives a brief history of the field including the 1927 Solvay conference, Einstein-Bohr debates, and personalities of the key players (Pauli, Schrodinger, Heisenberg, de Broglie). He then quickly goes over the basics that you need to follow the rest of the book – superposition, entanglement, Born rule, Wave Function, Hamiltonian, decoherence.Carroll quickly moves on to the measurement problem and describes both its well-known interpretations (“Copenhagen”, “Pilot Wave/Hidden Variables”, “Many Worlds”) and the relatively more recent Dynamical collapse and QBism theories. You get a good intuition for the theories themselves and pros/cons of each.As expected, he spends a fair amount of time on Everettian interpretation, of which he is a well-known proponent. Here we get a healthy dose of branching, decoherence, and wave function evolution. Carroll makes a case that technically the approach is pure (“austere” is his go-to word), and acknowledges that the amount of cognitive dissonance from reconciling this purity with observable reality is uncanny. He suggests a few cognitive tricks to reduce that dissonance, and some of them almost help. In the last part of the book we revisit quantum field theory (which is very nicely covered in his previous books btw), and start talking about theoretical physicists’ holy grail - quantum gravity. Carroll briefly explains how other fundamental forces were quantized, and why quantizing gravity is damn hard. We get a mention of String theory and a classy dis of AdS/CFT correspondence (field’s only lamp post in a drunken man’s parking garage). But there is hope still. Carroll is part of the wave of physicists who are becoming increasingly convinced that quantizing gravity will not happen. Instead we should derive spacetime itself from quantum mechanics, which would give us gravity on a quantum mechanical platter. Susskind & Maldacena’s 2013 “ER=EPR” paper is an obvious step in that direction, and Carroll’s thinking runs along similar lines. Space and locality is sorta-kinda like entanglement, and time is sorta-kinda like growth of the entanglement. (In Susskind’s case time is sorta-kinda like growth of quantum complexity). The first half of the book gets 5 stars – informative, mostly clear, fun to read. But, as we get into the second half, explanations start running away a bit. Carroll brings some back, but many escape. The fix is obvious - include equations in the text. Fine, if you don’t include equations in a popular science book so be it, but then providing more pictorial illustrations is a must."
186,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41901229-gary-moreau,4,"Given all the hoopla about science and technology of late, I set off about a year ago to find books that might help me to understand just exactly how far along scientists are in truly understanding our universe and thus being able to manipulate its course. And what could be more cutting edge than quantum physics, although the basics have been around for a century or more.Carroll is an accomplished theoretical physicist at the California Institute of Technology and a well-established author. He is also a proponent of the Many-Worlds school of the quantum world. (Yes, you exist in many worlds but you will never meet yourself.) The book is well written and intended for an audience broader than the professional physicist. And bravo for that. Alas, however, try as he might, this book will be a slog for the average lay reader. The physics that most of us learned in school is all about particles. Quantum physics, on the other hand, is all about waves and fields. In such a fluid world, the sheer act of measuring something, changes whatever it is we’re measuring. (Akin to trying to catch the proverbial greased pig.)Part of the problem that scientists, particularly physicists, face is that their only vehicle for communicating what they learn is language. But language is a human convention. It is not of nature like oxygen and rain. And it is, by definition, symbolic. That’s why we invented it, to facilitate communication.The universe, however, is not a human convention. It is nature itself. Nor is it symbolic. It is the universe. That’s about as real as it gets.Scientists attempt to get around this by creating their own language and system of notation. It sounds impressive, but it doesn’t quite bridge the gap. “Is the picture we’ve sketched, where the entanglement between degrees of freedom somehow comes together to define the geometry of our approximately classical spacetime, actually on the right track?” He ultimately answers that complex question with the simplest of answer. “Nobody knows for sure.”In the end, my conclusion is that scientists are not as far along as many would have us believe. They know a lot, and there are many brilliant minds working through the issues, but “a lot” is a relative calibration. There is much they don’t know. In a way, I admit, that is reassuring to me. I am not a religious man. I am, however, a philosopher. I am comfortable with the unknown. The great unknown gives us something to think about. And it’s the thinking, rather than the ultimate conclusion, which I have come to believe is the true essence of knowledge.A very worthwhile book but you have to be willing to put in the effort."
187,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5469227-d-l-morrese,4,"Sean Carroll is a well-known and respected theoretical physicist, and I am in no way qualified to review his book. I did read it, however, and I did enjoy it, in a way. What I enjoyed mostly, I think, was the thought that some very clever people probably understand it. Sadly, I can't say I'm one of them. There are three reasons for this: I don't have a background in quantum mechanics, I'm not especially brilliant, and I don't think my mind is flexible enough to wrap around most of the ideas presented. None of these are the fault of the book, hence my 4-star rating. The point Dr. Carroll is making, as best I can tell, is that reality, in all its apparent wild complexity and diversity is, in fact, simply the wave function of the universe evolving in accordance with Schrödinger's equation. Like, duh! Why didn't I think of that?Just kidding. I have only a vague idea what that even means. What Dr. Carrol thinks it means (or at least what I think he thinks it means) is that truly quantum phenomena cause the universal wave function to split or branch, which results in two equally real universes where before there was only one...not that anyone notices, or can notice, or even know which one they are in.... I can understand the idea of branching. Actually, it's what the late, great Terry Pratchett used as a premise in his books Jingo and Night Watch. (Excellent stories with cops, robbers, revolution, and a special, magical kind of physics set in a wonderfully imaginative fantasy world. I highly recommend them. But, I digress. Back to the subject at hand...) The creation of multiple worlds every time an entangled particle is seen to spin one way when it could equally have been observed to spin another seems to be a rather inefficient way of constructing a universe, but I'm willing to go along with it if it's all backed up with a sound theory and some supporting observations. After reading this book, I'm still not sure it is. Again, probably not the fault of the book, and it makes a great premise for a good story."

Countless theories have been created to simplify the world for us. This book talks about how the world looks quantumly, or to the smallest spectrum. For instance, we know that Earth turns counter-clockwise to the sun but what are the atoms doing when this happens. Quantum physics in this book is explained well enough for anyone to understand what we've learned. However, it is a matter of how motivated you are to learn about the subject, because you will oftentimes find yourself rereading paragraphs in order to fully understand. The book sometimes even surfaces starter physics topics, which might affect the reading of an experienced physics student. The contents of the book range from how much we don't know, different theorys, and space-time. I enjoyed the book as it was a great learning experience. The many different theories were enjoyable to learn about; with the many-worlds theory being my favorite because of its craziness. The world splitting into different realities like a cell dividing is a real possibility, and it is scary finding out how little we know about the world. The state of quantum physics now is like the average person using a phone. We know how to use it, but we don't know what is actually going on in the inside. Overall, I gave this book a 4/5 because it made learning quantum physics enjoyable."
189,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98493136-martin-reader,4,"This is a good book. It covers not only the subject of quantum mechanics, but the history as well. He provides a reach history of the discussions between Neils Bohr and Albert Einstein. Bohr favored using quantum mechanics to drive innovation. And it certainly did – from nuclear weapons, to computes to electronics advancements, quantum mechanics has delivered much. But Einstein’s issue was not with what quantum mechanics could explain, he wanted to know why quantum mechanics worked. The field of quantum foundations – why the world behaves in a quantum fashion – was largely ignored for decades. It was not until 1957 when Hugh Everett developed the many worlds approach, that the topic began to be discussed again. Carroll explains how observations and experiments continue to support the Everett model of many worlds. The arguments are sometimes difficult to follow, but as he points out, Richard Feynman once said “I think I can safely say that no one understands quantum mechanics.” "

Things become pretty impenetrable for a book marketed as a popular science read, even taking into consideration the unintuitive nature of any discussion of quantum mechanics.It’s a shame, as Carroll has proven himself capable at explaining complex topics with ease and charm, and the concept of Many Worlds is fascinating to say the least. What I’m missing here is that quality being consistent across the book. (To be clear, I can’t imagine what an incredible challenge this would be.)For readers with more than an armchair physics nerd’s knowledge, I’m sure this could easily be a 4 or 5 star read."

I'm just saying that it's a bit much to swallow. Maybe classic Physics and a slight lean toward empiricism is holding me back a bit.

Disclaimer: I had not been familiar with anything concerning quantum physics before reading this.This book introduces to you a theory of many worlds, which is on its own really amazing. The problem is in our human brains - it is not that easy for us to grasp the concept of spatial infinity. Even harder problem is accepting the concept of branching. But when you admit it could be true (I still have no idea if everything is as described or everything works completely differently), a world... Wait, many worlds of amazing possibilities opened up.

207,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73419547-doctor-moss,5,"Quantum theory is frustrating. That’s probably a laughable understatement, especially for a non-physicist like me. After all, Richard Feynman famously said, “I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics.”As Sean Carroll points out, physicists are themselves encouraged to treat quantum mechanics as a basis for calculations more than as a description of reality. Those who venture into questions about the reality that quantum theory describes or the “meaning” of quantum mechanics are venturing into “quantum foundations,” a potentially disreputable and risky neighborhood.That’s what Carroll does here, presenting and arguing for the Everett or “Many Worlds” interpretation of quantum theory. We owe Hugh Everett credit for originating that interpretation in 1957, by contrast with the traditionally dominant Copenhagen interpretation, championed by Werner Heisenberg in collaboration if not always agreement with Niels Bohr. According to the Copenhagen interpretation and the Everett interpretation as well, quantum phenomena, e.g., the position, momentum, or spin of a particle such as an electron, are described by a wave function rather than, classically, by determinate, discrete values. I won’t try to explain why this is so — that would strain both the limits of a review and my understanding. For that, Carroll’s book does a good job. The wave function spreads such values as position, momentum, and spin across possible values, and it is not until a property such as those is “measured” that the value becomes determinate and distinct. It is not just that we don’t know the value until it is measured — it doesn’t exist until it is measured.Part of the difficulty in understanding this aspect of quantum theory, as Carroll explains, is that we tend to cling to a classical description of reality as made up of tiny bits of matter — “particles” in that classical sense. But particles, at least on some readings of quantum theory, really are wave functions. Their behavior isn’t just described by a wave function — they ARE wave functions. That’s where, I think, the difficulty in understanding quantum mechanics as a true description of reality begins. A wave function, after all, is a mathematical entity.But that’s just the beginning. Next comes “entanglement.” Again, please excuse the compressed explanation — Carroll does a much better job. Two particles, e.g., photons or electrons, can become “entangled” via various naturally occurring methods. Photons for example can create “entangled” pairs of electrons and positrons when passing through the nucleus of an atom. The two particles comprise a system with a net neutral charge and zero spin. If we then measure the spin of the electron and find it clockwise, we know that if we measure the spin of the positron, it will be counterclockwise. The tricky part is, of course, that the spin of the electron, before it is measured is neither clockwise nor counterclockwise. It becomes one or the other only upon measurement. Now, suppose that the electron and positron pair, since their generation, have grown far apart in distance from one another. The measurement of one of the pair, given their entangled state, will not only determine the spin of that one particle, but also, apparently instantaneously, the spin of the other. This is what upset Einstein as “spooky action at a distance.” It seems to defy both common sense and the constraint set by the speed of light as the maximum speed at which a causal influence can be transmitted — in this case, the effect (the direction of spin of the second particle) seems to be generated instantaneously by the cause (the direction of spin of the first particle).It is at this point that the Copenhagen and Everett interpretations diverge. On the Copenhagen interpretation, when the measurement occurs (which could be performed by a human observer or by an instrument of one sort or another), the wave function of the particle is said to “collapse.” It resolves uniquely to the value obtained by the measurement. End of story (except for entanglement and other difficult to swallow aspects of the theory as a whole).According to the Everett interpretation, the wave function does not collapse to a unique, single value — rather it “branches” into multiple worlds in which different possible values hold. In one world, the one we continue in, the electron has a clockwise spin, but in another that branches away from ours, it has a counterclockwise spin.That may sound outrageous and “metaphysical,” but there is, Carroll maintains, a solid rationale behind it. The Copenhagen interpretation treats the measurement, and the entanglement as a separate system from the observer or measuring device. In fact, the measuring device or observer is treated as part of a classically defined physical space, without entanglement with the quantum phenomenon being measured. By contrast, the Everett interpretation imposes no such seemingly ad hoc boundary between the measuring and the phenomenon measured. Rather than a wave function confined to the measured system, Everett’s wave function is “universal” — all phenomena in the universe are treated as at least potentially in entangled relationships comprising a single system. When a measurement is made, that universe is branched, and values not obtained in this universe are realized in other worlds. Since measurement itself — the fixing of a value on a quantum phenomenon — happens naturally and frequently (many, many, many times per second), the number of worlds, or branchings, that have taken place since the time of the Big Bang, is very, very, very large — Carroll gives a quick approximate calculation of two to the tenth to the 112 worlds. Hence the name “Many Worlds.”In fact, as Carroll explains, entanglement is a pervasive property, at the submicroscopic quantum level. The natural processes that produce it are part of the equally pervasive interactions among the quantum particles that underlie the experienced universe.His arguments in favor of the Everett interpretation, you may begin to realize, are methodological, even philosophical. Carroll is well-versed in some of the relevant works in philosophy of science and logic, giving him the background support he needs in order to make an Occam’s Razor inspired defense of the Everett interpretation as one that hews most closely to the well-ordered and empirically validated core of quantum theory — the wave function and entanglement. Other interpretations, including not only the Copenhagen interpretation but others briefly discussed in a chapter on alternatives, tend to introduce ad hoc entities, values, or assumptions in order to make the theory more containable within expectations and mathematical standards. I should mention in passing that one of these alternative interpretations that Carroll discusses is an “epistemic” interpretation. An “epistemic” interpretation is one in which the theory is viewed not so much as describing reality as describing our knowledge of reality. Interpretations that claim that quantum theory describes reality per se are called “ontic” by contrast. Epistemic interpretations, including the Copenhagen interpretation as read by many, draws back from what you might call a realist or even metaphysical claim (using “metaphysical” in the philosophical sense of pertaining to a reality independent of our ideas, thoughts, or knowledge of it). But Carroll is answering, in part, a challenge posed by Einstein in his objections to the Copenhagen interpretation. Einstein had objected both to its violation of “locality” (i.e., instantaneous action over distances) and to its failure to provide a comprehensible description of reality. The Everett interpretation does accept the violation of locality, so Einstein would not be pleased.Does it provide a comprehensible description of reality? It’s hard to say so, until we understand what “many worlds” really means. How do we give that concept itself an “ontic” interpretation? I don’t know, and that’s something that Carroll doesn’t venture far into. He does, in a footnote, distinguish “Many Worlds” from “Multiverse” where the latter has a quasi-spatial understanding, as separate regions of or domains of a kind of meta-space (or spacetime). He means something else. And he includes a chapter that attempts to resolve some of the vertigo we get when we imagine ourselves as part of this universe that is constantly branching into more and more worlds. What becomes of me? Well, there’s another me, but a different me, experiencing some other world. There are certainly uses of “world” that would seem to resonate with this idea of “many worlds” — the “possible worlds” discussed in philosophical logic and the mathematical spaces discussed in theoretical math. But none of those are going to meet a middling standard of intuitiveness or provide a kind of realist “ontic” feel. And I don’t think Carroll really helps us with that problem.The final third or so of the book carries on from the Everett interpretation to an even more speculative discussion of how spacetime itself might be generated from quantum theory. The discussion brings back the Einsteinian concept of locality to generate an idea of spatial separation as a matter of decreasing entanglement — in simplistic terms, spatial distance is generated as a decrease in the degree of entanglement of the particles making up the universe. As with much of quantum theory, in this speculative story about the origin of spacetime, it’s difficult to tell where we are telling a story of how the math that describes reality is generated and where we are telling a story that describes how the reality itself is generated. In any case, maybe despite the book’s subtitle, the heart of the book is Carroll’s presentation and argument for the Everett interpretation.Who is this book for? It’s going to be taxing for anyone who wants to read casually. As with any book on quantum theory, it is conceptually demanding. This stuff is hard to think about. And the concepts come fast and hard at times. You’ll have to put some effort into it. It isn’t mathematically challenging. There are, as I noticed them anyway, only two mathematical formulas in the book — Schrodinger’s wave function formula and Einstein’s for the curvature of spacetime. But these are offered really only as illustrations, not as formulas the reader needs to understand in any detail.I’m not a specialist, so I won’t try to say much about the interest that physicists themselves may take. I think, for many, it may be a broadening experience to reflect on the “meaning” of quantum theory.I enjoyed the book. There are a lot of books on quantum theory that rely heavily on metaphor and attempts to reduce the unintuitive to the intuitive. Carroll doesn’t do that, so I believe I’m actually experiencing how he, as a quantum theorist, thinks about what he is working on. The cost may be that, although my understanding of quantum theory and its “meaning” are much greater for having read the book, the holes in my understanding (and in the account I’ve given here) are more glaring to me."
208,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29467608-serro,2,"This might have been too technical for me, or otherwise for really advanced science readers which I might not be.Quantum mechanics and quantum field theory is central to the book and the author expands a lot on the many worlds theory. I was lost on the concept of branching and how it could progressively produce multiple copies of ourselves on different branches. Still, this lead me to the idea of a multiverse and that is mind-blowing whichever way you look at it.Style-wise the author has tried indeed to the extent that he decided to integrate a dialogue on quantum mechanics between a father and his daughter, simply to make it more literary elegant with mixed effect."
209,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57803005-tomas-sedovic,5,"I wish my first introduction to Quantum Mechanics was with this book.Most approaches focus on the utter weirdness, elevating our misled intuitions and ignorance to a mysticism. What is the nature of the observer? Why is everything a both a wave and a particle? How is the can both alive and dead at the same time? Why the divide between the quantum realm and our everyday reality? And where does human consciousness come into all this?You hear people talk about QM with such an air of mystery, there's no wonder charlatans like Deepak Chopra take hold in the confusion.This book cuts right through the bullshit, focusing on what we know, why we know it, what we don't know and what are we doing about it.Things aren't a particle and a wave at the same time. Everything's waves. There's nothing special about an observer and absolutely nothing special about consciousness (from the QM point of view). QM has almost certainly nothing to do with your thought processes (other than the driving all the underlying chemistry that is). The act of ""observing"" is simply an entanglement of (what we perceive as) a particle with the measuring equipment and its environment. What you decide for lunch has no fundamental effect on the shape of the universe.It is a breath of fresh air to hear some definite answers in the field that's commonly so muddled. And seeing how we got there. You don't need to be versed in QM, physics or even maths to be able to follow it. It does call for an attentive reader, however. One who is willing to pause and think, maybe re-read a paragraph or two.Moreover, Something Deeply Hidden tries to impart as much genuine understanding as is possible without dealing with complex numbers and matrix calculations. It goes right up to the maths wall, but it doesn't cross it.Popular explanations of scientific topics often resort to similes that seem to provide an understanding, but leave the audience confused on the underlying issues, building wrong intuitions instead of a coherent picture.Not this book. If you get it, you're genuinely close to *really* getting it and if you don't get it, you at least know.Quantum mechanics is a very young science, developed extremely quickly (most of the fundamentals having been laid down in the span of two decades) with twisted, colourful history full of fascinating characters. The book mostly ignores this.As such, Adam Becker's What Is Real? which came out earlier in the same year is a perfect companion to Sean Carroll's Something Deeply Hidden. The former paints the historical context while the latter dives into the science.The book begins with the outline for why we needed QM in the first place, followed by describing the wavefunction and its evolution governed by the Schrödinger equation and describing the various experiments and what they mean.It highlights that the deepest underpinnings of the theory are not understood at all (hence the proliferation of ""interpretations"" of QM), outlines why that might be the case and then selects a particular approach through which to make sense of all the observations.That explanation framework is the Hugh Everett's or Many-Worlds theory. It highlights its stark simplicity: ""The entire universe is a wave function evolving according to the Schrödinger equation. Period."" It is a deterministic theory as well, nothing random or unpredictable about it.It makes a good case that even if it doesn't turn out to be the ultimate answer, it is the purest thing we've got and it serves as a very nice lens to look at the quantum behaviour through. All the other theories need to postulate more stuff: elements other than the wave function, deviations from the Schrödinger equation, etc.It goes through ways which we might one day be able to experimentally determine one from the other (showing that these really aren't interpretations as much as genuinely different theories with different predictions).The common criticisms and misunderstandings are addressed in a really good chapter that's basically a Socratic dialogue between a many-worlds sceptic and a scientist studying it.It does highlight the other popular theories and tries to compare them with many-worlds, but it's explicitly clear what the main focus is. That said, even if you find many worlds unpalatable, problematic or plain weird, the will leave you with a much better understanding of quantum physics.The final section of the book focuses on the big unanswered question: what is the quantum theory of gravity? We've successfully quantised all the other fundamental forces. And we've got a really good picture of gravity in realms where it is fairly weak (i.e. the vast majority of the universe). But what's really going on in strong gravitational fields (black holes, the big bang) is still a huge unknown.The author goes over some interesting directions (some of which he was an active participant in) suggesting that since the traditional approach to quantising gravity has not worked out that well yet, maybe we should start looking at QM at its purest form and trying to derive spacetime and gravity that way. A bottom-up approach instead of the top-down one we've been doing so far.I really liked how this seems to be the culmination of the author's writing career to date. It tackles spacetime, geometry, entropy as well as morality in the face of our laws of physics -- all topics he'd written excellent books about before.There have been multiple cases where I was following the argument being laid out in front of me and a nagging question has arisen. Most books, these are left unanswered. Here? It was directly addressed a couple paragraphs later.I've read it as an audiobook (always a risky endeavour in a scientific topic) and it was excellent. Narrated by the author himself (to whom I could listen to constantly) and really well put together. The printed book had diagrams and equations, but these were described so well that it took me a while to realise they must have been there.Most similar audiobooks provide you with a PDF of all the pictures (if you're lucky) and you're supposed to have them handy while you listen. There was no need for any of that here. It stands perfectly on its own.PS: Just like the What Is Real? it paints Albert Einstein as fiercely smart person who understand QM as well as anyone and who's questions and criticisms cut right to the meat of the matter. He's been instrumental in building the theory and indeed it is his work in QM (quantisation of light) that resulted in his Nobel price (not relativity as people think). Instead of losing touch (as is the popular depiction) what he lost instead was the PR battle with Niels Bohr.I like this picture better than the popular one. Einstein was one sharp fucking cookie and this just makes so much more sense."

This is practically a book arguing that the many worlds hypothesis is our best escape from the Copenhagen interpretation. It is evidently a much more robust theory than all of our present alternatives. Recommended for those thinking about 'quantum foundations'. Well complimented by Tegmark's :https://www.google.com/search?client=...and smolin's https://www.google.com/search?client=...There were some things about this book that bothered me, but it did what it needed to do pretty decently."
211,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2167338-david-agranoff,4,"This book is not for everyone. Sean Carroll is an author I reviewed before with his epic book about the universe the Big Picture. I feel more deeply connected to this author because I know his voice well. I listen every week to his podcast mindscape that I often describe as Sean Carrol talks to other geniuses. I was familiar with these ideas and the many-worlds theories before not just as a Carroll podcast listener but as a huge Sci-fi nerd and Philip K Dick Podcaster. We have talked about Many-worlds in a pseudo-science 60's way a lot.I am not going to pretend for one minute that I am able to process more than the basic ideas here. I read this book quickly because whenever math or the Nitty-Gritty of how particles spin. I really enjoyed the history of discovery and how Carroll weaves the methods that the greats in science came to the various theories that make Quantum science. I know this will sound corny but my love for this topic has roots in my favorite childhood horror movie John Carpenter's Prince of Darkness that was the first place that a young me heard of Quantum psychics. This is primarily an introduction to one of the most debated issues in the study of spacetime, as such I think it is a good introduction but the big bottom line in this review do you enjoy this stuff? I do and still felt the need to skip a few parts. I enjoy Sean Carroll's books because he helps takes universe-spanning Ideas and boils them down. Separated into three sections, part one is where we get the majority of the history. This part is called Spooky based on the idea that even Einstein in the early days found these issues to be hard to deal with. In this section, Carroll sets up the questions that we are going to ponder. The second part is called Splitting and gets into what it all means. Part three Spacetime is where most of the interesting theories happen. The most interesting concepts for me were near the end. ""It is plausible that the symmetry between space and time that we are familiar with from relativity isn't built into Quantum Gravity."" Oh no he didn't? Was there more to the universe than Einstein could see? sure and towards the end Carroll questions if Space is even part of the equation and this tiny level. Another part I enjoyed was one of the last chapters that explained more of the science behind Black holes, as Hawking was quoted in the book Black holes ain't so black. I enjoyed Carroll's last book more than this one but that could have as much to do with the epic themes of that one. This one was designed to be a purely academic exercise, while the Big Picture dealt with the point where the rubber meets the road between cosmology and philosophy. "
212,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6953429-elazar,2,"I had high hopes for this book especially because I am a long-time listener and admirer of Sean‘s podcasts. Unfortunately, I felt like I was reading a preacher’s sermon on why the Many Worlds theory is the “truth” and why every other theory is wrong. I wasn’t convinced. "
213,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85852005-sato,5,"I personally find Everettian quantum mechanics, and all the many worlds that it implies, to be by far the most plausible version of quantum theory that I know of. And this book mainly tries to present an understandable version of quantum mechanics and to show that everything is basically quantum and drawing a line between the classical world and quantomic world is not quiet sensible. But the other notion that Sean Carroll tries to show us is this Feynman’s famous quote: “ No one truly understands Quantum mechanics”, and we already have a lot to know about it specially when we try to describe spacetime and the notions in the quantum field theory and the quantum theory of gravity. For many years now, the search for a complete and compelling quantum theory of gravity has been recognized as an important scientific goal.Here is a general idea of Quantum mechanics 1.Set up the system by fixing a specific wave function Ψ.2. Evolve the system using Schrödinger’s equation.3. There are certain observable quantities we can choose to measure, such as position, and when we do measure them, we obtain definite results.4. The probability of getting any one particular result can be calculated from the wave function. The wave function associates an amplitude with every possible measurement outcome; the probability for any outcome is the square of that amplitude.5. Upon measurement, the wave function collapses. However spread out it may have been pre-measurement, afterward it is concentrated on the result we obtained(Measurement Problem). To get a general idea of Everett’s Many-Worlds interpretation as an alternative to the measurement problem and equally as the gist of Sean’s efforts all along the book, I tried to bring the general approach of Everettian quantum mechanics in Sean Carol’s words(slightly changed). Many-Worlds Before the measurement happens, there is one electron and one observer. After they interact, however, rather than thinking of that one observer having evolved into a superposition of possible states, we could think of them as having evolved into multiple possible observers. The right way to describe things after the measurement, in this view, is not as one person with multiple ideas about where the electron was seen, but as multiple worlds, each of which contains a single person with a very definite idea about where the electron was seen.Here’s the big reveal: what we’ve described as austere quantum mechanics is more commonly known as the Everett, or Many-Worlds, formulation of quantum mechanics, first put forward by Hugh Everett in 1957. The Everett view arises from a fundamental annoyance with all of the special rules about measurements that are presented as part of the standard textbook quantum recipe, and suggests instead that there is just a single kind of quantum evolution. The price we pay for this vastly increased elegance of theoretical formalism is that the theory describes many copies of what we think of as “the universe,” each slightly different, but each truly real in some sense. Whether the benefit is worth the cost is an issue about which people disagree. (It is.)"
214,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47544933-jose-rodriguez,5,"I think that Sean Carroll is one of the best “popularizers” of physics I have ever encountered. One could argue that such popularizations are like cartoon versions of literature classics, and in some ways they are. But if done well, they can bring an understanding of the “forest” that could be lost when engaged in the particularities of the mathematical “trees.” On this book, Carroll tackles the foundations of quantum mechanics, a problem from the very beginning of the field and which many physicists feel is not relevant to the calculations and experiments they carry out. Who cares if we can’t figure out what is the wave function collapse that happens after a measurement, as proposed by the so-called “Copenhagen interpretation”, if we have done extremely well without worrying about it?But some people would find this attitude deeply unsatisfactory, since it results in no understanding of the nature of reality, and the judgement by Richard Feynman that nobody really understands quantum mechanics.One of the most popular solutions has been the Many Worlds interpretation that Hugh Everett III proposed in the 1950’s, which was ignored or ridiculed by many physicists, resulting in Everett working in the defense industry after his PhD, and maybe contributing to his early death due to alcohol and other unhealthy habits, But recently there has been a resurgence of interest in these ideas, partly due to their relevance to a formulation of quantum gravity. And Sean Johnson comes out in this book as a major proponent of the Everett interpretation. It is a very difficult endeavor, and I’m not sure that he was completely successful in achieving the goal. And because he only uses words, I found that some of the concepts remained unclear, which made me wish for a lot of equations on the pages. Things get worse when the discussion turns into philosophical issues of ontology and epistemology, in which I found it very difficult to “disentangle” my thinking. The rock bottom is the chapter that tackles whether this view impacts our thinking about morality (it doesn’t). I wish that he would have stayed the course along the lines of his statement at different points that we are not really required to think about many worlds in the Everett picture. The main point is that we accept a universal wave function which evolves in accordance with Schroedinger’s equation, and from which descriptions of measurements, particles, and even space emerge (emergence is discussed in detail in his previous book “The Big Picture”). What convinced me to give this book five stars is its provocative discussion about new ways of thinking about reality. The last chapters discussing space, time, black holes, holographic picture, etc. of course do not present new solutions (they do not exist at this point), but are very successful in raising questions and introducing concepts that continue to make physics such an exciting field, at least for me.Now I should look for the equations, except that I don’t think I have the time nor the energy to do so."
215,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1680974-alex-zakharov,4,"A good non-technical introduction to quantum mechanics with heavy emphasis on Everettian interpretation. Carroll gives a brief history of the field including the 1927 Solvay conference, Einstein-Bohr debates, and personalities of the key players (Pauli, Schrodinger, Heisenberg, de Broglie). He then quickly goes over the basics that you need to follow the rest of the book – superposition, entanglement, Born rule, Wave Function, Hamiltonian, decoherence.Carroll quickly moves on to the measurement problem and describes both its well-known interpretations (“Copenhagen”, “Pilot Wave/Hidden Variables”, “Many Worlds”) and the relatively more recent Dynamical collapse and QBism theories. You get a good intuition for the theories themselves and pros/cons of each.As expected, he spends a fair amount of time on Everettian interpretation, of which he is a well-known proponent. Here we get a healthy dose of branching, decoherence, and wave function evolution. Carroll makes a case that technically the approach is pure (“austere” is his go-to word), and acknowledges that the amount of cognitive dissonance from reconciling this purity with observable reality is uncanny. He suggests a few cognitive tricks to reduce that dissonance, and some of them almost help. In the last part of the book we revisit quantum field theory (which is very nicely covered in his previous books btw), and start talking about theoretical physicists’ holy grail - quantum gravity. Carroll briefly explains how other fundamental forces were quantized, and why quantizing gravity is damn hard. We get a mention of String theory and a classy dis of AdS/CFT correspondence (field’s only lamp post in a drunken man’s parking garage). But there is hope still. Carroll is part of the wave of physicists who are becoming increasingly convinced that quantizing gravity will not happen. Instead we should derive spacetime itself from quantum mechanics, which would give us gravity on a quantum mechanical platter. Susskind & Maldacena’s 2013 “ER=EPR” paper is an obvious step in that direction, and Carroll’s thinking runs along similar lines. Space and locality is sorta-kinda like entanglement, and time is sorta-kinda like growth of the entanglement. (In Susskind’s case time is sorta-kinda like growth of quantum complexity). The first half of the book gets 5 stars – informative, mostly clear, fun to read. But, as we get into the second half, explanations start running away a bit. Carroll brings some back, but many escape. The fix is obvious - include equations in the text. Fine, if you don’t include equations in a popular science book so be it, but then providing more pictorial illustrations is a must."
216,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41901229-gary-moreau,4,"Given all the hoopla about science and technology of late, I set off about a year ago to find books that might help me to understand just exactly how far along scientists are in truly understanding our universe and thus being able to manipulate its course. And what could be more cutting edge than quantum physics, although the basics have been around for a century or more.Carroll is an accomplished theoretical physicist at the California Institute of Technology and a well-established author. He is also a proponent of the Many-Worlds school of the quantum world. (Yes, you exist in many worlds but you will never meet yourself.) The book is well written and intended for an audience broader than the professional physicist. And bravo for that. Alas, however, try as he might, this book will be a slog for the average lay reader. The physics that most of us learned in school is all about particles. Quantum physics, on the other hand, is all about waves and fields. In such a fluid world, the sheer act of measuring something, changes whatever it is we’re measuring. (Akin to trying to catch the proverbial greased pig.)Part of the problem that scientists, particularly physicists, face is that their only vehicle for communicating what they learn is language. But language is a human convention. It is not of nature like oxygen and rain. And it is, by definition, symbolic. That’s why we invented it, to facilitate communication.The universe, however, is not a human convention. It is nature itself. Nor is it symbolic. It is the universe. That’s about as real as it gets.Scientists attempt to get around this by creating their own language and system of notation. It sounds impressive, but it doesn’t quite bridge the gap. “Is the picture we’ve sketched, where the entanglement between degrees of freedom somehow comes together to define the geometry of our approximately classical spacetime, actually on the right track?” He ultimately answers that complex question with the simplest of answer. “Nobody knows for sure.”In the end, my conclusion is that scientists are not as far along as many would have us believe. They know a lot, and there are many brilliant minds working through the issues, but “a lot” is a relative calibration. There is much they don’t know. In a way, I admit, that is reassuring to me. I am not a religious man. I am, however, a philosopher. I am comfortable with the unknown. The great unknown gives us something to think about. And it’s the thinking, rather than the ultimate conclusion, which I have come to believe is the true essence of knowledge.A very worthwhile book but you have to be willing to put in the effort."
217,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5469227-d-l-morrese,4,"Sean Carroll is a well-known and respected theoretical physicist, and I am in no way qualified to review his book. I did read it, however, and I did enjoy it, in a way. What I enjoyed mostly, I think, was the thought that some very clever people probably understand it. Sadly, I can't say I'm one of them. There are three reasons for this: I don't have a background in quantum mechanics, I'm not especially brilliant, and I don't think my mind is flexible enough to wrap around most of the ideas presented. None of these are the fault of the book, hence my 4-star rating. The point Dr. Carroll is making, as best I can tell, is that reality, in all its apparent wild complexity and diversity is, in fact, simply the wave function of the universe evolving in accordance with Schrödinger's equation. Like, duh! Why didn't I think of that?Just kidding. I have only a vague idea what that even means. What Dr. Carrol thinks it means (or at least what I think he thinks it means) is that truly quantum phenomena cause the universal wave function to split or branch, which results in two equally real universes where before there was only one...not that anyone notices, or can notice, or even know which one they are in.... I can understand the idea of branching. Actually, it's what the late, great Terry Pratchett used as a premise in his books Jingo and Night Watch. (Excellent stories with cops, robbers, revolution, and a special, magical kind of physics set in a wonderfully imaginative fantasy world. I highly recommend them. But, I digress. Back to the subject at hand...) The creation of multiple worlds every time an entangled particle is seen to spin one way when it could equally have been observed to spin another seems to be a rather inefficient way of constructing a universe, but I'm willing to go along with it if it's all backed up with a sound theory and some supporting observations. After reading this book, I'm still not sure it is. Again, probably not the fault of the book, and it makes a great premise for a good story."
218,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/106439976-axel-brambila,4,"Since the dawn of time, humans have tried to figure out how the world works. Countless theories have been created to simplify the world for us. This book talks about how the world looks quantumly, or to the smallest spectrum. For instance, we know that Earth turns counter-clockwise to the sun but what are the atoms doing when this happens. Quantum physics in this book is explained well enough for anyone to understand what we've learned. However, it is a matter of how motivated you are to learn about the subject, because you will oftentimes find yourself rereading paragraphs in order to fully understand. The book sometimes even surfaces starter physics topics, which might affect the reading of an experienced physics student. The contents of the book range from how much we don't know, different theorys, and space-time. I enjoyed the book as it was a great learning experience. The many different theories were enjoyable to learn about; with the many-worlds theory being my favorite because of its craziness. The world splitting into different realities like a cell dividing is a real possibility, and it is scary finding out how little we know about the world. The state of quantum physics now is like the average person using a phone. We know how to use it, but we don't know what is actually going on in the inside. Overall, I gave this book a 4/5 because it made learning quantum physics enjoyable."
219,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98493136-martin-reader,4,"This is a good book. It covers not only the subject of quantum mechanics, but the history as well. He provides a reach history of the discussions between Neils Bohr and Albert Einstein. Bohr favored using quantum mechanics to drive innovation. And it certainly did – from nuclear weapons, to computes to electronics advancements, quantum mechanics has delivered much. But Einstein’s issue was not with what quantum mechanics could explain, he wanted to know why quantum mechanics worked. The field of quantum foundations – why the world behaves in a quantum fashion – was largely ignored for decades. It was not until 1957 when Hugh Everett developed the many worlds approach, that the topic began to be discussed again. Carroll explains how observations and experiments continue to support the Everett model of many worlds. The arguments are sometimes difficult to follow, but as he points out, Richard Feynman once said “I think I can safely say that no one understands quantum mechanics.” "
220,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15709090-cole,3,"As some other reviewers have remarked, I found the first third (maybe even half?) of Carroll’s latest book to be an enthralling ride, but it quickly took off without me thereafter. Things become pretty impenetrable for a book marketed as a popular science read, even taking into consideration the unintuitive nature of any discussion of quantum mechanics.It’s a shame, as Carroll has proven himself capable at explaining complex topics with ease and charm, and the concept of Many Worlds is fascinating to say the least. What I’m missing here is that quality being consistent across the book. (To be clear, I can’t imagine what an incredible challenge this would be.)For readers with more than an armchair physics nerd’s knowledge, I’m sure this could easily be a 4 or 5 star read."

I'm not sure why. The content was somewhat interesting, but ""Many Worlds"" reminds me a bit of String Theory in that they are both a bit far-fetched. I'm not saying that they can't be. I'm just saying that it's a bit much to swallow. Maybe classic Physics and a slight lean toward empiricism is holding me back a bit. I believe Carroll knew when he wrote this book that many would suffer from my affliction.But hey... there are stranger things and all that, Horatio. ;)"

It is not that kind of book you should take to the beach or read it on subway. Disclaimer: I had not been familiar with anything concerning quantum physics before reading this.This book introduces to you a theory of many worlds, which is on its own really amazing. The problem is in our human brains - it is not that easy for us to grasp the concept of spatial infinity. Even harder problem is accepting the concept of branching. But when you admit it could be true (I still have no idea if everything is as described or everything works completely differently), a world... Wait, many worlds of amazing possibilities opened up.

This is not a criticism: I actually think Carroll did a very good job of dressing modern physics up in a way that is accessible for non-physicists, but you have to work for it (I didn't consistently do, so the rating can be understood as one of my job as a reader too).

I still don't fully understand this stuff, but reading more about it is exciting and makes the world (universe, really) a really fascinating place to live.The moral of this story is most of the shit you worry about is not a big deal. The universe is pretty random and vastly more interesting than you are."

Need some more knowledge in quantum mechanics. But I think it is still ok to read: ""I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics."" - Richard FeynmanIt is a bit hard to accept Many-Worlds interpretation with our (at least my) current understandings of our mind, our life and our world. Multiverse looks fun in Hollywood movies though. Anyways, it is just hypothesis."

237,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73419547-doctor-moss,5,"Quantum theory is frustrating. That’s probably a laughable understatement, especially for a non-physicist like me. After all, Richard Feynman famously said, “I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics.”As Sean Carroll points out, physicists are themselves encouraged to treat quantum mechanics as a basis for calculations more than as a description of reality. Those who venture into questions about the reality that quantum theory describes or the “meaning” of quantum mechanics are venturing into “quantum foundations,” a potentially disreputable and risky neighborhood.That’s what Carroll does here, presenting and arguing for the Everett or “Many Worlds” interpretation of quantum theory. We owe Hugh Everett credit for originating that interpretation in 1957, by contrast with the traditionally dominant Copenhagen interpretation, championed by Werner Heisenberg in collaboration if not always agreement with Niels Bohr. According to the Copenhagen interpretation and the Everett interpretation as well, quantum phenomena, e.g., the position, momentum, or spin of a particle such as an electron, are described by a wave function rather than, classically, by determinate, discrete values. I won’t try to explain why this is so — that would strain both the limits of a review and my understanding. For that, Carroll’s book does a good job. The wave function spreads such values as position, momentum, and spin across possible values, and it is not until a property such as those is “measured” that the value becomes determinate and distinct. It is not just that we don’t know the value until it is measured — it doesn’t exist until it is measured.Part of the difficulty in understanding this aspect of quantum theory, as Carroll explains, is that we tend to cling to a classical description of reality as made up of tiny bits of matter — “particles” in that classical sense. But particles, at least on some readings of quantum theory, really are wave functions. Their behavior isn’t just described by a wave function — they ARE wave functions. That’s where, I think, the difficulty in understanding quantum mechanics as a true description of reality begins. A wave function, after all, is a mathematical entity.But that’s just the beginning. Next comes “entanglement.” Again, please excuse the compressed explanation — Carroll does a much better job. Two particles, e.g., photons or electrons, can become “entangled” via various naturally occurring methods. Photons for example can create “entangled” pairs of electrons and positrons when passing through the nucleus of an atom. The two particles comprise a system with a net neutral charge and zero spin. If we then measure the spin of the electron and find it clockwise, we know that if we measure the spin of the positron, it will be counterclockwise. The tricky part is, of course, that the spin of the electron, before it is measured is neither clockwise nor counterclockwise. It becomes one or the other only upon measurement. Now, suppose that the electron and positron pair, since their generation, have grown far apart in distance from one another. The measurement of one of the pair, given their entangled state, will not only determine the spin of that one particle, but also, apparently instantaneously, the spin of the other. This is what upset Einstein as “spooky action at a distance.” It seems to defy both common sense and the constraint set by the speed of light as the maximum speed at which a causal influence can be transmitted — in this case, the effect (the direction of spin of the second particle) seems to be generated instantaneously by the cause (the direction of spin of the first particle).It is at this point that the Copenhagen and Everett interpretations diverge. On the Copenhagen interpretation, when the measurement occurs (which could be performed by a human observer or by an instrument of one sort or another), the wave function of the particle is said to “collapse.” It resolves uniquely to the value obtained by the measurement. End of story (except for entanglement and other difficult to swallow aspects of the theory as a whole).According to the Everett interpretation, the wave function does not collapse to a unique, single value — rather it “branches” into multiple worlds in which different possible values hold. In one world, the one we continue in, the electron has a clockwise spin, but in another that branches away from ours, it has a counterclockwise spin.That may sound outrageous and “metaphysical,” but there is, Carroll maintains, a solid rationale behind it. The Copenhagen interpretation treats the measurement, and the entanglement as a separate system from the observer or measuring device. In fact, the measuring device or observer is treated as part of a classically defined physical space, without entanglement with the quantum phenomenon being measured. By contrast, the Everett interpretation imposes no such seemingly ad hoc boundary between the measuring and the phenomenon measured. Rather than a wave function confined to the measured system, Everett’s wave function is “universal” — all phenomena in the universe are treated as at least potentially in entangled relationships comprising a single system. When a measurement is made, that universe is branched, and values not obtained in this universe are realized in other worlds. Since measurement itself — the fixing of a value on a quantum phenomenon — happens naturally and frequently (many, many, many times per second), the number of worlds, or branchings, that have taken place since the time of the Big Bang, is very, very, very large — Carroll gives a quick approximate calculation of two to the tenth to the 112 worlds. Hence the name “Many Worlds.”In fact, as Carroll explains, entanglement is a pervasive property, at the submicroscopic quantum level. The natural processes that produce it are part of the equally pervasive interactions among the quantum particles that underlie the experienced universe.His arguments in favor of the Everett interpretation, you may begin to realize, are methodological, even philosophical. Carroll is well-versed in some of the relevant works in philosophy of science and logic, giving him the background support he needs in order to make an Occam’s Razor inspired defense of the Everett interpretation as one that hews most closely to the well-ordered and empirically validated core of quantum theory — the wave function and entanglement. Other interpretations, including not only the Copenhagen interpretation but others briefly discussed in a chapter on alternatives, tend to introduce ad hoc entities, values, or assumptions in order to make the theory more containable within expectations and mathematical standards. I should mention in passing that one of these alternative interpretations that Carroll discusses is an “epistemic” interpretation. An “epistemic” interpretation is one in which the theory is viewed not so much as describing reality as describing our knowledge of reality. Interpretations that claim that quantum theory describes reality per se are called “ontic” by contrast. Epistemic interpretations, including the Copenhagen interpretation as read by many, draws back from what you might call a realist or even metaphysical claim (using “metaphysical” in the philosophical sense of pertaining to a reality independent of our ideas, thoughts, or knowledge of it). But Carroll is answering, in part, a challenge posed by Einstein in his objections to the Copenhagen interpretation. Einstein had objected both to its violation of “locality” (i.e., instantaneous action over distances) and to its failure to provide a comprehensible description of reality. The Everett interpretation does accept the violation of locality, so Einstein would not be pleased.Does it provide a comprehensible description of reality? It’s hard to say so, until we understand what “many worlds” really means. How do we give that concept itself an “ontic” interpretation? I don’t know, and that’s something that Carroll doesn’t venture far into. He does, in a footnote, distinguish “Many Worlds” from “Multiverse” where the latter has a quasi-spatial understanding, as separate regions of or domains of a kind of meta-space (or spacetime). He means something else. And he includes a chapter that attempts to resolve some of the vertigo we get when we imagine ourselves as part of this universe that is constantly branching into more and more worlds. What becomes of me? Well, there’s another me, but a different me, experiencing some other world. There are certainly uses of “world” that would seem to resonate with this idea of “many worlds” — the “possible worlds” discussed in philosophical logic and the mathematical spaces discussed in theoretical math. But none of those are going to meet a middling standard of intuitiveness or provide a kind of realist “ontic” feel. And I don’t think Carroll really helps us with that problem.The final third or so of the book carries on from the Everett interpretation to an even more speculative discussion of how spacetime itself might be generated from quantum theory. The discussion brings back the Einsteinian concept of locality to generate an idea of spatial separation as a matter of decreasing entanglement — in simplistic terms, spatial distance is generated as a decrease in the degree of entanglement of the particles making up the universe. As with much of quantum theory, in this speculative story about the origin of spacetime, it’s difficult to tell where we are telling a story of how the math that describes reality is generated and where we are telling a story that describes how the reality itself is generated. In any case, maybe despite the book’s subtitle, the heart of the book is Carroll’s presentation and argument for the Everett interpretation.Who is this book for? It’s going to be taxing for anyone who wants to read casually. As with any book on quantum theory, it is conceptually demanding. This stuff is hard to think about. And the concepts come fast and hard at times. You’ll have to put some effort into it. It isn’t mathematically challenging. There are, as I noticed them anyway, only two mathematical formulas in the book — Schrodinger’s wave function formula and Einstein’s for the curvature of spacetime. But these are offered really only as illustrations, not as formulas the reader needs to understand in any detail.I’m not a specialist, so I won’t try to say much about the interest that physicists themselves may take. I think, for many, it may be a broadening experience to reflect on the “meaning” of quantum theory.I enjoyed the book. There are a lot of books on quantum theory that rely heavily on metaphor and attempts to reduce the unintuitive to the intuitive. Carroll doesn’t do that, so I believe I’m actually experiencing how he, as a quantum theorist, thinks about what he is working on. The cost may be that, although my understanding of quantum theory and its “meaning” are much greater for having read the book, the holes in my understanding (and in the account I’ve given here) are more glaring to me."
238,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29467608-serro,2,"This might have been too technical for me, or otherwise for really advanced science readers which I might not be.Quantum mechanics and quantum field theory is central to the book and the author expands a lot on the many worlds theory. I was lost on the concept of branching and how it could progressively produce multiple copies of ourselves on different branches. Still, this lead me to the idea of a multiverse and that is mind-blowing whichever way you look at it.Style-wise the author has tried indeed to the extent that he decided to integrate a dialogue on quantum mechanics between a father and his daughter, simply to make it more literary elegant with mixed effect."
239,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57803005-tomas-sedovic,5,"I wish my first introduction to Quantum Mechanics was with this book.Most approaches focus on the utter weirdness, elevating our misled intuitions and ignorance to a mysticism. What is the nature of the observer? Why is everything a both a wave and a particle? How is the can both alive and dead at the same time? Why the divide between the quantum realm and our everyday reality? And where does human consciousness come into all this?You hear people talk about QM with such an air of mystery, there's no wonder charlatans like Deepak Chopra take hold in the confusion.This book cuts right through the bullshit, focusing on what we know, why we know it, what we don't know and what are we doing about it.Things aren't a particle and a wave at the same time. Everything's waves. There's nothing special about an observer and absolutely nothing special about consciousness (from the QM point of view). QM has almost certainly nothing to do with your thought processes (other than the driving all the underlying chemistry that is). The act of ""observing"" is simply an entanglement of (what we perceive as) a particle with the measuring equipment and its environment. What you decide for lunch has no fundamental effect on the shape of the universe.It is a breath of fresh air to hear some definite answers in the field that's commonly so muddled. And seeing how we got there. You don't need to be versed in QM, physics or even maths to be able to follow it. It does call for an attentive reader, however. One who is willing to pause and think, maybe re-read a paragraph or two.Moreover, Something Deeply Hidden tries to impart as much genuine understanding as is possible without dealing with complex numbers and matrix calculations. It goes right up to the maths wall, but it doesn't cross it.Popular explanations of scientific topics often resort to similes that seem to provide an understanding, but leave the audience confused on the underlying issues, building wrong intuitions instead of a coherent picture.Not this book. If you get it, you're genuinely close to *really* getting it and if you don't get it, you at least know.Quantum mechanics is a very young science, developed extremely quickly (most of the fundamentals having been laid down in the span of two decades) with twisted, colourful history full of fascinating characters. The book mostly ignores this.As such, Adam Becker's What Is Real? which came out earlier in the same year is a perfect companion to Sean Carroll's Something Deeply Hidden. The former paints the historical context while the latter dives into the science.The book begins with the outline for why we needed QM in the first place, followed by describing the wavefunction and its evolution governed by the Schrödinger equation and describing the various experiments and what they mean.It highlights that the deepest underpinnings of the theory are not understood at all (hence the proliferation of ""interpretations"" of QM), outlines why that might be the case and then selects a particular approach through which to make sense of all the observations.That explanation framework is the Hugh Everett's or Many-Worlds theory. It highlights its stark simplicity: ""The entire universe is a wave function evolving according to the Schrödinger equation. Period."" It is a deterministic theory as well, nothing random or unpredictable about it.It makes a good case that even if it doesn't turn out to be the ultimate answer, it is the purest thing we've got and it serves as a very nice lens to look at the quantum behaviour through. All the other theories need to postulate more stuff: elements other than the wave function, deviations from the Schrödinger equation, etc.It goes through ways which we might one day be able to experimentally determine one from the other (showing that these really aren't interpretations as much as genuinely different theories with different predictions).The common criticisms and misunderstandings are addressed in a really good chapter that's basically a Socratic dialogue between a many-worlds sceptic and a scientist studying it.It does highlight the other popular theories and tries to compare them with many-worlds, but it's explicitly clear what the main focus is. That said, even if you find many worlds unpalatable, problematic or plain weird, the will leave you with a much better understanding of quantum physics.The final section of the book focuses on the big unanswered question: what is the quantum theory of gravity? We've successfully quantised all the other fundamental forces. And we've got a really good picture of gravity in realms where it is fairly weak (i.e. the vast majority of the universe). But what's really going on in strong gravitational fields (black holes, the big bang) is still a huge unknown.The author goes over some interesting directions (some of which he was an active participant in) suggesting that since the traditional approach to quantising gravity has not worked out that well yet, maybe we should start looking at QM at its purest form and trying to derive spacetime and gravity that way. A bottom-up approach instead of the top-down one we've been doing so far.I really liked how this seems to be the culmination of the author's writing career to date. It tackles spacetime, geometry, entropy as well as morality in the face of our laws of physics -- all topics he'd written excellent books about before.There have been multiple cases where I was following the argument being laid out in front of me and a nagging question has arisen. Most books, these are left unanswered. Here? It was directly addressed a couple paragraphs later.I've read it as an audiobook (always a risky endeavour in a scientific topic) and it was excellent. Narrated by the author himself (to whom I could listen to constantly) and really well put together. The printed book had diagrams and equations, but these were described so well that it took me a while to realise they must have been there.Most similar audiobooks provide you with a PDF of all the pictures (if you're lucky) and you're supposed to have them handy while you listen. There was no need for any of that here. It stands perfectly on its own.PS: Just like the What Is Real? it paints Albert Einstein as fiercely smart person who understand QM as well as anyone and who's questions and criticisms cut right to the meat of the matter. He's been instrumental in building the theory and indeed it is his work in QM (quantisation of light) that resulted in his Nobel price (not relativity as people think). Instead of losing touch (as is the popular depiction) what he lost instead was the PR battle with Niels Bohr.I like this picture better than the popular one. Einstein was one sharp fucking cookie and this just makes so much more sense."

This is practically a book arguing that the many worlds hypothesis is our best escape from the Copenhagen interpretation. It is evidently a much more robust theory than all of our present alternatives. Recommended for those thinking about 'quantum foundations'. Well complimented by Tegmark's :https://www.google.com/search?client=...and smolin's https://www.google.com/search?client=...There were some things about this book that bothered me, but it did what it needed to do pretty decently."
241,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2167338-david-agranoff,4,"This book is not for everyone. Sean Carroll is an author I reviewed before with his epic book about the universe the Big Picture. I feel more deeply connected to this author because I know his voice well. I listen every week to his podcast mindscape that I often describe as Sean Carrol talks to other geniuses. I was familiar with these ideas and the many-worlds theories before not just as a Carroll podcast listener but as a huge Sci-fi nerd and Philip K Dick Podcaster. We have talked about Many-worlds in a pseudo-science 60's way a lot.I am not going to pretend for one minute that I am able to process more than the basic ideas here. I read this book quickly because whenever math or the Nitty-Gritty of how particles spin. I really enjoyed the history of discovery and how Carroll weaves the methods that the greats in science came to the various theories that make Quantum science. I know this will sound corny but my love for this topic has roots in my favorite childhood horror movie John Carpenter's Prince of Darkness that was the first place that a young me heard of Quantum psychics. This is primarily an introduction to one of the most debated issues in the study of spacetime, as such I think it is a good introduction but the big bottom line in this review do you enjoy this stuff? I do and still felt the need to skip a few parts. I enjoy Sean Carroll's books because he helps takes universe-spanning Ideas and boils them down. Separated into three sections, part one is where we get the majority of the history. This part is called Spooky based on the idea that even Einstein in the early days found these issues to be hard to deal with. In this section, Carroll sets up the questions that we are going to ponder. The second part is called Splitting and gets into what it all means. Part three Spacetime is where most of the interesting theories happen. The most interesting concepts for me were near the end. ""It is plausible that the symmetry between space and time that we are familiar with from relativity isn't built into Quantum Gravity."" Oh no he didn't? Was there more to the universe than Einstein could see? sure and towards the end Carroll questions if Space is even part of the equation and this tiny level. Another part I enjoyed was one of the last chapters that explained more of the science behind Black holes, as Hawking was quoted in the book Black holes ain't so black. I enjoyed Carroll's last book more than this one but that could have as much to do with the epic themes of that one. This one was designed to be a purely academic exercise, while the Big Picture dealt with the point where the rubber meets the road between cosmology and philosophy. "
242,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6953429-elazar,2,"I had high hopes for this book especially because I am a long-time listener and admirer of Sean‘s podcasts. Unfortunately, I felt like I was reading a preacher’s sermon on why the Many Worlds theory is the “truth” and why every other theory is wrong. I wasn’t convinced. "
243,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85852005-sato,5,"I personally find Everettian quantum mechanics, and all the many worlds that it implies, to be by far the most plausible version of quantum theory that I know of. And this book mainly tries to present an understandable version of quantum mechanics and to show that everything is basically quantum and drawing a line between the classical world and quantomic world is not quiet sensible. But the other notion that Sean Carroll tries to show us is this Feynman’s famous quote: “ No one truly understands Quantum mechanics”, and we already have a lot to know about it specially when we try to describe spacetime and the notions in the quantum field theory and the quantum theory of gravity. For many years now, the search for a complete and compelling quantum theory of gravity has been recognized as an important scientific goal.Here is a general idea of Quantum mechanics 1.Set up the system by fixing a specific wave function Ψ.2. Evolve the system using Schrödinger’s equation.3. There are certain observable quantities we can choose to measure, such as position, and when we do measure them, we obtain definite results.4. The probability of getting any one particular result can be calculated from the wave function. The wave function associates an amplitude with every possible measurement outcome; the probability for any outcome is the square of that amplitude.5. Upon measurement, the wave function collapses. However spread out it may have been pre-measurement, afterward it is concentrated on the result we obtained(Measurement Problem). To get a general idea of Everett’s Many-Worlds interpretation as an alternative to the measurement problem and equally as the gist of Sean’s efforts all along the book, I tried to bring the general approach of Everettian quantum mechanics in Sean Carol’s words(slightly changed). Many-Worlds Before the measurement happens, there is one electron and one observer. After they interact, however, rather than thinking of that one observer having evolved into a superposition of possible states, we could think of them as having evolved into multiple possible observers. The right way to describe things after the measurement, in this view, is not as one person with multiple ideas about where the electron was seen, but as multiple worlds, each of which contains a single person with a very definite idea about where the electron was seen.Here’s the big reveal: what we’ve described as austere quantum mechanics is more commonly known as the Everett, or Many-Worlds, formulation of quantum mechanics, first put forward by Hugh Everett in 1957. The Everett view arises from a fundamental annoyance with all of the special rules about measurements that are presented as part of the standard textbook quantum recipe, and suggests instead that there is just a single kind of quantum evolution. The price we pay for this vastly increased elegance of theoretical formalism is that the theory describes many copies of what we think of as “the universe,” each slightly different, but each truly real in some sense. Whether the benefit is worth the cost is an issue about which people disagree. (It is.)"
244,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47544933-jose-rodriguez,5,"I think that Sean Carroll is one of the best “popularizers” of physics I have ever encountered. One could argue that such popularizations are like cartoon versions of literature classics, and in some ways they are. But if done well, they can bring an understanding of the “forest” that could be lost when engaged in the particularities of the mathematical “trees.” On this book, Carroll tackles the foundations of quantum mechanics, a problem from the very beginning of the field and which many physicists feel is not relevant to the calculations and experiments they carry out. Who cares if we can’t figure out what is the wave function collapse that happens after a measurement, as proposed by the so-called “Copenhagen interpretation”, if we have done extremely well without worrying about it?But some people would find this attitude deeply unsatisfactory, since it results in no understanding of the nature of reality, and the judgement by Richard Feynman that nobody really understands quantum mechanics.One of the most popular solutions has been the Many Worlds interpretation that Hugh Everett III proposed in the 1950’s, which was ignored or ridiculed by many physicists, resulting in Everett working in the defense industry after his PhD, and maybe contributing to his early death due to alcohol and other unhealthy habits, But recently there has been a resurgence of interest in these ideas, partly due to their relevance to a formulation of quantum gravity. And Sean Johnson comes out in this book as a major proponent of the Everett interpretation. It is a very difficult endeavor, and I’m not sure that he was completely successful in achieving the goal. And because he only uses words, I found that some of the concepts remained unclear, which made me wish for a lot of equations on the pages. Things get worse when the discussion turns into philosophical issues of ontology and epistemology, in which I found it very difficult to “disentangle” my thinking. The rock bottom is the chapter that tackles whether this view impacts our thinking about morality (it doesn’t). I wish that he would have stayed the course along the lines of his statement at different points that we are not really required to think about many worlds in the Everett picture. The main point is that we accept a universal wave function which evolves in accordance with Schroedinger’s equation, and from which descriptions of measurements, particles, and even space emerge (emergence is discussed in detail in his previous book “The Big Picture”). What convinced me to give this book five stars is its provocative discussion about new ways of thinking about reality. The last chapters discussing space, time, black holes, holographic picture, etc. of course do not present new solutions (they do not exist at this point), but are very successful in raising questions and introducing concepts that continue to make physics such an exciting field, at least for me.Now I should look for the equations, except that I don’t think I have the time nor the energy to do so."
245,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1680974-alex-zakharov,4,"A good non-technical introduction to quantum mechanics with heavy emphasis on Everettian interpretation. Carroll gives a brief history of the field including the 1927 Solvay conference, Einstein-Bohr debates, and personalities of the key players (Pauli, Schrodinger, Heisenberg, de Broglie). He then quickly goes over the basics that you need to follow the rest of the book – superposition, entanglement, Born rule, Wave Function, Hamiltonian, decoherence.Carroll quickly moves on to the measurement problem and describes both its well-known interpretations (“Copenhagen”, “Pilot Wave/Hidden Variables”, “Many Worlds”) and the relatively more recent Dynamical collapse and QBism theories. You get a good intuition for the theories themselves and pros/cons of each.As expected, he spends a fair amount of time on Everettian interpretation, of which he is a well-known proponent. Here we get a healthy dose of branching, decoherence, and wave function evolution. Carroll makes a case that technically the approach is pure (“austere” is his go-to word), and acknowledges that the amount of cognitive dissonance from reconciling this purity with observable reality is uncanny. He suggests a few cognitive tricks to reduce that dissonance, and some of them almost help. In the last part of the book we revisit quantum field theory (which is very nicely covered in his previous books btw), and start talking about theoretical physicists’ holy grail - quantum gravity. Carroll briefly explains how other fundamental forces were quantized, and why quantizing gravity is damn hard. We get a mention of String theory and a classy dis of AdS/CFT correspondence (field’s only lamp post in a drunken man’s parking garage). But there is hope still. Carroll is part of the wave of physicists who are becoming increasingly convinced that quantizing gravity will not happen. Instead we should derive spacetime itself from quantum mechanics, which would give us gravity on a quantum mechanical platter. Susskind & Maldacena’s 2013 “ER=EPR” paper is an obvious step in that direction, and Carroll’s thinking runs along similar lines. Space and locality is sorta-kinda like entanglement, and time is sorta-kinda like growth of the entanglement. (In Susskind’s case time is sorta-kinda like growth of quantum complexity). The first half of the book gets 5 stars – informative, mostly clear, fun to read. But, as we get into the second half, explanations start running away a bit. Carroll brings some back, but many escape. The fix is obvious - include equations in the text. Fine, if you don’t include equations in a popular science book so be it, but then providing more pictorial illustrations is a must."

The book is well written and intended for an audience broader than the professional physicist. And bravo for that. Alas, however, try as he might, this book will be a slog for the average lay reader. The physics that most of us learned in school is all about particles. Quantum physics, on the other hand, is all about waves and fields. In such a fluid world, the sheer act of measuring something, changes whatever it is we’re measuring. (Akin to trying to catch the proverbial greased pig.)Part of the problem that scientists, particularly physicists, face is that their only vehicle for communicating what they learn is language. But language is a human convention. It is not of nature like oxygen and rain. And it is, by definition, symbolic. That’s why we invented it, to facilitate communication.The universe, however, is not a human convention. It is nature itself. Nor is it symbolic. It is the universe. That’s about as real as it gets.Scientists attempt to get around this by creating their own language and system of notation. It sounds impressive, but it doesn’t quite bridge the gap. “Is the picture we’ve sketched, where the entanglement between degrees of freedom somehow comes together to define the geometry of our approximately classical spacetime, actually on the right track?” He ultimately answers that complex question with the simplest of answer. “Nobody knows for sure.”In the end, my conclusion is that scientists are not as far along as many would have us believe. They know a lot, and there are many brilliant minds working through the issues, but “a lot” is a relative calibration. There is much they don’t know. In a way, I admit, that is reassuring to me. I am not a religious man. I am, however, a philosopher. I am comfortable with the unknown. The great unknown gives us something to think about. And it’s the thinking, rather than the ultimate conclusion, which I have come to believe is the true essence of knowledge.A very worthwhile book but you have to be willing to put in the effort."
247,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5469227-d-l-morrese,4,"Sean Carroll is a well-known and respected theoretical physicist, and I am in no way qualified to review his book. I did read it, however, and I did enjoy it, in a way. What I enjoyed mostly, I think, was the thought that some very clever people probably understand it. Sadly, I can't say I'm one of them. There are three reasons for this: I don't have a background in quantum mechanics, I'm not especially brilliant, and I don't think my mind is flexible enough to wrap around most of the ideas presented. None of these are the fault of the book, hence my 4-star rating. The point Dr. Carroll is making, as best I can tell, is that reality, in all its apparent wild complexity and diversity is, in fact, simply the wave function of the universe evolving in accordance with Schrödinger's equation. Like, duh! Why didn't I think of that?Just kidding. I have only a vague idea what that even means. What Dr. Carrol thinks it means (or at least what I think he thinks it means) is that truly quantum phenomena cause the universal wave function to split or branch, which results in two equally real universes where before there was only one...not that anyone notices, or can notice, or even know which one they are in.... I can understand the idea of branching. Actually, it's what the late, great Terry Pratchett used as a premise in his books Jingo and Night Watch. (Excellent stories with cops, robbers, revolution, and a special, magical kind of physics set in a wonderfully imaginative fantasy world. I highly recommend them. But, I digress. Back to the subject at hand...) The creation of multiple worlds every time an entangled particle is seen to spin one way when it could equally have been observed to spin another seems to be a rather inefficient way of constructing a universe, but I'm willing to go along with it if it's all backed up with a sound theory and some supporting observations. After reading this book, I'm still not sure it is. Again, probably not the fault of the book, and it makes a great premise for a good story."
248,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/106439976-axel-brambila,4,"Since the dawn of time, humans have tried to figure out how the world works. Countless theories have been created to simplify the world for us. This book talks about how the world looks quantumly, or to the smallest spectrum. For instance, we know that Earth turns counter-clockwise to the sun but what are the atoms doing when this happens. Quantum physics in this book is explained well enough for anyone to understand what we've learned. However, it is a matter of how motivated you are to learn about the subject, because you will oftentimes find yourself rereading paragraphs in order to fully understand. The book sometimes even surfaces starter physics topics, which might affect the reading of an experienced physics student. The contents of the book range from how much we don't know, different theorys, and space-time. I enjoyed the book as it was a great learning experience. The many different theories were enjoyable to learn about; with the many-worlds theory being my favorite because of its craziness. The world splitting into different realities like a cell dividing is a real possibility, and it is scary finding out how little we know about the world. The state of quantum physics now is like the average person using a phone. We know how to use it, but we don't know what is actually going on in the inside. Overall, I gave this book a 4/5 because it made learning quantum physics enjoyable."
249,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98493136-martin-reader,4,"This is a good book. It covers not only the subject of quantum mechanics, but the history as well. He provides a reach history of the discussions between Neils Bohr and Albert Einstein. Bohr favored using quantum mechanics to drive innovation. And it certainly did – from nuclear weapons, to computes to electronics advancements, quantum mechanics has delivered much. But Einstein’s issue was not with what quantum mechanics could explain, he wanted to know why quantum mechanics worked. The field of quantum foundations – why the world behaves in a quantum fashion – was largely ignored for decades. It was not until 1957 when Hugh Everett developed the many worlds approach, that the topic began to be discussed again. Carroll explains how observations and experiments continue to support the Everett model of many worlds. The arguments are sometimes difficult to follow, but as he points out, Richard Feynman once said “I think I can safely say that no one understands quantum mechanics.” "
250,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15709090-cole,3,"As some other reviewers have remarked, I found the first third (maybe even half?) of Carroll’s latest book to be an enthralling ride, but it quickly took off without me thereafter. Things become pretty impenetrable for a book marketed as a popular science read, even taking into consideration the unintuitive nature of any discussion of quantum mechanics.It’s a shame, as Carroll has proven himself capable at explaining complex topics with ease and charm, and the concept of Many Worlds is fascinating to say the least. What I’m missing here is that quality being consistent across the book. (To be clear, I can’t imagine what an incredible challenge this would be.)For readers with more than an armchair physics nerd’s knowledge, I’m sure this could easily be a 4 or 5 star read."

I'm not sure why. The content was somewhat interesting, but ""Many Worlds"" reminds me a bit of String Theory in that they are both a bit far-fetched. I'm not saying that they can't be. I'm just saying that it's a bit much to swallow. Maybe classic Physics and a slight lean toward empiricism is holding me back a bit. I believe Carroll knew when he wrote this book that many would suffer from my affliction.But hey... there are stranger things and all that, Horatio. ;)"

It is not that kind of book you should take to the beach or read it on subway. Disclaimer: I had not been familiar with anything concerning quantum physics before reading this.This book introduces to you a theory of many worlds, which is on its own really amazing. The problem is in our human brains - it is not that easy for us to grasp the concept of spatial infinity. Even harder problem is accepting the concept of branching. But when you admit it could be true (I still have no idea if everything is as described or everything works completely differently), a world... Wait, many worlds of amazing possibilities opened up.

This is not a criticism: I actually think Carroll did a very good job of dressing modern physics up in a way that is accessible for non-physicists, but you have to work for it (I didn't consistently do, so the rating can be understood as one of my job as a reader too).

I still don't fully understand this stuff, but reading more about it is exciting and makes the world (universe, really) a really fascinating place to live.The moral of this story is most of the shit you worry about is not a big deal.

But I think it is still ok to read: ""I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics."" - Richard FeynmanIt is a bit hard to accept Many-Worlds interpretation with our (at least my) current understandings of our mind, our life and our world. Multiverse looks fun in Hollywood movies though. Anyways, it is just hypothesis."

267,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73419547-doctor-moss,5,"Quantum theory is frustrating. That’s probably a laughable understatement, especially for a non-physicist like me. After all, Richard Feynman famously said, “I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics.”As Sean Carroll points out, physicists are themselves encouraged to treat quantum mechanics as a basis for calculations more than as a description of reality. Those who venture into questions about the reality that quantum theory describes or the “meaning” of quantum mechanics are venturing into “quantum foundations,” a potentially disreputable and risky neighborhood.That’s what Carroll does here, presenting and arguing for the Everett or “Many Worlds” interpretation of quantum theory. We owe Hugh Everett credit for originating that interpretation in 1957, by contrast with the traditionally dominant Copenhagen interpretation, championed by Werner Heisenberg in collaboration if not always agreement with Niels Bohr. According to the Copenhagen interpretation and the Everett interpretation as well, quantum phenomena, e.g., the position, momentum, or spin of a particle such as an electron, are described by a wave function rather than, classically, by determinate, discrete values. I won’t try to explain why this is so — that would strain both the limits of a review and my understanding. For that, Carroll’s book does a good job. The wave function spreads such values as position, momentum, and spin across possible values, and it is not until a property such as those is “measured” that the value becomes determinate and distinct. It is not just that we don’t know the value until it is measured — it doesn’t exist until it is measured.Part of the difficulty in understanding this aspect of quantum theory, as Carroll explains, is that we tend to cling to a classical description of reality as made up of tiny bits of matter — “particles” in that classical sense. But particles, at least on some readings of quantum theory, really are wave functions. Their behavior isn’t just described by a wave function — they ARE wave functions. That’s where, I think, the difficulty in understanding quantum mechanics as a true description of reality begins. A wave function, after all, is a mathematical entity.But that’s just the beginning. Next comes “entanglement.” Again, please excuse the compressed explanation — Carroll does a much better job. Two particles, e.g., photons or electrons, can become “entangled” via various naturally occurring methods. Photons for example can create “entangled” pairs of electrons and positrons when passing through the nucleus of an atom. The two particles comprise a system with a net neutral charge and zero spin. If we then measure the spin of the electron and find it clockwise, we know that if we measure the spin of the positron, it will be counterclockwise. The tricky part is, of course, that the spin of the electron, before it is measured is neither clockwise nor counterclockwise. It becomes one or the other only upon measurement. Now, suppose that the electron and positron pair, since their generation, have grown far apart in distance from one another. The measurement of one of the pair, given their entangled state, will not only determine the spin of that one particle, but also, apparently instantaneously, the spin of the other. This is what upset Einstein as “spooky action at a distance.” It seems to defy both common sense and the constraint set by the speed of light as the maximum speed at which a causal influence can be transmitted — in this case, the effect (the direction of spin of the second particle) seems to be generated instantaneously by the cause (the direction of spin of the first particle).It is at this point that the Copenhagen and Everett interpretations diverge. On the Copenhagen interpretation, when the measurement occurs (which could be performed by a human observer or by an instrument of one sort or another), the wave function of the particle is said to “collapse.” It resolves uniquely to the value obtained by the measurement. End of story (except for entanglement and other difficult to swallow aspects of the theory as a whole).According to the Everett interpretation, the wave function does not collapse to a unique, single value — rather it “branches” into multiple worlds in which different possible values hold. In one world, the one we continue in, the electron has a clockwise spin, but in another that branches away from ours, it has a counterclockwise spin.That may sound outrageous and “metaphysical,” but there is, Carroll maintains, a solid rationale behind it. The Copenhagen interpretation treats the measurement, and the entanglement as a separate system from the observer or measuring device. In fact, the measuring device or observer is treated as part of a classically defined physical space, without entanglement with the quantum phenomenon being measured. By contrast, the Everett interpretation imposes no such seemingly ad hoc boundary between the measuring and the phenomenon measured. Rather than a wave function confined to the measured system, Everett’s wave function is “universal” — all phenomena in the universe are treated as at least potentially in entangled relationships comprising a single system. When a measurement is made, that universe is branched, and values not obtained in this universe are realized in other worlds. Since measurement itself — the fixing of a value on a quantum phenomenon — happens naturally and frequently (many, many, many times per second), the number of worlds, or branchings, that have taken place since the time of the Big Bang, is very, very, very large — Carroll gives a quick approximate calculation of two to the tenth to the 112 worlds. Hence the name “Many Worlds.”In fact, as Carroll explains, entanglement is a pervasive property, at the submicroscopic quantum level. The natural processes that produce it are part of the equally pervasive interactions among the quantum particles that underlie the experienced universe.His arguments in favor of the Everett interpretation, you may begin to realize, are methodological, even philosophical. Carroll is well-versed in some of the relevant works in philosophy of science and logic, giving him the background support he needs in order to make an Occam’s Razor inspired defense of the Everett interpretation as one that hews most closely to the well-ordered and empirically validated core of quantum theory — the wave function and entanglement. Other interpretations, including not only the Copenhagen interpretation but others briefly discussed in a chapter on alternatives, tend to introduce ad hoc entities, values, or assumptions in order to make the theory more containable within expectations and mathematical standards. I should mention in passing that one of these alternative interpretations that Carroll discusses is an “epistemic” interpretation. An “epistemic” interpretation is one in which the theory is viewed not so much as describing reality as describing our knowledge of reality. Interpretations that claim that quantum theory describes reality per se are called “ontic” by contrast. Epistemic interpretations, including the Copenhagen interpretation as read by many, draws back from what you might call a realist or even metaphysical claim (using “metaphysical” in the philosophical sense of pertaining to a reality independent of our ideas, thoughts, or knowledge of it). But Carroll is answering, in part, a challenge posed by Einstein in his objections to the Copenhagen interpretation. Einstein had objected both to its violation of “locality” (i.e., instantaneous action over distances) and to its failure to provide a comprehensible description of reality. The Everett interpretation does accept the violation of locality, so Einstein would not be pleased.Does it provide a comprehensible description of reality? It’s hard to say so, until we understand what “many worlds” really means. How do we give that concept itself an “ontic” interpretation? I don’t know, and that’s something that Carroll doesn’t venture far into. He does, in a footnote, distinguish “Many Worlds” from “Multiverse” where the latter has a quasi-spatial understanding, as separate regions of or domains of a kind of meta-space (or spacetime). He means something else. And he includes a chapter that attempts to resolve some of the vertigo we get when we imagine ourselves as part of this universe that is constantly branching into more and more worlds. What becomes of me? Well, there’s another me, but a different me, experiencing some other world. There are certainly uses of “world” that would seem to resonate with this idea of “many worlds” — the “possible worlds” discussed in philosophical logic and the mathematical spaces discussed in theoretical math. But none of those are going to meet a middling standard of intuitiveness or provide a kind of realist “ontic” feel. And I don’t think Carroll really helps us with that problem.The final third or so of the book carries on from the Everett interpretation to an even more speculative discussion of how spacetime itself might be generated from quantum theory. The discussion brings back the Einsteinian concept of locality to generate an idea of spatial separation as a matter of decreasing entanglement — in simplistic terms, spatial distance is generated as a decrease in the degree of entanglement of the particles making up the universe. As with much of quantum theory, in this speculative story about the origin of spacetime, it’s difficult to tell where we are telling a story of how the math that describes reality is generated and where we are telling a story that describes how the reality itself is generated. In any case, maybe despite the book’s subtitle, the heart of the book is Carroll’s presentation and argument for the Everett interpretation.Who is this book for? It’s going to be taxing for anyone who wants to read casually. As with any book on quantum theory, it is conceptually demanding. This stuff is hard to think about. And the concepts come fast and hard at times. You’ll have to put some effort into it. It isn’t mathematically challenging. There are, as I noticed them anyway, only two mathematical formulas in the book — Schrodinger’s wave function formula and Einstein’s for the curvature of spacetime. But these are offered really only as illustrations, not as formulas the reader needs to understand in any detail.I’m not a specialist, so I won’t try to say much about the interest that physicists themselves may take. I think, for many, it may be a broadening experience to reflect on the “meaning” of quantum theory.I enjoyed the book. There are a lot of books on quantum theory that rely heavily on metaphor and attempts to reduce the unintuitive to the intuitive. Carroll doesn’t do that, so I believe I’m actually experiencing how he, as a quantum theorist, thinks about what he is working on. The cost may be that, although my understanding of quantum theory and its “meaning” are much greater for having read the book, the holes in my understanding (and in the account I’ve given here) are more glaring to me."
268,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29467608-serro,2,"This might have been too technical for me, or otherwise for really advanced science readers which I might not be.Quantum mechanics and quantum field theory is central to the book and the author expands a lot on the many worlds theory. I was lost on the concept of branching and how it could progressively produce multiple copies of ourselves on different branches. Still, this lead me to the idea of a multiverse and that is mind-blowing whichever way you look at it.Style-wise the author has tried indeed to the extent that he decided to integrate a dialogue on quantum mechanics between a father and his daughter, simply to make it more literary elegant with mixed effect."
269,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57803005-tomas-sedovic,5,"I wish my first introduction to Quantum Mechanics was with this book.Most approaches focus on the utter weirdness, elevating our misled intuitions and ignorance to a mysticism. What is the nature of the observer? Why is everything a both a wave and a particle? How is the can both alive and dead at the same time? Why the divide between the quantum realm and our everyday reality? And where does human consciousness come into all this?You hear people talk about QM with such an air of mystery, there's no wonder charlatans like Deepak Chopra take hold in the confusion.This book cuts right through the bullshit, focusing on what we know, why we know it, what we don't know and what are we doing about it.Things aren't a particle and a wave at the same time. Everything's waves. There's nothing special about an observer and absolutely nothing special about consciousness (from the QM point of view). QM has almost certainly nothing to do with your thought processes (other than the driving all the underlying chemistry that is). The act of ""observing"" is simply an entanglement of (what we perceive as) a particle with the measuring equipment and its environment. What you decide for lunch has no fundamental effect on the shape of the universe.It is a breath of fresh air to hear some definite answers in the field that's commonly so muddled. And seeing how we got there. You don't need to be versed in QM, physics or even maths to be able to follow it. It does call for an attentive reader, however. One who is willing to pause and think, maybe re-read a paragraph or two.Moreover, Something Deeply Hidden tries to impart as much genuine understanding as is possible without dealing with complex numbers and matrix calculations. It goes right up to the maths wall, but it doesn't cross it.Popular explanations of scientific topics often resort to similes that seem to provide an understanding, but leave the audience confused on the underlying issues, building wrong intuitions instead of a coherent picture.Not this book. If you get it, you're genuinely close to *really* getting it and if you don't get it, you at least know.Quantum mechanics is a very young science, developed extremely quickly (most of the fundamentals having been laid down in the span of two decades) with twisted, colourful history full of fascinating characters. The book mostly ignores this.As such, Adam Becker's What Is Real? which came out earlier in the same year is a perfect companion to Sean Carroll's Something Deeply Hidden. The former paints the historical context while the latter dives into the science.The book begins with the outline for why we needed QM in the first place, followed by describing the wavefunction and its evolution governed by the Schrödinger equation and describing the various experiments and what they mean.It highlights that the deepest underpinnings of the theory are not understood at all (hence the proliferation of ""interpretations"" of QM), outlines why that might be the case and then selects a particular approach through which to make sense of all the observations.That explanation framework is the Hugh Everett's or Many-Worlds theory. It highlights its stark simplicity: ""The entire universe is a wave function evolving according to the Schrödinger equation. Period."" It is a deterministic theory as well, nothing random or unpredictable about it.It makes a good case that even if it doesn't turn out to be the ultimate answer, it is the purest thing we've got and it serves as a very nice lens to look at the quantum behaviour through. All the other theories need to postulate more stuff: elements other than the wave function, deviations from the Schrödinger equation, etc.It goes through ways which we might one day be able to experimentally determine one from the other (showing that these really aren't interpretations as much as genuinely different theories with different predictions).The common criticisms and misunderstandings are addressed in a really good chapter that's basically a Socratic dialogue between a many-worlds sceptic and a scientist studying it.It does highlight the other popular theories and tries to compare them with many-worlds, but it's explicitly clear what the main focus is. That said, even if you find many worlds unpalatable, problematic or plain weird, the will leave you with a much better understanding of quantum physics.The final section of the book focuses on the big unanswered question: what is the quantum theory of gravity? We've successfully quantised all the other fundamental forces. And we've got a really good picture of gravity in realms where it is fairly weak (i.e. the vast majority of the universe). But what's really going on in strong gravitational fields (black holes, the big bang) is still a huge unknown.The author goes over some interesting directions (some of which he was an active participant in) suggesting that since the traditional approach to quantising gravity has not worked out that well yet, maybe we should start looking at QM at its purest form and trying to derive spacetime and gravity that way. A bottom-up approach instead of the top-down one we've been doing so far.I really liked how this seems to be the culmination of the author's writing career to date. It tackles spacetime, geometry, entropy as well as morality in the face of our laws of physics -- all topics he'd written excellent books about before.There have been multiple cases where I was following the argument being laid out in front of me and a nagging question has arisen. Most books, these are left unanswered. Here? It was directly addressed a couple paragraphs later.I've read it as an audiobook (always a risky endeavour in a scientific topic) and it was excellent. Narrated by the author himself (to whom I could listen to constantly) and really well put together. The printed book had diagrams and equations, but these were described so well that it took me a while to realise they must have been there.Most similar audiobooks provide you with a PDF of all the pictures (if you're lucky) and you're supposed to have them handy while you listen. There was no need for any of that here. It stands perfectly on its own.PS: Just like the What Is Real? it paints Albert Einstein as fiercely smart person who understand QM as well as anyone and who's questions and criticisms cut right to the meat of the matter. He's been instrumental in building the theory and indeed it is his work in QM (quantisation of light) that resulted in his Nobel price (not relativity as people think). Instead of losing touch (as is the popular depiction) what he lost instead was the PR battle with Niels Bohr.I like this picture better than the popular one. Einstein was one sharp fucking cookie and this just makes so much more sense."

271,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2167338-david-agranoff,4,"This book is not for everyone. Sean Carroll is an author I reviewed before with his epic book about the universe the Big Picture. I feel more deeply connected to this author because I know his voice well. I listen every week to his podcast mindscape that I often describe as Sean Carrol talks to other geniuses. I was familiar with these ideas and the many-worlds theories before not just as a Carroll podcast listener but as a huge Sci-fi nerd and Philip K Dick Podcaster. We have talked about Many-worlds in a pseudo-science 60's way a lot.I am not going to pretend for one minute that I am able to process more than the basic ideas here. I read this book quickly because whenever math or the Nitty-Gritty of how particles spin. I really enjoyed the history of discovery and how Carroll weaves the methods that the greats in science came to the various theories that make Quantum science. I know this will sound corny but my love for this topic has roots in my favorite childhood horror movie John Carpenter's Prince of Darkness that was the first place that a young me heard of Quantum psychics. This is primarily an introduction to one of the most debated issues in the study of spacetime, as such I think it is a good introduction but the big bottom line in this review do you enjoy this stuff? I do and still felt the need to skip a few parts. I enjoy Sean Carroll's books because he helps takes universe-spanning Ideas and boils them down. Separated into three sections, part one is where we get the majority of the history. This part is called Spooky based on the idea that even Einstein in the early days found these issues to be hard to deal with. In this section, Carroll sets up the questions that we are going to ponder. The second part is called Splitting and gets into what it all means. Part three Spacetime is where most of the interesting theories happen. The most interesting concepts for me were near the end. ""It is plausible that the symmetry between space and time that we are familiar with from relativity isn't built into Quantum Gravity."" Oh no he didn't? Was there more to the universe than Einstein could see? sure and towards the end Carroll questions if Space is even part of the equation and this tiny level. Another part I enjoyed was one of the last chapters that explained more of the science behind Black holes, as Hawking was quoted in the book Black holes ain't so black. I enjoyed Carroll's last book more than this one but that could have as much to do with the epic themes of that one. This one was designed to be a purely academic exercise, while the Big Picture dealt with the point where the rubber meets the road between cosmology and philosophy. "
272,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6953429-elazar,2,"I had high hopes for this book especially because I am a long-time listener and admirer of Sean‘s podcasts. Unfortunately, I felt like I was reading a preacher’s sermon on why the Many Worlds theory is the “truth” and why every other theory is wrong. I wasn’t convinced. "
273,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85852005-sato,5,"I personally find Everettian quantum mechanics, and all the many worlds that it implies, to be by far the most plausible version of quantum theory that I know of. And this book mainly tries to present an understandable version of quantum mechanics and to show that everything is basically quantum and drawing a line between the classical world and quantomic world is not quiet sensible. But the other notion that Sean Carroll tries to show us is this Feynman’s famous quote: “ No one truly understands Quantum mechanics”, and we already have a lot to know about it specially when we try to describe spacetime and the notions in the quantum field theory and the quantum theory of gravity. For many years now, the search for a complete and compelling quantum theory of gravity has been recognized as an important scientific goal.Here is a general idea of Quantum mechanics 1.Set up the system by fixing a specific wave function Ψ.2. Evolve the system using Schrödinger’s equation.3. There are certain observable quantities we can choose to measure, such as position, and when we do measure them, we obtain definite results.4. The probability of getting any one particular result can be calculated from the wave function. The wave function associates an amplitude with every possible measurement outcome; the probability for any outcome is the square of that amplitude.5. Upon measurement, the wave function collapses. However spread out it may have been pre-measurement, afterward it is concentrated on the result we obtained(Measurement Problem). To get a general idea of Everett’s Many-Worlds interpretation as an alternative to the measurement problem and equally as the gist of Sean’s efforts all along the book, I tried to bring the general approach of Everettian quantum mechanics in Sean Carol’s words(slightly changed). Many-Worlds Before the measurement happens, there is one electron and one observer. After they interact, however, rather than thinking of that one observer having evolved into a superposition of possible states, we could think of them as having evolved into multiple possible observers. The right way to describe things after the measurement, in this view, is not as one person with multiple ideas about where the electron was seen, but as multiple worlds, each of which contains a single person with a very definite idea about where the electron was seen.Here’s the big reveal: what we’ve described as austere quantum mechanics is more commonly known as the Everett, or Many-Worlds, formulation of quantum mechanics, first put forward by Hugh Everett in 1957. The Everett view arises from a fundamental annoyance with all of the special rules about measurements that are presented as part of the standard textbook quantum recipe, and suggests instead that there is just a single kind of quantum evolution. The price we pay for this vastly increased elegance of theoretical formalism is that the theory describes many copies of what we think of as “the universe,” each slightly different, but each truly real in some sense. Whether the benefit is worth the cost is an issue about which people disagree. (It is.)"
274,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47544933-jose-rodriguez,5,"I think that Sean Carroll is one of the best “popularizers” of physics I have ever encountered. One could argue that such popularizations are like cartoon versions of literature classics, and in some ways they are. But if done well, they can bring an understanding of the “forest” that could be lost when engaged in the particularities of the mathematical “trees.” On this book, Carroll tackles the foundations of quantum mechanics, a problem from the very beginning of the field and which many physicists feel is not relevant to the calculations and experiments they carry out. Who cares if we can’t figure out what is the wave function collapse that happens after a measurement, as proposed by the so-called “Copenhagen interpretation”, if we have done extremely well without worrying about it?But some people would find this attitude deeply unsatisfactory, since it results in no understanding of the nature of reality, and the judgement by Richard Feynman that nobody really understands quantum mechanics.One of the most popular solutions has been the Many Worlds interpretation that Hugh Everett III proposed in the 1950’s, which was ignored or ridiculed by many physicists, resulting in Everett working in the defense industry after his PhD, and maybe contributing to his early death due to alcohol and other unhealthy habits, But recently there has been a resurgence of interest in these ideas, partly due to their relevance to a formulation of quantum gravity. And Sean Johnson comes out in this book as a major proponent of the Everett interpretation. It is a very difficult endeavor, and I’m not sure that he was completely successful in achieving the goal. And because he only uses words, I found that some of the concepts remained unclear, which made me wish for a lot of equations on the pages. Things get worse when the discussion turns into philosophical issues of ontology and epistemology, in which I found it very difficult to “disentangle” my thinking. The rock bottom is the chapter that tackles whether this view impacts our thinking about morality (it doesn’t). I wish that he would have stayed the course along the lines of his statement at different points that we are not really required to think about many worlds in the Everett picture. The main point is that we accept a universal wave function which evolves in accordance with Schroedinger’s equation, and from which descriptions of measurements, particles, and even space emerge (emergence is discussed in detail in his previous book “The Big Picture”). What convinced me to give this book five stars is its provocative discussion about new ways of thinking about reality. The last chapters discussing space, time, black holes, holographic picture, etc. of course do not present new solutions (they do not exist at this point), but are very successful in raising questions and introducing concepts that continue to make physics such an exciting field, at least for me.Now I should look for the equations, except that I don’t think I have the time nor the energy to do so."
275,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1680974-alex-zakharov,4,"A good non-technical introduction to quantum mechanics with heavy emphasis on Everettian interpretation. Carroll gives a brief history of the field including the 1927 Solvay conference, Einstein-Bohr debates, and personalities of the key players (Pauli, Schrodinger, Heisenberg, de Broglie). He then quickly goes over the basics that you need to follow the rest of the book – superposition, entanglement, Born rule, Wave Function, Hamiltonian, decoherence.Carroll quickly moves on to the measurement problem and describes both its well-known interpretations (“Copenhagen”, “Pilot Wave/Hidden Variables”, “Many Worlds”) and the relatively more recent Dynamical collapse and QBism theories. You get a good intuition for the theories themselves and pros/cons of each.As expected, he spends a fair amount of time on Everettian interpretation, of which he is a well-known proponent. Here we get a healthy dose of branching, decoherence, and wave function evolution. Carroll makes a case that technically the approach is pure (“austere” is his go-to word), and acknowledges that the amount of cognitive dissonance from reconciling this purity with observable reality is uncanny. He suggests a few cognitive tricks to reduce that dissonance, and some of them almost help. In the last part of the book we revisit quantum field theory (which is very nicely covered in his previous books btw), and start talking about theoretical physicists’ holy grail - quantum gravity. Carroll briefly explains how other fundamental forces were quantized, and why quantizing gravity is damn hard. We get a mention of String theory and a classy dis of AdS/CFT correspondence (field’s only lamp post in a drunken man’s parking garage). But there is hope still. Carroll is part of the wave of physicists who are becoming increasingly convinced that quantizing gravity will not happen. Instead we should derive spacetime itself from quantum mechanics, which would give us gravity on a quantum mechanical platter. Susskind & Maldacena’s 2013 “ER=EPR” paper is an obvious step in that direction, and Carroll’s thinking runs along similar lines. Space and locality is sorta-kinda like entanglement, and time is sorta-kinda like growth of the entanglement. (In Susskind’s case time is sorta-kinda like growth of quantum complexity). The first half of the book gets 5 stars – informative, mostly clear, fun to read. But, as we get into the second half, explanations start running away a bit. Carroll brings some back, but many escape. The fix is obvious - include equations in the text. Fine, if you don’t include equations in a popular science book so be it, but then providing more pictorial illustrations is a must."
276,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41901229-gary-moreau,4,"Given all the hoopla about science and technology of late, I set off about a year ago to find books that might help me to understand just exactly how far along scientists are in truly understanding our universe and thus being able to manipulate its course. And what could be more cutting edge than quantum physics, although the basics have been around for a century or more.Carroll is an accomplished theoretical physicist at the California Institute of Technology and a well-established author. He is also a proponent of the Many-Worlds school of the quantum world. (Yes, you exist in many worlds but you will never meet yourself.) The book is well written and intended for an audience broader than the professional physicist. And bravo for that. Alas, however, try as he might, this book will be a slog for the average lay reader. The physics that most of us learned in school is all about particles. Quantum physics, on the other hand, is all about waves and fields. In such a fluid world, the sheer act of measuring something, changes whatever it is we’re measuring. (Akin to trying to catch the proverbial greased pig.)Part of the problem that scientists, particularly physicists, face is that their only vehicle for communicating what they learn is language. But language is a human convention. It is not of nature like oxygen and rain. And it is, by definition, symbolic. That’s why we invented it, to facilitate communication.The universe, however, is not a human convention. It is nature itself. Nor is it symbolic. It is the universe. That’s about as real as it gets.Scientists attempt to get around this by creating their own language and system of notation. It sounds impressive, but it doesn’t quite bridge the gap. “Is the picture we’ve sketched, where the entanglement between degrees of freedom somehow comes together to define the geometry of our approximately classical spacetime, actually on the right track?” He ultimately answers that complex question with the simplest of answer. “Nobody knows for sure.”In the end, my conclusion is that scientists are not as far along as many would have us believe. They know a lot, and there are many brilliant minds working through the issues, but “a lot” is a relative calibration. There is much they don’t know. In a way, I admit, that is reassuring to me. I am not a religious man. I am, however, a philosopher. I am comfortable with the unknown. The great unknown gives us something to think about. And it’s the thinking, rather than the ultimate conclusion, which I have come to believe is the true essence of knowledge.A very worthwhile book but you have to be willing to put in the effort."
277,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5469227-d-l-morrese,4,"Sean Carroll is a well-known and respected theoretical physicist, and I am in no way qualified to review his book. I did read it, however, and I did enjoy it, in a way. What I enjoyed mostly, I think, was the thought that some very clever people probably understand it. Sadly, I can't say I'm one of them. There are three reasons for this: I don't have a background in quantum mechanics, I'm not especially brilliant, and I don't think my mind is flexible enough to wrap around most of the ideas presented. None of these are the fault of the book, hence my 4-star rating. The point Dr. Carroll is making, as best I can tell, is that reality, in all its apparent wild complexity and diversity is, in fact, simply the wave function of the universe evolving in accordance with Schrödinger's equation. Like, duh! Why didn't I think of that?Just kidding. I have only a vague idea what that even means. What Dr. Carrol thinks it means (or at least what I think he thinks it means) is that truly quantum phenomena cause the universal wave function to split or branch, which results in two equally real universes where before there was only one...not that anyone notices, or can notice, or even know which one they are in.... I can understand the idea of branching. Actually, it's what the late, great Terry Pratchett used as a premise in his books Jingo and Night Watch. (Excellent stories with cops, robbers, revolution, and a special, magical kind of physics set in a wonderfully imaginative fantasy world. I highly recommend them. But, I digress. Back to the subject at hand...) The creation of multiple worlds every time an entangled particle is seen to spin one way when it could equally have been observed to spin another seems to be a rather inefficient way of constructing a universe, but I'm willing to go along with it if it's all backed up with a sound theory and some supporting observations. After reading this book, I'm still not sure it is. Again, probably not the fault of the book, and it makes a great premise for a good story."
278,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/106439976-axel-brambila,4,"Since the dawn of time, humans have tried to figure out how the world works. Countless theories have been created to simplify the world for us. This book talks about how the world looks quantumly, or to the smallest spectrum. For instance, we know that Earth turns counter-clockwise to the sun but what are the atoms doing when this happens. Quantum physics in this book is explained well enough for anyone to understand what we've learned. However, it is a matter of how motivated you are to learn about the subject, because you will oftentimes find yourself rereading paragraphs in order to fully understand. The book sometimes even surfaces starter physics topics, which might affect the reading of an experienced physics student. The contents of the book range from how much we don't know, different theorys, and space-time. I enjoyed the book as it was a great learning experience. The many different theories were enjoyable to learn about; with the many-worlds theory being my favorite because of its craziness. The world splitting into different realities like a cell dividing is a real possibility, and it is scary finding out how little we know about the world. The state of quantum physics now is like the average person using a phone. We know how to use it, but we don't know what is actually going on in the inside. Overall, I gave this book a 4/5 because it made learning quantum physics enjoyable."
279,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98493136-martin-reader,4,"This is a good book. It covers not only the subject of quantum mechanics, but the history as well. He provides a reach history of the discussions between Neils Bohr and Albert Einstein. Bohr favored using quantum mechanics to drive innovation. And it certainly did – from nuclear weapons, to computes to electronics advancements, quantum mechanics has delivered much. But Einstein’s issue was not with what quantum mechanics could explain, he wanted to know why quantum mechanics worked. The field of quantum foundations – why the world behaves in a quantum fashion – was largely ignored for decades. It was not until 1957 when Hugh Everett developed the many worlds approach, that the topic began to be discussed again. Carroll explains how observations and experiments continue to support the Everett model of many worlds. The arguments are sometimes difficult to follow, but as he points out, Richard Feynman once said “I think I can safely say that no one understands quantum mechanics.” "
280,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15709090-cole,3,"As some other reviewers have remarked, I found the first third (maybe even half?) of Carroll’s latest book to be an enthralling ride, but it quickly took off without me thereafter. Things become pretty impenetrable for a book marketed as a popular science read, even taking into consideration the unintuitive nature of any discussion of quantum mechanics.It’s a shame, as Carroll has proven himself capable at explaining complex topics with ease and charm, and the concept of Many Worlds is fascinating to say the least. What I’m missing here is that quality being consistent across the book. (To be clear, I can’t imagine what an incredible challenge this would be.)For readers with more than an armchair physics nerd’s knowledge, I’m sure this could easily be a 4 or 5 star read."

I'm not sure why. The content was somewhat interesting, but ""Many Worlds"" reminds me a bit of String Theory in that they are both a bit far-fetched. I'm not saying that they can't be. I'm just saying that it's a bit much to swallow. Maybe classic Physics and a slight lean toward empiricism is holding me back a bit. I believe Carroll knew when he wrote this book that many would suffer from my affliction.But hey... there are stranger things and all that, Horatio. ;)"

It is not that kind of book you should take to the beach or read it on subway. Disclaimer: I had not been familiar with anything concerning quantum physics before reading this.This book introduces to you a theory of many worlds, which is on its own really amazing. The problem is in our human brains - it is not that easy for us to grasp the concept of spatial infinity. Even harder problem is accepting the concept of branching. But when you admit it could be true (I still have no idea if everything is as described or everything works completely differently), a world... Wait, many worlds of amazing possibilities opened up.

This is not a criticism: I actually think Carroll did a very good job of dressing modern physics up in a way that is accessible for non-physicists, but you have to work for it (I didn't consistently do, so the rating can be understood as one of my job as a reader too).

I still don't fully understand this stuff, but reading more about it is exciting and makes the world (universe, really) a really fascinating place to live.The moral of this story is most of the shit you worry about is not a big deal.

But I think it is still ok to read: ""I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics."" - Richard FeynmanIt is a bit hard to accept Many-Worlds interpretation with our (at least my) current understandings of our mind, our life and our world.

297,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73419547-doctor-moss,5,"Quantum theory is frustrating. That’s probably a laughable understatement, especially for a non-physicist like me. After all, Richard Feynman famously said, “I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics.”As Sean Carroll points out, physicists are themselves encouraged to treat quantum mechanics as a basis for calculations more than as a description of reality. Those who venture into questions about the reality that quantum theory describes or the “meaning” of quantum mechanics are venturing into “quantum foundations,” a potentially disreputable and risky neighborhood.That’s what Carroll does here, presenting and arguing for the Everett or “Many Worlds” interpretation of quantum theory. We owe Hugh Everett credit for originating that interpretation in 1957, by contrast with the traditionally dominant Copenhagen interpretation, championed by Werner Heisenberg in collaboration if not always agreement with Niels Bohr. According to the Copenhagen interpretation and the Everett interpretation as well, quantum phenomena, e.g., the position, momentum, or spin of a particle such as an electron, are described by a wave function rather than, classically, by determinate, discrete values. I won’t try to explain why this is so — that would strain both the limits of a review and my understanding. For that, Carroll’s book does a good job. The wave function spreads such values as position, momentum, and spin across possible values, and it is not until a property such as those is “measured” that the value becomes determinate and distinct. It is not just that we don’t know the value until it is measured — it doesn’t exist until it is measured.Part of the difficulty in understanding this aspect of quantum theory, as Carroll explains, is that we tend to cling to a classical description of reality as made up of tiny bits of matter — “particles” in that classical sense. But particles, at least on some readings of quantum theory, really are wave functions. Their behavior isn’t just described by a wave function — they ARE wave functions. That’s where, I think, the difficulty in understanding quantum mechanics as a true description of reality begins. A wave function, after all, is a mathematical entity.But that’s just the beginning. Next comes “entanglement.” Again, please excuse the compressed explanation — Carroll does a much better job. Two particles, e.g., photons or electrons, can become “entangled” via various naturally occurring methods. Photons for example can create “entangled” pairs of electrons and positrons when passing through the nucleus of an atom. The two particles comprise a system with a net neutral charge and zero spin. If we then measure the spin of the electron and find it clockwise, we know that if we measure the spin of the positron, it will be counterclockwise. The tricky part is, of course, that the spin of the electron, before it is measured is neither clockwise nor counterclockwise. It becomes one or the other only upon measurement. Now, suppose that the electron and positron pair, since their generation, have grown far apart in distance from one another. The measurement of one of the pair, given their entangled state, will not only determine the spin of that one particle, but also, apparently instantaneously, the spin of the other. This is what upset Einstein as “spooky action at a distance.” It seems to defy both common sense and the constraint set by the speed of light as the maximum speed at which a causal influence can be transmitted — in this case, the effect (the direction of spin of the second particle) seems to be generated instantaneously by the cause (the direction of spin of the first particle).It is at this point that the Copenhagen and Everett interpretations diverge. On the Copenhagen interpretation, when the measurement occurs (which could be performed by a human observer or by an instrument of one sort or another), the wave function of the particle is said to “collapse.” It resolves uniquely to the value obtained by the measurement. End of story (except for entanglement and other difficult to swallow aspects of the theory as a whole).According to the Everett interpretation, the wave function does not collapse to a unique, single value — rather it “branches” into multiple worlds in which different possible values hold. In one world, the one we continue in, the electron has a clockwise spin, but in another that branches away from ours, it has a counterclockwise spin.That may sound outrageous and “metaphysical,” but there is, Carroll maintains, a solid rationale behind it. The Copenhagen interpretation treats the measurement, and the entanglement as a separate system from the observer or measuring device. In fact, the measuring device or observer is treated as part of a classically defined physical space, without entanglement with the quantum phenomenon being measured. By contrast, the Everett interpretation imposes no such seemingly ad hoc boundary between the measuring and the phenomenon measured. Rather than a wave function confined to the measured system, Everett’s wave function is “universal” — all phenomena in the universe are treated as at least potentially in entangled relationships comprising a single system. When a measurement is made, that universe is branched, and values not obtained in this universe are realized in other worlds. Since measurement itself — the fixing of a value on a quantum phenomenon — happens naturally and frequently (many, many, many times per second), the number of worlds, or branchings, that have taken place since the time of the Big Bang, is very, very, very large — Carroll gives a quick approximate calculation of two to the tenth to the 112 worlds. Hence the name “Many Worlds.”In fact, as Carroll explains, entanglement is a pervasive property, at the submicroscopic quantum level. The natural processes that produce it are part of the equally pervasive interactions among the quantum particles that underlie the experienced universe.His arguments in favor of the Everett interpretation, you may begin to realize, are methodological, even philosophical. Carroll is well-versed in some of the relevant works in philosophy of science and logic, giving him the background support he needs in order to make an Occam’s Razor inspired defense of the Everett interpretation as one that hews most closely to the well-ordered and empirically validated core of quantum theory — the wave function and entanglement. Other interpretations, including not only the Copenhagen interpretation but others briefly discussed in a chapter on alternatives, tend to introduce ad hoc entities, values, or assumptions in order to make the theory more containable within expectations and mathematical standards. I should mention in passing that one of these alternative interpretations that Carroll discusses is an “epistemic” interpretation. An “epistemic” interpretation is one in which the theory is viewed not so much as describing reality as describing our knowledge of reality. Interpretations that claim that quantum theory describes reality per se are called “ontic” by contrast. Epistemic interpretations, including the Copenhagen interpretation as read by many, draws back from what you might call a realist or even metaphysical claim (using “metaphysical” in the philosophical sense of pertaining to a reality independent of our ideas, thoughts, or knowledge of it). But Carroll is answering, in part, a challenge posed by Einstein in his objections to the Copenhagen interpretation. Einstein had objected both to its violation of “locality” (i.e., instantaneous action over distances) and to its failure to provide a comprehensible description of reality. The Everett interpretation does accept the violation of locality, so Einstein would not be pleased.Does it provide a comprehensible description of reality? It’s hard to say so, until we understand what “many worlds” really means. How do we give that concept itself an “ontic” interpretation? I don’t know, and that’s something that Carroll doesn’t venture far into. He does, in a footnote, distinguish “Many Worlds” from “Multiverse” where the latter has a quasi-spatial understanding, as separate regions of or domains of a kind of meta-space (or spacetime). He means something else. And he includes a chapter that attempts to resolve some of the vertigo we get when we imagine ourselves as part of this universe that is constantly branching into more and more worlds. What becomes of me? Well, there’s another me, but a different me, experiencing some other world. There are certainly uses of “world” that would seem to resonate with this idea of “many worlds” — the “possible worlds” discussed in philosophical logic and the mathematical spaces discussed in theoretical math. But none of those are going to meet a middling standard of intuitiveness or provide a kind of realist “ontic” feel. And I don’t think Carroll really helps us with that problem.The final third or so of the book carries on from the Everett interpretation to an even more speculative discussion of how spacetime itself might be generated from quantum theory. The discussion brings back the Einsteinian concept of locality to generate an idea of spatial separation as a matter of decreasing entanglement — in simplistic terms, spatial distance is generated as a decrease in the degree of entanglement of the particles making up the universe. As with much of quantum theory, in this speculative story about the origin of spacetime, it’s difficult to tell where we are telling a story of how the math that describes reality is generated and where we are telling a story that describes how the reality itself is generated. In any case, maybe despite the book’s subtitle, the heart of the book is Carroll’s presentation and argument for the Everett interpretation.Who is this book for? It’s going to be taxing for anyone who wants to read casually. As with any book on quantum theory, it is conceptually demanding. This stuff is hard to think about. And the concepts come fast and hard at times. You’ll have to put some effort into it. It isn’t mathematically challenging. There are, as I noticed them anyway, only two mathematical formulas in the book — Schrodinger’s wave function formula and Einstein’s for the curvature of spacetime. But these are offered really only as illustrations, not as formulas the reader needs to understand in any detail.I’m not a specialist, so I won’t try to say much about the interest that physicists themselves may take. I think, for many, it may be a broadening experience to reflect on the “meaning” of quantum theory.I enjoyed the book. There are a lot of books on quantum theory that rely heavily on metaphor and attempts to reduce the unintuitive to the intuitive. Carroll doesn’t do that, so I believe I’m actually experiencing how he, as a quantum theorist, thinks about what he is working on. The cost may be that, although my understanding of quantum theory and its “meaning” are much greater for having read the book, the holes in my understanding (and in the account I’ve given here) are more glaring to me."

I was lost on the concept of branching and how it could progressively produce multiple copies of ourselves on different branches. Still, this lead me to the idea of a multiverse and that is mind-blowing whichever way you look at it.Style-wise the author has tried indeed to the extent that he decided to integrate a dialogue on quantum mechanics between a father and his daughter, simply to make it more literary elegant with mixed effect."
299,1524743011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57803005-tomas-sedovic,5,"I wish my first introduction to Quantum Mechanics was with this book.Most approaches focus on the utter weirdness, elevating our misled intuitions and ignorance to a mysticism. What is the nature of the observer? Why is everything a both a wave and a particle? How is the can both alive and dead at the same time? Why the divide between the quantum realm and our everyday reality? And where does human consciousness come into all this?You hear people talk about QM with such an air of mystery, there's no wonder charlatans like Deepak Chopra take hold in the confusion.This book cuts right through the bullshit, focusing on what we know, why we know it, what we don't know and what are we doing about it.Things aren't a particle and a wave at the same time. Everything's waves. There's nothing special about an observer and absolutely nothing special about consciousness (from the QM point of view). QM has almost certainly nothing to do with your thought processes (other than the driving all the underlying chemistry that is). The act of ""observing"" is simply an entanglement of (what we perceive as) a particle with the measuring equipment and its environment. What you decide for lunch has no fundamental effect on the shape of the universe.It is a breath of fresh air to hear some definite answers in the field that's commonly so muddled. And seeing how we got there. You don't need to be versed in QM, physics or even maths to be able to follow it. It does call for an attentive reader, however. One who is willing to pause and think, maybe re-read a paragraph or two.Moreover, Something Deeply Hidden tries to impart as much genuine understanding as is possible without dealing with complex numbers and matrix calculations. It goes right up to the maths wall, but it doesn't cross it.Popular explanations of scientific topics often resort to similes that seem to provide an understanding, but leave the audience confused on the underlying issues, building wrong intuitions instead of a coherent picture.Not this book. If you get it, you're genuinely close to *really* getting it and if you don't get it, you at least know.Quantum mechanics is a very young science, developed extremely quickly (most of the fundamentals having been laid down in the span of two decades) with twisted, colourful history full of fascinating characters. The book mostly ignores this.As such, Adam Becker's What Is Real? which came out earlier in the same year is a perfect companion to Sean Carroll's Something Deeply Hidden. The former paints the historical context while the latter dives into the science.The book begins with the outline for why we needed QM in the first place, followed by describing the wavefunction and its evolution governed by the Schrödinger equation and describing the various experiments and what they mean.It highlights that the deepest underpinnings of the theory are not understood at all (hence the proliferation of ""interpretations"" of QM), outlines why that might be the case and then selects a particular approach through which to make sense of all the observations.That explanation framework is the Hugh Everett's or Many-Worlds theory. It highlights its stark simplicity: ""The entire universe is a wave function evolving according to the Schrödinger equation. Period."" It is a deterministic theory as well, nothing random or unpredictable about it.It makes a good case that even if it doesn't turn out to be the ultimate answer, it is the purest thing we've got and it serves as a very nice lens to look at the quantum behaviour through. All the other theories need to postulate more stuff: elements other than the wave function, deviations from the Schrödinger equation, etc.It goes through ways which we might one day be able to experimentally determine one from the other (showing that these really aren't interpretations as much as genuinely different theories with different predictions).The common criticisms and misunderstandings are addressed in a really good chapter that's basically a Socratic dialogue between a many-worlds sceptic and a scientist studying it.It does highlight the other popular theories and tries to compare them with many-worlds, but it's explicitly clear what the main focus is. That said, even if you find many worlds unpalatable, problematic or plain weird, the will leave you with a much better understanding of quantum physics.The final section of the book focuses on the big unanswered question: what is the quantum theory of gravity? We've successfully quantised all the other fundamental forces. And we've got a really good picture of gravity in realms where it is fairly weak (i.e. the vast majority of the universe). But what's really going on in strong gravitational fields (black holes, the big bang) is still a huge unknown.The author goes over some interesting directions (some of which he was an active participant in) suggesting that since the traditional approach to quantising gravity has not worked out that well yet, maybe we should start looking at QM at its purest form and trying to derive spacetime and gravity that way. A bottom-up approach instead of the top-down one we've been doing so far.I really liked how this seems to be the culmination of the author's writing career to date. It tackles spacetime, geometry, entropy as well as morality in the face of our laws of physics -- all topics he'd written excellent books about before.There have been multiple cases where I was following the argument being laid out in front of me and a nagging question has arisen. Most books, these are left unanswered. Here? It was directly addressed a couple paragraphs later.I've read it as an audiobook (always a risky endeavour in a scientific topic) and it was excellent. Narrated by the author himself (to whom I could listen to constantly) and really well put together. The printed book had diagrams and equations, but these were described so well that it took me a while to realise they must have been there.Most similar audiobooks provide you with a PDF of all the pictures (if you're lucky) and you're supposed to have them handy while you listen. There was no need for any of that here. It stands perfectly on its own.PS: Just like the What Is Real? it paints Albert Einstein as fiercely smart person who understand QM as well as anyone and who's questions and criticisms cut right to the meat of the matter. He's been instrumental in building the theory and indeed it is his work in QM (quantisation of light) that resulted in his Nobel price (not relativity as people think). Instead of losing touch (as is the popular depiction) what he lost instead was the PR battle with Niels Bohr.I like this picture better than the popular one. Einstein was one sharp fucking cookie and this just makes so much more sense."
