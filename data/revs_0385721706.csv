0,0385721706,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1415047-whitaker,1,"I’ve read James Surowiecki in the New Yorker. I’ve generally enjoyed his articles and found them fairly informative and engaging. I think that perhaps he should stick to that: writing articles. This book was, well, disappointing. And I suspect that it’s because I expect more from a book. I expect an analysis that is more balanced and rigorous. While I am willing to accept a little grandstanding in an article, I find it intolerable in a book. What’s ironic about all of this is that he’s written a book celebrating diversity of thought, but there’s absolutely none of that in this book. I thought that there were some interesting anecdotes, ideas and bits of information here, but that ultimately all the pieces did not gel into a whole. Not only was the sum of the information not more than its parts, I actually thought it was less. The book also had problems for me in a number of key areas that totally detracted from any regard I might have had for it. Pet Peeve #1 It’s damned annoying when something is misrepresented. It makes me wonder what else is being misrepresented that I can’t pick up because I don’t know what I don’t know. He totally misrepresented Keynes in a number of ways, quoting him out of context. He quotes Keynes’s statement, “Worldly wisdom teaches that it is better for reputation to fail conventionally than to succeed unconventionally,” as if Keynes supported that statement. The full quote by Keynes is this:“...an investor who proposes to ignore near-term market fluctuations ... will in practice come in for most criticism, wherever investment funds are managed by committees or boards or banks. For it is in the essence of his behaviour that he should be eccentric, unconventional and rash in the eyes of average opinion. If he is successful, that will only confirm the general belief in his rashness; and if in the short run he is unsuccessful, which is very likely, he will not receive much mercy. Worldly wisdom teaches that it is better for reputation to fail conventionally than to succeed unconventionally.”Keynes is actually praising the long-term investor but stating how hard it is to not simply follow the crowd. This is the opposite of what Surowiecki uses him for. He later quotes Keynes’s statement about the stock market:“Professional investment may be likened to those for newspaper competitions in which competitors have to pick out the six prettiest faces from a hundred photographs, the prize being awarded to the competitor whose choice most nearly corresponds to the average preferences of the competitors as a whole; so each competitor has to pick, not those faces which he himself finds prettiest, but those which he thinks likeliest to catch the fancy of other competitors, all of whom are looking at the problem from the same point of view.”He then goes on to state that that behaviour is what Keynes “recommends”. This is not only not what Keynes recommends, but what he is against. The statement quoted is Keynes’ description of how the stock market works: people speculating rather than making up their own mind based on fundamentals. He then explains that this is why there are bubbles and crashes: because people are simply following the herd. Again, the total opposite of what Surowiecki uses him for.This is pretty egregious as far as I’m concerned. Pet Peeve #2He misrepresents facts. He describes an experiment conducted in the late 1980s by Paul Andreassen:Andreassen divided students into two groups. Each group selected a portfolio of stocks, and knew enough about each stock to come up with what seemed like a fair price for it. Then Andreassen one group to see only the changes in the prices of their stocks. They could buy and sell if they wanted, but all they knew was whether the price of a stock had gone up or down. The second group was allowed to see the changes in price, but was also given a constant stream of financial news that supposedly explained what was happening. Surprisingly, the less-well-informed group did far better than the group that was given all the news... the students who had access to the news overreacted... The students who could look only at the stock’s price had no choice but to concentrate on the fundamentals that they had used to pick their stocks to begin with.The thing is, financial information is exactly what the fundamentals are supposed to be. The entire idea behind financial information is that you know what is happening to the company, and hence what its future prospects are, rather than being in dark and just speculating. He then goes on to say, “The problem of putting too much weight on a single piece of information is compounded when everyone in the market is getting that information... Groups are only smart when there is a balance between the information that everyone in the group shares and the information that each of the members of the group holds privately.” You know what we call it when people trade shares on “information that each of the members of the group holds privately”? It’s called insider trading. The solution to the problem of the market overreacting is not to disclose less information. It’s to enforce a trading halt when an important piece of information is to be announced so that the market has time to digest the information. The annoying thing is that I’m sure he knows this. It just doesn’t make for very interesting reading. Pet Peeve #3He draws sweeping conclusions from cherry picked examples. His book looks at the following events: 1. The rise of the petrol-driven car at a time when other alternatives like a steam-engine car and an electric car were also commercially available alternatives. 2. The fad for wooden tracks instead of asphalt roads, which eventually turned out to be a huge mistake. The first incident is cited as an example of the genius of the market. The second one is cited as an instance when the market got it wrong. Why and when does a crowd get it wrong? He gives two explanations: ● A crowd gets things wrong when there is an information cascade. People don’t make up their own minds; they depend on other people for information. ● A crowd is best at making decisions when it is presented with choices. How exactly it is that the first example differs in a material way from the other one is never really supported with hard researched facts. There were choices in both the examples of the car and the wooden tracks. And in both cases, the standard had a champion that went around hard-selling his alternative. Anyone remember the war between Betamax and PAL? Or between Microsoft and Apple? In each of those cases, the less efficient standard won. But you’re not going to see those stories in this book. He gives another story how the market is a genius at determining facts. Here he relies on the Challenger disaster and its consequence on Morton Thiokol. This was the company that was eventually found responsible for the accident. Of the four companies that were involved, its stock went down the lowest and the fastest even before official conclusions as to the cause were reached. This is one of his proofs that the market “knows” the facts even before the facts are in. He also talks about Enron, but as an example of how a top-down managed company is bad. Oddly, the fact that the market didn’t “know” the facts about Enron doesn’t come up. Here’s a final one. He talks about how people on the street are able to move smoothly along as an example of the crowd being intelligent. Several chapters down he talks about how traffic can snarl up and we can get stuck in jams. But really in terms of fluid dynamics, there’s no difference between one and the other. Worse, he omits examples of situations when there are too many people on a crowded street and a panic just starts for no reason: a stampede arises and people die. Pet Peeve #4 The fact is that he doesn’t really say anything terribly insightful: ● Decisions are better made when we take into account all the facts and listen to divergent views that present various perspectives. ● Following other people is useful sometimes; other times it’s disastrous. Well, du-huhhh, dude! More annoying to me is when he says banal things that are wrong:The banal but key point I’m trying to make is that the more important the decision, the less likely a cascade is to take hold. To translate that, he’s saying that when we have to make important decisions, we tend to listen to other people less and rely on our own judgment more. Really? Tell that to the people who sunk their life savings into Savings & Loans, into internet stocks, into mortgages they couldn’t afford. The opposite is in fact often true: that when we are faced with a major decision that can have long lasting consequences, we often follow what seems to have been successful for everyone else. In Conclusion...I think he had a number of interesting facts that he tried to make too much of. I think if you look hard enough, there are situations when a crowd’s decision turns out right and when it turns out wrong. But you could probably find individual decisions with the same result. And I’m quite sure that under some circumstances, a crowd will come to a better collective decision. What I don’t think is that you can usefully draw any general magic bullet rules about this. Each situation is sui generis and specific to itself. As always, the devil is in the details. But that doesn’t make for a very interesting book, or one that will sell, does it. "
1,0385721706,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46422-tk-keanini,5,"I enjoyed this book. I wrote a review and then read everyone else's review and decided to return to write something more to the point. Some people did not even finish the book so I'd like highlight a few important concepts Surowiecki was trying to communicate.The four essential conditions that make up a smart or wise crowd are: - Diversity of OpinionEach person must have some private information that he/she brings to the group. Their own interpretation or their own understanding of the problem space or a related problem space. - IndependencePeople hold to their own reasoning to some degree- DecentralizationIndividuals are able to specialize and draw on their local knowledge. Someone is going to be closest to a certain aspect of the problem space and this is what is meant by local knowledge.- AggregationThe means to synthesize the thoughts of the team in to a collective decision.All four need to be met in order for the crowd to be wise. If you experience in life has been that crowds are dumb, changes are one of these four conditions were missing.In order to reorient yourself to what Surowiecki is saying, it may require an entirely new framing of your world and some are just not willing to do that.The book is fantastic and required reading for people in a leadership position."
2,0385721706,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,4,"This book begins with a bang and ends with a bang – so I guess it is not too surprising that there is a bit of a whimper in the middle. In some ways this book covers similar ground to other books I’ve read recently, particularly Fooled by Randomness The Hidden Role of Chance in Life and in the Markets. In fact, it could be that I’ve been reading far too many of this type of book recently and so they are all starting to merge into one.The kinds of people who do tests on other people did a test in which they asked a group of people to guess how many jelly beans there were in a jar. There were 850 jelly beans in the jar and the average guess was something like 875 beans. This is a mere 3% out from the actual figure. The interesting thing in this story is that only one individual was able to guess more accurately than the group was able to guess on average. That is, individuals guessed randomly and badly, and yet, collectively their guess averaged out all of the bad guesses to such an extent that the group guess was better than virtually any individual guess (and given that before counting you couldn't know which was the one individual to rely on more than the group going with the group actually seems like the only logical option. Now, isn’t that a remarkably outcome?You see, it stands against a lot of our most cherished beliefs and intuitions. Those are that there exist in the world experts – and to quote Laura Anderson, “Only an expert can deal with the problem, because only an expert can see the problem”. But in fact experts often do remarkably badly at what they do, even in their special area of expertise. Sometimes that area of expertise needs to be so narrowly defined that it becomes very hard to know what questions an expert is actually expert in. Worse still is the fact that we are human and tend to have too high an estimation of our own expertise. Our cherished beliefs are perhaps best summed up by that quote from Nietzsche, “Madness of single persons is something rare, but the madness of groups, parties, crowds seems to be the rule”. And there seems to be lots of evidence of madness in groups, which is, of course, the opposite thesis to that put forward in this book. There is a discussion in this book, for example, on market failures (particularly bubbles) and this can make crowds seem completely insane. The most interesting example in the book was a discussion on a woman in Seattle who was standing on a bridge considering whether she should commit suicide during the peak hour traffic rush hour. Naturally, this tended to hold up the peak hour traffic as she was being 'talked down' by the Police. But while the Police were trying to talk her down pedestrians and drivers alike (both put-out by this woman’s ‘antics’) started to call on her to kill herself (quoted in the book as ‘go ahead and jump, bitch’). The crowd finally won and the woman did jump. Now, it would seem hard to argue that there was a lot of wisdom in that particular crowd, and Nietzsche would seem to have a rather large chalk mark added to his side of the board. The point of this book is not to argue that crowds are always wise, nor that they are always right. The point is to say that crowds of people often make the best decision – better than the decisions of even the smartest individuals in a group. Not only that, the group is generally a safer bet than ‘a leader’ because what we are interested in when we pick leaders is not always their ability to lead us to the best of all possible futures, but to (perhaps) look rather dashing in a pin-striped suit. That is, the argument put forward in this book is that groups tend to do better at picking what is best for the group than individuals can, and also to point out when groups are most likely to fail. The jelly bean example above is an interesting case in point. Here we got a group of people to pick the number of jelly beans in a jar and they did better on average than virtually all individuals in that group at picking the number of jelly beans. But the example gets even more interesting. After the group made its choice it was given another go. This time they were given some ‘additional information’. This information was that people should pay particular attention to the fact that there is an air gap at the top of the jar and that the jar is made out of thin plastic, and not thick glass. Both of these pieces of information were ‘true’, but they also both pointed in the direction that would increase the magnitude of the already too high guesses the group had made. Not surprisingly, the new guesses now made by the group tended to be even higher than previously and the difference between guess and number of jelly beans increased to 7% above the actual number of beans.The lessons from this are, I think, far reaching and profound. Yes, groups can be too easily fooled, particularly by experts directing their attention, and that the words ‘mob’ and ‘riot’ are not nearly as much fun if you're not in a crowd – all the same, I still disagree with Nietzsche. Most of us, as individuals, are a bit nutty in one way or another; we are also terribly fixed in our views. In fact, there are numerous examples presented in this book to make the case that groups tend to be much more rational than individuals.There is also an interesting discussion on centrally planned economies and free markets. One of the clear problems with the Soviet Union was, it would seem, that as there was no market to direct what would be produced, people got bonuses for producing lots of what no one wanted. It is not immediately apparent why Socialism should be diametrically opposed to free markets. The notion that a Socialist economy, an economy whose stated aim is to provide what is in the best interests of society, should be interested in what the members of society wants hardly seems contradictory. Perhaps the dichotomy isn't something we should be swinging between - socialist control, market freedom. With all the talk of market failures at the moment I’m becoming increasingly concerned that we will be able to separate babies and bath water.I’m also very interested in worker participation in their jobs. For a society that spends so much time talking about the benefits of democracy, we clearly don’t think (or rarely think) that those benefits should extend to the workplace. And yet, as is also shown in this book, when democracy is extended into the workplace it brings unequivocal benefits to everyone. As someone who finds much of the exercise of power to be more about ego than the cloak of efficiency it seeks to dress itself in, extending democracy seems infinitely appealing to me.Tangential to this idea is something else noted in passing in this book, that often a company losing one of its long standing and valued employees (only to be replaced by someone with less expertise) actually has a positive effect on the business. This is because groups tend to be far too exclusive and to only see as valid what they already know. Someone new coming into the group often gets to be the truth sayer. The major recommendation in this book, in its quest to really gain wisdom from groups, is to ensure the group is as diverse as possible and that everyone feels they can have a say. There is quite a bit of talk about the downside of too much information, particularly too much speculation on the causes of what are probably random fluctuations – but in general, more diversity is better than more homogeneity, despite how much worse it might feel at the time.The other core idea is that we should seek to do everything in our power to increase 'trust', as when trust is lost people are much more likely to act as mobs, rather than crowds. Again, we do like to be lead, but being lead often is at the cost of diversity and that is virtually never a good thing.I think this book gave a compelling argument in favour of democracy – however, there was a long bit in the middle about American Football (with lots of talk about things that went a bit like this – ‘they were in their fifth at the seven yard line and had to work out whether to play it safe and go for a field goal or take a 50% chance on…) and, frankly, I didn’t follow a word of it. If I’ve learnt anything, it is that while sporting metaphors are difficult in English, they are impossible in American.I was particularly interesting in his defence of short selling in stock markets. Nothing if not brave. All the same, I think he makes a rather compelling case.Despite this, there were many worthwhile ideas in this book and I would highly recommend it."

Watch the asymptote as it approaches infinity... You are getting veeeerrrry sleeeeepy...This is a very interesting concept, fleshed out into a very boring book. It seems like a graduate thesis that got stretched to book length for publication in hopes of drafting the popular slipstream of writers such as Malcolm Gladwell.The premise is fascinating, and the first chapter delivers. After that it reminds me of papers I wrote in high school, where I'd state a proposition and then strip-mine all available research materials in a singleminded quest for [only] supoorting information. It feels very one-sided.Overall, as I'm sure you can tell, I found it a bit of a disappointment because it could have been a very enjoyable article or even a book if it wasn't so heavy-handed in pursuing the thesis's applicability to every aspect of human endeavor."
4,0385721706,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3000932-sara-alaee,4,"“The Wisdom of Crowds is not an argument against experts, but against our excessive faith in the single individual decision maker. I think there are two big problems with relying on a single individual—no matter how well-informed. The first is that true experts—that is, the real titans—are surprisingly hard to identify…The second, and more important, problem is that even brilliant experts have biases and blind spots, and so they make mistakes. And what's troubling is that, in general, they don't know when they're making those mistakes…” --James Surowiecki  This book takes a good look at the theory of Collective Intelligence which is defined as the shared wisdom (or intelligence) emerging from the collaboration and cooperation of individuals. Through numerous anecdotes and discussing several experiments, the author highlights the situations where the crowd came up with answers at least as good as (sometimes better than) experts’ opinions : betting markets, guessing games, Linux, etc. He also addresses the cases where the crowd failed to be wise: the Challenger explosion, The Columbia space shuttle disaster, the stock-market bubble, the bowling bubble, etc. The reasons for why and how each of these stories (and many more) turned out as either successful or unfortunate lie in the properties which define a wise group. The author argues that, under right conditions, a group can – and will – be smarter than its smartest members.As indicated in the book, the conditions/requirements for a wise group include: Diversity (of opinions), Independence, Decentralization and Aggregation. Diversity guarantees that different perspectives from different individuals are brought into the decision process. Independence ensures that people’s opinions aren’t determined by the opinions of those around them. Decentralization certifies that people are able to specialize and draw on local knowledge. Finally, Aggregation provides some mechanism to turn private information into a collective judgment. Using these four properties, a wise group is able to solve three types of problems, namely Cognition, Coordination and Cooperation problems. Cognition deals with problems that need deliberation and information processing. These problems have definitive solutions. Coordination includes problems that require members to organize their behaviors in order to work together effectively. And, Cooperation requires self-interested and often distrustful people to work together without a central system controlling their behaviors. Unlike cognition, collective solutions to the last two problems, i.e. coordination and cooperation, are fuzzier and less definitive.With clear prose and interesting little stories covered in the book ranging across diverse fields of economy, culture, history, politics, etc., this is a very practical and engaging book. I’d recommend it to all. "
5,0385721706,http://goodreads.com/user/show/644054-ben-campopiano,3,"""As he walked through the exhibition that day, Galton came across a weight-judging competition. A fat ox hade been selected and placed on display, and members of a agathering crowd were lining up to place wagers on the weight of the ox. (Or rather, they were placing wagers on what the weight of the ox would be after it had been slaughtered and dresssed.) For sixpence, you could buy a stamped and numbered ticket, where you filled in your name, your address, and your estimate. The best guesses would receive prizes. Eight hundred people tried their luck. They were diverse people. Many of them were butchers and farmers, who were presumably expert at judging the weight of livestock, but there were also quite a few people who had, as it were, no insdier knowledge of cattle. ""Many non-experts competed,"" Galton wrote later in teh scientific journal Nature, ""like those clerks and others who have no expert knowledge of horses, but who bet on races, guided by newspapers, friends, and their own fancies."" The analogy to a democracy, in which people of radically different abilities and interests each get one vote, had suggested itself to Galton immediately. ""the average competitor was probably as well fitted for making a just estimate of the dressed weight of the ox, as an average voter is of judging the merits of most political issues on which he votes,"" he wrote.Galton was interested in figureing out what the ""average voter"" was capable of because he wanted to prove that the average voter was capable of very little. So he turned the competition into an inpromptu experiment. When the contest was over and the rpizes had been awarded, Galton borrowed the tickets from the organizers and ran a series of statisitcal tests on them. Galton arranged the guesses (Which totaled 787 in all, after he had to discard thirteen because they were illegible) in order to from highest to lowest and graphed them to see if htey would from a bell curve. Then, among other things, he added all the contestents' estimates and calculated the mean of the group's guesses. That number represented you could say, the collective wisdom of the Plymouth crowd. If the crowd were a single person, that was how much it would guessed the ox weighed.Galton undoubtedly thought that the average guess of the group would be way off the mark. After all, mix a few very smart people with some mediocre people and a lot of dumb people, and it seems likely you'd end up with a dumb answer. But Galton was wrong. The crowd had guessed that the ox, after it had been slaughtered and dressed, would weigh 1,197 pounds. After it had been slaughtered and dressed the ox weighed 1,198 pounds. In other words, the crowd's judgment was essentially perfect. Perhaps breeding did not mean so much after all. Galton wrote later: ""The result seems more creditable to the trustworthiness of a democratic judgment than might have been expected."" That was, to say the least, an understatement."" (p. XII - XIII)""Under the right circumstancesm, groups are remarkably intelligent, and are often smarter than teh smartest people in them.

XIII)""First they put a single person on a street courner and had him look up at an empty sky for sixty seconds.

This time, four times as many people stopped to gaze at the empty sky.

6,0385721706,http://goodreads.com/user/show/733624-al,1," Maybe somewhere inside this poorly written, incoherent book, there's a decent short article waiting to be written. Who knows, maybe that article has already been written, and that's why this foolishness has been perpetrated. My heart goes out to the poor fool who had to edit this thing; that's assuming it was edited, because you really can't tell by reading it. What must it have been like before the editing? Fortunately, the basic idea isn't hard to understand, and certainly it's repeated often enough. Of course, it's also denied in various places, and then again there are numerous contradictions within the book. Not to mention at least one basic math error. But never mind. My advice: read the title and subtitle, absorb the wisdom in them, and go on to something else.  I read this book, I thought, in preparation for a scheduled discussion of it at the college Homecoming weekend. That's one discussion I won't be attending. Ciao. "

8,0385721706,http://goodreads.com/user/show/284485-kara,4,"One of our VPs asked if I had read this and would recommend it for our company's global book club. I said no but jokingly added that I could read it tonight and let her know tomorrow. She didn't realize I was joking, so...now I'm reading it tonight.Sometimes these things happen.-----This book does get dry at times, but it has a lot of information in it. What I particularly liked about it is that it referenced all kinds of studies. This is not a book of opinions or a representation of a speaker’s presentation in book form; this is a book aggregating research and theories done on the subject of crowds and decisions over the years. (There are also pages of notes in the back if anyone would like to do further research.)I believe the intent here is to be a cross between a Malcolm Gladwell and Freakonomics, but it’s not quite as accessible as they are. (Some of the negative reviews said this read more like someone’s thesis paper--I wouldn't go that far, but I see where they're coming from.)The theme of the book is that crowds, when they’re the right type of crowds, perform better than individuals, even very smart individuals. He goes through a bunch of examples when crowds were wise (the average guess of the weight of the pig was very close to its actual, sports betting, Linux) and when they were wrong (the Challenger explosion, the Columbia disaster, the Bay of Pigs). He then talks about what characteristics makes crowds wise. That boils down to: diversity of opinion, independence, decentralization, and aggregation.Diversity of opinion: “Collective decisions are only wise when they incorporate lots of different information.” If everyone thinks the same way and has the same background, a crowd will be no smarter than an individual. The individuals in the crowd need to bring their own experiences and knowledge to be effective.Independence: When one person makes a prediction after hearing other people’s first, this can affect the outcome and cause a “cascade” effect. “The problem,” he says, “starts when people’s decision are not made all at once but rather in sequence…People fall in line because they believe they’re learning something important from the example of others…after a certain point it becomes rational for people to stop paying attention to their own knowledge—their private information—and to start looking instead at the actions of others and imitate them.” Decentralization: “The virtues of decentralization are twofold. On the one hand, the more responsibility people have for their own environments, the more engaged they will be…The second thing decentralization makes easier is coordination. Instead of having to make constant resort to orders and threads, companies can rely on workers to find new, more efficient ways of getting things done.”Aggregation: Crowds are useless if the diverse opinions are not aggregated in some way. This is often the downfall of decentralization: “Decentralization’s great weakness is that there’s no guarantee that valuable information which is uncovered in one part of the system will find its way through the rest of the system.”All in all, worth reading. Maybe don't try to do it overnight."
9,0385721706,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13229843-ben-batchelder,5,"Bill Buckley famously quipped that he would rather be lead by “the first 400 people listed in the Boston telephone directory than the faculty of Harvard,” a populist observation which still brings a smile to our faces. This book, which I’ve wished to read for some time, finally explains the wisdom of Buckley’s insight. It also answers a nagging question – for me at least – on why so many otherwise intelligent politicians, especially on the left, say and do such stupid things.The simple answer is that diversity of opinion (which the author calls “cognitive diversity”) is the only diversity that matters. Get enough unconnected adults together in a room, with a mix of opinions and experiences, and their deliberations will consistently produce far better results than “going to the experts.” This is counterintuitive in the extreme, as we have been increasingly taught that one should trust a few, heavy-breathing experts in any given area (public health, social policy, you name it) to decide what is best for us plebs. “With most things, the average is mediocrity.” the author explains. “With collective intelligence, it’s excellence.” [p.11] And later: “Heretical or not, it’s the truth: the value of expertise is, in many contexts, overrated.” [p.32] You can imagine that this book was not well received by the Harvard faculty or liberal lions in Boston or elsewhere.Amazingly the author, James Surowiecki, was a journalist until a few years ago at The New Yorker, where he wrote the Financial Page column. I say amazing as Surowiecki arrived at the venerable institution after editor Tina Brown had worked hard to make the magazine trendy, edgy and, by injecting politics, dumber and dumber. It was actually editor David Remnick who took a chance on him, and for many years he remained a voice of reason within its increasingly politicized pages.His refreshing thesis is stated clearly in the introduction: “under the right circumstances, groups are remarkably intelligent, and are often smarter than the smartest people in them.” [p.xiii] Ponder that for a moment. The smartest person, even several of the most expert, will regularly underperform the group’s collective wisdom. Surowiecki is wonderfully categorical in saying this insight – “that under the right conditions, imperfect humans can produce near-perfect results – has not been challenged.” [p.106]The original experiment, which underpins the Wisdom of Crowds (not of Mobs, which the author admits demonstrate the opposite), took place over a century ago at a county fair in England. There, a British scientist named Galton stumbled on an ox weight-judging competition, where 800 fair-goers paid a small fee to make a guess to earn rewards. Obviously, a county fair attracts many farmers and ranchers who are experienced with ox-tending, as well as many fair goers who aren’t. As Surowiecki explains:“Galton undoubtedly thought that the average guess of the group would be way off the mark. After all, mix a few very smart people with some mediocre people and a lot of dumb people, and it seems likely you’d end up with a dumb answer. But Galton was wrong.” [p.xiii] The average guess was 1,197 pounds, essentially a perfect guess as the correct one was 1,198. (And notice that Galton’s presumed attitude eerily echoes that of many of today’s intellectuals.)How could that be? Luck? Anti-populists and elites the world over tremble at the answer...Yet guessing the weight of an animal is a rather simple assessment of a clear activity: weighing something. The introduction ends with a more recent example involving much more complicated calculations. In 1968, the U.S. submarine Scorpion disappeared on its return from a tour of duty in the North Atlantic. Only the sub’s last reported location was known, which drew a potential search circle of twenty miles wide and many thousands of feet deep – a potentially hopeless task. Instead of gathering a small group of submarine experts, the naval officer in charge “assembled a team of men with a wide range of knowledge, including mathematicians, submarine specialists, and salvage men. Instead of asking them to consult with each other to come up with an answer, he asked each of them to offer his best guess.” Each participant was asked to rate the likelihood of various scenarios (what went wrong, speed at the time, steepness of descent), which were collected and, via a process called Bayes’s theorem, produced a best- or collective guess of the sub’s location. The end result? Only 220 yards from the actual location at the bottom of the sea.Even so, both these examples come from but one area of the problem-solving arena, which Surowiecki calls simple “cognition” problems (mostly guessing something that can be known definitively). Other areas where the startling wisdom of crowds also manifest include “coordination” problems (what is a fair price for buyers and sellers? how to drive safely in heavy traffic?) and cooperation ones (getting distrustful people to work together even against their self-interest, including paying taxes and dealing with pollution). “[T]here are times – think of a riot, or a stock market bubble – when aggregating individual decisions produces a collective decision that is utterly irrational.” [p.xix] But these are exceptions which tend to prove the rule, and often lack critical elements for good decision making.The key to good group decisions, he discovers, is cognitive diversity and independence of thought “because the best collective decisions are the product of disagreement and contest, not consensus or compromise.... Paradoxically the best way for a group to be smart is for each person in it to think and act as independently as possible.” [p. xix]The author fleshes out the ramifications of these startling observations in capitalist markets, corporate decision making, and democratic governance, where even the skeptical (and eugenicist) Galton realized after his county fair epiphany, “‘The result seems more creditable to the trustworthiness of a democratic judgement than might have been expected.’” [p.xiii]But what about group think, one wonders? Surowiecki confirms “when decision makers are too much alike – in worldview and mind-set – they easily fall prey to groupthink” which “includ[es] a conviction that dissent is not useful.” “Deliberation in a groupthink setting has the disturbing effect not of opening people’s minds but of closing them.” [pp.25,38]Allan Bloom’s The Closing of the American Mind anyone? Yet, since its publishing in 1987, have we paid heed to its warnings?Which brings me to my contention of the startlingly poor decisions that many politicians, especially of the left, make.Not to pick on New York, one of the bluest of blue states, yet both the Governor and city Mayor made disastrous decisions during this pandemic. Were they the result of liberal groupthink? The Governor mandated nursing homes to open their doors to former and non-resident Covid patients to free up hospital beds, and forbade that the nursing homes test them for Covid. This tragic order was disguised, denied, and only reluctantly reversed after a month of cascading nursing home deaths. The Mayor ordered the public transport schedule (subways and buses) to be cut in half in the condescending belief that if he allowed full schedules it would encourage more non-essential workers to use them. Instead, it forced essential workers into many tighter spaces, likely spreading the disease more easily. (To be fair, the Mayor of London was similarly arrogant and misled.) Do these leaders’ inner circle lack diversity of opinion? Do they only interact with like-minded people? Likely.Worse, we can now surmise how the Administrative state, birthed by the ultra-progressive President Wilson over a century ago, has transformed into the ideologically-bent and powerful “swamp” of today. As Surowiecki explains,“And trusting an insulated, unelected elite to make the right decisions is a foolish strategy, given all we now know about small group dynamics, groupthink, and the failure of [cognitive] diversity.” [p.267]What a recipe for lack of accountability amid a plethora of poor decisions.Sadly, the recent examples are only the tip of the iceberg of disastrous public policy decisions spanning decades in Democrat-controlled cities, counties, and states. Due to the left’s extreme disdain for opposing views (think of the New York Times’s recent firing an editorial page editor for publishing a well-considered opposing view), many of these places – and almost all universities – have been turned into laboratories and breeding grounds for leftist ideology and groupthink.Notice that Surowiecki’s keys to good collective decision making, cognitive diversity and independence of thought, are about true and productive diversity – in thinking! The tragic emphasis on cultural diversity and skin color these days (contrary to Martin Luther King Jr.’s vision for America) is in fact producing a monolithic conformity, instead of true diversity, in every policy area it touches.Why do I suspect that Democrats are particularly susceptible? Besides the rigid PC conformity enforced at almost all places of learning, it is heart-wrenching to watch the Fourth Estate surrender its traditional role of providing balanced and unbiased information, and letting the consumer decide, and increasingly turning into an advocacy monolith for leftist thinking. As Surowiecki warns,“...independence of opinion is both a crucial ingredient in collectively wise decisions and one of the hardest things to keep intact.” [p.39]Given that rightist politicians and policy makers swim in a sea of leftist media and educational ideology, and live in a society where leftist culture reigns supreme, they may be less susceptible to groupthink – but not immune. That Republican governors tend to be better managers and make better decisions than their Democrat counterparts may stem from their frequent need to interact with big-city leftist mayors. On the other hand, blue states tend to be uniformly blue, with disastrous outcomes – such as the spiraling pension debts overwhelming Illinois, California, and New York finances.Surowiecki wrote his book prior to the great populist revolt against elites, unaccountable administrative states, and PC-pushers, and the dripping condescension they evidence towards the average Joe.While he doesn’t go as far as saying the wisdom of crowds manifests itself in election results (which sometimes more resemble markets manipulated by corruption and purveyors of bias and erroneous information, including many in the media), he does second Churchill’s wisdom that our democratic republic system is the least bad among the options.In sum, his thesis is a clarion call of warning about the destructive lack of wisdom of almost all of our reigning elites, the Harvard faculty included.Yet how, finally, to interpret these startling results from the higher, spiritual realm? The author briefly opines on such wisdom in moral matters by quoting a founding father:“Thomas Jefferson, for one, thought it likely that they [experts] might be worse. ‘State a moral case to a ploughman and a professor’ he wrote. ‘The former will decide it as well as and often better than the latter because he has not been led astray by artificial rules.’” [p.267]I suspect Surowiecki intimates a better answer when discussing the hubris of experts:“...there’s little correlation between an expert’s confidence in his judgement and the accuracy of it. In other words, experts don’t know when they don’t know something.” [p.278]Even those with only a casual understanding of the bible know that the primordial sin, the cause of Lucifer’s fall, was pride. Many of today’s experts (and politicians), untethered by a sense of humility in today’s fashionably anti-Christian culture, are so pride-filled as to dismiss in the name of “progress” the wisdom of their fellow man – as well as the wisdom of our collective history."

I was handing out this book to all my friends and colleagues at work, especially our president, who seemed to think a small coterie of sycophants was all he needed.From an earlier review I wrote some time ago: Wisdom of Crowds is a very insightful book about how we make decisions. The author describes the dangers of homogeneity in promoting group think, something we will begin to see more of in the Bush second administration as he builds his Cabinet with ""Yes"" men and women. Analysis by social scientists shows that decisions made by groups that permit little diversity are often wrong and conformity to adhere to the majority opinion can be very strong. Solomon Asch 's studies on conformity showed that an individual would often agree with the group even if there was overwhelming evidence to the contrary. For example, when presented with a card showing lines of different lengths and asked to pick the shortest one, subjects would almost always pick the one chosen by other members of the group (the experimenter's confederates) even when it was obviously not the shortest.Many of Surowiceki's arguments seem counter-intuitive, but he cites a fair amount of evidence that the best decisions, on average, are always made by groups rather than individuals regardless of their expertise. In fact, he says: ""... the more power you give a single individual in the face of complexity and uncertainty, the more likely it is that bad decisions will get made.""For the group decision-making process to work the best, several elements must be present.1. A formal process for encouraging disagreement must be present;2. The group must consist of stakeholders and non-stakeholders, i.e., people normally not part of the group should be present to make sure diversity of opinion is present. Diversity guarantees that multiple perspectives are brought into the decision-making process and that a broader range of information is included;3. the group must belief and see that it has the responsibility for making decisions. If the decision is made elsewhere, the result is the opposite, i.e., bad results or at least not the best;4. individuals be independent and have that independence respected to avoid being swayed by a leader or one powerful individual,5. and there be a process for aggregating the opinions. It's important that pressure to conform be suppressed.An intelligent group does not ask of its individual members to conform to the dominant view. Instead it creates a mechanism that resembles a democracy or a market. Individual group members get the opportunity to bring in their own information and opinions and are not forced to change their views. Their independence must be explicitly protected.Much like army ants in a circular mill who die from exhaustion following a lost leader, humans will often indulge in group think and group action even if it is not in their interest to do so. And the more influence we exert on one another the more likely we are to become collectively dummer. A very good argument for encouraging independent thinkers and nay sayers. The first half, or so, of the book is theory (sounds dry, but it's really quite fascinating) followed by some case studies."
11,0385721706,http://goodreads.com/user/show/925562-tom,5,"The Wisdom of Crowds takes a scientific look at the theory that given the right composition and the right problems to solve, a group can collectively be smarter than its smartest member. It sounds like it can't be true, I know, but the author is quite convincing. The book details three different types of problems crowds can help solve:1. Cognition problems: Problems that have definitive solution, such as how many jelly beans are in this big jar?2. Coordination problems: Problems that require members of a group to figure out how to coordinate their behavior with each other, such as driving safely in heavy traffic.3. Cooperation problems: Problems that require self-interested, distrustful people to work together, even when narrow self interest would seem to dictate that no individual should take part, i.e. paying taxes or taking care of the environment.There are also necessary ingredients in a successful crowd: Diversity of opinion, independence and decentralization.There are lots of interesting examples of the above throughout the book. I found the studies on cooperation problems to be specifically interesting - the ultimatum game (p112) and the public-goods (p139) experiments are great examples of this.Still, I'm sure that after reading all that, you still have doubts, as it seems counterintuitive to think that a crowd of undetermined intelligence is smarter than a really intelligent individual. I'll leave you, dear readers, with this to think about (from the afterword, pp277-278):""The Wisdom of Crowds is not an argument against experts, but against our excessive faith in the single individual decision maker. I think there are two big problems with relying on a single individual - no matter how well informed. The first is that true experts - that is, the real titans - are surprisingly hard to identify. In fact, if a group is smart enough to know whether an individual is a genuine decision-making prodigy, then the group is smart enough not to need that individual."""
12,0385721706,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46878-james,1," If a crowd is wise, then an individual writer like the author must not be? Much of the book is trite, some is just wrong. He refers to the book Moneyball and how clever Oakland was using new ideas to win more games.Like money sports is only about winning. Their #1 goal is to make as much money as possible,winning can help that,but being entertaining is more important. He admits that later in an example about Italian soccer. In Moneyball, we're told that the way to win is to walk to first base,and rarely or never try to steal a base. Who wants to go to a baseball game and watch guys WALK to first base?And stealing bases give unexpected excitement. That's not Moneyball, that's BORINGBALL. On page 127 he talks about Ernst & Young accountants,they did a crappy job, along with every one else on Wall street,but it's our fault because we ""stopped watching the watchmen"". The book was written in 2004, he couldn't know that another Ernstclient, Lehman brothers, had tons of liabilities off the booksso investors wouldn't know the true risk of investing in LEH.  Or being a counterparty to LEH.  In 2008 LEH went bankrupt. At least 600 Billion dollars in debts. At least One Million deals with counterparties. Has Ernst been held accountable in any way? No. Is that our fault too? The book is a collection of a hundred little stories that don't really fit together.I'm glad I didn't buy this book, back to the library."
13,0385721706,http://goodreads.com/user/show/669573-kathrynn,3,"I've debated on how to rate this book. On one hand there were interesting ideas between the cover, but on the other hand it was very dry and boring. I agree with another reviewer who mentioned it was like reading a thesis.The author separated the book into two parts: Part 1 and Part 2 and for the life of me I can't fathom why because it all ran together. The introduction starts off with numerous examples to the points he intends to make throughout the book that also have numerous--extensive--examples. A great deal of research had to go into putting the information together, but it seemed like too much name throwing and quoting with nothing to counter-balance the assumptions. There were many NFL examples (eyes rolling) and most of the examples seemed to go on forever. I got it. Enough already.On the plus side, sifting through the data of this book had me thinking about the wisdom of crowds. I agree that collective decisions are more likely to be good when made from a diverse group of individuals, reaching independent conclusions. The author's theories on becoming individually smarter, but collectively dumber were interesting. I agree that one of the quickest ways to make people's judgments biased is to make them dependent on one another for information. Another good suggestion I found in this book was reading ""The Tipping Point"" by Malcolm Gladwell--featured in Goodreads December 2009 Newsletter. :-)"
14,0385721706,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1028300-glen-engel-cox,3,"As a card-carrying member of the liberal elite, I approached James Surowiecki's book, The Wisdom of Crowds, with more than a small amount of skepticism. If his thesis, as exposed in the subtitle, ""Why the Many Are Smarter than the Few and How Collective Wisdom Shapes Business, Economies, Societies, and Nations,"" was true, it would put all of my liberal beliefs about the importance of higher education and intelligence used by experts in the service of the greater good to a serious test. Would this book turn me from being an admirer of Al Gore into a Bush-head? The horror, the horror.Now that I've finished the book, I'm happy to say that I'm still voting for John Kerry, but I do have a higher opinion of the ability of the masses to answer perplexing problems. At the same time, I strongly feel that Surowiecki's title and thesis are somewhat disingenious, owing more to a good marketing campaign and titular wordplay than actually expressing correctly the promise of his argument. Surowiecki attempts to deflate the classic book by Charles MacKay, Extraordinary Popular Delusions Volume Three: 3, and yet only mentions this famous counter argument by name twice and then only in passing. By doing so, he fails to fully address a real flaw in his thesis: when (under what conditions, size, background, etc) is a crowd a useful body as opposed to a dangerous mob.That's not to say that Surowiecki fails to show how crowds can make smarter decisions that individual experts. Through anecdotes and discussion of controlled social experiments, he illustrates how, collectively, a group actually does much better at problem solving, mainly through the use of group error correction, i.e., while one or two members of the group might be off the answer by degrees of standard deviation, when averaging, the group as a whole comes much closer to the correct answer more often than an individual expert. In particular, his discussion of the way that markets work (in this case, not just the stock market, but Vegas betting lines as well as faux creations such as the Hollywood Stock Exchange) changed my opinion of the usefulness of these for decision-making purposes.Yet it is also in this discussion of markets that Surowiecki's argument falls flat, in that he glosses over real market problems such as the irrationality of crowds in a bull market (such as the Danish tulip craze, the 1920s boom, or the irrational exuberance of the 90s) while making the case for how the proposed DARPA Policy Analysis Market (""a market centered on the Middle East [that:] might provide intelligence that otherwise would be missed""). Surowiecki seems to me to be much more trusting of humans, whereas I'm much more inclined to believe that no matter how good a system might be, there's also that individual expert who's working on gaming the system, making it fail in ways unexpected. I only harp on this because I get the feeling in several cases (the DARPA chapter in particular, where Surowiecki's disdain for the congress people who killed the Policy Analysis Market is all too apparent) that he is championing the use of market-based decision making over our current expert-based.Reading this book did make me look at situations differently, and because of such, I'd recommend it. For example, while watching the 2004 Summer Olympics, I instantly thought of this book while watching the reaction of the crowd who felt that the judges for the individual men's gymnastics high-bar competition had not graded the Russian gymnast's performance correctly. They proceeded to boo and make noise until the panel of six judges changed their ratings. I pondered, is this an example of Surowiecki's thesis or an example of mob-rule, or, perhaps something he didn't quite cover, a little of both?"
15,0385721706,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3362541-shelby-boyer,4,"In reading Surowiecki’s The Wisdom of Crowds, I found myself finally patting myself on the back for being what I’ve always been: average. Finally—someone championing the wisdom of the little guy. The entire book is built around the idea of a crowd knowing what’s best. From figuring out how to maneuver a crowded street to finding lost submarines and judging economics, the crowd has got it down. Surowiecki makes an easily compelling case for the crowd, and he manages to do it in an entertaining way. His book is accessible to his subject matter—those common men, the lay people of the world. I am in no way an expertise, a genius, or a leader; I know very little about digital culture, politics, economics. And yet I was able to understand and—more than that—appreciate Surowiecki’s claims. Even if you don’t agree with the content (and I know some won’t), it is a well-written and enjoyable book.But, to the point. The Wisdom of Crowds highlights various situations, most of them successful, where the crowd rendered an answer either the same or better than the experts opinions. Surowiecki outlines three different types of crowds and explains why it is the crowd that makes sense of the situation. We have our Cognitive, Coordinative, and Cooperative people each with a different success story. The Cognitive is about market judgment, where the crowd is allowed to think through problems, process information, and deliver a solution as a whole. Coordination deals with common cultural understanding and awareness. It comes off as street smarts, where the crowd all knows to walk to the right without really knowing why. And the Cooperation is all about the free market (obviously supported by our Mr. Surowiecki) and the building of networks of trust. He outlines these three “crowds” and their respective successes through various examples until, finally, we feel like we—the collective we!—can do anything. Forget the pros, forget the experts. Elect us! Call on us! Stick it to the man and release the hordes! But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. After all, the crowd itself isn’t celebrated; rather, their aggregated knowledge is the champion. Even in his examples just in the forward—deciding the ox’s weight or finding the lost submarine—it wasn’t that a crowd gathered together to sort out the best answer. No. Everyone gave their individual answer, someone or some machine inputted the data, and the mean was decided upon. It was that number that was the winner. Not any one conclusion but a conglomeration—a conglomeration dependent on some geniuses mixed in with some idiots standing in a crowd with a bunch of averages. So perhaps it’s less of a revolutionary call and more of a celebration of collaboration. It’s the pat on the back from your elementary school teacher after your group project went swimmingly: it’s not about you, it’s about the end result. If it works, it worked; if not, you brush it under the rug and move on. That is both the point, the power, and the depressing reality of this book. Surowiecki tries to champion us simple-minded majority—and he does so in an enlightening fashion. It’s great to read a book about how well we’re doing, how the digital age has allowed us to open up a whole new can of possibilities. But this book is also about how the average remain average, the experts remain experts, and the idiots…well, they’re still stupid. And that's just fine. At least according to Surowiecki. "
16,0385721706,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1068292-christy,4,"We usually think that a crowd, taken as a whole, is going to be wrong. But surprisingy, if you take everybody's individual wisdom and average it together, you'll get a better answer than you'll find from an expert. We're not talking about committees here--you don't put everybody together and have them talk it out. People have to come to their decisions independently. This works whether you're guessing the number of jelly beans in a bottle, or finding a lost submarine, or trying to guess where the stock market will go. Valuable lesson: don't think anybody is stupid, unless maybe it's an ""expert"" who doesn't listen to the ordinary people around him."

19,0385721706,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36095271-tom,4,"This book was one of those frustrating reads where you wish you'd come across the it much earlier, because it's full of good stuff, but by the time you reach it lesser imitators have picked half the flesh off the bones. I can't count how many insight porn blogposts I've read namechecking prediction markets, or Schelling points, or the ultimatum game, but I could have saved myself all the trouble by reading this book closer to the date of publication. Luckily, the sense of familiarity of the material fell away towards the end (perhaps those bits are hardest to excerpt?). Some of the social science is probably be a little shaky nowadays (the perils of provocative makes-u-think experiments), but overall this is a solid summary of a lot of research round group decision-making and market systems where correctness or optimality is an emergent property of the actions of the participants.I do have one criticism, though, and that is the amazingly doctrinaire science-journalist way Surowiecki starts all of his chapters with a scene-setting anecdote. At the beginning it's just a little stale; by the end of the book it has taken on a quiet absurdity, yanking you out of the flow of what is genuinely interesting to place you ""in the moment"" in a canned example taken from life.""One day in the fall of 1906, the British scientist Francis Galton left his home in the town of Plymouth and headed for the country fair...

21,0385721706,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2026132-theron,3,"I was skeptical when I first picked this book up. In fact, I picked it up and put it down any number of times. I picked it up and red the preface and after a short grumble, I put it down. Picked up, put down. Up down. Again. Weeks pasted before I picked it up again, knowing that there must be something of value in there, somewhere. Following a quick read, I wasn’t too disappointed. However, the first half is much better than the last half.Surowiecki starts with a mildly entertaining anecdote of Francis Galton and English country fair and a dressed-meat judging contest. He found that at the county fair, even the experts were not very good at judging the weight of an ox (dressed). What amazed him was that if the total guesses were aggregated, the average of all those guesses was remarkably correct in coming very close to the exact right answer. As in how many gumballs are in the jar – 186. In example after increasing more complex example, Surowieki proved his point – in theory and in a few best-case examples. However, he did put a LOT of caveats on the crowed that is wise. The wise crowd is: diverse, independent, decentralized, sufficiently large and must have a method of aggregating its decision. One interesting point, the crowd does not have to be full of smart people – or for that mater – any smart people.Surowieki also gives several examples of teams that fail to be wise. Most notably the mission management team of NASA during the Columbia Shuttle disaster. In summary, the Columbia Accident Investigation Board (CAIB) determined that the small team was not sufficiently diverse, and member did not operate independent from the leader, an didn’t have a method to aggregate – except through the team leader Linda Ham. In the area of diversity, Surowieki contrast the mission management team with the ground crew of Apollo 13, the later being nearly all middle-aged white males having crew cuts, white short-sleeve dress shirts, and narrow-ties. The key is and was cognitive diversity.Cognitive diversity is defined as the extent to which the group reflects differences in knowledge, including beliefs, preferences and perspectives (Miller et al 1998) [1:]. So how does one develop and maintain cognitive diversity in order to ensure the best possible decisions? Here are some simple rules:  Hire diversity. Hire folks with a diverse set of skills, knowledge, experience, values, beliefs, preferences and perspectives.  Maintain independence. This diversity, must be maintained and encouraged. It cannot be the goal of management to make all staff members alike.  Communicate differences. Everyone on the team should know, who knows what, who prefers what, and what perspectives they hold. This is to facilitate both access to information and co-ordination.  Openly listen (and talk later). The groups must actively and openly listen to the information provided by others.  Encourage dissonant viewpoints. Even if the dissonant viewpoint end up being incorrect, the process of thinking through reasons strengthens decisions.  Don’t seek consensus. The final decision or recommendation must come from aggregating the opinion – not seeking consensus. You must find a method of aggregating like a market place rather than a meeting.  What am I missing?-----[1:] Miller, CC, Burke LM, Glick WH (1998) ""Cognitive diversity among upper-echelon executives: Implications for strategic decision processes"", Strategic Management Journal, Vol.19, No.1, pp39."

His ingredients for decentralized wisdom are essentially the ingredients of the Scientific Revolution, participatory democracy and how we naturally learn from experience.Wow! My first review for this site was sparse. I'm expanding this review for The Wisdom of Crowds as an acknowledgment during an election week of the importance of this thesis for democracy.The ingredients for collective wisdom are: independence, decentralization, diversity and aggregation. People must think independently. Thus, the herd mentality automatically thwarts the pursuit of wisdom. Yet thinking independently does not matter much if everyone has the same centralized perspective of something. The value in independence to a democracy, for example, lies in people coming up with many different decentralized perspectives rather than be herded into a few factions/interest groups/parties.Diversity is thus a litmus test that independent and decentralized perspectives are working. Through diversity there is a spread of opinions around a norm, and there must then be a means of aggregating the diverse input to discover the norm of that spread. The norm represents a better answer than can be achieved by an expert.Think of it this way. For any given issue there is probably an ""expert"" or two who would advocate what is precisely the norm of the distribution, the ""correct"" answer if you will, but the odds weigh heavily against that. More likely an ""expert's"" advocacy would fall within half the standard deviation away from the norm. The only way to get precisely the norm is to allow for as much diversity as possible, through independence and decentralization, and come up with a valid and reliable means of getting the norm from the resulting distribution. Yes, you get ""wacko"" opinions with this method but, in addition to getting a more accurate norm through aggregation, you get something much closer to the concept of democracy than what survives our centralized institutions.Of further note: the Scientific Revolution was a rebellion against the dogma of the centralized ""experts"" of the time and a dramatic movement towards the independence and decentralization of knowledge. It has not been the centralizing tendencies of politics and economics that brought us much of what we think as progress today, but the independence and decentralization of the Scientific Revolution. I go into this more in Systems out of Balance."

24,0385721706,http://goodreads.com/user/show/164338-mack,3,"I’m trying to remember the first time I heard the phrase: “Group Think”. It might have been when a teacher pointed out a logical fallacy during a group presentation, or from a judge in a debate tournament, but I definitely remember hearing the phrase in reaction to the second gulf war and all the accusations and recriminations associated with it. Like many people, I heard that phrase and wondered: “is that the polite way of saying: ‘we all screwed up?’” Though he writes as part of the aftermath of the Iraq war, Surowiecki carefully avoids that most politically charged instance of “group think”. He instead addresses the promise and the perils of our increasingly collaborative culture, explaining the factors that help some groups discover modern marvels and lead others to massive mistakes. With the tone of a genial professor, Surowiecki explains the theory behind his argument. He quickly identifies four traits that strong groups share: diversity of opinion, independent decision making, decentralized judgement and aggregation of knowledge. The book follows an examination of these traits and offers a host of case studies that explain each factor in greater detail. These do not necessarily make for riveting reading (particularly when Surowiecki loses track of his examples and speaks in abstractions), but it does make for an interesting subject to study. I still don’t know if “group think” is just code for “we all screwed up”, much like I don’t know how to apply calculus to modern life or what lessons the Visigoths can teach us about modern government. But if there are good books that address interesting subjects, I may learn something, and that’s enough."
25,0385721706,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10797234-ravi-warrier,3,"I started reading this book with an inherent bias. Of course, I agree with Agent Kay in Men In Black when he said, ""A person is smart, people are dumb!"" and that's kind of intuitive for anyone with two eyes and a brain to observe the world. And so, I was convinced I wouldn't like what 'this guy' (the author) had to say... But I changed my mind. Only because mentally I changed the title of the book.If you change the title of the book to ""How to make crowds wiser"", then everything that Surowiecki says in the book falls into place, like a jigsaw puzzle. In fact, he concludes it that way as well. And so, I am guessing that the current title might be either a case of ""bandwagon effect"" or cowering into the publisher's demands to have a catchier title.Suroweicki does a good job of balancing both sides of the argument, demonstrating when crowds are smart and when they are dumb. And it all boils down to two important factors. I won't mention those factors here, because of spoilers and because I'd be taking away James' thunder. But, the factors that he tacitly or implicitly identifies are the two factors that determine any good brainstorming session or any group that is created to solve a problem.So, I liked the book. It brought a lot of information on its pages. Most of it good. Surowiecki also took the effort to show both sides of the coin in different scenarios and walks of life and society, which was nice. It was well written, but I must admit, at places, it felt repetitive and unncessarily longer than it should have.It lost out on 4 stars only because of the misleading title."

The financial crisis and stock market crash really do poke holes in a lot of his narrative on how groups out perform individuals.I would not recommend using a credit today for this book because it is outdated by recent events and we have evolved technologically since those days. I do like the authors main theme that groups out perform individuals but he would first need to rewrite his story to explain recent history and include recent tech innovations.The narrator is one of my favorites and he will make it easy to listen to the whole book in spite of the anachronisms in the narrative.

Anyone who has ever worked in a group will recognize many of the dynamics he describes - from the dominance of those who speak the most (regardless of the merits of the content they contribute) to unconscious deference to those of higher status (regardless of whether their expertise pertains to the problem at hand).

This happens when the wrong answers are randomly distributed, and the experts cast the deciding votes. You would be surprised how often this happens. Read the book for cases to keep an eye on biased wrong answers ruining this usually good strategy for finding optimal solutions."

Surowiecki did not create new definitions and slammed the blackboard: “This is it guys, truism!”. Instead, he went back to the literature review, he spared spaces for conflicting ideas. Therefore, after his book, I am more convinced by his idea, despite knowing that there have been traditional thinkers who disagree with you. In the case of Gladwell, I am more like: “Yeah…I see your point, but I highly doubt it.”I read the haft first of the book carefully and skimming through the other half. All the basic ideas were written first then followed by case studies that’s why. I crave for the basics. A universal recipe, then I’ll see its application for myself.Many interesting facts were listed, charmingly. Again the author did a better job than Gladwell. I don’t feel suffocated by his examples. They are like chocolates sprinkled on top of what has already been a fine piece of dessert. I see the classic names such as Milgran listed here. Oh, I remember it now, why is Surowiecki writing so charming. He is very serious about his references. It wasn’t just a title to escape the charge of plagiarism, he included a small review in each mention. I found it very easy to keep track of my to-read materials thanks to him.Let’s talk about the content. The whole book can be summed up by this idea: A crowd is wise if it satisfies:　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　 – Diversity of opinion. Everyone is smart in their own way. If you plus all of the ideas of a group in and divide them into an average idea. That idea is likely to be wiser than any individual idea. Why? Simple math. All of the errors will be canceled out, and the collective wisdom is an average of very sharp yet haphazard knowledge. The idea of “chase the expert” is long gone. It is better, to have some expertise in a group and a few commoners. – Independence. Let me quote Surowiecki to express the essence of this lesson: “You can be biased and irrational, but as long as you’re independent, you won’t make the group any dumber” (p. 41). Why? Because humans are social animals. We imitate. It is the origin of “If the dog is the leader of a whole patch of lions, all lions will die like a dog” kind of idea. Groupthink. Bay of Pigs. Any spark? People are scared to voice out their ideas in a group. Wrong judgement is contagious. – Decentralization and aggregation. Now that we have all of the ideas, we need someone to summarize it because the pages ain’t gonna write themselves. Even though humans were programmed to be collectively smart, the crowds did not write this book. An individual did. Ideas are scattered all over the places, we need a collector.And there is a whole chapter about coordination and another chapter about a society that offers the conditions of a crowd to implement those factors I just listed. How can one manage to act in a crowd with culture? I skimmed through it. There were way many class experiments on psychology that I would love to see by myself in the original sources.

37,0385721706,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36128537-baiju-joshi,4,"'The wisdom of crowds is dazzling'-Malcolm GladwellThe book uses real world examples to prove that collective wisdom far surpasses individual wisdom, as far as coordination and cooperation problems are concerned.Various issues that affect us in everyday lives, like democratic voting, markets, juries and even traffic, have been looked at from the perspective of collective decision making. There are interesting examples of how individual companies like Google and the scientific community as a whole, tap into this collective wisdom to the achieve the best results. The latter part of the book veers into the study of organisational behavior (which I don't like personally) and how groupthink results in poor decisions. Consequently, ways to create better organizational structures have also been mentioned.It would definitely be one of the tougher books you'll have read (as it demands complete attention), but an extremely good one because it provides a completely un-thought of perspective. It nails down one point quite clearly: Do not underestimate the wisdom of crowds, because collectively, crowds can arrive at better and more accurate decisions than almost all individuals."
38,0385721706,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10708119-pieter,3,"Traditional right and new left have a natural mistrust in crowds or Joe Sixpack for that matter. Le Bon, Nietzsche, Carlyle and Galton all referred in some way or another to the madness of the crowds. Current leftist influencers disgust voters electing the wrong candidate.Surowiecki opposes this rationale. Public decisions can outperform private decisions in solving cognition problems (who wins the Super Bowl? What is the weight of a ham?), co-ordination problems (trading at a fair price) and co-operation problems (paying taxes, working together although individual interest advises not to). Look at the way the Google search engine works (apart from the annoying ads) or how many times the audience correctly hits the spot at ""Who wants to be a millionaire?"".The author sees for four conditions how the public can outperform individual decisions: independence, diversity opinion, decentralization and aggregation. Whereas it may be OK to have homogeneous teams for exploiting, Surowiecki believes that heterogenous teams are better in exploring and even deciding. Not the CEO, but group management should decide on the condition that it is diversely informed. It is natural to prefer losing small by sticking to the crowd then by innovating and risking to lose a lot (so called herding). But society and organisations can win a lot by the latter. Diversity breaks conformity and makes it easier to express one's opinion and add wisdom to the discussion. Groups may polarise, but the entire community profits from the important role of dissent, although political-correct pundits prefer consensus, at least their consensus. ""Du choc des idées jaillit la lumière"", as a French quote goes.Secondly, simultaneous and autonomous (if not sequential) judgements should also lead to better results. A lot of Internet applications work on this basis successfully (e.g. Tripadvisor). But if collective wisdom prevails, why do stock markets tend to overcompensate? For psychological reasons (losses are felt double compared to gains) and also because stock prices are based on future forecasts not a current truth. But more importantly, bubbles and crashes are created by dependent knowledge, herd-like mentality. We seem to be overconfident to sell stocks at a bigger fool for a higher price somewhere in the future.Thirdly, decentralisation allows to work more locally and look at a case from different angles. It encourages engagement, whereas centralised organisations are typically costly and prevent information flows and initiative. Teams are more agile when decentralized (open source programming, US army). Hey, but what about the several intelligent services that competed against each other and that were unable to forecast a 9/11-event? Not centralisation offers a solution (cf. supra), but rather aggregation. Link all databases to distribute information, but keep autonomy via local decision centers. SARS scientists (and currently, Covid scientists) co-operate worldwide to find a virus, but they work in parallel. Thus, there is no top-down management controlling all operations. The process is pretty much in line with Western tradition in which scientific knowledge and innovative conclusions are shared publicly.Game theorists strongly emphasize the prisoner's dilemma issue or the problem of the commons. But the author does believe in co-operation that is built on stable relationships: Quaker, Chinese, Hanseatic League. By seizure of entire cities or families in case of non-payment, cheating comes at a very high (social) price. Simulation games learn that participants strive for a just distribution of wealth by even rejecting free money in case of an unequal split. From a positive perspective, conventions like queuing create order and stability and help to resolve co-ordination problems.As family and clan ties are less tight, markets encourage trust by establishing gatekeepers like auditors and rating agencies. These failed miserably during the financial crises in 2001 and 2009. Also states can fail if fines or its reputation do not suffice to discipline all tax payers. No doubt that taxes create value, but it takes two to tango.The author does not turn a blind eye to the current democratic crisis. People do no longer feel involved in political decisions. Therefore, Surowiecki suggests to implement deliberative democracy. One should make better use of local knowledge. Democracy does not always come up with the best decision but it is still preferred to keep decision making democratically."
39,0385721706,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19157738-daniel-olshansky,2,"A well written easy to read book with a few interesting thoughts and anecdotes, but provides little value overall. In my opinion, this book could serve as an fine introduction for individuals who have not studied economic bubbles, blockchain economics or the mentality required in investing. For anyone familiar with these subjects, there are many alternatives I believe are worth reading instead.This book was published in 2004 and it's amazing how applicable it is to everything blockchain related today. The book argues for the needs of ""free"" (decentralized?) prediction markets on different scales: small groups, institutions, industries and the public as a whole. The book also discusses various situations where decentralized groups of individuals managed to come to a consensus under very different circumstances. It’s a bit ironic how Surowiecki makes a lot of arguments in favor of decentralized governments while also explaining how illogical economic bubbles given the speculative state of cryptocurrencies today.There were some interesting references including Gary Shilling’s work, how several teams coordinated to develop a vaccine to SARS, the 1950s bowling bubble I wasn’t aware about at all, and a few economic tests run in University classes. Alongside the interesting examples, there were many mundane examples that almost put me to sleep, such as how humans coordinate through traffic amongst themselves.The book is very forward-looking given that it was written before conversations of workplace diversity spread widely, and long before blockchain technology became mainstream. That being said, I do not believe it will stand the test of time because the same topics have been covered numerous times with a lot more interesting detail."

In politics, business, markets, and every day cognitive challenges the summation of everyone's ideas are superior to the single idea of any individual person. Even when some individuals are ""experts"" or other elites. Think of it like the system of decision making that got our founders to the US Constitution. We think of compromise (aka ""problem solving"") as meeting in the middle of 2 extremes. In reality, our country was founded not by meeting in the middle - but by taking the BEST ideas of all sides and putting those together. The larger the group and more diverse the experience of that group, the more accurate their predictions from guessing weight to locating lost Navy submarines. It's true that diversity really does make us stronger. Not just ethnic diversity (although cultural differences and any different life experiences help differenciate the ideas people produce by shaping their values), but diversity in values, philosophy, and ideas. This principle is why central management exactly fails every single time. The smaller a decision making group gets, the more susceptible it is to making mistakes through group think and political posturing. "
44,0385721706,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7196247-tiago,3,"This book has two distinct parts and my rating is 3.5/5. The first one where the author lays the fundamental concepts behind his wisdom of the crowds theory is worth 5 stars. In summary, to become wise, a crowd should comply with these four criteria: - Diversity of opinion: Each person should have private information even if it's just an eccentric interpretation of the known facts.- Independence: People's opinions aren't determined by the opinions of those around them.- Decentralization: People are able to specialize and draw on local knowledge.- Aggregation: Some mechanism exists for turning private judgments into a collective decision. The second part with examples and counter examples is harder to read hence I give it 2 stars. The examples are not that interesting (with the exception of decision making at NASA and how stock market bubbles form) and the author sometimes rambles a lot. Another good point of the book is the rich 'notes and references' section."
45,0385721706,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6410286-brittany,4,"I love me a book on decision making.-Interesting mention from ""The baiting crowd in episodes of threatened suicide"" where a woman was told, ""Just jump, bitch! Just do it!"" when she climbed over the railing of a bridge in an obvious suicide attempt.-https://www.jstor.org/stable/2772323?-You do not need a consensus in order, for instance, to tap into the wisdom of a crowd, and the search for consensus encourages tepid, lowest-common-denominator solutions which offend no one rather han exciting everything. Instead of fostering the free exchange of conflicting views, consensus-driven groups-especially when the members are familiar with each other-tend to trade in the familiar and squelch provocative debate.-It's important to see, though, that polarization isn't just the result of people trying to stay in tune with the group...But if a majority of the group already supports one position, then most of the arguments that will be made will be in support of that position. So the uncertain people are likely to be swayed in that direction, in part simply because that's more of what they'll hear. Similarly, people who have more extreme positions are more likely to have strong, coherent arguments in favor of their positions and are also more likely to voice them. But the trust is that, especially when it comes to problems where there is no obvious right answer, there's no guarantee that the most-informed speaker will also be the most influential. On juries, for instance, two-thirds of all foremen-who lead and structure deliberations-are men, and during deliberations men talk far more than women do, even though no one has ever suggested that men as a gender have better insight into questions guilt and innocence. In groups where the members know each other, status tends to shape speaking patterns, with higher-status people talking more and more often than lower-status people. Again, this wouldn't matter as much if the authority of higher-status people was derived from greater knowledge. But oftentimes it doesn't. Even when higher-status people don't real know what they're talking about, they're more likely to speak....That kind of deference is important, because in small groups ideas often do not succeed simply on their own merits. Even when its virtues may seem self-evident, an idea needs a champion in order to be adopted by the group as a whole. That's another reason why a popular position tends to be come more popular in the course of deliberations: it has more potential champions to behind with. In a market or even a democracy, champions are far less important because of the sheer number of potential decision makers. But in a small group, having a strong advocate for an idea, no matter how good it is, is essential. And when advocates are chosen, as it were, on the basis of status or talkativeness, rather than perceptiveness or keenness of insight, then the group's chance of making a smart decision shrinks.-Social comparison-Stasser has also shown that in unstructured, free-flowing discussions, the information that tends to be talked about the most is, paradoxically, the information that everyone already knows. More curiously, information can be presented and listened to and still make little difference, because its contents are misinterpreted. New messages are often modified so that they fit old messages, which is especially dangerous since unusual messages often add the most value...Or they are modified to suit a pre-existing picture of the situation. -http://collectivescience.com/document...

About the fact that crowds sometimes are wiser and make better decisions than individual but world class experts would. 	2. What problem was the author trying to solve?	The myth or bias of talent and individual expertise that is so revered. 	3. What are the main arguments? Do I agree?	Efficiency of markets, who wants to be a millionaire and guessing total number of objects. How is this possible? How can thousands of stocks be priced so close to perfection? How can diverse crowds of people and even ants work out solutions to complex problems ? Consider the lost submarine where diverse people with some knowledge in the field had to guess at the location of a lost submarine with with very little information… the answer was correct by a couple hundred meters in a vast ocean.	I agree that diverse, decentralized and independent groups can be astonishingly accurate in many instances. This can be underestimated and therefore this book is an antidote. Sometimes groupthink leads to bubbles which is also a real phenomenon so nobody is completely rational.	4. What did I learn?	I learned about weighted average of a diverse independent group should be seriously considered. What does it converge to, think about science.	5. Which three facts, ideas or principles do I want to remember the most?	How in science diversity and independence is very important and that there are conflicting forces. A well known expert will have a big halo effect and partly distort our view.	How companies should work more like meritocracy and why it works. It is functional to be open minded but also independent, but make sure that your independent and contrarian thinking is accurate and don't underestimate the crowd.	There is a mathematical explanation how this wisdom might occur: in a group there are all kinds of people of different knowledge background and intelligence, and all this converges when the outliers cancel each other you get closer to good averages. In the game show the clever friend was correct about 80% and the crowd about 95%..	6. Which of my beliefs were challenged?	The belief that being contrarian is always good or smart.	7. How did my life change by reading this book?	More respect for the mechanism of markets and how some bias for social proof can be good.	8. What do I need to implement?	A more careful approach in not taking account of what big diverse masses think or going against what could be wise. Considering another truth.	9. Summary: we are like ants sometimes; we build glorious societies and infrastructure and we can also be doomed like when the ants march in a circle until death. We need groups to be diverse with individuals thinking strange things and a open society that allow this flow of information. In a totalitarian society the restriction of information diversity and the thinking alike is exactly what destroys it in the end. When in ""who wants to be a millionaire"" - ask the crowd there are sound reasons why they do better than the experts."

His argument is obviously for alleged wisdom of crowds, but IMHO, he doesn't make a coherent or compelling argument for it because for every positive example he gives, it seems like there's a counter-argument where it doesn't work (e.g., if crowd members are not independent, or decentralized, or whatever). I flipped to the back to see if he ever tried to sum up when crowds should be trusted, but the last chapter is on democracy...and if there's a domain where the crowds are more easily swayed by wrong/unproven/disproven beliefs and irrelevant crap, I'd love to hear about it.In every chapter, he just seems to bounce around until the chapter ends. I have no idea why he even had chapters, since they didn't appear to hold together as coherent entities. I quit at around page 100, and I felt like I was reading one random example after another.It seems like the central thesis is that ""the crowd is wise...in a rather limited set of circumstances, and you'd better make sure all the 'wise crowd' prerequisites are satisfied before you believe in their wisdom."" Which, in everyday use, is not actually all that useful a thesis. I did not have the patience to take notes throughout to build up the list of indications and contra-indications.As I write this (11 February 2016), Donald Trump has quite recently won the New Hampshire Republican primary by a very comfortable margin, and the stock market is having another fear based selloff as the ""wise"" crowds busily transform their paper losses into the real thing.

I have read some so read back this pioneer one seems easier.But i have to say that the wisdom of crowds need to be established under the rational crowds. Giving different environments, circumstances, crowds behaved very differently.We doubt how Nazi could existed, but looking at the background of what happened in Germany at that time, great depression, they still need to pay huge indemnity for WWI, people won't react calmly and rationally. I don't think we should blindly believe in crowds, certainly they have value on their opinion, but never underestimate the influence of small group of people among ordinary crowds, since crowds are sheep most of time. In Taiwan, just these few days we got a religious cult scandal exposed that the leader of the cult was gifted a luxurious car which cost more than 20 million NTD. Entering as member of this cult, you need to pay 2000NT per year, 300NT to attend a ceremony, yet there are more than 100,000 believers. In my wildest dream, I can never believe in modern days, people could worship someone just sitting there claiming giving your super positive power in group meditation. Among them, mostly are even young generations. You wonder why scientists who make this world progress never got so much fans, but these people not really doing anything actually trick easily so many seemingly not retarded people. Why? Social lost, economic depression, young generation can not find a goal, a better future. You want comfort mentally, come to master's embrace. The wisdom of crows? 1/300 of Taiwanese actually buy this kind of trick, most of young actually receive high education beyond university. I am scratching my head all the time...."
49,0385721706,http://goodreads.com/user/show/447127-giedra,4,"Fascinating description of the counterintuitive phenomenon in which aggregating knowledge of a large number of people produces a more accurate result than one would expect. For example, if you have a large number of people predict the number of jellybeans in a jar, their average will probably be very close to accurate and is likely to be more accurate than the estimate of all but 1 or 2 individuals. Described ways this phenomenon can be/is used to help predict things (eg, elections, sports winners, and most notably the stock market), as well as things that can cause the accuracy of these kinds of predictions to go off-kilter (eg, how certain kinds of biases cause stock market bubbles---or even how wording a question about how many jelly beans are in the jar might introduce bias that would push the group's aggregated average in one direction or another).Especially interesting to me was the discussion of the role of groups in decision-making, particularly how most corporations leave most major decisions in the hands of one or a few, when very likely they could get better decisions by including a much wider group of employees, whose wider diversity of perspectives might result in a more accurate way of seeing a problem and possible solutions. One more startling fact: 95% of money managers underperform the market. The market--with prices determined by everyone who's in the market--is simply smarter than any one manager, no matter how expert. Recommend for anyone who likes reading pop psychology/pop sociology as well as anyone who is interested in what makes the stock market work or not work, and how to improve decision-making in all kinds of groups.

50,0385721706,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2611100-rich,0,"Suroweiki engrossed me from the beginning. Though this book appears to be a collection of anecdotes about how crowds often outthink the experts, it struck me as a blueprint for how decision-makers should harness the power of people. Thus it is a treatise on smart business and marketing, good government, and sound organization management. As a U.S. Army veteran, the author propelled me to thoughts on how the military could use its people's collective wisdom, something on which I have written extensively:Nine Weeks: a teacher's education in Army Basic Training Among the most relevant claims from the book is this cogent bit of logic: ""To state the obvious, unless people know what the truth is, it's unlikely they'll make the right decisions. This means being honest about performance. It means being honest about what's not happening. It means being honest about expectations. Unfortunately, there's little evidence that this kind of sharing takes place....One of the things that gets in the way of the exchange of real information is the deep-rooted hostility on the part of bosses to opposition from subordinates. This is the real cost of a top-down approach to decision making: it confers the illusion of perfectability upon the decision makers and encourages everyone else simply to play along. What makes this especially damaging is that people in an organization already have a natural inclination to avoid conflict and potential trouble. It's remarkable, in fact, that in an autocratic organization good information ever surfaces. It's a book that anyone who has been around people should read. "
51,0385721706,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17738039-michael,4,"Overall, I ended up liking this book because I believe I learned something from it. And in truth I would recommend it to people. But a few things I didn't like came to me rather quickly. The author makes no small number of claims in this work without providing any substantive support for them. They are made as statements of fact, but in reality they are simply the author's opinions. This is rampant early on, but tails off after a few chapters. One example: ""Sometimes the messiest approach is the wisest."" Well, define wise here. And how does this statement match up with the examples given? When might it not be true? Are there case studies you can cite to back this up? These considerations were all missing. To me, it felt that the author failed to be as rigorously academic as he should have been at times. I found this to be frustrating and somewhat distracting from the message, which was interesting.And the ""perhaps"" and ""plausible"" terms used about the Challenger disaster were giant red flags; how they made it through the editing process is a mystery. There is lots of wishy-washiness out there today; this this was unnecessarily wishy-washy. That entire section felt like a waste of time.On the plus side, there is a lengthy section of notes at the end of the book; that is a nice addition. However, there aren't any references to them in the text. This means you very well may not find them until you've finished the book. (Guilty.) And that is, well, less nice. Put them at the end of each chapter in the next edition and reference them so people can find them and make them useful. "
52,0385721706,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5376698-ben-wagner,4,"The major flaw I found in the book is the way Surowiecki choses the evidence to support his major thesis. He does seem to pick and chose things that support his thesis, even taking certain events that would seem to go against his thesis and twist them around to support it. He even provides disclaimers before some anecdotes or pieces of evidence explaining how this could be taken differently, this seems to weaken his main argument by making me immediately think of the other ways a particular piece of evidence could be taken.That doesn't mean I didn't enjoy the book. I found it to be a page-turner and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience of reading the book. The book presents a fascinating thesis and works hard to support it while definitely following in the tradition of Malcolm Gladwell - who is a favorite author of mine. The contrast is the way I feel about crowd wisdom after reading the book. After reading Gladwell's books, I've been almost 100% convinced of his argument by the end. With Surowiecki I'm only 80% there. I think his thesis is fascinating but must be taken with caution. Too many of his own pieces of evidence show the way a crowd can be ignorant. Crowd Wisdom seems to be not a universal truth, but truth dependent on a variety of factors (such as diversity) that all have to be in place in order for the crowd to truly be wise. Again this is not to say I didn't enjoy the book, I most definitely did, and would recommend it to anyone interested in digital culture or even in Sociology.4 out of 5 "
53,0385721706,http://goodreads.com/user/show/976783-john,3,"This book was given to me as part of a training class at work a few years ago. At the time I only read the assigned chapters and put the book on my shelf intending to finish it at some point. Well, I got tired of looking at it and decided to finish it off once and for all.This book in its entirety didn't really hit the mark for me. While it stayed with the general theme of ""crowds are good in some cases but not others,"" the author stopped short of providing concrete recommendations on how to form or manage groups to achieve desired outcomes. In that sense, this was slightly more than a collection of stories about groups working well or not.What bothered me the most is the disregard the author has for leadership in groups. In the afterword, he basically dismisses the impact of leadership and says it is paradoxical to the concept of group work. However, in many of his examples, leaders either did have or could have had a positive impact on things without negatively influencing the process. As an example, he talks about the NASA lady in the context of the shuttle explosion and how her comments were dismissive of the possibility of damage and therefore she steered the group in the wrong direction. The author admonished her for her actions but stopped short of saying ""if you are in a similar position, you should do X,Y,and Z and avoid A, B, and C in order to have an effective group outcome.""Even despite all of the above, the book was entertaining which earned it 3 stars from me.I just don't think it was as good as the hype."
54,0385721706,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69801085-lee-kuiper,4,"What a premise for a book! Take a “diversity of opinion,” make sure those opinions are “independent” and “decentralized,” then “aggregate” them together: voilà, you’ve got super accurate intelligence. Somehow, the whole is greater than the sum of it’s parts. Fascinating.I assumed the book would crack open the non-intuitive/semi-mystical fact that intelligence arises from the myriads of the mundane—that the book itself would be a gestalt of paradigm shifting information. The first four chapters go into this exciting territory (somewhat practically) before the book sidles over into the hum-drum world of sighting various business/economical/political anecdotes and examples that prove some peripheral point of the thesis, all of which feel like filler to the original idea. It started to feel like a bait-and-switch.I continued on, hoping Surowiecki would delve deeper into the reasons behind why it works. However, long before the last chapter I stopped caring and even started forgetting why I wanted to read the book in the first place. By the last chapter I was struggling to read one page at a time. Wait, what was I reading again? The Wizard of Crowds? Or was it The Wisdom of Crows? I’m glad he wrote the book although it didn’t need to be nearly as long as it was. It should have sufficed as a 50 page article save that it wouldn’t have received the same legitimate recognition as a full-fledged book. That being said, though, this doesn’t really feel like a full-fledged book anyway.All in all, so-so. Three stars for The Wizard of Crows."
55,0385721706,http://goodreads.com/user/show/132592-matthew,4,"A conceptually very interesting book, well-researched and fluidly written. Some egs from behavioural finance will be familiar to anyone who read broadly in that field, but Suriowecki doesn't get to those till deep in, and the early egs are extremely broad-ranging and fascinating -- from locating lost submarines, to internal markets at corporations, gambling, the failure of intelligence agencies to foresee 9/11, bean counting, etc, etc -- is there no end to the questions we could potentially solve better with groups? Interesting too is the classification of problems into cognition, coordination and cooperation types. The challenge, though, is to identify why, despite all the evidence, there appear to be so many situations under which groups and crowds do not make good decisions. Here I felt it could have been more analytical - he does touch on the conditions necessary for a group to make a good decision (i) diversity (ii) decentralised and localised knowledge (iii) independence of thought (iv) ability to aggregate the diverse info and (I add) mechanism for decision-makers to take account of that aggregated info in making a decision; but more could have been written on where and why these so often fail, and where a different decision-making structure might fit better. But then that would be a business mgmt book, and this is after all straightforwardly a powerful argument for a powerful idea. "

In this well researched book he documents how, time and time again, the crowd has outperformed the experts in reaching conclusions. In the simplest of examples he shows how a crowd can best predict the weight of a pig (or the number of jelly beans in a jar) better than an expert. Any one individual will not necessarily “get it right” but the average of all the answers will. He then goes on to document far more complex situations where the wisdom that comes from the crowd can lead to better decisions. He does however acknowledge that not all crowds will lead to better decisions. Rather than leave us there, unsure when crowds are better or worse for decisions, he lays out the four conditions necessary for the “crowd” to be wise: (1) diversity of opinion; (2) independence of members from one another; (3) decentralization; and (4) a good method for aggregating opinions. Does this sound familiar? This is the hopefully the cornerstone of your organization. If not, what would it take to make your organization more collaborative in this way? And do you think it would be ""worthwhile?""Take the time to read through this book. Not only will it provide insight, it may help you as you build your work teams, and allow you to build better teams for success."
57,0385721706,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5905295-phillip,3,"Updated Review: Surowiecki has done a good job of charting the conditions under which a group of people will statistically and consistently make better choices/decisions/forecasts than even the smartest individual member(s) of the group. Given our Western fascination with experts (despite the climate of anti-intellectualism in the US) and the romantic model of the solitary genius, Surowiecki provides a compelling case for the benefits of large, diverse groups having the aggregate correct decision more often than individuals.One thing I don't necessarily care for about this book is the conservativism implicit throughout. Surowiecki spends a lengthy amount of space showing that the stock market (and by extension, capitalism) works well, and he comes down in favor of representative/liberal democracy. These are not inherently, in and of themselves, bad things, but they do represent a fundamental faith in the US/Western liberal system that Surowiecki's argument in favor of the wisdom of crowds might open to further interrogation.Original Review: An interesting book, though it seems to me that Suroweicki establishes his major point early on and then bludgeons one with evidence proving minor variations on the same theme. In my opinion, one could read the first half of the book without missing any crucial information to the argument. On the other hand, many of Suroweicki's examples are really fascinating, and are worthy of knowing even just as trivia."

Two major gripes about this book:1. I believe very few groups could ever come close to meeting the criteria for a ""wise group."" It's so unlikely that at the very best this book is a theory about only a rare situation (ie it's applicable to guessing the weight of an ox by secret ballot) or at the very worst the narrow probability invalidates the entire theory. The criteria are:Diversity of opinionEach person should have private information even if it's just an eccentric interpretation of the known facts.IndependencePeople's opinions aren't determined by the opinions of those around them.DecentralizationPeople are able to specialize and draw on local knowledge.AggregationSome mechanism exists for turning private judgments into a collective decision.The independence one is my biggest sticking point.2. The logic is faulty and contradictory. I'm too lazy to go into the details, but he frequently states in one part of the book that groups are incapable of doing X and then later presents anecdotes or studies to show the opposite. Some of the individual points were interesting by themselves but when brought together they just seemed like a grab-bag. Another reviewer posted a number of factual errors as well. I don't know how accurate that reviewer's assessment was..."
59,0385721706,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52858803-anthony,3,"Thought provoking exploration of the ""Law of Averages"" (or at least that's my take) and how it is borne out in collective ""decision"" making. Essentially, Surowiecki shows a number of examples and contexts in which seeking the greatest number of viewpoints is thought to give way to sound decision making. He explores (in no great depth) the concept of the economically ""rational individual"" and how his (or her) limited point of view is a liability to good decision making, even if that individual is ""an expert"". He posits that, almost always, seeking greater input in any sort of collective decision making endeavor will help to negate the cognitive biases/limitations of the individuals within a group via diversity of knowledge/viewpoints/experiences/etc. The limitations of group decision making efforts are also discussed, but this topic is left somewhat unresolved. To this point he touches on the obvious difficulties of coordinating the actions of large groups of people to produce a coherent ""outcome"", discusses the idea of diminishing returns in context, and ponders the inescapable fact that in a democratic society there will always be those who will not directly benefit from collective decision making. The book is at times dry and repetitive, and should probably be taken as a very general discussion of the concepts at hand. "
60,0385721706,http://goodreads.com/user/show/757661-brad,3,"I feel the same way about this book that I feel about a lot of ""pop econ"" books... interesting, but so what?Surowiecki does a fantastic job of setting up his topic in the first several chapters, and its a great read for awhile... a compelling theoretical framework (if a bit too lightweight) supported by a number of engaging examples. Then, about halfway through, I noticed that the theory had slipped away and he was just giving more and more examples. Some of them a bit more nuanced, for sure, and illustrating subtleties of his theory for sure, but it just felt a bit flat and pointless.My general complaint was really validated at the end, when he decided to tack on a few pages about how his theories could be used to reform and improve democracy. Really? In ten pages. There was actually something interesting about his point (both at the end and throughout), but the sheer lack of rigor, particularly at the end, just left me feeling like this was a not a book about an idea, but an idea for a book. Which is great for people who like to read about cute ideas, but not so great for those of us who already get the ideas, and want instead to read some great analysis.That being said, the first part of the book is incredibly well written and well worth reading."
61,0385721706,http://goodreads.com/user/show/145025-jeff-van-campen,3,"While this book is full of interesting anecdotes and research, it feels a bit thrown together.Some of the research seems to contradict his main thesis -- that groups of people are often smarter than the smartest individual among them. He seems to conclude that the only way to avoid traffic jams is to put people in smarter cars.Equally as frustrating, one of the anecdotes he uses throughout the book -- the story of the Scorpion submarine being (nearly) located by the average of several experts' predictions -- seems to be a one-off. It is a non-repeatable experiment, yet he returns to this again and again.Nevertheless, the book is worth reading for what he has to say about the best conditions for working in groups. The chapter on diversity is definitely worth reading.It's also worth finishing the book. He addressed most of the questions I had towards the end of the book. Not always to my satisfaction, but at least he acknowledged that they existed.I finished this book as a more of a skeptic about group-think that I was when I started it. If I learned anything it was that groups can make incredibly smart decisions under the right conditions, but getting it right is incredibly difficult."
62,0385721706,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1787060-ariah,4,"The Wisdom of Crowds falls into the same genre as Freakonomics and Malcolm Gladwell's books, a fascinating collection of interesting stories, studies and anecdotes toward a general premise. Surowiecki is a little more academic in writing style then the others above, but there is also a lot more information in this book then in some of the others. The basic idea is that we are smart as a group then we are individually. He's not advocating ""group think"" (one of the negative manifestations of collective decision making), but rather intentional collecting of individual decisions. An example of this is your typical ""guess the number of jelly beans"" contest. Studies show that if you take the average of all the guesses made will be closer then the vast majority of the individual answers, and closer over a series of contests then any individuals guesses.Time and again the research shows that if we can intelligently coordinate a ""crowd"", their decisions will be better then the ""experts"" every time. Surowiecki gives examples from all over and discusses things like the stock market, traffic patterns, CEOs, and sports. If you've read any of Malcolm Gladwell or Freakonomics, you'll definitely enjoy The Wisdom of Crowds."

The book, as he writes in his acknowledgments, ""is partly about the difference between a society and just a bunch of people living next to each other"" (p. 274)--a concept at the heart of all successful collaboration. His observations in his introduction lead us through a brief survey of those who have disparaged the ability of groups (crowds) to produce any signs of intelligent decision-making--Charles Mackay (""Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds""), Gustave le Bon (""The Crowd: A Study of the Popular Mind""), and others--then guide us to his well documented premise: ""…under the right circumstances, groups are remarkably intelligent, and are often smarter than the smartest people in them"" (p. xiii). The result is an entertaining, engaging, and convincing argument for collaboration involving people from exactly the same kind of widely diverse backgrounds that Frans Johansson promotes in ""The Medici Effect,"" and leaves us little room to doubt the power, efficacy, and attractiveness of what collaboration can produce."

The point Surowiecki tries to make is in certain condition, decision made by a group of people can be better than the same decision made by an expert or a group of expert. This sounds contradict to our conventional wisdom that experts are better but the author puts his case convincingly.However, the tricky part is to get the right condition, which proves, by the author, to be difficult and in many cases uncontrollable. The author then uses a large part of the book to demonstrate if the condition is not correct, the crowds can make some pretty bad decisions.This is not a how to book and you won’t find any framework or method to tell you how to leverage the wisdom of the crowds but by finishing this book, you should have better judgement on different situations that whether wisdom of crowd will success or not. This book is so comprehensive and full of contradictions (in a good way) that hasn’t had a summary at the end makes it difficult for the readers to consolidate all the points being examined.

65,0385721706,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3677821-pete,4,"The Wisdom of the Crowds (2004) by James Surowiecki is a book so well known that reading the book can give a sensation of deja vu. The book describes how many people making independent choices can make predictions and perform many calculations dramatically better than individuals or experts can. The book goes over how independent, bottom up decision making often has the edge on a top down style.Surowiecki, who is the financial columnist for the New Yorker, goes over some remarkable successes of the wisdom of the crowds in betting, guessing the number of items in a container, locating sunk submarines and of course, in allocating resources. There is also a really interesting chapter on how small committees are often the opposite of a wise crowd because people don’t really make their own decisions and then compare and add knowledge but instead simply agree with the most influential or talkative member of the group. Surowiecki puts forward the idea that prediction markets are a very good idea and should be used for intelligence gathering. The betting markets that do very well for political prediction are also briefly discussed. Some of the points are obvious but it’s still worth going over them. The book is written very well and it’s a fun and informative read."

The classic example is asking a group to guess the number of jellybeans in a jar--the group's average guess will consistently be better than any one group member's guess. Surowiecki, who writes for the The New Yorker, takes this model and applies it to areas like financial and decision markets, business strategy, and traffic patterns to show how group decisions are often better than an expert's. A fascinating and easy read--read it if you enjoyed

67,0385721706,http://goodreads.com/user/show/811989-douglas-summers-stay,4,"I was wondering whether an organization could somehow harness the intelligence of everyone involved to act as if it were superintelligent: more intelligent than any individual in the group. This book shows examples of limited domains where that can happen, and talks about how to structure your organization to take advantage of this effect. It would be better if he shared more than anecdotal data: he repeatedly makes a big deal of one successful location of a submarine by this method, but that could have been luck.What I have never seen is a novel written by a collaboration that is better than either of the authors could have produced individually. Certainly a novel produced like Wikipedia would be an absolute mess stylistically. I suppose you could outsource some of the research for an historical science fiction novel, and get greater realism than if it all had to be done by an individual (for example 1632), but realism doesn't necessarily translate into better writing. I know collaborations on movie scripts are at least occasionally successful, but I wouldn't say they are superior to those produced by individuals."
68,0385721706,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4923399-annemieke-windt,4,"While reading The Wisdom of Crowds I sometimes wondered, how would James Surowiecki write this book now. It's clearly a book written shortly after the dotcom bubble burst in 2000. Since then we saw that bankruptcy of the bonus system, the crashing of the mortgage market and the way social media influence our view on the world.It's an intruiging book, Surowiecki makes a clear cases why when it comes down to making decision, many know more than few. It's not about the many responding to eachother, but averaging everyone's individual opinion usually brings about a correct answer. That's why teams work, but only if they are assembled of people with different points of view and why open markets usually come to prices that reflect the value of a product. It's not about trying to get rid of different points of view to come to some bland decision. It's about looking at topics and problems for various points of view, taking them into account and come up with a correct answer. Again he proves why bonuses don't work, why CEO's are more likely to fail than to succeed and why we need a diversity of opinions and dialogue."
69,0385721706,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2006699-tariq-mahmood,4,"I guess the book achieves most of what it sets out to do. It managed to convince me of this dark art where a crowd of people working together, with something to loose, are able to somehow come up with the right solution again and again. But this is certainly not a foolproof discovery, as some crowds like the financial markets can get it completely wrong. That is the bit I didn't quite get from this reading. What is the difference between an effective and a failing group. One suggestion was given as peer pressure, so this is choosing an option in hope of being accepted by the majority in the crowd instead of voicing your own impulsive opinion without fear of any recrimination. Coming from Pakistani culture I can relate to many instances where agreements are reached because of either peers or a bullish boss or some thuggish personality in the particular group instead of individual impulsive thought streams. Again, the human animal has managed to ride the roost in the animal kingdom due to their ability to work and live together. I guess this book highlights this basic atavistic feature in all of us."
70,0385721706,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4771466-john-martindale,5,"A wonderful book showing the importance of a diversity of opinions. It cuts hard against the liberal progressives intentions of the few elite controlling the economy, education, government and even peoples personal lives. Experts are far to often cocksure and over-confident, but their being right is far more governed by luck/randomness then by skill. Its incredibly unwise putting to much responsibility and control into the hands of the few, if only democrats could figure this out. Now of course Crowds are not smarter if there is not diversity of opinions and freedom of thought, and though Surowiecki didn't speak much concerning education, it is one area where i am most concerned. For I fear the way it is now, education for the most part tries to make everyone fit a certain mold and discourages diversity of opinions and is doing a pretty good job at this.But yeah, Surowiecki had several reflections concerning the wisdom of crowds. It was a very interesting book. I liked his critique of the science community, reflections on when the crowds is unwise and fun things like why there are traffic jams and what might be done to prevent them. "
71,0385721706,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7962894-koen,1,"This is one of those books that actually manage to make people dumber.Proposing a woozy hypothesis like ‘wisdom of crowds’ for something that is done away with taking into account simple statistics like regression to the mean. Larger numbers of semi-random guesses mean less influence by the extreme guesses. That and a rather dodgy and obvious selectiveness in choosing long spun anecdotes. Once your realize this, the book becomes a progressively more frustrating read.Much like Malcolm Gladwell this will be the perfect read for those one book people who love to postulate the same theory at parties over and over again to convince the less literate that they’re erudite and fist bumping the latest social and economic theories. At least Gladwell has the sense not to give an example in his first chapter that completely takes the wind out of his theories, like this book does with claiming crowd wisdom in a completely random computer process. And finally, it takes a certain kind of balls to refer in your title to The Madness of Crowds, a more than a century old classic that proposes the opposite thesis, and not mention it at all."
72,0385721706,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33835199-ngee-poo,4,"The book raised a very interesting point of view - that crowds would in general do a better job of deciding things, given specific sets of circumstances.There were a few points that I felt I didn't agree with though. For instance, examples of choosing restaurants and choosing tech gadgets without influence from others, which I personally believe is not the case given that I do think some people choose to patronize certain restaurants by virtue of the fact that the queue is long and hence seen as more delectable. Also, regarding cinema operators, I do think the 'irrationality' of pricing should have included at least some analysis of game theory in play here. Cinema operators provided by and large commoditized services. I'm not going to be paying substantially more to watch Lord of the Rings in 1 cinema over the other, although of course there are several factors in play (e.g. geographical location/convenience). If cinema operators were to start adjusting their prices, the likelihood is that other operators would also follow suit. This could very well be a big reason behind why cinema operators don't adjust ticket prices according to demand."

I would not say it was flawless - it relies heavily on anecdotes and studies that the author glosses. I find these flaws relatively minor for a number of reasons, not least of which is that the author is truly going against the grain and will therefore struggle to find loads of research supporting this particular thesis. However, in going against the grain, I think the author could've done more to support his thesis with more in-depth studies, statistics, and analysis (similar to Daniel Kahneman's 'Thinking Fast and Slow,' which, while written in a similarly-colloquial style, offered a lot of rather-more-detailed summary of his (and others') research within the book itself).So overall, great effort, wonderful thesis, but could've done with a bit more intellectual rigor in the execution (n.b.: I have not finished reading the extensive 'Notes,' which may lead me to amend my view of the text; however, I tend not to judge a book by its footnotes/endnotes over the text itself)."
74,0385721706,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1186478-tyner-wilson,3,"This book is about an idea. This idea is presented in a fascinating and compelling manner.I have one criticism of the idea. Crowds can only be wise if they meet four conditions (diversity, aggregation, independence, decentralization). However, these conditions are defined loosely enough that the reader is at a loss when trying to test this idea in any practical and systematic way. Is my group diverse enough? Are they sufficiently independent? Without more clear guidelines, the ability to test is heavily compromised, so we are forced to take too much on faith from the author.I also have one criticism of the book. The first half is meant to present the ideas, and the second half is meant to present case studies. However, the first half has enough case studies included for the whole book. The second half becomes entirely redundant. The book starts off as a satisfying deluge of fresh ideas; but in the second half reduces to a trickle of redundancy. Do yourself a favor and stop after section 1."
75,0385721706,http://goodreads.com/user/show/291844-jill,2,"The problem with the Wisdom of Crowds is that it tries to make its point - that groups are smarter than even the smartest individual within them - in a meandering book of 335 pages, when it could have done so in 30:1. Groups are smart. 2. They manage to coordinate their actions in complex situations and collaborate, even if individuals are acting in self-interest. Culture and ""prosocial behaviour"" help ensure this. 3. You just have to ensure that group members are diverse and are able to make decisions independently.These are essentially the points that Surowiecki is trying to make - in various guises - across 12 chapters. The rest is just padding up with various examples, some more interesting than others. Don't get me wrong, it's not an entirely bad read. Surowiecki makes a convincing case, and some of the anecdotes, like the IEM and Scorpion examples are fascinating. But Surowiecki might have done better to have made his case in a New Yorker column or two, rather than a full blown book. "
76,0385721706,http://goodreads.com/user/show/478700-kylie-sparks,3,"This book was not a very exciting read, and I think would have been better as a magazine article, but I'm glad I read it anyway because it did give me some ideas for how groups can make better decisions. Surowiecki says that given the right conditions a group will make better decisions than any individual in that group. The conditions are: diversity of opinion, independence of the members from each other, decentralization; and some way to aggregate individual's opinions in the group. When groups make bad decisions, one of these conditions hasn't been met. If I'm ever a manager I will solicit employee's input by email prior to having a group meeting. Because once you are in the group, various factors make it unlikely that you will hear everyone's opinion, or really be able to evaluate the different information each individual has to offer. But it is critically important for an organization to be making decisions based on the collective wisdom of the group. I think all managers should at least skim this book."
77,0385721706,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41416768-eugene-kernes,5,"The book presents conditions that can make a crowd wiser than the sum of its part. The three requirements are diversity, independence, and decentralized system with an aggregation center. This books utilizes tools from economics, game theory, sociology, and politics which creates a very powerful explanation of how the Wisdom of Crowds can be applied. The major benefit of the book is the fact that the author does not just focus on one particular side of the Wisdom of Crowds as the Author explains how and when the Wisdom of Crowds works, and when it does not. Providing multiple sides makes the book more credible by signaling that it was well thought out and researched. Although the book is very eloquently written, the downside is that during the explanation of various parts that make the Wisdom of Crowds work, there is not much depth of the system. The examples are not given enough time to connect to the Wisdom of Crowds. It would have been better to write a slightly longer book and keep to some example to insure that the value of the system is understood. "

Parts of the book seem to ramble on a fair bit.At one point the author tries to argue with how the ""crowd"" determined that it wouldn't be a good idea to use ""crowd"" wisdom for predicting geopolitical events in the Middle East. If your premise is that the ""crowd"" is wise, how do you argue that point when the ""crowd"" says that it isn't wise. The author seems to claim that when crowds are wrong they are likely falling victim to group think. In that case, it'd be impossible to know a priori if a crowd is making an independent prediction or a group think prediction. So the prediction is useless.Still, it is an interesting book with some powerful insights. Several good points on how groups manipulate themselves."

The author gives plethora of examples from the obvious Stock markets to space exploration, from elections to fashion, in a wholesome argument on how, when and when not to depend on the masses for insight.... enough said, this is the subject of the future.

80,0385721706,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16070335-bo,4,"An enjoyable read. The authors argue that decisions aggregated from a group are often more accurate than those made by any one individual. A critical component for this ""wisdom of crowds"" come from the need to have diversity, independence, decentralization (i.e. a bottom-up versus a top-down approach to management, which can foster diversity and facilitates coordination), and aggregation. This enables orthogonal decision making, allowing for additivity from diverse sources of information while canceling out errors. Unless the decisions are independent, group decisions can be poor due to situations such as conformity, social proof, and information cascade. In the second half of the book (a little too wordy and loses focus at times), the author goes on to discuss implications of crowd decision making in traffic jams, scientific research, committees, corporate structure, financial markets, and democracy."

Numerous examples are provided, from guessing the number of jellybeans in a jar, to playing the stock market which, BTW, is not a good indicator of what we know - but Surowiecki tells us this and explains why. Along the way he discusses such phenomena from nature as monkeys who will trade a pebble for a cucumber slice - until they see a fellow get a grape for a pebble - and starlings who use a particular flight formation to protect themselves from predators. Also a macaque named Imo changes her society when she washes her food before eating it, among other innovations. The author uses these examples to illustrate how humans react to various situations. His ideas have implications in many areas, including politics and management in business, and he suggests how the dynamic works in these areas."

I found particularly informative a bunch of psychological and sociological experiments on crowd behaviour, as well as a precious analysis of what makes the crowd complexively smarter rather than dumber.Surowiecki deals well with market mechanisms; the collective decision-making leap in politics is daunting and much more complicated, but it is waiting for us ahead. I think this book makes an important contribution in that direction, it sheds some light on the positive outcome of collective behaviour. Tellingly, the crowd which makes better decisions isn't guided by groupthink: it is rather a collection of diverse, autonomously thinking individuals, who get to the best overall action/prediction by acting upon their distinctive informative edges. An indirect praise to the importance of critical thinking and of authentic, responsible sharing of knowledge."
83,0385721706,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3436890-dennis-boccippio,2,"Interesting premise; tedious, shallow and meandering execution. Surowiecki explores a number of promising leads but doesn't really close the deal on any of them. Too many anecdotes and related conclusions are left as fiat, without real exploration, exposition or more importantly credible documentation that the author's conclusions are merited by the studies he cites. Worse, every conclusion is promptly followed by a laundry list of caveats and counter-cases. Since the author does not truly develop an organizing theory or tightly woven explanatory narrative (leaving his only attempt to do so until literally the last several pages), the reader ends up being subjected to a barrage of interesting, but often contradictory, just-so stories. The end result is more frustrating than enjoyable or enriching."

Surowiecki's conceptualization of the ""wisdom of crowds"" without any sort of theorizing of power or the constructed systems of power - as well as his fetishism towards the market as an analogue and representative of the said ""wisdom"" - is not only lacking in analysis, but ultimately, fundamentally dangerous when trying to offer a prescription for the fundamental character of democracy. If I wanted to read about how the (unwashed) ""masses,"" in aggregate, can maybe reveal objective truths in this ""game of politics"" then I could have just looked at YouTube comments all day and saved myself the $9.50 that I spent on this book.

Instead, go look at the predictions markets, where folks can bet on almost anything. In particular, Google ""intrade"" and see how the betting is going on there. It's run out of Dublin, Ireland - where a whole Lot of betting must be legal - though most of the action, on events of interest to you, will be Americans placing bets, by using there computers."

This is like saying a goalie failed to stop all of the opposing team's goals. If we'd anticipated them, they wouldn't have been attacks.Look at me.

87,0385721706,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1301416-vincent,4,"Surowiecki describes several economic/psychological/sociological experiments and anecdotes which demonstrate that given the right conditions, groups can be wiser than experts. My only complaint is that he treats ""economic rationality"" in an unnecessarily narrow sense; i.e., the maximization of dollars. This gives the impression that when people behave in a way that doesn't increase dollar wealth, then economists regard them as behaving ""irrationally"" and therefore cannot predict their behavior. Problem is, economists define ""rationality"" as the maximization of utility--which includes dollar wealth, but also includes other kinds of emotional or mental wealth. I had the impression that he wasn't giving economists credit for recognizing that money isn't the meaning of life."

However, this turned out to be a well-detailed, well-organized, carefully constructed argument detailing exactly which problems and conditions are not just well answered but best answered by crowds. The author does not simply explain away counterexamples either, but shows how the theory predicts such behavior when the necessary conditions are not met. It may not really be a 4-star book, but it ended up being so much more than I expected (a 1- or 2-star book). Very educational, and not a bad read for information theory."

But it is not always the case, as highlighted in the intelligence failure of the 9/11 tragic episode and numerous others. It is interesting to note too, no matter whether it is a mere coincidence or not, that the evolution of the web in itself models after the participation of the masses as the key content provider and maker...something that perhaps the book has not been able to foretold, but is in fact a parallel phenomena indeed!"

The crowd might be right most of the time but it doesn't mean it will act responsibly!This definitely made me think and therefore deserves a re-read."

I remember something about a big cow at a 4-H show, a big jar of gum balls, and the stock market. This was an intelligent and interesting book, but I remember now precious little of it. So sorry.

It does however sounds like he argues that large group make better decisions, not true ones, but if he starts arguing that we get better leaders or something in that direction, he might be in trouble with the ad populum argument.

Perhaps I'm naturally skeptical, but the book left me doing a lot of further research about some of the experiments that were mentioned.That said, if you're interested in sociology and how groups work, it seems like a good stepping stone to further reading material and there are plenty of references to check out in the appendix."

The better way is to send everyone out to collect data and share it ""rock, scissors, paper"" style to see what wins.

114,0385721706,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22843903-oscar-romero,5,"An awesome reading about the many, many studies about how and when it is wise to use the crowds to make decisions and why. Quite interesting to read these facts which can only help us make better decisions and who knows? Maybe it will help us too, to be aware about the tremendous body of knowledge we are sometimes oblivious to.Strongly recommend it to everyone--especially those who think that only smart people should run the boat....like I used to think."
115,0385721706,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8338823-diana,4,"Best non-fiction book I have read in awhile.The book covers three types of problems -- cognition, cooperation, and coordination -- and talks about how groups can solve them efficiently, often more so than individuals. The key elements are diversity and independence, which are explained and qualified throughout the book.Really interesting insight into group mechanics and how to harness a group for efficiency rather than suffer the consequences of groupthink."
116,0385721706,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9154-arjun,4,"I really got into this book. Information aggregation is at once an issue that has been studied for hundreds of years (Condorcet Jury Theorem) yet is still ripe for innovation. Read this, Sunstein's ""Infotopia"" and work on Prediction Markets by Justin Wolfers. Also, the psych lit on group decision making once you're done with the normative foundations. "
117,0385721706,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61537-mel,4,"So so interesting! Brings together statistics, sociology and psychology of choices to bear light on the bigger picture. Will really make you think differently about everyday choices you make and see... I love this stuff! Half the book is composed of examples, which you may or may not find interesting."
118,0385721706,http://goodreads.com/user/show/336473-michael,4,I heard this book was influential to a number of technology leaders so I decided to check it out. It was interesting and contained a lot of good examples on how the wisdom of teams and groups of people can lead to good decisions if harnessed correctly. Especially interesting was the part about market based decision making.
119,0385721706,http://goodreads.com/user/show/524412-dan,2,"This book was interesting. I went in a skeptic, and came out the same. It is remarkable how insightful a group of individual people can be when their collective ideas are brought together (by a third party). However, it still remains that a group of people making a decision together more often than not get it very wrong."

It suggests that the group is more often correct than the individual. Lest it prompt too many to jump off a cliff collectively, it also suggests how groups can function well so as to actually move forward with wisdom. "
