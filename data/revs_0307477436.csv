In summary, this book is about how humans and animals live, die, evolve, get sick, heal in their natural settings plus a plethora of interesting other topics. Highly recommend to anyone interested in medicine, science, animals, public health, and one health 10/10The Good: This book is written so, so well. There is a lot of information in it and definitely fact dense, but it doesn't read dry or heavy at all. The author does an incredible job synthesizing facts and interesting stories and anecdotes making this book interesting and engaging throughout. Zoobiquity is a term coined by the author and it basically means having a comparative approach to medicine and disease. As doctors, we tend to get pigeonholed by our cases and own individual experience. This book is basically stating that if human MDs, public health experts, veterinarians, and other experts in given fields all work together then we will have a better knowledge and understanding of different diseases. I found this quote really summarized the heart of this book and concept:“Our essential connection with animals is ancient, and it runs deep. It extends from body to behavior, from psychology to society—forming the basis of our daily journey of survival. This calls for physicians and patients to think beyond the human bedside to barnyards, jungles, oceans, and skies. Because the fate of our world’s health doesn’t depend solely on how we humans fare. Rather it will be determined by how all the patients on the planet live, grow, get sick, and heal.” Though I loved every chapter my favorites were Roar-gasm (yes, all about sex), Scared to Death, and Fat Planet.The Bad: I wish it was longer!!! Disclaimer, I am a veterinarian so I loved everything about this book. Many of the topics presented in this I use every single day as a zoo/aquatic vet and I find it interesting how novel many of these theories are to human MDs. A bit frustrating that vets have had this zoobiquitous philosophy and comparative approach forever, yet people seem to respect it much more when it comes from human MDs. You need to be interested in these topics and/or a fan of non-fiction to enjoy this read.Favorite/Intersting Quotes:“When women buy a box of plastic ovulation-predictor sticks, they are purchasing fertility-detection technology that a stallion’s nostrils can provide for free.” “In a world where no creatures are truly isolated and diseases spread around as fast as jets can fly, we are all canaries and the entire planet is our coal mine. Any species can be a sentinel of danger, but only if the widest array of healthcare professionals is paying attention.”“Preventive medicine isn’t just for people. Keeping animals healthy ultimately helps keep humans healthy.” “Of course, all animals have different things to learn while traversing the arc that takes them from sexually immature, vulnerable child to reproductively capable, developed adult. In our case, those include advanced language skills and critical thinking. But there’s one feature that defines adolescence in species from condors to capuchin monkeys to college freshmen. It’s a time when they learn by taking risks and sometimes making mistakes...Modern parents can take comfort from the fact that most of our teenagers come through adolescence, too- perhaps a little bruised, maybe a little humiliated, but stronger for the journey.”“One thing you can say about meals in the wild: they’re never boring. Every bite requires a life-or-death focus on two things: getting food and avoiding becoming food. If an animal cannot find and secure consistent meals, he will die of starvation. If he’s not vigilant, he will fall to predation. In nature, eating is drenched with danger, risk taking, stress, and fear.” “So certain were experts that neonates felt no pain that through the mid-1980s major surgeries on newborn babies were sometimes performed without anesthesia. These included major cardiovascular procedures requiring prying open rib cages, puncturing lungs, and tying off major arteries. Though provided with no pharmacologic agents to blunt the pain that cracking ribs or cutting through the sternum might have induced, babies were given powerful agents to induce paralysis—ensuring an immobile (and undoubtedly terrified) patient on whom to operate. Jill Lawson’s remarkable story of her premature son, Jeffrey, and his unanesthetized heart surgery provides a heartbreaking account of such a procedure. After Jeffrey’s death in 1985, Lawson’s campaign to educate the medical profession about the need to treat pain in the young literally changed the field. And likely led to improved awareness of pain in animals, too. bA technique called clicker training pairs a metallic tick-tock! with a food treat every time the animal performs a desired behavior. Eventually the animal comes to associate the sound of the clicker with the feel-good neurochemical rewards of the food. When the treat is discontinued, the animal will continue doing the behavior, because”"

She's acting like she discovered something new & then leaves an incorrect impression about how & when animal & human medicine diverged so much. It's really a topic worthy of discussion in this book & I hope she gives it more time. If she doesn't, I won't be finishing the book. As it is, most of her examples are fairly ridiculous so far. Well read, though.The book has gotten better, but I'm reeling. I've known quite a few doctors & vets. The best often explained things to us in terms of animals & vice versa. My uncle & a couple of other vets used to fix up people as needed. We've always swapped medicines with our animals. Anyone who has raised animals & kids knows there's a lot of similarities both physically & psychologically. I read synopsis of a lot of scientific animal studies, so it's quite daunting to listen to this highly trained doctor admit to this level of ignorance.She confesses to being cloistered from the real world as a top cardiologist & psychiatrist. She points out & admits to the snobbery of the medical community, how the 'top' doctors like neurosurgeons look down on mere vets even though it's tougher to get into vet school. She also correctly points out that vets look down on human doctors since they merely work on one species of animal, one that can usually talk, but similarities between species is all news to her! That's some ivory tower she's been living in. It's scary. Update: I tried, but the woman is just too divorced from reality. I guess that's what comes of devoting yourself to as much study as she has & growing up without any pets. It's just too much to bear, though. You'd think she'd realize how much she owes to animal studies already, but she seems clueless. How a heart surgeon could be is beyond me. I don't know what crazy theories they teach in shrink school now, but again, you'd think she'd realize people have animal urges & didn't emerge as from the caves very long ago by evolutionary standards. She really needs to go live on a farm for a few years. "
2,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1889783-emily,2,"This book was good enough, but could have been so much better. The overall theme is that there are significant parallels between human and animal health that have been overlooked due to the bifurcation of human and veterinary medicine; this is explored through chapters on problems like cancer, substance abuse, heart ailments, and self-harm. It turns out that some recent ""discoveries"" in human health have long been known, analogously, by vets; so we should look for more connections to improve health for members of every species. So far, so good. The book was written by a doctor collaborating with a science journalist, and the dumbed-down additions to the text stand out so much they may as well have been printed in a different color: ""In other words, a common genetic 'blueprint' instructed the embryos of Shamu, Secretariat, and Kate Middleton to grow different, yet homologous, limbs: steering flippers, thundering hooves, and regal, waving arms."" I probably don't need to quote the sentence that came before to make it obvious that this gloss is unnecessary for comprehension. Now multiply that across the entire book. And yet, the paragraphs that I assume were written by the doctor are perfectly pleasant to read and don't require this kind of dressing up, unless you assume the audience consists of recalcitrant 10th graders.I'm not entirely sure this book deserves to be damned with two stars instead of three, or my ""magazine-article-as-book"" tag. The central thesis is worthwhile and lots of the examples are interesting. But the presentation borders on Natalie-Angier-ish and the examples pile up in a way that tells you more about horses or koalas than the developing field of ""one health."" It did make me impatient and seemed less thoughtful than Spillover, which deals with similar material."
3,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68583290-jamie,4,"Life is high school: there are jocks and nerds and stoners along a carefully graduated and strictly maintained social order. It is true in medicine as well. At the top are the brain and cardiac surgeons, and at the bottom the Family Practice physicians (note that the hierarchy has nothing to do with who actually saves more lives). And veterinarians? Please, the average doctor would just as soon consult a Ouija board. This is unfortunate because, as Zoobiquity shows, human doctors could learn a lot from their veterinary colleagues. The amount of overlap between humans and other kinds of animals is considerable and results in some illuminating observations about psychology, etiology, and evolutionary biology.The author is a cardiologist who also consults at the Los Angeles zoo, so she has seen plenty of cases of convergent behavior and illness, and each chapter of the book covers a different broad category, such as sex, addiction, virology, and psychological conditions like self-harm. Each is illuminated with case studies showing a gradient of behavior that stretches across the animal kingdom, in which humankind is simply one data point on the continuum. In addition, some behaviors which are considered pathological in humans have clear evolutionary roots that were at one time successful survival strategies (successful in the sense that they allowed the animal to live long enough to reproduce and pass along the genes for the behavior). The chapter on addiction starts with her describing the drug safe in her office, an elaborate contraption of timers and passwords where access to each different type of drug is isolated from the others. It is designed, of course, to prevent theft by doctors and nurses struggling with their own demons. The most insightful parts of the chapter deal with what we have learned from animals about addiction as reward/relief, and how that can point us toward more humane and effective treatments.Substance abusers can learn healthy behaviors that provide the same (albeit less potent) good feelings they used to seek from a bottle, a pill, or a needle. In fact, that may be what makes some rehab programs so effective for certain addicts. If you look at the behaviors these program encourage – socializing, companionship, anticipation, planning, and purpose – they’re all part of an ancient, calibrated system that doles out internal neurochemical rewards. (p. 109)The chapter on self-harm sees it as a troubling manifestation on the far end of what started out as grooming behavior, similar to addiction in its anticipation/reward/release cycle.Release … and relief – those are the same reasons cutters give for why they cut. The same intensity and promise of sudden relief we might get from pulling a single strand of hair or picking a pimple, dialed way, way up, leads cutters to carve lines in their skin with razor blades. If we accept that this behavior is on the same spectrum as less destructive forms of grooming, as my veterinarian colleagues would suggest, then self-mutilation is truly grooming gone wild. (p. 168)The book is full of observations, anecdotes, and case studies that make the reader pause and think about his or her own behaviors that are usually so automatic they are rarely examined for any deeper psychological or evolutionary meaning. We can learn a lot from seeing how our animal cousins behave, and human doctors could benefit from spending more time talking to veterinarians about commonalities among their patients."
4,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92397-brittany,4,"I honestly cannot think of anyone who wouldn't benefit from reading this book. Natterson-Horowitz is a doctor who was asked to do cardiovascular surgery on a tamarin. While trying to ""reassure"" the monkey pre-surgery, she learned about the risks of a condition called capture myopathy found in animals. She's shocked to find this condition, well-studied among vets, bears a striking resemblance to an emerging heart condition in humans. This gets her thinking: What else do vets know all about that could help humans? The answer, it turns out, is quite a lot.With the help of a science journalist, Natterson-Horowitz has created a compulsively readable, entertaining, and enlightening book about the intersection of human and non-human medicine. She has fascinating chapters on cardiology, cancer, sex, addiction, fear, obesity, mental illness, sexually transmitted diseases, and adolescence. She finds endless unexpected corollaries and begins to ask how studying these issues in animals could teach us more about humans. The results, as I mentioned, are riveting. The information she so smoothly conveys opens up all source of captivating ideas, questions, and avenues for investigation and collaboration. The only (small) flaw with this book was her obsession with coming up with new terms. ""Zoobiquity"" for instance, which I'm not sure is really going to catch on) or a syndrome called F.R.A.D.E. which stands for ""fear/restraint associated death events"" and is more than a little forced. I don't know, perhaps all doctors do that. Regardless, it's a tiny flaw, and I suspect many of my friends and relatives will be receiving this book as a gift. "

I am so glad I finally picked it up.This is an engaging look at how medical doctors confer with veterinarians (which doesn't happen as often as it should). The chapters are divided into various ailments and diseases and the connections made sense. It seems the tides are turning and these doctors confer more and more. If you love animals and our connection to their world, I definitely recommend this one."

11,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4563036-pia,5,"Zoobiquity is a surprisingly well-referenced, knowledgeable pop-science book (some of you will know it's hard to find these!) which deals with the concept of human animal, and other animal medicine. It essentially says that the human medical world would be vastly improved and probably a great deal more efficient in certain areas, if medical doctors trained only in the human body let go of their condescending bias towards veterinarians (which is a generalisation, but can be frankly seen throughout the world), and actually collaborated with them, sharing knowledge and wisdom.This is established in two ways. First, the authors explore just how much we share in common with animals. From extended adolescence and risk-taking behaviour to zoonoses. It explores the concept that many diseases in the world are not just found in humans, but also animals, and aside from ticks and rabies, these include cancer, certain heart diseases, mental illnesses such as compulsion disorders, binge eating, anorexia, self-injury, as well as STDs and other illnesses. Not only that, but it explores that many animals - from spiders to ungulates - find masturbation enjoyable, a great deal of animals experience the chemical phenomenon known as orgasm, many have sex for pleasure (not just the myth of the dolphin and the pig, which is ridiculous). The second way this is established is to explore specific case studies where human doctor interaction would have - or has actually been - vastly improved by interaction with veterinarians. This includes the fact that the West Nile Virus outbreak in the USA in the late 1990s could have been identified far earlier if the CDC had listened to a veterinarian who specialised in birds and had identified a flavivirus there (the CDC later revised their position and manuals to include a zoonotic department as a result of this). It also includes the fact that relatively recently doctors identified stress-triggered heart failure, and called it 'takotsuba syndrome,' when in fact this condition is probably what has been known as 'capture myopathy' amongst veterinarians for decades. Time and time again, the book demonstrates that human beings are directly influenced in matters of health beneficially, when human doctors collaborate with animal doctors. One of the things I found interesting and thought-provoking as someone with mental illness, was how the book found examples of a great spectrum of mental illness out in the wild. How, in some cases, it wasn't even pathological. And the author makes a speculative position that some mental illnesses may be natural survival behaviours spun out of control. This united a lot of things about the animal kingdom I've picked up over the years, but with a refreshing philosophical stance that human animals really just are on the same level as our other animal cousins and relatives; and the sooner we realise that, the sooner our health will reap the tangible benefits. I found the book well-organised, with a lot of flow between chapter content. The chapters themselves covered a lot of different animal examples, researchers, and theories without necessarily seeming cluttered, incoherent or disorganised. A few times in the book an idea or hypothesis was hinted at, but then forgotten and abandoned. But given how much actual knowledge was being imparted in a pop-science format, I find this easily forgiveable. There are going to be points where the pop-science writing is jarring. There were a few times where I thought 'I've read contradicting, solid science in this area from peer-reviewed sources and I suspect this may be wrong or outdated,' but I tend to evaluate popular science within the category of popular science (i.e. this is not a peer reviewed academic article spouting jargon left, right and centre); so for that, I can only give this book five stars (closer to four and a half, but Goodreads doesn't distinguish). The actual style of the writing itself was engaging. It struck me as fair, it tried to avoid being too generalistic, it wasn't proscriptive or didactic, letting a lot of the case studies speak for themselves. The collaboration between these two authors was a success, tonally and in terms of information imparted. And though it may not be likely, I hope they find reason to work together again, since the results are eminently enjoyable and educational at the same time."
12,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8336045-susan,5,"I'm really enjoying this book. ""Zoobiquity: What Animals Can Teach Us About Health and the Science of Healing"" provides a novel perspective on understanding human disease and health by looking at similarities and differences found in animals, both domestic and wild (and even dragonflies -- is that a bug?). The book also looks at the evolution of health and disease dating back to the time of the dinosaurs. Also, the authors also nicely dives into mental health issues ""across species"" which I found really interesting. I particularly enjoyed the chapters ""Fat Planet,"" ""Leaving The Nest,"" ""Grooming Gone Wild"", and ""Zoobiquity."" I've read plenty about the West Nile Virus when it infected people here in the US a few years ago and actually knew someone who was diagnosed with it. But I particularly appreciated the story about a veterinarian's role behind its accurate identification on North American soil in the last chapter. Had no idea. This story (and the whole book) made the picture of public and personal health in my mind look a whole lot broader. Not to mention the health of my beloved pets! Despite being a very scientific book, the personal anecdotes infused with a sense of humor keeps it a very entertaining read. "

While we have a history of using animals in our research (medical, pharmacological, beauty), doctors have not tended to be open to veterinarian medicine and animal studies as a way to learn about or gain insight into human biology.Horowitz et al are looking to change that. She goes into various animal situations/conditions and likens them to human conditions. For example, what can we learn about the transmission of human STDs from koala bears with chlamydia (an unfortunate epidemic) or about cutting from parrots to pluck themselves until they are bald of feathers?Very interesting - I found myself sharing tidbits from the book everytime I picked it up."

Written by a cardiologist and a science writer, carefully documented, and informed by veterinarians and wildlife biologists, this book brings it all together - and encourages a One Health approach, where physicians for ALL species can learn from each other, to the benefit of all. WHO KNEW that animals had similar problems with addictions, mental health, heart problems, STDs, and obesity? Unfortunately, the arrogance of the human medical community has delayed our understanding of so many of our health problems - but now there's no excuse.

18,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18673428-johan-haneveld,4,"Usually I'm not that much of a career enthusiast that I start to read books in my free time that have to do with my profession. I usually keep work and the rest of my life separated. However, I chose my job as the editor of the Dutch veterinary journal for a reason, and that is that I am quite interested in biology, love animals, love studying their ways of life, and their diversity. I am still a bit sad that I did not study biology in college. But I did study biomedical sciences! And I did that because I am interested in the way the human body works as well, and how DNA, cel machinery and the environment come together to determine human health and sickness. So to read something that brings these interests together (there's even mention of dinosaurs and fish in the book) was enticing in the end. At my work I have read (and written) a lot about 'one health'- the idea that there's not much difference between human beings and animals, they inhabit a single ecosystem, and micro-organisms don't differentiate between them as hosts. As the Q-fever epidemy showed, the health of e.g. goats cannot be separated from the health of the people living around the farms where the goats are kept. The author of this book proposes to take the concept one step further: zoobiquity is her neologism. She uses this term to describe a approach that to understand etiology of illnesses in humans, looks at animals -not laboratory animals, but animals in their natural habitat. For these animals have eating disorders just as we do, they develop addictions, they get fat in certain circumstances, they develop stereotypical behaviour and damage themselves. Understanding the factors involved in these behaviours in animals helps us to understand why people show these behaviours. The main lesson is that we are not as much in control of our behaviour as we believe we are: our behaviours are not a matter of choice, really, but develop from an interaction between us, our genes (formed by aeons of evolution) and our environment. When there's a mismatch between environment and individual, behavioural patterns that are meant to help the inidividual thrive will start to backfire. To remedy these illnesses (e.g. obesitas) we not only have to ask an individual to change their behaviour, we have to change the environment. I think this is an important point to make, as we live in a society that does not fit with the species we are. Packed in communities of thousands, close upon one another in trains and buildings, the stress of the office for eight hours a day, food we not have to hunt for and electricity to fiddle with our circadian rhythm ... it's a wonder we are not having more stress than we have now. This book helps us see ourselves as creatures in an ecosystem, not the untouchable lords of creation we have held ourselves to be. And it's written in a very engaging style, with lots of very interesting facts, stories and anecdotes. Recommended for anyone with a fleeting interest in health or biology or our stressful society and how we cope with that. "
19,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3178329-crosby,5,"From pet canines sucking toads to derive ""highs"", to pet birds plucking their own feathers despite the pain, to adolescent antelopes daring predatory cheetahs to attack them, this book is a fascinating trip through the similarities in the animal world to equivalent human behavior. The examples are just a few of the correlations. The canine example is from a chapter describing how humans (and all animals) are built neurologically to derive rewards from life through participating in activities that release neurotransmitters that reinforce the action. Whether it is spending time on face book, running a marathon, exercising, eating chocolate, achieving high scores in the classroom, hitting targets on a shooting range, finding a special someone in life, everyone wants (chemically speaking) the endorphin reward for doing so. Some have figured out ways to get around the need to work for the reward by indulging in things like alcohol, pot, (or sucking on toads to get the hallucinogen from skin secretions in the cases of the dogs) etc ---the shortcut so to speak. Shortcuts lead to less motivation for working towards goals in life. This is the premise of the authors as part of what comprises the ""Zoobiquity"" theme of the book. They cite example after example of the equivalency of life experiences in animals to the correlate in humans. Abnormal human behaviors such anorexia, intentionally harming oneself by cutting and others are correlated with the animal examples of the same behavior. The recklessness of human adolescence is correlated to the same type of behaviors in ""adolescent"" animals. The book is divided into chapters where the human condition is defined then numerous examples of the same conditions experienced by animals follows. There are chapters on eating disorders, drug taking, heart problems,anxiety attacks, obesity, adolescence, cancer, sex, depression (yes, animals suffer from depression as well), sexually transmitted diseases, etc. For those people interested in veterinary medicine, human medicine and just biology in general, this book is an important read. It is one of those ""big thinker"" books that leaves the reader saying time after time ""that makes sense"", ""so that is why"" and eventually those with a good background in biology and medicine can't help but try to relate their own experiences and readings to this concept. It helps tremendously that one of the authors is a physician who has had multiple professional interactions with veterinarians and has a co-author who writes in a very accessible science oriented manner. The two women have written not only an entertaining read but in my opinion, an important read. I fully agree with Discover Magazine naming it ""Best Book of the Year"". "
20,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18457308-rachael-f,5,"A time ago I wanted to be a vet. So when I came across this book it sparked a curiosity in me. There are very few medical popular science books around, and even fewer veterinary related ones. And I have to say it was a truly illuminating book, and one anyone interested in medicine (be it animal or human) or science should read.Although written by two authors, Zoobiquity is written from the perspective of Dr Natterson, a doctor, and her journey discovering comparative medicine. The book is very easy to follow, and you don't need a insane amount of scientific knowledge to read it (which in my experience, a lot of ""mainstream"" popular science requires). I'm only 19, but I could have easily read this book at 16.Zoobiquity takes us on a journey comparing important issues in the medical community (obesity, cancer, STD's, mental health) with how they play out in the animal kingdom. And the facts you learn from it! Did you know dinosaurs got cancer? The way the book is written in an accessible way. The work doesn't feel ""dumbed down"", yet it doesn't make you feel stupid reading it. It's written in a friendly tone, with a few popular culture references, but sounds intelligent enough to be taken seriously.More importantly, it feels like you're reading a revolutionary book. Right at the beginning, the book states that doctors and vets barely talk to each other, and I have the sneaking suspicion that she's right. This book is written to draw attention to the overlap between animal and human medicine, to encourage more discussion, and to look for ideas and cures outside the realms of the human hospital and into the natural world.It is by no means an easy read, it requires you to think. But isn't that what you want from a good science book?"
21,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5662520-davytron,4,"I have always loved comparative studies of humans and other animals. I have fought against the dismissal of ""anthropomorphizing"" because it's often just arrogant and ignorant - so naturally this book's premise appealed to me greatly! There is nothing new in this book. That is to say, the topics Natterson-Horowitz and Bowers talk about have been studied and hypothesized for years. This is, at best, a lit review. Worse is that the two authors present the info that is clearly new to them as if it is new to everyone. It's actually a little bit embarrassing to read about just how ignorant Natterson-Horowitz was before she decided to research this overarching topic - not just in comparative studies but in matters that directly relate to her allegedly top tier practice as a psychiatrist and cardiologist. Apparently she is still a very old school psychiatrist in that she still only uses psychoanalysis to treat everything- a lengthy, expensive process that doesn't have the best track record. Further, she often makes grandiose statements about the ignorance of her entire profession simply based out of her own ignorance. I can't help but feel vets and doctors alike would be miffed reading this book. However, despite the negatives I've dished above this is still an awesome summary of decades of research and starting point for some to reset our ways of looking at ""strictly human"" problems including obesity, addiction, and mental health.

Or that given the opportunity most animals will gorge to the point of becoming morbidly obese? Or that STDs are threatening to kill off California sea lions and Australia's beloved koala?""Zoobiquity"" is a sometimes insightful and educational read on the astonishing similarities and connections between animals and humans, as far as health goes anyway. Some of the ideas presented are surprising and fun to read about. But much of the rest won't be to someone who isn't indoctrinated into the dogmatic ""scientific"" belief that animals are so vastly different than man. The overall theme, that studying animals can provide useful help in dealing with our own human-health predicaments (good for us but I can see how this might quickly turn south for animals), shows how science's regard for viewing animals as decidedly less-than, is only hurting HUMAN progress in the area of health & disease in the long run. If you see it as a wake up call to scientists, it is quite useful. As an informative read for the lay, it is less promising. I rated the book a 3 overall, because it was enjoyable at times. But the overriding assumption that we all lack common sense and the book's failed efforts at wit and satire, made it hard to get through at times."

Pg 91, on addiction:""A friendly cocker spaniel in TX once sent her owners' lives into a tailsprin when she turned her attention to toad licking. Lady had been the perfect pet, until one day she got a taste of the hallucinogenic toxin on the skin of a cane toad. Soon she was obsessed with the back door, always begging to get out. She'd beeline to the pond in the backyard and sniff out the toads. Once she found them, she mouthed them so vigorously she sucked the pigment right out of their skin. According to her owners, after these amphibian benders Lady would be ""disoriented and withdrawn, soporifice and glassy-eyed."" So the neighbours' dogs weren't allowed to come over to play, for fear that they'd pick up Lady's habit. As amusingly recounted in a story on NPR, one night the dog's human mistress found herself in the backyard at four in the morning, desperately searching for a toad to give to Lady--literally enabling the addiction so the dog would finally come inside and the family could get some sleep.""

Natterson-Horowitz is an MD who had her eyes opened by what vets and others involved with animal health can teach her. Zoobiquity talks about these collaborations then presents several chapters, each with examples from a particular field (eating disorders/weight, heart health, sexuality, etc).I especially appreciate how she doesn't rely on trite (and useless) descriptions of the various health issues (like: you should eat fewer calories to lose weight or dietary fat is bad for you and carbs are good). She doesn't go into a lot of depth (it's simply not that kind of book) but she does delve into more than surface beliefs.

The vet immediately puts an end to that, just as I was thinking, ""Lady, have you never had a dog, cat, hamster, mouse, whatever? They do not find extended eye-to-eye contact comforting!""

The overriding theme is the growing benefit to us all by having close collaboration between medical researchers of human diseases and veterinary scientists because the animal kingdom is plagued by virtually all the ailments that affect humans. I'll quote an old joke here, that physicians are veterinarians who treat only one species. OK, the book is better than the joke. The only criticism I have is that, after providing fascinating observations in each chapter, the conclusions are somewhat mundane. Certainly scientists can pick up from here and expand the wide potential for theories and new ideas."

Her premise is that as a physician she has learned more about human disease and behavior by working with veterinarians. But she explores the two disciplines in parallel and does not bring them together. Topics vary and include syncope, eating disorders, obesity, cancer, pathogens, MI, addictions, sexuality, and self mutilation. But the information is presented as fleshed-out bullet points listing the species in which the disorders have been documented. Not only is this annoying and boring to read, it detracts from her premise. To provide a list of species means to exclude other species that might have the affliction but it hasn't been documented."

49,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5473158-heather,5,"Back in the 19th century the same doctor that would treat humans in a town would also treat that town's animals. This is before the era of specialists, fancy hospitals and the basic separation of people and things that technology tends to bring to us on all levels as we advance. Of course medicine has ""improved"" vastly since the olden era, but author Dr. Barbara Natterson-Horowitz explains that having that understanding between man and animal can lend far more value to the world of medicine and even just philosophical understanding of the nature of life far beyond what our sophisticated modern medicine can tell. This is what this book explores and for her, it is an important connection and realization.Animals suffer from the same things we all do. In fact biologically we are deeply connected. One of the more intriguing chapters was on sexuality (titled: Roar-gasm) where the author makes a connection between things like the sex appeal of Elvis's curled lip and the animal kingdom. If you are intrigued by this chapter I encourage you to pick up a copy of The Red Queen: Sex and the Evolution of Human Nature by Matt Ridley. But sexuality is only one small piece of the pie in the connection of human and animal. Diseases are a big one, and probably the one connection that has lead to the most advancement in medicine as a result. But diseases go well beyond the typical cancers and heart disease. Animals can suffer from drug addictions, depression and even anorexia. The treatment of these diseases for animals can have a healing effect on humans too. One of the most touching chapters was ""Leaving the Nest"" that explores not just the process of growing up and spreading one's wings but also the aspect of bullying. Bullying is very prevelant in the animal kingdom too, as evidenced by those with the alpha personality. It is a test of dominance and strength, and the author points out that by observing how the various species reacts and evolves from these events can help us learn how to start looking for our solutions to the same complex issues our youth faces. The summary of the book is a perfect summary for life that many can find useful: ""Our essential connection with animals is ancient, and it runs deep. It extends from body to behavior, from psychology to society--forming the basis of our daily journey of survival. This calls for physicians and patients to think beyond the bedside to barnyards, jungles, oceans and skies. Because the fate of our world's health doesn't depend solely on how we humans fare. Rather, it will be determined by how all the patients on the planet live, grow, get sick, and heal"""
50,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15696054-delene-beeland,5,"As much as we attempt to divide ourselves from the rest of the animal kingdom, the truth is that members of Homo sapiens are, well, animals. So it shouldn’t raise eyebrows to learn that humans and animals share many common—and not so common—ailments, such as heart anomalies and cancers. In Zoobiquity, authors Barbara Natterson-Horowitz and Kathryn Bowers dig deeply into these commonalities. But they don’t simply search for similar diseases and afflictions shared by man and beast, they also explore and explain the possible evolutionary underpinnings of these links.Natterson-Horowitz is a practicing cardiologist at the University of California-Los Angeles Medical Center who began consulting at a regional zoo. Her forays into treating animal patients led her to understand that medical doctors and veterinarians often have different names for similar diseases and behaviors shared by their patients. In the book’s opening scene, Horowitz recalls how she realized that the risk of her Emperor tamarin patient developing capture myopathy was eerily similar to the human condition of takotsubo cardiomyopathy, which is also known as broken heart syndrome.After that experience, Horowitz began asking if animals get specific kinds of cancers. She discovered parallels between the tumors growing around branding sites in livestock to those growing around the traumatized skin of people’s tattoos and scarifications. And just as mutations in the BRCA1 gene are known to be connected to breast cancer in people, in some animals (such as jaguars and English springer spaniels), carriers of this mutated gene also develop breast cancers.Zoobiquity takes readers on a journey connecting the dots between seemingly unconnected behaviors: for example, how the roots of substance addiction and other self-destructive habits may actually be byproducts of survival strategies, and how fainting in people may be related to behaviors that evolved in prey animals to escape being eaten. (Full review here.)"
51,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1911547-brigitte,4,"  I highly enjoyed this book on looking at human and animal health as a whole, instead of separate issues (humans are animals, after all). As a scientist I was familiar with many of the examples used and they were used well. The book does a great job of linking a variety of issues into an organized whole.A few stray observations: I appreciated the mention that the food we eat bears no relation to its wild counterpart, because we've bread them for centuries if not longer to suit our purposes. It is not possible to eat non-genetically modified food, since humans have been doing it for so long. Our ancestors simply didn't know that the traits they were selecting for corresponded to specific genes.Early on the book mentions that through a process called epigenetics, the genes inherited by children could be different from the parents. This is absolutely not true - the DNA sequence (A,T,G,C) is the same from parent to child. What can be changed through epigenetics is how those genes are expressed - when, in what tissues/cells, and how much. Thus, if a parent suffers a period of starvation prior to the arrival of a child, even years before a child is born, that experience will be passed on through epigenetics, or how the DNA sequence is packaged and read by the cell. Think of it like a typical web page: a few favored links are at the top, important information is highlighted, and then further information is included as you scroll down the page. As events happen, the content is moved around. It is always still there, but certain events make specific content more readily available. The actions and experiences of a particular individual make his or her genes more or less readily available, and that availability is passed along through generations.The info on HIV/AIDS wasn't terribly specific, as there is evidence that the disease crossed species around the 1930s, and it was the traumatic upheavals caused by colonization of the interior of Africa that eventually unleashed the disease on the world."
52,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5448276-leah,4,"As a veterinary student it is utterly refreshing to see recognition of the importance of my profession in One Health. The author is not wrong about the rift between physicians and veterinarians. We are routinely looked down upon by physicians despite it being harder to get into vet school and a curriculum that is just as hard if not harder to stay in. To see a physician acknowledge the wealth of information we have to share is a delight. Her comparisons between human and animal diseases are illuminating in the terms of understanding how pathology plays out across species. In some ways I felt that I, and really veterinarians in general, already understood the message but I take hope in the idea that this book could potentially open the eyes of my human counterparts to the value of shared information. I know multiple veterinarians, particularly specialists, that keep up with human medical journals. As a profession we are quite aware of the similarities between diseases in various species. We also know that our research and treatments have significant potential economic impacts as well as future impacts on human health. Dr. Natterson does a wonderful job of not only building a narrative throughout each chapter, but of laying out medical differential diagnoses in a way that is both understandable and complete to the ordinary person. It will not go over your head. She addresses the full range of health concerns, from the physical to mental health. Often, she adds in a personal touch to give a sense of reality and potential applications by recounting details of cases from her past or examples in everyday life. It adds a very human quality to the book that keeps the science from being too analytical. I highly recommend this book to veterinarians, doctors, or anyone with a stake in the future of One Health medicine. So really essentially everyone. "
53,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3154417-connie-n,2,"This book took me a relatively long time to read. It wasn't all that bad, it was just pretty dry, like a lecture given by a professor who is really excited about her subject but she isn't dynamic enough to enthuse her students. The subject was fairly interesting, mainly that there are many, many diseases and conditions that correlate between humans and other species. The author suggests that it would be extremely helpful to the health of the world for veterinarians and physicians to work together toward the common goal of good healthcare. She writes, ""Because the fate of our world's health doesn't depend solely on how we humans fare. Rather, it will be determined by how all the patients on the planet live, grow, get sick, and heal."" The best part of the book, in my opinion, was how she approached each category of interest and compared humans to animals...the chapter Fat Planet talked about overeating, Roar-gasm talked about sexual practices, Grooming Gone Wild talked about self-mutilation, etc. Each subject was interesting. The problem for me was that she spent lots of time with each chapter, providing example after example to prove her point when I was convinced with a lot less words. This book didn't excite me, but I did gain a greater understanding and appreciation for the subject and for the author's attempts (as a human physician herself) to coordinate seminars and awareness among her colleagues, both human and animal-focused. BTW, she herself coined the word ""zoobiquity"" when she had an aha moment and discovered that an animal in the zoo she was consulting for had a disease very similar to one she was treating in a human. Zoobiquity is from the Greek for animal (zo) and the Latin for everywhere (ubique), joining 2 cultures as she proposes to join the 2 cultures of human and animal medicine."
54,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10445857-bill,2,"The main thesis behind Zoobiquity is that many diseases found in humans have analogues in animal populations and that veterinary and human medicine stand to learn from each other's fields. The book progresses through a series of chapters that each focus on a disease found in humans such as overeating or anorexia, self-harm, cancer, or substance abuse and then shows how similar conditions affect animal populations. In discussing the analogous animal diseases, Ms. Natterson-Horowitz gives the reader a framework for a broader and more compassionate approach to the human problem. For example, in the chapter on self-harm, Natterson-Horowitz shows how self-destructive animal behaviors in grooming (such as feather-plucking in birds or lick granuloma in dogs) have their roots in stress and isolation. She stresses the importance of using ""an evolutionary tool set to repair an evolutionary short circuit."" I thought the book was a little light in its treatment and could have gone deeper in many instances. Some of the material is better dealt with in other works, such as zoonotic disease spread written about in David Quamman's Spillover. Natterson-Horowitz is sometimes breathless over making the connections between animal and human diseases so that the phrases ""until that moment"" and ""imagine my surprise"" show up a few too many times. All in all, it was a light read and is a good non-fiction summer book. It was ok, perfectly ok; no more or less."

It has a goal in mind and meets it well.Barbara Natterson-Horowitz has written a medial treatise for general audiences to educate them (and maybe successfully convince some) on the benefits of cross species study in the medical field. She (and her coauthor) covers everything from fainting, to obesity, STDs, and growing up in the animal kingdom, providing evidence for each.If readers have successfully completed high school science courses (and beyond), much of this information will not be new. Rather, what is most informative is the intricate workings of the human body in terms of certain diseases, etc., and the similarities between those that are  not mammals.There is almost nothing wrong with this text, which is why I rate it so high. However, I did find myself with a few unanswerable questions that I would love to discuss with the author. Perhaps these questions could have been answered if the book itself was longer (really, it's only 244 pages in hardcover) and was not such a succinct read (i.e. more like a dense academic paper). Overall, this book just confirms the benefits of my personal beliefs and interest in multispecies study in all academic and professional fields (where relevant)."
56,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7508307-ronald,4,"We are animals. It's with other creatures that we share our anatomy. With lizards, horses, rhinos, frogs, dogs and cats we share organs like the heart, stomach and brain. And it's about time the medical community realized that. For too long, says Barbara Natterson-Horowitz, doctors and veterinarians have ignored each other. Well, the first group has done most of the ignoring.Uncovering diseases that are thought be uniquely human, Natterson-Horowitz builds a strong case that they are in fact really ubiquitous (common) in the animal kingdom. Hence the title 'Zoobiquity'. Diabetes, heart failure and even psychological problems such as anorexia and obsessive compulsive disorder have their analogs in other creatures.The downside is that the huge amount of information in the book is presented in repeatedly the same way. Each chapter starts with a strange affliction (whether in humans or animals), and then - surprise! - the affliction apparently can be found in many different species of animals. The novelty of it all wears off pretty quick, and by the last few chapters, 'Zoobiquity' feels like repetitive read.A must-read, but I guess it's best to check out in chunks. One chapter per week, or something."

It sometimes became a little dry and sometimes a little over the top with medical information but all in all, it was an eye-opening listen. Read by Karen White, who did a wonderful job, this amazing book taught me a number of things. I found out that koalas can contract chlamydia and, in fact, the species is actually being decimated by the disease. Gorillas can suffer from clinical depression and dinosaur remains show signs of brain tumors. The author, Barbara Natterson-Horowitz, is a cardiologist and had been asked to look at a Emperor tamarin at the Los Angeles Zoo. Although the patient was soon lost, Dr. Natterson-Horowitz discovered that wild animals can actually die from of cardiac arrest brought on by extreme emotional stress--just like humans. This set her on a path of looking into and writing about additional similarities between animals and us and she found plenty. She then teamed up with science journalist Kathryn Bowers, and together completed this book. Once you've read it, you'll realize that we not only have to worry about how we treat our planet and the environment but how we keep our pets and wild life as healthy as possible, it all is just very much intertwined. Very informative and interesting."

The chapter on obesity was especially fascinating;I learned some things I would rather not know about my food.My only regret is that, not surprisingly given the author's profession as a physician (From the book: What do you call a physician? A veterinarian who can only treat one species.), the emphasis is on how what we learn about animals can help us with human health. I would have liked to see more about how we can use human medicine to improve animal health. All too many of us have loved our companion animals and lost them to medical conditions that would have been treatable in a human.Also, again ot surprising given the fact that the author is a cardiologist who started out as a psychiatrist, the emphasis was on heart problems and mental health. But Zoobiquity does not pretend to be a complete compendium comparing all interspecies medical issues. It effectively conveys the message that we are doing our health a disservice by our tendency to consider ourselves ""above"" and different from other animals and, along the way, very clearly and entertainingly presents fascinating information about health issues for humans and other species.

Learning from veterinarians, she came to understand that the differences between human and animal medicine are comparatively minor, and that the potential benefits of collaboration are as vast as the huge numbers of disorders and diseases common to humans and other species. Until the Industrial Revolution made veterinary medicine into a rural speciality, many a country physician assisted as needed when farmers called. The subsequent barriers between veterinary and medical scientists were social constructs, not scientific distinctions. Dr. Natterson-Horowitz and journalist Kathryn Bowers offer a fascinating narrative of discovery in which they demonstrate the ubiquity of the same diseases in both animals and humans and how cooperation in the medical/veterinary community can advance healthcare for all.

I don't know how much water some of them actually hold, but just about every connection between humans and animals that the authors propose is worth some thought. For example, is it actually true that surly teenagers avoid eye contact with their parents because of a subconscious instinct to avoid challenging an older or dominant figure, much as dogs avoid eye contact to prevent a fight? I have no idea. But it's an interesting thought, and maybe when my son is that age, I'll remember it and it'll make dealing with the reality a little easier. "

79,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5473158-heather,5,"Back in the 19th century the same doctor that would treat humans in a town would also treat that town's animals. This is before the era of specialists, fancy hospitals and the basic separation of people and things that technology tends to bring to us on all levels as we advance. Of course medicine has ""improved"" vastly since the olden era, but author Dr. Barbara Natterson-Horowitz explains that having that understanding between man and animal can lend far more value to the world of medicine and even just philosophical understanding of the nature of life far beyond what our sophisticated modern medicine can tell. This is what this book explores and for her, it is an important connection and realization.Animals suffer from the same things we all do. In fact biologically we are deeply connected. One of the more intriguing chapters was on sexuality (titled: Roar-gasm) where the author makes a connection between things like the sex appeal of Elvis's curled lip and the animal kingdom. If you are intrigued by this chapter I encourage you to pick up a copy of The Red Queen: Sex and the Evolution of Human Nature by Matt Ridley. But sexuality is only one small piece of the pie in the connection of human and animal. Diseases are a big one, and probably the one connection that has lead to the most advancement in medicine as a result. But diseases go well beyond the typical cancers and heart disease. Animals can suffer from drug addictions, depression and even anorexia. The treatment of these diseases for animals can have a healing effect on humans too. One of the most touching chapters was ""Leaving the Nest"" that explores not just the process of growing up and spreading one's wings but also the aspect of bullying. Bullying is very prevelant in the animal kingdom too, as evidenced by those with the alpha personality. It is a test of dominance and strength, and the author points out that by observing how the various species reacts and evolves from these events can help us learn how to start looking for our solutions to the same complex issues our youth faces. The summary of the book is a perfect summary for life that many can find useful: ""Our essential connection with animals is ancient, and it runs deep. It extends from body to behavior, from psychology to society--forming the basis of our daily journey of survival. This calls for physicians and patients to think beyond the bedside to barnyards, jungles, oceans and skies. Because the fate of our world's health doesn't depend solely on how we humans fare. Rather, it will be determined by how all the patients on the planet live, grow, get sick, and heal"""
80,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15696054-delene-beeland,5,"As much as we attempt to divide ourselves from the rest of the animal kingdom, the truth is that members of Homo sapiens are, well, animals. So it shouldn’t raise eyebrows to learn that humans and animals share many common—and not so common—ailments, such as heart anomalies and cancers. In Zoobiquity, authors Barbara Natterson-Horowitz and Kathryn Bowers dig deeply into these commonalities. But they don’t simply search for similar diseases and afflictions shared by man and beast, they also explore and explain the possible evolutionary underpinnings of these links.Natterson-Horowitz is a practicing cardiologist at the University of California-Los Angeles Medical Center who began consulting at a regional zoo. Her forays into treating animal patients led her to understand that medical doctors and veterinarians often have different names for similar diseases and behaviors shared by their patients. In the book’s opening scene, Horowitz recalls how she realized that the risk of her Emperor tamarin patient developing capture myopathy was eerily similar to the human condition of takotsubo cardiomyopathy, which is also known as broken heart syndrome.After that experience, Horowitz began asking if animals get specific kinds of cancers. She discovered parallels between the tumors growing around branding sites in livestock to those growing around the traumatized skin of people’s tattoos and scarifications. And just as mutations in the BRCA1 gene are known to be connected to breast cancer in people, in some animals (such as jaguars and English springer spaniels), carriers of this mutated gene also develop breast cancers.Zoobiquity takes readers on a journey connecting the dots between seemingly unconnected behaviors: for example, how the roots of substance addiction and other self-destructive habits may actually be byproducts of survival strategies, and how fainting in people may be related to behaviors that evolved in prey animals to escape being eaten. (Full review here.)"
81,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1911547-brigitte,4,"  I highly enjoyed this book on looking at human and animal health as a whole, instead of separate issues (humans are animals, after all). As a scientist I was familiar with many of the examples used and they were used well. The book does a great job of linking a variety of issues into an organized whole.A few stray observations: I appreciated the mention that the food we eat bears no relation to its wild counterpart, because we've bread them for centuries if not longer to suit our purposes. It is not possible to eat non-genetically modified food, since humans have been doing it for so long. Our ancestors simply didn't know that the traits they were selecting for corresponded to specific genes.Early on the book mentions that through a process called epigenetics, the genes inherited by children could be different from the parents. This is absolutely not true - the DNA sequence (A,T,G,C) is the same from parent to child. What can be changed through epigenetics is how those genes are expressed - when, in what tissues/cells, and how much. Thus, if a parent suffers a period of starvation prior to the arrival of a child, even years before a child is born, that experience will be passed on through epigenetics, or how the DNA sequence is packaged and read by the cell. Think of it like a typical web page: a few favored links are at the top, important information is highlighted, and then further information is included as you scroll down the page. As events happen, the content is moved around. It is always still there, but certain events make specific content more readily available. The actions and experiences of a particular individual make his or her genes more or less readily available, and that availability is passed along through generations.The info on HIV/AIDS wasn't terribly specific, as there is evidence that the disease crossed species around the 1930s, and it was the traumatic upheavals caused by colonization of the interior of Africa that eventually unleashed the disease on the world."
82,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5448276-leah,4,"As a veterinary student it is utterly refreshing to see recognition of the importance of my profession in One Health. The author is not wrong about the rift between physicians and veterinarians. We are routinely looked down upon by physicians despite it being harder to get into vet school and a curriculum that is just as hard if not harder to stay in. To see a physician acknowledge the wealth of information we have to share is a delight. Her comparisons between human and animal diseases are illuminating in the terms of understanding how pathology plays out across species. In some ways I felt that I, and really veterinarians in general, already understood the message but I take hope in the idea that this book could potentially open the eyes of my human counterparts to the value of shared information. I know multiple veterinarians, particularly specialists, that keep up with human medical journals. As a profession we are quite aware of the similarities between diseases in various species. We also know that our research and treatments have significant potential economic impacts as well as future impacts on human health. Dr. Natterson does a wonderful job of not only building a narrative throughout each chapter, but of laying out medical differential diagnoses in a way that is both understandable and complete to the ordinary person. It will not go over your head. She addresses the full range of health concerns, from the physical to mental health. Often, she adds in a personal touch to give a sense of reality and potential applications by recounting details of cases from her past or examples in everyday life. It adds a very human quality to the book that keeps the science from being too analytical. I highly recommend this book to veterinarians, doctors, or anyone with a stake in the future of One Health medicine. So really essentially everyone. "

It wasn't all that bad, it was just pretty dry, like a lecture given by a professor who is really excited about her subject but she isn't dynamic enough to enthuse her students. The subject was fairly interesting, mainly that there are many, many diseases and conditions that correlate between humans and other species. The author suggests that it would be extremely helpful to the health of the world for veterinarians and physicians to work together toward the common goal of good healthcare. She writes, ""Because the fate of our world's health doesn't depend solely on how we humans fare. Rather, it will be determined by how all the patients on the planet live, grow, get sick, and heal."" The best part of the book, in my opinion, was how she approached each category of interest and compared humans to animals...the chapter Fat Planet talked about overeating, Roar-gasm talked about sexual practices, Grooming Gone Wild talked about self-mutilation, etc. Each subject was interesting. The problem for me was that she spent lots of time with each chapter, providing example after example to prove her point when I was convinced with a lot less words. This book didn't excite me, but I did gain a greater understanding and appreciation for the subject and for the author's attempts (as a human physician herself) to coordinate seminars and awareness among her colleagues, both human and animal-focused. BTW, she herself coined the word ""zoobiquity"" when she had an aha moment and discovered that an animal in the zoo she was consulting for had a disease very similar to one she was treating in a human.

With lizards, horses, rhinos, frogs, dogs and cats we share organs like the heart, stomach and brain. And it's about time the medical community realized that. For too long, says Barbara Natterson-Horowitz, doctors and veterinarians have ignored each other. Well, the first group has done most of the ignoring.Uncovering diseases that are thought be uniquely human, Natterson-Horowitz builds a strong case that they are in fact really ubiquitous (common) in the animal kingdom. Hence the title 'Zoobiquity'. Diabetes, heart failure and even psychological problems such as anorexia and obsessive compulsive disorder have their analogs in other creatures.The downside is that the huge amount of information in the book is presented in repeatedly the same way. Each chapter starts with a strange affliction (whether in humans or animals), and then - surprise! - the affliction apparently can be found in many different species of animals. The novelty of it all wears off pretty quick, and by the last few chapters, 'Zoobiquity' feels like repetitive read.A must-read, but I guess it's best to check out in chunks. One chapter per week, or something."

It sometimes became a little dry and sometimes a little over the top with medical information but all in all, it was an eye-opening listen. Read by Karen White, who did a wonderful job, this amazing book taught me a number of things. I found out that koalas can contract chlamydia and, in fact, the species is actually being decimated by the disease. Gorillas can suffer from clinical depression and dinosaur remains show signs of brain tumors. The author, Barbara Natterson-Horowitz, is a cardiologist and had been asked to look at a Emperor tamarin at the Los Angeles Zoo. Although the patient was soon lost, Dr. Natterson-Horowitz discovered that wild animals can actually die from of cardiac arrest brought on by extreme emotional stress--just like humans. This set her on a path of looking into and writing about additional similarities between animals and us and she found plenty. She then teamed up with science journalist Kathryn Bowers, and together completed this book. Once you've read it, you'll realize that we not only have to worry about how we treat our planet and the environment but how we keep our pets and wild life as healthy as possible, it all is just very much intertwined. Very informative and interesting."

The chapter on obesity was especially fascinating;I learned some things I would rather not know about my food.My only regret is that, not surprisingly given the author's profession as a physician (From the book: What do you call a physician? A veterinarian who can only treat one species.), the emphasis is on how what we learn about animals can help us with human health. I would have liked to see more about how we can use human medicine to improve animal health. All too many of us have loved our companion animals and lost them to medical conditions that would have been treatable in a human.Also, again ot surprising given the fact that the author is a cardiologist who started out as a psychiatrist, the emphasis was on heart problems and mental health. But Zoobiquity does not pretend to be a complete compendium comparing all interspecies medical issues. It effectively conveys the message that we are doing our health a disservice by our tendency to consider ourselves ""above"" and different from other animals and, along the way, very clearly and entertainingly presents fascinating information about health issues for humans and other species.

Learning from veterinarians, she came to understand that the differences between human and animal medicine are comparatively minor, and that the potential benefits of collaboration are as vast as the huge numbers of disorders and diseases common to humans and other species. Until the Industrial Revolution made veterinary medicine into a rural speciality, many a country physician assisted as needed when farmers called. The subsequent barriers between veterinary and medical scientists were social constructs, not scientific distinctions. Dr. Natterson-Horowitz and journalist Kathryn Bowers offer a fascinating narrative of discovery in which they demonstrate the ubiquity of the same diseases in both animals and humans and how cooperation in the medical/veterinary community can advance healthcare for all.

For example, is it actually true that surly teenagers avoid eye contact with their parents because of a subconscious instinct to avoid challenging an older or dominant figure, much as dogs avoid eye contact to prevent a fight? I have no idea. But it's an interesting thought, and maybe when my son is that age, I'll remember it and it'll make dealing with the reality a little easier. "

109,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5473158-heather,5,"Back in the 19th century the same doctor that would treat humans in a town would also treat that town's animals. This is before the era of specialists, fancy hospitals and the basic separation of people and things that technology tends to bring to us on all levels as we advance. Of course medicine has ""improved"" vastly since the olden era, but author Dr. Barbara Natterson-Horowitz explains that having that understanding between man and animal can lend far more value to the world of medicine and even just philosophical understanding of the nature of life far beyond what our sophisticated modern medicine can tell. This is what this book explores and for her, it is an important connection and realization.Animals suffer from the same things we all do. In fact biologically we are deeply connected. One of the more intriguing chapters was on sexuality (titled: Roar-gasm) where the author makes a connection between things like the sex appeal of Elvis's curled lip and the animal kingdom. If you are intrigued by this chapter I encourage you to pick up a copy of The Red Queen: Sex and the Evolution of Human Nature by Matt Ridley. But sexuality is only one small piece of the pie in the connection of human and animal. Diseases are a big one, and probably the one connection that has lead to the most advancement in medicine as a result. But diseases go well beyond the typical cancers and heart disease. Animals can suffer from drug addictions, depression and even anorexia. The treatment of these diseases for animals can have a healing effect on humans too. One of the most touching chapters was ""Leaving the Nest"" that explores not just the process of growing up and spreading one's wings but also the aspect of bullying. Bullying is very prevelant in the animal kingdom too, as evidenced by those with the alpha personality. It is a test of dominance and strength, and the author points out that by observing how the various species reacts and evolves from these events can help us learn how to start looking for our solutions to the same complex issues our youth faces. The summary of the book is a perfect summary for life that many can find useful: ""Our essential connection with animals is ancient, and it runs deep. It extends from body to behavior, from psychology to society--forming the basis of our daily journey of survival. This calls for physicians and patients to think beyond the bedside to barnyards, jungles, oceans and skies. Because the fate of our world's health doesn't depend solely on how we humans fare. Rather, it will be determined by how all the patients on the planet live, grow, get sick, and heal"""
110,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15696054-delene-beeland,5,"As much as we attempt to divide ourselves from the rest of the animal kingdom, the truth is that members of Homo sapiens are, well, animals. So it shouldn’t raise eyebrows to learn that humans and animals share many common—and not so common—ailments, such as heart anomalies and cancers. In Zoobiquity, authors Barbara Natterson-Horowitz and Kathryn Bowers dig deeply into these commonalities. But they don’t simply search for similar diseases and afflictions shared by man and beast, they also explore and explain the possible evolutionary underpinnings of these links.Natterson-Horowitz is a practicing cardiologist at the University of California-Los Angeles Medical Center who began consulting at a regional zoo. Her forays into treating animal patients led her to understand that medical doctors and veterinarians often have different names for similar diseases and behaviors shared by their patients. In the book’s opening scene, Horowitz recalls how she realized that the risk of her Emperor tamarin patient developing capture myopathy was eerily similar to the human condition of takotsubo cardiomyopathy, which is also known as broken heart syndrome.After that experience, Horowitz began asking if animals get specific kinds of cancers. She discovered parallels between the tumors growing around branding sites in livestock to those growing around the traumatized skin of people’s tattoos and scarifications. And just as mutations in the BRCA1 gene are known to be connected to breast cancer in people, in some animals (such as jaguars and English springer spaniels), carriers of this mutated gene also develop breast cancers.Zoobiquity takes readers on a journey connecting the dots between seemingly unconnected behaviors: for example, how the roots of substance addiction and other self-destructive habits may actually be byproducts of survival strategies, and how fainting in people may be related to behaviors that evolved in prey animals to escape being eaten. (Full review here.)"
111,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1911547-brigitte,4,"  I highly enjoyed this book on looking at human and animal health as a whole, instead of separate issues (humans are animals, after all). As a scientist I was familiar with many of the examples used and they were used well. The book does a great job of linking a variety of issues into an organized whole.A few stray observations: I appreciated the mention that the food we eat bears no relation to its wild counterpart, because we've bread them for centuries if not longer to suit our purposes. It is not possible to eat non-genetically modified food, since humans have been doing it for so long. Our ancestors simply didn't know that the traits they were selecting for corresponded to specific genes.Early on the book mentions that through a process called epigenetics, the genes inherited by children could be different from the parents. This is absolutely not true - the DNA sequence (A,T,G,C) is the same from parent to child. What can be changed through epigenetics is how those genes are expressed - when, in what tissues/cells, and how much. Thus, if a parent suffers a period of starvation prior to the arrival of a child, even years before a child is born, that experience will be passed on through epigenetics, or how the DNA sequence is packaged and read by the cell. Think of it like a typical web page: a few favored links are at the top, important information is highlighted, and then further information is included as you scroll down the page. As events happen, the content is moved around. It is always still there, but certain events make specific content more readily available. The actions and experiences of a particular individual make his or her genes more or less readily available, and that availability is passed along through generations.The info on HIV/AIDS wasn't terribly specific, as there is evidence that the disease crossed species around the 1930s, and it was the traumatic upheavals caused by colonization of the interior of Africa that eventually unleashed the disease on the world."
112,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5448276-leah,4,"As a veterinary student it is utterly refreshing to see recognition of the importance of my profession in One Health. The author is not wrong about the rift between physicians and veterinarians. We are routinely looked down upon by physicians despite it being harder to get into vet school and a curriculum that is just as hard if not harder to stay in. To see a physician acknowledge the wealth of information we have to share is a delight. Her comparisons between human and animal diseases are illuminating in the terms of understanding how pathology plays out across species. In some ways I felt that I, and really veterinarians in general, already understood the message but I take hope in the idea that this book could potentially open the eyes of my human counterparts to the value of shared information. I know multiple veterinarians, particularly specialists, that keep up with human medical journals. As a profession we are quite aware of the similarities between diseases in various species. We also know that our research and treatments have significant potential economic impacts as well as future impacts on human health. Dr. Natterson does a wonderful job of not only building a narrative throughout each chapter, but of laying out medical differential diagnoses in a way that is both understandable and complete to the ordinary person. It will not go over your head. She addresses the full range of health concerns, from the physical to mental health. Often, she adds in a personal touch to give a sense of reality and potential applications by recounting details of cases from her past or examples in everyday life. It adds a very human quality to the book that keeps the science from being too analytical. I highly recommend this book to veterinarians, doctors, or anyone with a stake in the future of One Health medicine. So really essentially everyone. "
113,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3154417-connie-n,2,"This book took me a relatively long time to read. It wasn't all that bad, it was just pretty dry, like a lecture given by a professor who is really excited about her subject but she isn't dynamic enough to enthuse her students. The subject was fairly interesting, mainly that there are many, many diseases and conditions that correlate between humans and other species. The author suggests that it would be extremely helpful to the health of the world for veterinarians and physicians to work together toward the common goal of good healthcare. She writes, ""Because the fate of our world's health doesn't depend solely on how we humans fare. Rather, it will be determined by how all the patients on the planet live, grow, get sick, and heal."" The best part of the book, in my opinion, was how she approached each category of interest and compared humans to animals...the chapter Fat Planet talked about overeating, Roar-gasm talked about sexual practices, Grooming Gone Wild talked about self-mutilation, etc. Each subject was interesting. The problem for me was that she spent lots of time with each chapter, providing example after example to prove her point when I was convinced with a lot less words. This book didn't excite me, but I did gain a greater understanding and appreciation for the subject and for the author's attempts (as a human physician herself) to coordinate seminars and awareness among her colleagues, both human and animal-focused. BTW, she herself coined the word ""zoobiquity"" when she had an aha moment and discovered that an animal in the zoo she was consulting for had a disease very similar to one she was treating in a human. Zoobiquity is from the Greek for animal (zo) and the Latin for everywhere (ubique), joining 2 cultures as she proposes to join the 2 cultures of human and animal medicine."
114,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10445857-bill,2,"The main thesis behind Zoobiquity is that many diseases found in humans have analogues in animal populations and that veterinary and human medicine stand to learn from each other's fields. The book progresses through a series of chapters that each focus on a disease found in humans such as overeating or anorexia, self-harm, cancer, or substance abuse and then shows how similar conditions affect animal populations. In discussing the analogous animal diseases, Ms. Natterson-Horowitz gives the reader a framework for a broader and more compassionate approach to the human problem. For example, in the chapter on self-harm, Natterson-Horowitz shows how self-destructive animal behaviors in grooming (such as feather-plucking in birds or lick granuloma in dogs) have their roots in stress and isolation. She stresses the importance of using ""an evolutionary tool set to repair an evolutionary short circuit."" I thought the book was a little light in its treatment and could have gone deeper in many instances. Some of the material is better dealt with in other works, such as zoonotic disease spread written about in David Quamman's Spillover. Natterson-Horowitz is sometimes breathless over making the connections between animal and human diseases so that the phrases ""until that moment"" and ""imagine my surprise"" show up a few too many times. All in all, it was a light read and is a good non-fiction summer book. It was ok, perfectly ok; no more or less."
115,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7787544-taylor,4,"4.5/5For what this book *is* --a multispecies medical ethnography targeted at showing people the interconnectedness between humans and animals-- it is quite good. It has a goal in mind and meets it well.Barbara Natterson-Horowitz has written a medial treatise for general audiences to educate them (and maybe successfully convince some) on the benefits of cross species study in the medical field. She (and her coauthor) covers everything from fainting, to obesity, STDs, and growing up in the animal kingdom, providing evidence for each.If readers have successfully completed high school science courses (and beyond), much of this information will not be new. Rather, what is most informative is the intricate workings of the human body in terms of certain diseases, etc., and the similarities between those that are  not mammals.There is almost nothing wrong with this text, which is why I rate it so high. However, I did find myself with a few unanswerable questions that I would love to discuss with the author. Perhaps these questions could have been answered if the book itself was longer (really, it's only 244 pages in hardcover) and was not such a succinct read (i.e. more like a dense academic paper). Overall, this book just confirms the benefits of my personal beliefs and interest in multispecies study in all academic and professional fields (where relevant)."
116,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7508307-ronald,4,"We are animals. It's with other creatures that we share our anatomy. With lizards, horses, rhinos, frogs, dogs and cats we share organs like the heart, stomach and brain. And it's about time the medical community realized that. For too long, says Barbara Natterson-Horowitz, doctors and veterinarians have ignored each other. Well, the first group has done most of the ignoring.Uncovering diseases that are thought be uniquely human, Natterson-Horowitz builds a strong case that they are in fact really ubiquitous (common) in the animal kingdom. Hence the title 'Zoobiquity'. Diabetes, heart failure and even psychological problems such as anorexia and obsessive compulsive disorder have their analogs in other creatures.The downside is that the huge amount of information in the book is presented in repeatedly the same way. Each chapter starts with a strange affliction (whether in humans or animals), and then - surprise! - the affliction apparently can be found in many different species of animals. The novelty of it all wears off pretty quick, and by the last few chapters, 'Zoobiquity' feels like repetitive read.A must-read, but I guess it's best to check out in chunks. One chapter per week, or something."

It sometimes became a little dry and sometimes a little over the top with medical information but all in all, it was an eye-opening listen. Read by Karen White, who did a wonderful job, this amazing book taught me a number of things. I found out that koalas can contract chlamydia and, in fact, the species is actually being decimated by the disease. Gorillas can suffer from clinical depression and dinosaur remains show signs of brain tumors. The author, Barbara Natterson-Horowitz, is a cardiologist and had been asked to look at a Emperor tamarin at the Los Angeles Zoo. Although the patient was soon lost, Dr. Natterson-Horowitz discovered that wild animals can actually die from of cardiac arrest brought on by extreme emotional stress--just like humans. This set her on a path of looking into and writing about additional similarities between animals and us and she found plenty. She then teamed up with science journalist Kathryn Bowers, and together completed this book. Once you've read it, you'll realize that we not only have to worry about how we treat our planet and the environment but how we keep our pets and wild life as healthy as possible, it all is just very much intertwined.

Until the Industrial Revolution made veterinary medicine into a rural speciality, many a country physician assisted as needed when farmers called. The subsequent barriers between veterinary and medical scientists were social constructs, not scientific distinctions.

I don't know how much water some of them actually hold, but just about every connection between humans and animals that the authors propose is worth some thought. For example, is it actually true that surly teenagers avoid eye contact with their parents because of a subconscious instinct to avoid challenging an older or dominant figure, much as dogs avoid eye contact to prevent a fight? I have no idea. But it's an interesting thought, and maybe when my son is that age, I'll remember it and it'll make dealing with the reality a little easier. "

139,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5473158-heather,5,"Back in the 19th century the same doctor that would treat humans in a town would also treat that town's animals. This is before the era of specialists, fancy hospitals and the basic separation of people and things that technology tends to bring to us on all levels as we advance. Of course medicine has ""improved"" vastly since the olden era, but author Dr. Barbara Natterson-Horowitz explains that having that understanding between man and animal can lend far more value to the world of medicine and even just philosophical understanding of the nature of life far beyond what our sophisticated modern medicine can tell. This is what this book explores and for her, it is an important connection and realization.Animals suffer from the same things we all do. In fact biologically we are deeply connected. One of the more intriguing chapters was on sexuality (titled: Roar-gasm) where the author makes a connection between things like the sex appeal of Elvis's curled lip and the animal kingdom. If you are intrigued by this chapter I encourage you to pick up a copy of The Red Queen: Sex and the Evolution of Human Nature by Matt Ridley. But sexuality is only one small piece of the pie in the connection of human and animal. Diseases are a big one, and probably the one connection that has lead to the most advancement in medicine as a result. But diseases go well beyond the typical cancers and heart disease. Animals can suffer from drug addictions, depression and even anorexia. The treatment of these diseases for animals can have a healing effect on humans too. One of the most touching chapters was ""Leaving the Nest"" that explores not just the process of growing up and spreading one's wings but also the aspect of bullying. Bullying is very prevelant in the animal kingdom too, as evidenced by those with the alpha personality. It is a test of dominance and strength, and the author points out that by observing how the various species reacts and evolves from these events can help us learn how to start looking for our solutions to the same complex issues our youth faces. The summary of the book is a perfect summary for life that many can find useful: ""Our essential connection with animals is ancient, and it runs deep. It extends from body to behavior, from psychology to society--forming the basis of our daily journey of survival. This calls for physicians and patients to think beyond the bedside to barnyards, jungles, oceans and skies. Because the fate of our world's health doesn't depend solely on how we humans fare. Rather, it will be determined by how all the patients on the planet live, grow, get sick, and heal"""
140,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15696054-delene-beeland,5,"As much as we attempt to divide ourselves from the rest of the animal kingdom, the truth is that members of Homo sapiens are, well, animals. So it shouldn’t raise eyebrows to learn that humans and animals share many common—and not so common—ailments, such as heart anomalies and cancers. In Zoobiquity, authors Barbara Natterson-Horowitz and Kathryn Bowers dig deeply into these commonalities. But they don’t simply search for similar diseases and afflictions shared by man and beast, they also explore and explain the possible evolutionary underpinnings of these links.Natterson-Horowitz is a practicing cardiologist at the University of California-Los Angeles Medical Center who began consulting at a regional zoo. Her forays into treating animal patients led her to understand that medical doctors and veterinarians often have different names for similar diseases and behaviors shared by their patients. In the book’s opening scene, Horowitz recalls how she realized that the risk of her Emperor tamarin patient developing capture myopathy was eerily similar to the human condition of takotsubo cardiomyopathy, which is also known as broken heart syndrome.After that experience, Horowitz began asking if animals get specific kinds of cancers. She discovered parallels between the tumors growing around branding sites in livestock to those growing around the traumatized skin of people’s tattoos and scarifications. And just as mutations in the BRCA1 gene are known to be connected to breast cancer in people, in some animals (such as jaguars and English springer spaniels), carriers of this mutated gene also develop breast cancers.Zoobiquity takes readers on a journey connecting the dots between seemingly unconnected behaviors: for example, how the roots of substance addiction and other self-destructive habits may actually be byproducts of survival strategies, and how fainting in people may be related to behaviors that evolved in prey animals to escape being eaten. (Full review here.)"
141,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1911547-brigitte,4,"  I highly enjoyed this book on looking at human and animal health as a whole, instead of separate issues (humans are animals, after all). As a scientist I was familiar with many of the examples used and they were used well. The book does a great job of linking a variety of issues into an organized whole.A few stray observations: I appreciated the mention that the food we eat bears no relation to its wild counterpart, because we've bread them for centuries if not longer to suit our purposes. It is not possible to eat non-genetically modified food, since humans have been doing it for so long. Our ancestors simply didn't know that the traits they were selecting for corresponded to specific genes.Early on the book mentions that through a process called epigenetics, the genes inherited by children could be different from the parents. This is absolutely not true - the DNA sequence (A,T,G,C) is the same from parent to child. What can be changed through epigenetics is how those genes are expressed - when, in what tissues/cells, and how much. Thus, if a parent suffers a period of starvation prior to the arrival of a child, even years before a child is born, that experience will be passed on through epigenetics, or how the DNA sequence is packaged and read by the cell. Think of it like a typical web page: a few favored links are at the top, important information is highlighted, and then further information is included as you scroll down the page. As events happen, the content is moved around. It is always still there, but certain events make specific content more readily available. The actions and experiences of a particular individual make his or her genes more or less readily available, and that availability is passed along through generations.The info on HIV/AIDS wasn't terribly specific, as there is evidence that the disease crossed species around the 1930s, and it was the traumatic upheavals caused by colonization of the interior of Africa that eventually unleashed the disease on the world."
142,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5448276-leah,4,"As a veterinary student it is utterly refreshing to see recognition of the importance of my profession in One Health. The author is not wrong about the rift between physicians and veterinarians. We are routinely looked down upon by physicians despite it being harder to get into vet school and a curriculum that is just as hard if not harder to stay in. To see a physician acknowledge the wealth of information we have to share is a delight. Her comparisons between human and animal diseases are illuminating in the terms of understanding how pathology plays out across species. In some ways I felt that I, and really veterinarians in general, already understood the message but I take hope in the idea that this book could potentially open the eyes of my human counterparts to the value of shared information. I know multiple veterinarians, particularly specialists, that keep up with human medical journals. As a profession we are quite aware of the similarities between diseases in various species. We also know that our research and treatments have significant potential economic impacts as well as future impacts on human health. Dr. Natterson does a wonderful job of not only building a narrative throughout each chapter, but of laying out medical differential diagnoses in a way that is both understandable and complete to the ordinary person. It will not go over your head. She addresses the full range of health concerns, from the physical to mental health. Often, she adds in a personal touch to give a sense of reality and potential applications by recounting details of cases from her past or examples in everyday life. It adds a very human quality to the book that keeps the science from being too analytical. I highly recommend this book to veterinarians, doctors, or anyone with a stake in the future of One Health medicine. So really essentially everyone. "
143,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3154417-connie-n,2,"This book took me a relatively long time to read. It wasn't all that bad, it was just pretty dry, like a lecture given by a professor who is really excited about her subject but she isn't dynamic enough to enthuse her students. The subject was fairly interesting, mainly that there are many, many diseases and conditions that correlate between humans and other species. The author suggests that it would be extremely helpful to the health of the world for veterinarians and physicians to work together toward the common goal of good healthcare. She writes, ""Because the fate of our world's health doesn't depend solely on how we humans fare. Rather, it will be determined by how all the patients on the planet live, grow, get sick, and heal."" The best part of the book, in my opinion, was how she approached each category of interest and compared humans to animals...the chapter Fat Planet talked about overeating, Roar-gasm talked about sexual practices, Grooming Gone Wild talked about self-mutilation, etc. Each subject was interesting. The problem for me was that she spent lots of time with each chapter, providing example after example to prove her point when I was convinced with a lot less words. This book didn't excite me, but I did gain a greater understanding and appreciation for the subject and for the author's attempts (as a human physician herself) to coordinate seminars and awareness among her colleagues, both human and animal-focused. BTW, she herself coined the word ""zoobiquity"" when she had an aha moment and discovered that an animal in the zoo she was consulting for had a disease very similar to one she was treating in a human. Zoobiquity is from the Greek for animal (zo) and the Latin for everywhere (ubique), joining 2 cultures as she proposes to join the 2 cultures of human and animal medicine."
144,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10445857-bill,2,"The main thesis behind Zoobiquity is that many diseases found in humans have analogues in animal populations and that veterinary and human medicine stand to learn from each other's fields. The book progresses through a series of chapters that each focus on a disease found in humans such as overeating or anorexia, self-harm, cancer, or substance abuse and then shows how similar conditions affect animal populations. In discussing the analogous animal diseases, Ms. Natterson-Horowitz gives the reader a framework for a broader and more compassionate approach to the human problem. For example, in the chapter on self-harm, Natterson-Horowitz shows how self-destructive animal behaviors in grooming (such as feather-plucking in birds or lick granuloma in dogs) have their roots in stress and isolation. She stresses the importance of using ""an evolutionary tool set to repair an evolutionary short circuit."" I thought the book was a little light in its treatment and could have gone deeper in many instances. Some of the material is better dealt with in other works, such as zoonotic disease spread written about in David Quamman's Spillover. Natterson-Horowitz is sometimes breathless over making the connections between animal and human diseases so that the phrases ""until that moment"" and ""imagine my surprise"" show up a few too many times. All in all, it was a light read and is a good non-fiction summer book. It was ok, perfectly ok; no more or less."
145,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7787544-taylor,4,"4.5/5For what this book *is* --a multispecies medical ethnography targeted at showing people the interconnectedness between humans and animals-- it is quite good. It has a goal in mind and meets it well.Barbara Natterson-Horowitz has written a medial treatise for general audiences to educate them (and maybe successfully convince some) on the benefits of cross species study in the medical field. She (and her coauthor) covers everything from fainting, to obesity, STDs, and growing up in the animal kingdom, providing evidence for each.If readers have successfully completed high school science courses (and beyond), much of this information will not be new. Rather, what is most informative is the intricate workings of the human body in terms of certain diseases, etc., and the similarities between those that are  not mammals.There is almost nothing wrong with this text, which is why I rate it so high. However, I did find myself with a few unanswerable questions that I would love to discuss with the author. Perhaps these questions could have been answered if the book itself was longer (really, it's only 244 pages in hardcover) and was not such a succinct read (i.e. more like a dense academic paper). Overall, this book just confirms the benefits of my personal beliefs and interest in multispecies study in all academic and professional fields (where relevant)."
146,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7508307-ronald,4,"We are animals. It's with other creatures that we share our anatomy. With lizards, horses, rhinos, frogs, dogs and cats we share organs like the heart, stomach and brain. And it's about time the medical community realized that. For too long, says Barbara Natterson-Horowitz, doctors and veterinarians have ignored each other. Well, the first group has done most of the ignoring.Uncovering diseases that are thought be uniquely human, Natterson-Horowitz builds a strong case that they are in fact really ubiquitous (common) in the animal kingdom. Hence the title 'Zoobiquity'. Diabetes, heart failure and even psychological problems such as anorexia and obsessive compulsive disorder have their analogs in other creatures.The downside is that the huge amount of information in the book is presented in repeatedly the same way. Each chapter starts with a strange affliction (whether in humans or animals), and then - surprise! - the affliction apparently can be found in many different species of animals. The novelty of it all wears off pretty quick, and by the last few chapters, 'Zoobiquity' feels like repetitive read.A must-read, but I guess it's best to check out in chunks. One chapter per week, or something."

It sometimes became a little dry and sometimes a little over the top with medical information but all in all, it was an eye-opening listen. Read by Karen White, who did a wonderful job, this amazing book taught me a number of things. I found out that koalas can contract chlamydia and, in fact, the species is actually being decimated by the disease. Gorillas can suffer from clinical depression and dinosaur remains show signs of brain tumors. The author, Barbara Natterson-Horowitz, is a cardiologist and had been asked to look at a Emperor tamarin at the Los Angeles Zoo. Although the patient was soon lost, Dr. Natterson-Horowitz discovered that wild animals can actually die from of cardiac arrest brought on by extreme emotional stress--just like humans. This set her on a path of looking into and writing about additional similarities between animals and us and she found plenty. She then teamed up with science journalist Kathryn Bowers, and together completed this book. Once you've read it, you'll realize that we not only have to worry about how we treat our planet and the environment but how we keep our pets and wild life as healthy as possible, it all is just very much intertwined. Very informative and interesting."

I don't know how much water some of them actually hold, but just about every connection between humans and animals that the authors propose is worth some thought. For example, is it actually true that surly teenagers avoid eye contact with their parents because of a subconscious instinct to avoid challenging an older or dominant figure, much as dogs avoid eye contact to prevent a fight? I have no idea. But it's an interesting thought, and maybe when my son is that age, I'll remember it and it'll make dealing with the reality a little easier. "

169,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5473158-heather,5,"Back in the 19th century the same doctor that would treat humans in a town would also treat that town's animals. This is before the era of specialists, fancy hospitals and the basic separation of people and things that technology tends to bring to us on all levels as we advance. Of course medicine has ""improved"" vastly since the olden era, but author Dr. Barbara Natterson-Horowitz explains that having that understanding between man and animal can lend far more value to the world of medicine and even just philosophical understanding of the nature of life far beyond what our sophisticated modern medicine can tell. This is what this book explores and for her, it is an important connection and realization.Animals suffer from the same things we all do. In fact biologically we are deeply connected. One of the more intriguing chapters was on sexuality (titled: Roar-gasm) where the author makes a connection between things like the sex appeal of Elvis's curled lip and the animal kingdom. If you are intrigued by this chapter I encourage you to pick up a copy of The Red Queen: Sex and the Evolution of Human Nature by Matt Ridley. But sexuality is only one small piece of the pie in the connection of human and animal. Diseases are a big one, and probably the one connection that has lead to the most advancement in medicine as a result. But diseases go well beyond the typical cancers and heart disease. Animals can suffer from drug addictions, depression and even anorexia. The treatment of these diseases for animals can have a healing effect on humans too. One of the most touching chapters was ""Leaving the Nest"" that explores not just the process of growing up and spreading one's wings but also the aspect of bullying. Bullying is very prevelant in the animal kingdom too, as evidenced by those with the alpha personality. It is a test of dominance and strength, and the author points out that by observing how the various species reacts and evolves from these events can help us learn how to start looking for our solutions to the same complex issues our youth faces. The summary of the book is a perfect summary for life that many can find useful: ""Our essential connection with animals is ancient, and it runs deep. It extends from body to behavior, from psychology to society--forming the basis of our daily journey of survival. This calls for physicians and patients to think beyond the bedside to barnyards, jungles, oceans and skies. Because the fate of our world's health doesn't depend solely on how we humans fare. Rather, it will be determined by how all the patients on the planet live, grow, get sick, and heal"""
170,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15696054-delene-beeland,5,"As much as we attempt to divide ourselves from the rest of the animal kingdom, the truth is that members of Homo sapiens are, well, animals. So it shouldn’t raise eyebrows to learn that humans and animals share many common—and not so common—ailments, such as heart anomalies and cancers. In Zoobiquity, authors Barbara Natterson-Horowitz and Kathryn Bowers dig deeply into these commonalities. But they don’t simply search for similar diseases and afflictions shared by man and beast, they also explore and explain the possible evolutionary underpinnings of these links.Natterson-Horowitz is a practicing cardiologist at the University of California-Los Angeles Medical Center who began consulting at a regional zoo. Her forays into treating animal patients led her to understand that medical doctors and veterinarians often have different names for similar diseases and behaviors shared by their patients. In the book’s opening scene, Horowitz recalls how she realized that the risk of her Emperor tamarin patient developing capture myopathy was eerily similar to the human condition of takotsubo cardiomyopathy, which is also known as broken heart syndrome.After that experience, Horowitz began asking if animals get specific kinds of cancers. She discovered parallels between the tumors growing around branding sites in livestock to those growing around the traumatized skin of people’s tattoos and scarifications. And just as mutations in the BRCA1 gene are known to be connected to breast cancer in people, in some animals (such as jaguars and English springer spaniels), carriers of this mutated gene also develop breast cancers.Zoobiquity takes readers on a journey connecting the dots between seemingly unconnected behaviors: for example, how the roots of substance addiction and other self-destructive habits may actually be byproducts of survival strategies, and how fainting in people may be related to behaviors that evolved in prey animals to escape being eaten. (Full review here.)"
171,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1911547-brigitte,4,"  I highly enjoyed this book on looking at human and animal health as a whole, instead of separate issues (humans are animals, after all). As a scientist I was familiar with many of the examples used and they were used well. The book does a great job of linking a variety of issues into an organized whole.A few stray observations: I appreciated the mention that the food we eat bears no relation to its wild counterpart, because we've bread them for centuries if not longer to suit our purposes. It is not possible to eat non-genetically modified food, since humans have been doing it for so long. Our ancestors simply didn't know that the traits they were selecting for corresponded to specific genes.Early on the book mentions that through a process called epigenetics, the genes inherited by children could be different from the parents. This is absolutely not true - the DNA sequence (A,T,G,C) is the same from parent to child. What can be changed through epigenetics is how those genes are expressed - when, in what tissues/cells, and how much. Thus, if a parent suffers a period of starvation prior to the arrival of a child, even years before a child is born, that experience will be passed on through epigenetics, or how the DNA sequence is packaged and read by the cell. Think of it like a typical web page: a few favored links are at the top, important information is highlighted, and then further information is included as you scroll down the page. As events happen, the content is moved around. It is always still there, but certain events make specific content more readily available. The actions and experiences of a particular individual make his or her genes more or less readily available, and that availability is passed along through generations.The info on HIV/AIDS wasn't terribly specific, as there is evidence that the disease crossed species around the 1930s, and it was the traumatic upheavals caused by colonization of the interior of Africa that eventually unleashed the disease on the world."
172,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5448276-leah,4,"As a veterinary student it is utterly refreshing to see recognition of the importance of my profession in One Health. The author is not wrong about the rift between physicians and veterinarians. We are routinely looked down upon by physicians despite it being harder to get into vet school and a curriculum that is just as hard if not harder to stay in. To see a physician acknowledge the wealth of information we have to share is a delight. Her comparisons between human and animal diseases are illuminating in the terms of understanding how pathology plays out across species. In some ways I felt that I, and really veterinarians in general, already understood the message but I take hope in the idea that this book could potentially open the eyes of my human counterparts to the value of shared information. I know multiple veterinarians, particularly specialists, that keep up with human medical journals. As a profession we are quite aware of the similarities between diseases in various species. We also know that our research and treatments have significant potential economic impacts as well as future impacts on human health. Dr. Natterson does a wonderful job of not only building a narrative throughout each chapter, but of laying out medical differential diagnoses in a way that is both understandable and complete to the ordinary person. It will not go over your head. She addresses the full range of health concerns, from the physical to mental health. Often, she adds in a personal touch to give a sense of reality and potential applications by recounting details of cases from her past or examples in everyday life. It adds a very human quality to the book that keeps the science from being too analytical. I highly recommend this book to veterinarians, doctors, or anyone with a stake in the future of One Health medicine. So really essentially everyone. "
173,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3154417-connie-n,2,"This book took me a relatively long time to read. It wasn't all that bad, it was just pretty dry, like a lecture given by a professor who is really excited about her subject but she isn't dynamic enough to enthuse her students. The subject was fairly interesting, mainly that there are many, many diseases and conditions that correlate between humans and other species. The author suggests that it would be extremely helpful to the health of the world for veterinarians and physicians to work together toward the common goal of good healthcare. She writes, ""Because the fate of our world's health doesn't depend solely on how we humans fare. Rather, it will be determined by how all the patients on the planet live, grow, get sick, and heal."" The best part of the book, in my opinion, was how she approached each category of interest and compared humans to animals...the chapter Fat Planet talked about overeating, Roar-gasm talked about sexual practices, Grooming Gone Wild talked about self-mutilation, etc. Each subject was interesting. The problem for me was that she spent lots of time with each chapter, providing example after example to prove her point when I was convinced with a lot less words. This book didn't excite me, but I did gain a greater understanding and appreciation for the subject and for the author's attempts (as a human physician herself) to coordinate seminars and awareness among her colleagues, both human and animal-focused. BTW, she herself coined the word ""zoobiquity"" when she had an aha moment and discovered that an animal in the zoo she was consulting for had a disease very similar to one she was treating in a human. Zoobiquity is from the Greek for animal (zo) and the Latin for everywhere (ubique), joining 2 cultures as she proposes to join the 2 cultures of human and animal medicine."
174,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10445857-bill,2,"The main thesis behind Zoobiquity is that many diseases found in humans have analogues in animal populations and that veterinary and human medicine stand to learn from each other's fields. The book progresses through a series of chapters that each focus on a disease found in humans such as overeating or anorexia, self-harm, cancer, or substance abuse and then shows how similar conditions affect animal populations. In discussing the analogous animal diseases, Ms. Natterson-Horowitz gives the reader a framework for a broader and more compassionate approach to the human problem. For example, in the chapter on self-harm, Natterson-Horowitz shows how self-destructive animal behaviors in grooming (such as feather-plucking in birds or lick granuloma in dogs) have their roots in stress and isolation. She stresses the importance of using ""an evolutionary tool set to repair an evolutionary short circuit."" I thought the book was a little light in its treatment and could have gone deeper in many instances. Some of the material is better dealt with in other works, such as zoonotic disease spread written about in David Quamman's Spillover. Natterson-Horowitz is sometimes breathless over making the connections between animal and human diseases so that the phrases ""until that moment"" and ""imagine my surprise"" show up a few too many times. All in all, it was a light read and is a good non-fiction summer book. It was ok, perfectly ok; no more or less."
175,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7787544-taylor,4,"4.5/5For what this book *is* --a multispecies medical ethnography targeted at showing people the interconnectedness between humans and animals-- it is quite good. It has a goal in mind and meets it well.Barbara Natterson-Horowitz has written a medial treatise for general audiences to educate them (and maybe successfully convince some) on the benefits of cross species study in the medical field. She (and her coauthor) covers everything from fainting, to obesity, STDs, and growing up in the animal kingdom, providing evidence for each.If readers have successfully completed high school science courses (and beyond), much of this information will not be new. Rather, what is most informative is the intricate workings of the human body in terms of certain diseases, etc., and the similarities between those that are  not mammals.There is almost nothing wrong with this text, which is why I rate it so high. However, I did find myself with a few unanswerable questions that I would love to discuss with the author. Perhaps these questions could have been answered if the book itself was longer (really, it's only 244 pages in hardcover) and was not such a succinct read (i.e. more like a dense academic paper). Overall, this book just confirms the benefits of my personal beliefs and interest in multispecies study in all academic and professional fields (where relevant)."
176,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7508307-ronald,4,"We are animals. It's with other creatures that we share our anatomy. With lizards, horses, rhinos, frogs, dogs and cats we share organs like the heart, stomach and brain. And it's about time the medical community realized that. For too long, says Barbara Natterson-Horowitz, doctors and veterinarians have ignored each other. Well, the first group has done most of the ignoring.Uncovering diseases that are thought be uniquely human, Natterson-Horowitz builds a strong case that they are in fact really ubiquitous (common) in the animal kingdom. Hence the title 'Zoobiquity'. Diabetes, heart failure and even psychological problems such as anorexia and obsessive compulsive disorder have their analogs in other creatures.The downside is that the huge amount of information in the book is presented in repeatedly the same way. Each chapter starts with a strange affliction (whether in humans or animals), and then - surprise! - the affliction apparently can be found in many different species of animals. The novelty of it all wears off pretty quick, and by the last few chapters, 'Zoobiquity' feels like repetitive read.A must-read, but I guess it's best to check out in chunks. One chapter per week, or something."
177,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10196629-beverly,4,"This was really a fascinating book. It sometimes became a little dry and sometimes a little over the top with medical information but all in all, it was an eye-opening listen. Read by Karen White, who did a wonderful job, this amazing book taught me a number of things. I found out that koalas can contract chlamydia and, in fact, the species is actually being decimated by the disease. Gorillas can suffer from clinical depression and dinosaur remains show signs of brain tumors. The author, Barbara Natterson-Horowitz, is a cardiologist and had been asked to look at a Emperor tamarin at the Los Angeles Zoo. Although the patient was soon lost, Dr. Natterson-Horowitz discovered that wild animals can actually die from of cardiac arrest brought on by extreme emotional stress--just like humans. This set her on a path of looking into and writing about additional similarities between animals and us and she found plenty. She then teamed up with science journalist Kathryn Bowers, and together completed this book. Once you've read it, you'll realize that we not only have to worry about how we treat our planet and the environment but how we keep our pets and wild life as healthy as possible, it all is just very much intertwined. Very informative and interesting."
178,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3093693-angie-boyter,4,"This book is a real winner. The chapter on obesity was especially fascinating;I learned some things I would rather not know about my food.My only regret is that, not surprisingly given the author's profession as a physician (From the book: What do you call a physician? A veterinarian who can only treat one species.), the emphasis is on how what we learn about animals can help us with human health. I would have liked to see more about how we can use human medicine to improve animal health. All too many of us have loved our companion animals and lost them to medical conditions that would have been treatable in a human.Also, again ot surprising given the fact that the author is a cardiologist who started out as a psychiatrist, the emphasis was on heart problems and mental health. But Zoobiquity does not pretend to be a complete compendium comparing all interspecies medical issues. It effectively conveys the message that we are doing our health a disservice by our tendency to consider ourselves ""above"" and different from other animals and, along the way, very clearly and entertainingly presents fascinating information about health issues for humans and other species. "
179,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1906917-judith,3,"Zoobiquity: What Animals Can Teach Us about Health and the Science of Healing by Barbara Natterson-Horowitz and Kathryn Bowers began with the investigations of Dr. Natterson-Horowitz, cardiologist and professor at the UCLA Medical Center, based on her experience as Cardiac Consultant at the Los Angeles Zoo. Learning from veterinarians, she came to understand that the differences between human and animal medicine are comparatively minor, and that the potential benefits of collaboration are as vast as the huge numbers of disorders and diseases common to humans and other species. Until the Industrial Revolution made veterinary medicine into a rural speciality, many a country physician assisted as needed when farmers called. The subsequent barriers between veterinary and medical scientists were social constructs, not scientific distinctions. Dr. Natterson-Horowitz and journalist Kathryn Bowers offer a fascinating narrative of discovery in which they demonstrate the ubiquity of the same diseases in both animals and humans and how cooperation in the medical/veterinary community can advance healthcare for all.

199,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5473158-heather,5,"Back in the 19th century the same doctor that would treat humans in a town would also treat that town's animals. This is before the era of specialists, fancy hospitals and the basic separation of people and things that technology tends to bring to us on all levels as we advance. Of course medicine has ""improved"" vastly since the olden era, but author Dr. Barbara Natterson-Horowitz explains that having that understanding between man and animal can lend far more value to the world of medicine and even just philosophical understanding of the nature of life far beyond what our sophisticated modern medicine can tell. This is what this book explores and for her, it is an important connection and realization.Animals suffer from the same things we all do. In fact biologically we are deeply connected. One of the more intriguing chapters was on sexuality (titled: Roar-gasm) where the author makes a connection between things like the sex appeal of Elvis's curled lip and the animal kingdom. If you are intrigued by this chapter I encourage you to pick up a copy of The Red Queen: Sex and the Evolution of Human Nature by Matt Ridley. But sexuality is only one small piece of the pie in the connection of human and animal. Diseases are a big one, and probably the one connection that has lead to the most advancement in medicine as a result. But diseases go well beyond the typical cancers and heart disease. Animals can suffer from drug addictions, depression and even anorexia. The treatment of these diseases for animals can have a healing effect on humans too. One of the most touching chapters was ""Leaving the Nest"" that explores not just the process of growing up and spreading one's wings but also the aspect of bullying. Bullying is very prevelant in the animal kingdom too, as evidenced by those with the alpha personality. It is a test of dominance and strength, and the author points out that by observing how the various species reacts and evolves from these events can help us learn how to start looking for our solutions to the same complex issues our youth faces. The summary of the book is a perfect summary for life that many can find useful: ""Our essential connection with animals is ancient, and it runs deep. It extends from body to behavior, from psychology to society--forming the basis of our daily journey of survival. This calls for physicians and patients to think beyond the bedside to barnyards, jungles, oceans and skies. Because the fate of our world's health doesn't depend solely on how we humans fare. Rather, it will be determined by how all the patients on the planet live, grow, get sick, and heal"""
200,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15696054-delene-beeland,5,"As much as we attempt to divide ourselves from the rest of the animal kingdom, the truth is that members of Homo sapiens are, well, animals. So it shouldn’t raise eyebrows to learn that humans and animals share many common—and not so common—ailments, such as heart anomalies and cancers. In Zoobiquity, authors Barbara Natterson-Horowitz and Kathryn Bowers dig deeply into these commonalities. But they don’t simply search for similar diseases and afflictions shared by man and beast, they also explore and explain the possible evolutionary underpinnings of these links.Natterson-Horowitz is a practicing cardiologist at the University of California-Los Angeles Medical Center who began consulting at a regional zoo. Her forays into treating animal patients led her to understand that medical doctors and veterinarians often have different names for similar diseases and behaviors shared by their patients. In the book’s opening scene, Horowitz recalls how she realized that the risk of her Emperor tamarin patient developing capture myopathy was eerily similar to the human condition of takotsubo cardiomyopathy, which is also known as broken heart syndrome.After that experience, Horowitz began asking if animals get specific kinds of cancers. She discovered parallels between the tumors growing around branding sites in livestock to those growing around the traumatized skin of people’s tattoos and scarifications. And just as mutations in the BRCA1 gene are known to be connected to breast cancer in people, in some animals (such as jaguars and English springer spaniels), carriers of this mutated gene also develop breast cancers.Zoobiquity takes readers on a journey connecting the dots between seemingly unconnected behaviors: for example, how the roots of substance addiction and other self-destructive habits may actually be byproducts of survival strategies, and how fainting in people may be related to behaviors that evolved in prey animals to escape being eaten. (Full review here.)"
201,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1911547-brigitte,4,"  I highly enjoyed this book on looking at human and animal health as a whole, instead of separate issues (humans are animals, after all). As a scientist I was familiar with many of the examples used and they were used well. The book does a great job of linking a variety of issues into an organized whole.A few stray observations: I appreciated the mention that the food we eat bears no relation to its wild counterpart, because we've bread them for centuries if not longer to suit our purposes. It is not possible to eat non-genetically modified food, since humans have been doing it for so long. Our ancestors simply didn't know that the traits they were selecting for corresponded to specific genes.Early on the book mentions that through a process called epigenetics, the genes inherited by children could be different from the parents. This is absolutely not true - the DNA sequence (A,T,G,C) is the same from parent to child. What can be changed through epigenetics is how those genes are expressed - when, in what tissues/cells, and how much. Thus, if a parent suffers a period of starvation prior to the arrival of a child, even years before a child is born, that experience will be passed on through epigenetics, or how the DNA sequence is packaged and read by the cell. Think of it like a typical web page: a few favored links are at the top, important information is highlighted, and then further information is included as you scroll down the page. As events happen, the content is moved around. It is always still there, but certain events make specific content more readily available. The actions and experiences of a particular individual make his or her genes more or less readily available, and that availability is passed along through generations.The info on HIV/AIDS wasn't terribly specific, as there is evidence that the disease crossed species around the 1930s, and it was the traumatic upheavals caused by colonization of the interior of Africa that eventually unleashed the disease on the world."
202,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5448276-leah,4,"As a veterinary student it is utterly refreshing to see recognition of the importance of my profession in One Health. The author is not wrong about the rift between physicians and veterinarians. We are routinely looked down upon by physicians despite it being harder to get into vet school and a curriculum that is just as hard if not harder to stay in. To see a physician acknowledge the wealth of information we have to share is a delight. Her comparisons between human and animal diseases are illuminating in the terms of understanding how pathology plays out across species. In some ways I felt that I, and really veterinarians in general, already understood the message but I take hope in the idea that this book could potentially open the eyes of my human counterparts to the value of shared information. I know multiple veterinarians, particularly specialists, that keep up with human medical journals. As a profession we are quite aware of the similarities between diseases in various species. We also know that our research and treatments have significant potential economic impacts as well as future impacts on human health. Dr. Natterson does a wonderful job of not only building a narrative throughout each chapter, but of laying out medical differential diagnoses in a way that is both understandable and complete to the ordinary person. It will not go over your head. She addresses the full range of health concerns, from the physical to mental health. Often, she adds in a personal touch to give a sense of reality and potential applications by recounting details of cases from her past or examples in everyday life. It adds a very human quality to the book that keeps the science from being too analytical. I highly recommend this book to veterinarians, doctors, or anyone with a stake in the future of One Health medicine. So really essentially everyone. "
203,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3154417-connie-n,2,"This book took me a relatively long time to read. It wasn't all that bad, it was just pretty dry, like a lecture given by a professor who is really excited about her subject but she isn't dynamic enough to enthuse her students. The subject was fairly interesting, mainly that there are many, many diseases and conditions that correlate between humans and other species. The author suggests that it would be extremely helpful to the health of the world for veterinarians and physicians to work together toward the common goal of good healthcare. She writes, ""Because the fate of our world's health doesn't depend solely on how we humans fare. Rather, it will be determined by how all the patients on the planet live, grow, get sick, and heal."" The best part of the book, in my opinion, was how she approached each category of interest and compared humans to animals...the chapter Fat Planet talked about overeating, Roar-gasm talked about sexual practices, Grooming Gone Wild talked about self-mutilation, etc. Each subject was interesting. The problem for me was that she spent lots of time with each chapter, providing example after example to prove her point when I was convinced with a lot less words. This book didn't excite me, but I did gain a greater understanding and appreciation for the subject and for the author's attempts (as a human physician herself) to coordinate seminars and awareness among her colleagues, both human and animal-focused. BTW, she herself coined the word ""zoobiquity"" when she had an aha moment and discovered that an animal in the zoo she was consulting for had a disease very similar to one she was treating in a human. Zoobiquity is from the Greek for animal (zo) and the Latin for everywhere (ubique), joining 2 cultures as she proposes to join the 2 cultures of human and animal medicine."
204,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10445857-bill,2,"The main thesis behind Zoobiquity is that many diseases found in humans have analogues in animal populations and that veterinary and human medicine stand to learn from each other's fields. The book progresses through a series of chapters that each focus on a disease found in humans such as overeating or anorexia, self-harm, cancer, or substance abuse and then shows how similar conditions affect animal populations. In discussing the analogous animal diseases, Ms. Natterson-Horowitz gives the reader a framework for a broader and more compassionate approach to the human problem. For example, in the chapter on self-harm, Natterson-Horowitz shows how self-destructive animal behaviors in grooming (such as feather-plucking in birds or lick granuloma in dogs) have their roots in stress and isolation. She stresses the importance of using ""an evolutionary tool set to repair an evolutionary short circuit."" I thought the book was a little light in its treatment and could have gone deeper in many instances. Some of the material is better dealt with in other works, such as zoonotic disease spread written about in David Quamman's Spillover. Natterson-Horowitz is sometimes breathless over making the connections between animal and human diseases so that the phrases ""until that moment"" and ""imagine my surprise"" show up a few too many times. All in all, it was a light read and is a good non-fiction summer book. It was ok, perfectly ok; no more or less."
205,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7787544-taylor,4,"4.5/5For what this book *is* --a multispecies medical ethnography targeted at showing people the interconnectedness between humans and animals-- it is quite good. It has a goal in mind and meets it well.Barbara Natterson-Horowitz has written a medial treatise for general audiences to educate them (and maybe successfully convince some) on the benefits of cross species study in the medical field. She (and her coauthor) covers everything from fainting, to obesity, STDs, and growing up in the animal kingdom, providing evidence for each.If readers have successfully completed high school science courses (and beyond), much of this information will not be new. Rather, what is most informative is the intricate workings of the human body in terms of certain diseases, etc., and the similarities between those that are  not mammals.There is almost nothing wrong with this text, which is why I rate it so high. However, I did find myself with a few unanswerable questions that I would love to discuss with the author. Perhaps these questions could have been answered if the book itself was longer (really, it's only 244 pages in hardcover) and was not such a succinct read (i.e. more like a dense academic paper). Overall, this book just confirms the benefits of my personal beliefs and interest in multispecies study in all academic and professional fields (where relevant)."
206,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7508307-ronald,4,"We are animals. It's with other creatures that we share our anatomy. With lizards, horses, rhinos, frogs, dogs and cats we share organs like the heart, stomach and brain. And it's about time the medical community realized that. For too long, says Barbara Natterson-Horowitz, doctors and veterinarians have ignored each other. Well, the first group has done most of the ignoring.Uncovering diseases that are thought be uniquely human, Natterson-Horowitz builds a strong case that they are in fact really ubiquitous (common) in the animal kingdom. Hence the title 'Zoobiquity'. Diabetes, heart failure and even psychological problems such as anorexia and obsessive compulsive disorder have their analogs in other creatures.The downside is that the huge amount of information in the book is presented in repeatedly the same way. Each chapter starts with a strange affliction (whether in humans or animals), and then - surprise! - the affliction apparently can be found in many different species of animals. The novelty of it all wears off pretty quick, and by the last few chapters, 'Zoobiquity' feels like repetitive read.A must-read, but I guess it's best to check out in chunks. One chapter per week, or something."
207,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10196629-beverly,4,"This was really a fascinating book. It sometimes became a little dry and sometimes a little over the top with medical information but all in all, it was an eye-opening listen. Read by Karen White, who did a wonderful job, this amazing book taught me a number of things. I found out that koalas can contract chlamydia and, in fact, the species is actually being decimated by the disease. Gorillas can suffer from clinical depression and dinosaur remains show signs of brain tumors. The author, Barbara Natterson-Horowitz, is a cardiologist and had been asked to look at a Emperor tamarin at the Los Angeles Zoo. Although the patient was soon lost, Dr. Natterson-Horowitz discovered that wild animals can actually die from of cardiac arrest brought on by extreme emotional stress--just like humans. This set her on a path of looking into and writing about additional similarities between animals and us and she found plenty. She then teamed up with science journalist Kathryn Bowers, and together completed this book. Once you've read it, you'll realize that we not only have to worry about how we treat our planet and the environment but how we keep our pets and wild life as healthy as possible, it all is just very much intertwined. Very informative and interesting."
208,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3093693-angie-boyter,4,"This book is a real winner. The chapter on obesity was especially fascinating;I learned some things I would rather not know about my food.My only regret is that, not surprisingly given the author's profession as a physician (From the book: What do you call a physician? A veterinarian who can only treat one species.), the emphasis is on how what we learn about animals can help us with human health. I would have liked to see more about how we can use human medicine to improve animal health. All too many of us have loved our companion animals and lost them to medical conditions that would have been treatable in a human.Also, again ot surprising given the fact that the author is a cardiologist who started out as a psychiatrist, the emphasis was on heart problems and mental health. But Zoobiquity does not pretend to be a complete compendium comparing all interspecies medical issues. It effectively conveys the message that we are doing our health a disservice by our tendency to consider ourselves ""above"" and different from other animals and, along the way, very clearly and entertainingly presents fascinating information about health issues for humans and other species. "
209,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1906917-judith,3,"Zoobiquity: What Animals Can Teach Us about Health and the Science of Healing by Barbara Natterson-Horowitz and Kathryn Bowers began with the investigations of Dr. Natterson-Horowitz, cardiologist and professor at the UCLA Medical Center, based on her experience as Cardiac Consultant at the Los Angeles Zoo. Learning from veterinarians, she came to understand that the differences between human and animal medicine are comparatively minor, and that the potential benefits of collaboration are as vast as the huge numbers of disorders and diseases common to humans and other species. Until the Industrial Revolution made veterinary medicine into a rural speciality, many a country physician assisted as needed when farmers called. The subsequent barriers between veterinary and medical scientists were social constructs, not scientific distinctions. Dr. Natterson-Horowitz and journalist Kathryn Bowers offer a fascinating narrative of discovery in which they demonstrate the ubiquity of the same diseases in both animals and humans and how cooperation in the medical/veterinary community can advance healthcare for all.

I don't know how much water some of them actually hold, but just about every connection between humans and animals that the authors propose is worth some thought. For example, is it actually true that surly teenagers avoid eye contact with their parents because of a subconscious instinct to avoid challenging an older or dominant figure, much as dogs avoid eye contact to prevent a fight? I have no idea. But it's an interesting thought, and maybe when my son is that age, I'll remember it and it'll make dealing with the reality a little easier. "

229,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5473158-heather,5,"Back in the 19th century the same doctor that would treat humans in a town would also treat that town's animals. This is before the era of specialists, fancy hospitals and the basic separation of people and things that technology tends to bring to us on all levels as we advance. Of course medicine has ""improved"" vastly since the olden era, but author Dr. Barbara Natterson-Horowitz explains that having that understanding between man and animal can lend far more value to the world of medicine and even just philosophical understanding of the nature of life far beyond what our sophisticated modern medicine can tell. This is what this book explores and for her, it is an important connection and realization.Animals suffer from the same things we all do. In fact biologically we are deeply connected. One of the more intriguing chapters was on sexuality (titled: Roar-gasm) where the author makes a connection between things like the sex appeal of Elvis's curled lip and the animal kingdom. If you are intrigued by this chapter I encourage you to pick up a copy of The Red Queen: Sex and the Evolution of Human Nature by Matt Ridley. But sexuality is only one small piece of the pie in the connection of human and animal. Diseases are a big one, and probably the one connection that has lead to the most advancement in medicine as a result. But diseases go well beyond the typical cancers and heart disease. Animals can suffer from drug addictions, depression and even anorexia. The treatment of these diseases for animals can have a healing effect on humans too. One of the most touching chapters was ""Leaving the Nest"" that explores not just the process of growing up and spreading one's wings but also the aspect of bullying. Bullying is very prevelant in the animal kingdom too, as evidenced by those with the alpha personality. It is a test of dominance and strength, and the author points out that by observing how the various species reacts and evolves from these events can help us learn how to start looking for our solutions to the same complex issues our youth faces. The summary of the book is a perfect summary for life that many can find useful: ""Our essential connection with animals is ancient, and it runs deep. It extends from body to behavior, from psychology to society--forming the basis of our daily journey of survival. This calls for physicians and patients to think beyond the bedside to barnyards, jungles, oceans and skies. Because the fate of our world's health doesn't depend solely on how we humans fare. Rather, it will be determined by how all the patients on the planet live, grow, get sick, and heal"""
230,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15696054-delene-beeland,5,"As much as we attempt to divide ourselves from the rest of the animal kingdom, the truth is that members of Homo sapiens are, well, animals. So it shouldn’t raise eyebrows to learn that humans and animals share many common—and not so common—ailments, such as heart anomalies and cancers. In Zoobiquity, authors Barbara Natterson-Horowitz and Kathryn Bowers dig deeply into these commonalities. But they don’t simply search for similar diseases and afflictions shared by man and beast, they also explore and explain the possible evolutionary underpinnings of these links.Natterson-Horowitz is a practicing cardiologist at the University of California-Los Angeles Medical Center who began consulting at a regional zoo. Her forays into treating animal patients led her to understand that medical doctors and veterinarians often have different names for similar diseases and behaviors shared by their patients. In the book’s opening scene, Horowitz recalls how she realized that the risk of her Emperor tamarin patient developing capture myopathy was eerily similar to the human condition of takotsubo cardiomyopathy, which is also known as broken heart syndrome.After that experience, Horowitz began asking if animals get specific kinds of cancers. She discovered parallels between the tumors growing around branding sites in livestock to those growing around the traumatized skin of people’s tattoos and scarifications. And just as mutations in the BRCA1 gene are known to be connected to breast cancer in people, in some animals (such as jaguars and English springer spaniels), carriers of this mutated gene also develop breast cancers.Zoobiquity takes readers on a journey connecting the dots between seemingly unconnected behaviors: for example, how the roots of substance addiction and other self-destructive habits may actually be byproducts of survival strategies, and how fainting in people may be related to behaviors that evolved in prey animals to escape being eaten. (Full review here.)"
231,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1911547-brigitte,4,"  I highly enjoyed this book on looking at human and animal health as a whole, instead of separate issues (humans are animals, after all). As a scientist I was familiar with many of the examples used and they were used well. The book does a great job of linking a variety of issues into an organized whole.A few stray observations: I appreciated the mention that the food we eat bears no relation to its wild counterpart, because we've bread them for centuries if not longer to suit our purposes. It is not possible to eat non-genetically modified food, since humans have been doing it for so long. Our ancestors simply didn't know that the traits they were selecting for corresponded to specific genes.Early on the book mentions that through a process called epigenetics, the genes inherited by children could be different from the parents. This is absolutely not true - the DNA sequence (A,T,G,C) is the same from parent to child. What can be changed through epigenetics is how those genes are expressed - when, in what tissues/cells, and how much. Thus, if a parent suffers a period of starvation prior to the arrival of a child, even years before a child is born, that experience will be passed on through epigenetics, or how the DNA sequence is packaged and read by the cell. Think of it like a typical web page: a few favored links are at the top, important information is highlighted, and then further information is included as you scroll down the page. As events happen, the content is moved around. It is always still there, but certain events make specific content more readily available. The actions and experiences of a particular individual make his or her genes more or less readily available, and that availability is passed along through generations.The info on HIV/AIDS wasn't terribly specific, as there is evidence that the disease crossed species around the 1930s, and it was the traumatic upheavals caused by colonization of the interior of Africa that eventually unleashed the disease on the world."
232,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5448276-leah,4,"As a veterinary student it is utterly refreshing to see recognition of the importance of my profession in One Health. The author is not wrong about the rift between physicians and veterinarians. We are routinely looked down upon by physicians despite it being harder to get into vet school and a curriculum that is just as hard if not harder to stay in. To see a physician acknowledge the wealth of information we have to share is a delight. Her comparisons between human and animal diseases are illuminating in the terms of understanding how pathology plays out across species. In some ways I felt that I, and really veterinarians in general, already understood the message but I take hope in the idea that this book could potentially open the eyes of my human counterparts to the value of shared information. I know multiple veterinarians, particularly specialists, that keep up with human medical journals. As a profession we are quite aware of the similarities between diseases in various species. We also know that our research and treatments have significant potential economic impacts as well as future impacts on human health. Dr. Natterson does a wonderful job of not only building a narrative throughout each chapter, but of laying out medical differential diagnoses in a way that is both understandable and complete to the ordinary person. It will not go over your head. She addresses the full range of health concerns, from the physical to mental health. Often, she adds in a personal touch to give a sense of reality and potential applications by recounting details of cases from her past or examples in everyday life. It adds a very human quality to the book that keeps the science from being too analytical. I highly recommend this book to veterinarians, doctors, or anyone with a stake in the future of One Health medicine. So really essentially everyone. "
233,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3154417-connie-n,2,"This book took me a relatively long time to read. It wasn't all that bad, it was just pretty dry, like a lecture given by a professor who is really excited about her subject but she isn't dynamic enough to enthuse her students. The subject was fairly interesting, mainly that there are many, many diseases and conditions that correlate between humans and other species. The author suggests that it would be extremely helpful to the health of the world for veterinarians and physicians to work together toward the common goal of good healthcare. She writes, ""Because the fate of our world's health doesn't depend solely on how we humans fare. Rather, it will be determined by how all the patients on the planet live, grow, get sick, and heal."" The best part of the book, in my opinion, was how she approached each category of interest and compared humans to animals...the chapter Fat Planet talked about overeating, Roar-gasm talked about sexual practices, Grooming Gone Wild talked about self-mutilation, etc. Each subject was interesting. The problem for me was that she spent lots of time with each chapter, providing example after example to prove her point when I was convinced with a lot less words. This book didn't excite me, but I did gain a greater understanding and appreciation for the subject and for the author's attempts (as a human physician herself) to coordinate seminars and awareness among her colleagues, both human and animal-focused. BTW, she herself coined the word ""zoobiquity"" when she had an aha moment and discovered that an animal in the zoo she was consulting for had a disease very similar to one she was treating in a human. Zoobiquity is from the Greek for animal (zo) and the Latin for everywhere (ubique), joining 2 cultures as she proposes to join the 2 cultures of human and animal medicine."
234,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10445857-bill,2,"The main thesis behind Zoobiquity is that many diseases found in humans have analogues in animal populations and that veterinary and human medicine stand to learn from each other's fields. The book progresses through a series of chapters that each focus on a disease found in humans such as overeating or anorexia, self-harm, cancer, or substance abuse and then shows how similar conditions affect animal populations. In discussing the analogous animal diseases, Ms. Natterson-Horowitz gives the reader a framework for a broader and more compassionate approach to the human problem. For example, in the chapter on self-harm, Natterson-Horowitz shows how self-destructive animal behaviors in grooming (such as feather-plucking in birds or lick granuloma in dogs) have their roots in stress and isolation. She stresses the importance of using ""an evolutionary tool set to repair an evolutionary short circuit."" I thought the book was a little light in its treatment and could have gone deeper in many instances. Some of the material is better dealt with in other works, such as zoonotic disease spread written about in David Quamman's Spillover. Natterson-Horowitz is sometimes breathless over making the connections between animal and human diseases so that the phrases ""until that moment"" and ""imagine my surprise"" show up a few too many times. All in all, it was a light read and is a good non-fiction summer book. It was ok, perfectly ok; no more or less."
235,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7787544-taylor,4,"4.5/5For what this book *is* --a multispecies medical ethnography targeted at showing people the interconnectedness between humans and animals-- it is quite good. It has a goal in mind and meets it well.Barbara Natterson-Horowitz has written a medial treatise for general audiences to educate them (and maybe successfully convince some) on the benefits of cross species study in the medical field. She (and her coauthor) covers everything from fainting, to obesity, STDs, and growing up in the animal kingdom, providing evidence for each.If readers have successfully completed high school science courses (and beyond), much of this information will not be new. Rather, what is most informative is the intricate workings of the human body in terms of certain diseases, etc., and the similarities between those that are  not mammals.There is almost nothing wrong with this text, which is why I rate it so high. However, I did find myself with a few unanswerable questions that I would love to discuss with the author. Perhaps these questions could have been answered if the book itself was longer (really, it's only 244 pages in hardcover) and was not such a succinct read (i.e. more like a dense academic paper). Overall, this book just confirms the benefits of my personal beliefs and interest in multispecies study in all academic and professional fields (where relevant)."
236,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7508307-ronald,4,"We are animals. It's with other creatures that we share our anatomy. With lizards, horses, rhinos, frogs, dogs and cats we share organs like the heart, stomach and brain. And it's about time the medical community realized that. For too long, says Barbara Natterson-Horowitz, doctors and veterinarians have ignored each other. Well, the first group has done most of the ignoring.Uncovering diseases that are thought be uniquely human, Natterson-Horowitz builds a strong case that they are in fact really ubiquitous (common) in the animal kingdom. Hence the title 'Zoobiquity'. Diabetes, heart failure and even psychological problems such as anorexia and obsessive compulsive disorder have their analogs in other creatures.The downside is that the huge amount of information in the book is presented in repeatedly the same way. Each chapter starts with a strange affliction (whether in humans or animals), and then - surprise! - the affliction apparently can be found in many different species of animals. The novelty of it all wears off pretty quick, and by the last few chapters, 'Zoobiquity' feels like repetitive read.A must-read, but I guess it's best to check out in chunks. One chapter per week, or something."
237,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10196629-beverly,4,"This was really a fascinating book. It sometimes became a little dry and sometimes a little over the top with medical information but all in all, it was an eye-opening listen. Read by Karen White, who did a wonderful job, this amazing book taught me a number of things. I found out that koalas can contract chlamydia and, in fact, the species is actually being decimated by the disease. Gorillas can suffer from clinical depression and dinosaur remains show signs of brain tumors. The author, Barbara Natterson-Horowitz, is a cardiologist and had been asked to look at a Emperor tamarin at the Los Angeles Zoo. Although the patient was soon lost, Dr. Natterson-Horowitz discovered that wild animals can actually die from of cardiac arrest brought on by extreme emotional stress--just like humans. This set her on a path of looking into and writing about additional similarities between animals and us and she found plenty. She then teamed up with science journalist Kathryn Bowers, and together completed this book. Once you've read it, you'll realize that we not only have to worry about how we treat our planet and the environment but how we keep our pets and wild life as healthy as possible, it all is just very much intertwined. Very informative and interesting."
238,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3093693-angie-boyter,4,"This book is a real winner. The chapter on obesity was especially fascinating;I learned some things I would rather not know about my food.My only regret is that, not surprisingly given the author's profession as a physician (From the book: What do you call a physician? A veterinarian who can only treat one species.), the emphasis is on how what we learn about animals can help us with human health. I would have liked to see more about how we can use human medicine to improve animal health. All too many of us have loved our companion animals and lost them to medical conditions that would have been treatable in a human.Also, again ot surprising given the fact that the author is a cardiologist who started out as a psychiatrist, the emphasis was on heart problems and mental health. But Zoobiquity does not pretend to be a complete compendium comparing all interspecies medical issues. It effectively conveys the message that we are doing our health a disservice by our tendency to consider ourselves ""above"" and different from other animals and, along the way, very clearly and entertainingly presents fascinating information about health issues for humans and other species.

Learning from veterinarians, she came to understand that the differences between human and animal medicine are comparatively minor, and that the potential benefits of collaboration are as vast as the huge numbers of disorders and diseases common to humans and other species. Until the Industrial Revolution made veterinary medicine into a rural speciality, many a country physician assisted as needed when farmers called. The subsequent barriers between veterinary and medical scientists were social constructs, not scientific distinctions. Dr. Natterson-Horowitz and journalist Kathryn Bowers offer a fascinating narrative of discovery in which they demonstrate the ubiquity of the same diseases in both animals and humans and how cooperation in the medical/veterinary community can advance healthcare for all.

I don't know how much water some of them actually hold, but just about every connection between humans and animals that the authors propose is worth some thought. For example, is it actually true that surly teenagers avoid eye contact with their parents because of a subconscious instinct to avoid challenging an older or dominant figure, much as dogs avoid eye contact to prevent a fight? I have no idea. But it's an interesting thought, and maybe when my son is that age, I'll remember it and it'll make dealing with the reality a little easier. "

259,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5473158-heather,5,"Back in the 19th century the same doctor that would treat humans in a town would also treat that town's animals. This is before the era of specialists, fancy hospitals and the basic separation of people and things that technology tends to bring to us on all levels as we advance. Of course medicine has ""improved"" vastly since the olden era, but author Dr. Barbara Natterson-Horowitz explains that having that understanding between man and animal can lend far more value to the world of medicine and even just philosophical understanding of the nature of life far beyond what our sophisticated modern medicine can tell. This is what this book explores and for her, it is an important connection and realization.Animals suffer from the same things we all do. In fact biologically we are deeply connected. One of the more intriguing chapters was on sexuality (titled: Roar-gasm) where the author makes a connection between things like the sex appeal of Elvis's curled lip and the animal kingdom. If you are intrigued by this chapter I encourage you to pick up a copy of The Red Queen: Sex and the Evolution of Human Nature by Matt Ridley. But sexuality is only one small piece of the pie in the connection of human and animal. Diseases are a big one, and probably the one connection that has lead to the most advancement in medicine as a result. But diseases go well beyond the typical cancers and heart disease. Animals can suffer from drug addictions, depression and even anorexia. The treatment of these diseases for animals can have a healing effect on humans too. One of the most touching chapters was ""Leaving the Nest"" that explores not just the process of growing up and spreading one's wings but also the aspect of bullying. Bullying is very prevelant in the animal kingdom too, as evidenced by those with the alpha personality. It is a test of dominance and strength, and the author points out that by observing how the various species reacts and evolves from these events can help us learn how to start looking for our solutions to the same complex issues our youth faces. The summary of the book is a perfect summary for life that many can find useful: ""Our essential connection with animals is ancient, and it runs deep. It extends from body to behavior, from psychology to society--forming the basis of our daily journey of survival. This calls for physicians and patients to think beyond the bedside to barnyards, jungles, oceans and skies. Because the fate of our world's health doesn't depend solely on how we humans fare. Rather, it will be determined by how all the patients on the planet live, grow, get sick, and heal"""
260,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15696054-delene-beeland,5,"As much as we attempt to divide ourselves from the rest of the animal kingdom, the truth is that members of Homo sapiens are, well, animals. So it shouldn’t raise eyebrows to learn that humans and animals share many common—and not so common—ailments, such as heart anomalies and cancers. In Zoobiquity, authors Barbara Natterson-Horowitz and Kathryn Bowers dig deeply into these commonalities. But they don’t simply search for similar diseases and afflictions shared by man and beast, they also explore and explain the possible evolutionary underpinnings of these links.Natterson-Horowitz is a practicing cardiologist at the University of California-Los Angeles Medical Center who began consulting at a regional zoo. Her forays into treating animal patients led her to understand that medical doctors and veterinarians often have different names for similar diseases and behaviors shared by their patients. In the book’s opening scene, Horowitz recalls how she realized that the risk of her Emperor tamarin patient developing capture myopathy was eerily similar to the human condition of takotsubo cardiomyopathy, which is also known as broken heart syndrome.After that experience, Horowitz began asking if animals get specific kinds of cancers. She discovered parallels between the tumors growing around branding sites in livestock to those growing around the traumatized skin of people’s tattoos and scarifications. And just as mutations in the BRCA1 gene are known to be connected to breast cancer in people, in some animals (such as jaguars and English springer spaniels), carriers of this mutated gene also develop breast cancers.Zoobiquity takes readers on a journey connecting the dots between seemingly unconnected behaviors: for example, how the roots of substance addiction and other self-destructive habits may actually be byproducts of survival strategies, and how fainting in people may be related to behaviors that evolved in prey animals to escape being eaten. (Full review here.)"
261,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1911547-brigitte,4,"  I highly enjoyed this book on looking at human and animal health as a whole, instead of separate issues (humans are animals, after all). As a scientist I was familiar with many of the examples used and they were used well. The book does a great job of linking a variety of issues into an organized whole.A few stray observations: I appreciated the mention that the food we eat bears no relation to its wild counterpart, because we've bread them for centuries if not longer to suit our purposes. It is not possible to eat non-genetically modified food, since humans have been doing it for so long. Our ancestors simply didn't know that the traits they were selecting for corresponded to specific genes.Early on the book mentions that through a process called epigenetics, the genes inherited by children could be different from the parents. This is absolutely not true - the DNA sequence (A,T,G,C) is the same from parent to child. What can be changed through epigenetics is how those genes are expressed - when, in what tissues/cells, and how much. Thus, if a parent suffers a period of starvation prior to the arrival of a child, even years before a child is born, that experience will be passed on through epigenetics, or how the DNA sequence is packaged and read by the cell. Think of it like a typical web page: a few favored links are at the top, important information is highlighted, and then further information is included as you scroll down the page. As events happen, the content is moved around. It is always still there, but certain events make specific content more readily available. The actions and experiences of a particular individual make his or her genes more or less readily available, and that availability is passed along through generations.The info on HIV/AIDS wasn't terribly specific, as there is evidence that the disease crossed species around the 1930s, and it was the traumatic upheavals caused by colonization of the interior of Africa that eventually unleashed the disease on the world."
262,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5448276-leah,4,"As a veterinary student it is utterly refreshing to see recognition of the importance of my profession in One Health. The author is not wrong about the rift between physicians and veterinarians. We are routinely looked down upon by physicians despite it being harder to get into vet school and a curriculum that is just as hard if not harder to stay in. To see a physician acknowledge the wealth of information we have to share is a delight. Her comparisons between human and animal diseases are illuminating in the terms of understanding how pathology plays out across species. In some ways I felt that I, and really veterinarians in general, already understood the message but I take hope in the idea that this book could potentially open the eyes of my human counterparts to the value of shared information. I know multiple veterinarians, particularly specialists, that keep up with human medical journals. As a profession we are quite aware of the similarities between diseases in various species. We also know that our research and treatments have significant potential economic impacts as well as future impacts on human health. Dr. Natterson does a wonderful job of not only building a narrative throughout each chapter, but of laying out medical differential diagnoses in a way that is both understandable and complete to the ordinary person. It will not go over your head. She addresses the full range of health concerns, from the physical to mental health. Often, she adds in a personal touch to give a sense of reality and potential applications by recounting details of cases from her past or examples in everyday life. It adds a very human quality to the book that keeps the science from being too analytical. I highly recommend this book to veterinarians, doctors, or anyone with a stake in the future of One Health medicine. So really essentially everyone. "
263,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3154417-connie-n,2,"This book took me a relatively long time to read. It wasn't all that bad, it was just pretty dry, like a lecture given by a professor who is really excited about her subject but she isn't dynamic enough to enthuse her students. The subject was fairly interesting, mainly that there are many, many diseases and conditions that correlate between humans and other species. The author suggests that it would be extremely helpful to the health of the world for veterinarians and physicians to work together toward the common goal of good healthcare. She writes, ""Because the fate of our world's health doesn't depend solely on how we humans fare. Rather, it will be determined by how all the patients on the planet live, grow, get sick, and heal."" The best part of the book, in my opinion, was how she approached each category of interest and compared humans to animals...the chapter Fat Planet talked about overeating, Roar-gasm talked about sexual practices, Grooming Gone Wild talked about self-mutilation, etc. Each subject was interesting. The problem for me was that she spent lots of time with each chapter, providing example after example to prove her point when I was convinced with a lot less words. This book didn't excite me, but I did gain a greater understanding and appreciation for the subject and for the author's attempts (as a human physician herself) to coordinate seminars and awareness among her colleagues, both human and animal-focused. BTW, she herself coined the word ""zoobiquity"" when she had an aha moment and discovered that an animal in the zoo she was consulting for had a disease very similar to one she was treating in a human. Zoobiquity is from the Greek for animal (zo) and the Latin for everywhere (ubique), joining 2 cultures as she proposes to join the 2 cultures of human and animal medicine."
264,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10445857-bill,2,"The main thesis behind Zoobiquity is that many diseases found in humans have analogues in animal populations and that veterinary and human medicine stand to learn from each other's fields. The book progresses through a series of chapters that each focus on a disease found in humans such as overeating or anorexia, self-harm, cancer, or substance abuse and then shows how similar conditions affect animal populations. In discussing the analogous animal diseases, Ms. Natterson-Horowitz gives the reader a framework for a broader and more compassionate approach to the human problem. For example, in the chapter on self-harm, Natterson-Horowitz shows how self-destructive animal behaviors in grooming (such as feather-plucking in birds or lick granuloma in dogs) have their roots in stress and isolation. She stresses the importance of using ""an evolutionary tool set to repair an evolutionary short circuit."" I thought the book was a little light in its treatment and could have gone deeper in many instances. Some of the material is better dealt with in other works, such as zoonotic disease spread written about in David Quamman's Spillover. Natterson-Horowitz is sometimes breathless over making the connections between animal and human diseases so that the phrases ""until that moment"" and ""imagine my surprise"" show up a few too many times. All in all, it was a light read and is a good non-fiction summer book. It was ok, perfectly ok; no more or less."
265,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7787544-taylor,4,"4.5/5For what this book *is* --a multispecies medical ethnography targeted at showing people the interconnectedness between humans and animals-- it is quite good. It has a goal in mind and meets it well.Barbara Natterson-Horowitz has written a medial treatise for general audiences to educate them (and maybe successfully convince some) on the benefits of cross species study in the medical field. She (and her coauthor) covers everything from fainting, to obesity, STDs, and growing up in the animal kingdom, providing evidence for each.If readers have successfully completed high school science courses (and beyond), much of this information will not be new. Rather, what is most informative is the intricate workings of the human body in terms of certain diseases, etc., and the similarities between those that are  not mammals.There is almost nothing wrong with this text, which is why I rate it so high. However, I did find myself with a few unanswerable questions that I would love to discuss with the author. Perhaps these questions could have been answered if the book itself was longer (really, it's only 244 pages in hardcover) and was not such a succinct read (i.e. more like a dense academic paper). Overall, this book just confirms the benefits of my personal beliefs and interest in multispecies study in all academic and professional fields (where relevant)."
266,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7508307-ronald,4,"We are animals. It's with other creatures that we share our anatomy. With lizards, horses, rhinos, frogs, dogs and cats we share organs like the heart, stomach and brain. And it's about time the medical community realized that. For too long, says Barbara Natterson-Horowitz, doctors and veterinarians have ignored each other. Well, the first group has done most of the ignoring.Uncovering diseases that are thought be uniquely human, Natterson-Horowitz builds a strong case that they are in fact really ubiquitous (common) in the animal kingdom. Hence the title 'Zoobiquity'. Diabetes, heart failure and even psychological problems such as anorexia and obsessive compulsive disorder have their analogs in other creatures.The downside is that the huge amount of information in the book is presented in repeatedly the same way. Each chapter starts with a strange affliction (whether in humans or animals), and then - surprise! - the affliction apparently can be found in many different species of animals. The novelty of it all wears off pretty quick, and by the last few chapters, 'Zoobiquity' feels like repetitive read.A must-read, but I guess it's best to check out in chunks. One chapter per week, or something."
267,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10196629-beverly,4,"This was really a fascinating book. It sometimes became a little dry and sometimes a little over the top with medical information but all in all, it was an eye-opening listen. Read by Karen White, who did a wonderful job, this amazing book taught me a number of things. I found out that koalas can contract chlamydia and, in fact, the species is actually being decimated by the disease. Gorillas can suffer from clinical depression and dinosaur remains show signs of brain tumors. The author, Barbara Natterson-Horowitz, is a cardiologist and had been asked to look at a Emperor tamarin at the Los Angeles Zoo. Although the patient was soon lost, Dr. Natterson-Horowitz discovered that wild animals can actually die from of cardiac arrest brought on by extreme emotional stress--just like humans. This set her on a path of looking into and writing about additional similarities between animals and us and she found plenty. She then teamed up with science journalist Kathryn Bowers, and together completed this book. Once you've read it, you'll realize that we not only have to worry about how we treat our planet and the environment but how we keep our pets and wild life as healthy as possible, it all is just very much intertwined. Very informative and interesting."
268,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3093693-angie-boyter,4,"This book is a real winner. The chapter on obesity was especially fascinating;I learned some things I would rather not know about my food.My only regret is that, not surprisingly given the author's profession as a physician (From the book: What do you call a physician? A veterinarian who can only treat one species.), the emphasis is on how what we learn about animals can help us with human health. I would have liked to see more about how we can use human medicine to improve animal health. All too many of us have loved our companion animals and lost them to medical conditions that would have been treatable in a human.Also, again ot surprising given the fact that the author is a cardiologist who started out as a psychiatrist, the emphasis was on heart problems and mental health. But Zoobiquity does not pretend to be a complete compendium comparing all interspecies medical issues. It effectively conveys the message that we are doing our health a disservice by our tendency to consider ourselves ""above"" and different from other animals and, along the way, very clearly and entertainingly presents fascinating information about health issues for humans and other species. "
269,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1906917-judith,3,"Zoobiquity: What Animals Can Teach Us about Health and the Science of Healing by Barbara Natterson-Horowitz and Kathryn Bowers began with the investigations of Dr. Natterson-Horowitz, cardiologist and professor at the UCLA Medical Center, based on her experience as Cardiac Consultant at the Los Angeles Zoo. Learning from veterinarians, she came to understand that the differences between human and animal medicine are comparatively minor, and that the potential benefits of collaboration are as vast as the huge numbers of disorders and diseases common to humans and other species. Until the Industrial Revolution made veterinary medicine into a rural speciality, many a country physician assisted as needed when farmers called. The subsequent barriers between veterinary and medical scientists were social constructs, not scientific distinctions. Dr. Natterson-Horowitz and journalist Kathryn Bowers offer a fascinating narrative of discovery in which they demonstrate the ubiquity of the same diseases in both animals and humans and how cooperation in the medical/veterinary community can advance healthcare for all.

Engaging writing style, lots of interesting anecdotes.

271,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4265436-nicole,4,"The theories and ideas in this book were very interesting. I don't know how much water some of them actually hold, but just about every connection between humans and animals that the authors propose is worth some thought. For example, is it actually true that surly teenagers avoid eye contact with their parents because of a subconscious instinct to avoid challenging an older or dominant figure, much as dogs avoid eye contact to prevent a fight? I have no idea. But it's an interesting thought, and maybe when my son is that age, I'll remember it and it'll make dealing with the reality a little easier. "

What a wonderful treat, a well-deserved five-star effort, I highly recommend it!Further suggestions: ""Why Evolution Is True"" by Jerry A.

289,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5473158-heather,5,"Back in the 19th century the same doctor that would treat humans in a town would also treat that town's animals. This is before the era of specialists, fancy hospitals and the basic separation of people and things that technology tends to bring to us on all levels as we advance. Of course medicine has ""improved"" vastly since the olden era, but author Dr. Barbara Natterson-Horowitz explains that having that understanding between man and animal can lend far more value to the world of medicine and even just philosophical understanding of the nature of life far beyond what our sophisticated modern medicine can tell. This is what this book explores and for her, it is an important connection and realization.Animals suffer from the same things we all do. In fact biologically we are deeply connected. One of the more intriguing chapters was on sexuality (titled: Roar-gasm) where the author makes a connection between things like the sex appeal of Elvis's curled lip and the animal kingdom. If you are intrigued by this chapter I encourage you to pick up a copy of The Red Queen: Sex and the Evolution of Human Nature by Matt Ridley. But sexuality is only one small piece of the pie in the connection of human and animal. Diseases are a big one, and probably the one connection that has lead to the most advancement in medicine as a result. But diseases go well beyond the typical cancers and heart disease. Animals can suffer from drug addictions, depression and even anorexia. The treatment of these diseases for animals can have a healing effect on humans too. One of the most touching chapters was ""Leaving the Nest"" that explores not just the process of growing up and spreading one's wings but also the aspect of bullying. Bullying is very prevelant in the animal kingdom too, as evidenced by those with the alpha personality. It is a test of dominance and strength, and the author points out that by observing how the various species reacts and evolves from these events can help us learn how to start looking for our solutions to the same complex issues our youth faces. The summary of the book is a perfect summary for life that many can find useful: ""Our essential connection with animals is ancient, and it runs deep. It extends from body to behavior, from psychology to society--forming the basis of our daily journey of survival. This calls for physicians and patients to think beyond the bedside to barnyards, jungles, oceans and skies. Because the fate of our world's health doesn't depend solely on how we humans fare. Rather, it will be determined by how all the patients on the planet live, grow, get sick, and heal"""
290,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15696054-delene-beeland,5,"As much as we attempt to divide ourselves from the rest of the animal kingdom, the truth is that members of Homo sapiens are, well, animals. So it shouldn’t raise eyebrows to learn that humans and animals share many common—and not so common—ailments, such as heart anomalies and cancers. In Zoobiquity, authors Barbara Natterson-Horowitz and Kathryn Bowers dig deeply into these commonalities. But they don’t simply search for similar diseases and afflictions shared by man and beast, they also explore and explain the possible evolutionary underpinnings of these links.Natterson-Horowitz is a practicing cardiologist at the University of California-Los Angeles Medical Center who began consulting at a regional zoo. Her forays into treating animal patients led her to understand that medical doctors and veterinarians often have different names for similar diseases and behaviors shared by their patients. In the book’s opening scene, Horowitz recalls how she realized that the risk of her Emperor tamarin patient developing capture myopathy was eerily similar to the human condition of takotsubo cardiomyopathy, which is also known as broken heart syndrome.After that experience, Horowitz began asking if animals get specific kinds of cancers. She discovered parallels between the tumors growing around branding sites in livestock to those growing around the traumatized skin of people’s tattoos and scarifications. And just as mutations in the BRCA1 gene are known to be connected to breast cancer in people, in some animals (such as jaguars and English springer spaniels), carriers of this mutated gene also develop breast cancers.Zoobiquity takes readers on a journey connecting the dots between seemingly unconnected behaviors: for example, how the roots of substance addiction and other self-destructive habits may actually be byproducts of survival strategies, and how fainting in people may be related to behaviors that evolved in prey animals to escape being eaten.

291,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1911547-brigitte,4,"  I highly enjoyed this book on looking at human and animal health as a whole, instead of separate issues (humans are animals, after all). As a scientist I was familiar with many of the examples used and they were used well. The book does a great job of linking a variety of issues into an organized whole.A few stray observations: I appreciated the mention that the food we eat bears no relation to its wild counterpart, because we've bread them for centuries if not longer to suit our purposes. It is not possible to eat non-genetically modified food, since humans have been doing it for so long. Our ancestors simply didn't know that the traits they were selecting for corresponded to specific genes.Early on the book mentions that through a process called epigenetics, the genes inherited by children could be different from the parents. This is absolutely not true - the DNA sequence (A,T,G,C) is the same from parent to child. What can be changed through epigenetics is how those genes are expressed - when, in what tissues/cells, and how much. Thus, if a parent suffers a period of starvation prior to the arrival of a child, even years before a child is born, that experience will be passed on through epigenetics, or how the DNA sequence is packaged and read by the cell. Think of it like a typical web page: a few favored links are at the top, important information is highlighted, and then further information is included as you scroll down the page. As events happen, the content is moved around. It is always still there, but certain events make specific content more readily available. The actions and experiences of a particular individual make his or her genes more or less readily available, and that availability is passed along through generations.The info on HIV/AIDS wasn't terribly specific, as there is evidence that the disease crossed species around the 1930s, and it was the traumatic upheavals caused by colonization of the interior of Africa that eventually unleashed the disease on the world."
292,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5448276-leah,4,"As a veterinary student it is utterly refreshing to see recognition of the importance of my profession in One Health. The author is not wrong about the rift between physicians and veterinarians. We are routinely looked down upon by physicians despite it being harder to get into vet school and a curriculum that is just as hard if not harder to stay in. To see a physician acknowledge the wealth of information we have to share is a delight. Her comparisons between human and animal diseases are illuminating in the terms of understanding how pathology plays out across species. In some ways I felt that I, and really veterinarians in general, already understood the message but I take hope in the idea that this book could potentially open the eyes of my human counterparts to the value of shared information. I know multiple veterinarians, particularly specialists, that keep up with human medical journals. As a profession we are quite aware of the similarities between diseases in various species. We also know that our research and treatments have significant potential economic impacts as well as future impacts on human health. Dr. Natterson does a wonderful job of not only building a narrative throughout each chapter, but of laying out medical differential diagnoses in a way that is both understandable and complete to the ordinary person. It will not go over your head. She addresses the full range of health concerns, from the physical to mental health. Often, she adds in a personal touch to give a sense of reality and potential applications by recounting details of cases from her past or examples in everyday life. It adds a very human quality to the book that keeps the science from being too analytical. I highly recommend this book to veterinarians, doctors, or anyone with a stake in the future of One Health medicine. So really essentially everyone. "
293,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3154417-connie-n,2,"This book took me a relatively long time to read. It wasn't all that bad, it was just pretty dry, like a lecture given by a professor who is really excited about her subject but she isn't dynamic enough to enthuse her students. The subject was fairly interesting, mainly that there are many, many diseases and conditions that correlate between humans and other species. The author suggests that it would be extremely helpful to the health of the world for veterinarians and physicians to work together toward the common goal of good healthcare. She writes, ""Because the fate of our world's health doesn't depend solely on how we humans fare. Rather, it will be determined by how all the patients on the planet live, grow, get sick, and heal."" The best part of the book, in my opinion, was how she approached each category of interest and compared humans to animals...the chapter Fat Planet talked about overeating, Roar-gasm talked about sexual practices, Grooming Gone Wild talked about self-mutilation, etc. Each subject was interesting. The problem for me was that she spent lots of time with each chapter, providing example after example to prove her point when I was convinced with a lot less words. This book didn't excite me, but I did gain a greater understanding and appreciation for the subject and for the author's attempts (as a human physician herself) to coordinate seminars and awareness among her colleagues, both human and animal-focused. BTW, she herself coined the word ""zoobiquity"" when she had an aha moment and discovered that an animal in the zoo she was consulting for had a disease very similar to one she was treating in a human. Zoobiquity is from the Greek for animal (zo) and the Latin for everywhere (ubique), joining 2 cultures as she proposes to join the 2 cultures of human and animal medicine."
294,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10445857-bill,2,"The main thesis behind Zoobiquity is that many diseases found in humans have analogues in animal populations and that veterinary and human medicine stand to learn from each other's fields. The book progresses through a series of chapters that each focus on a disease found in humans such as overeating or anorexia, self-harm, cancer, or substance abuse and then shows how similar conditions affect animal populations. In discussing the analogous animal diseases, Ms. Natterson-Horowitz gives the reader a framework for a broader and more compassionate approach to the human problem. For example, in the chapter on self-harm, Natterson-Horowitz shows how self-destructive animal behaviors in grooming (such as feather-plucking in birds or lick granuloma in dogs) have their roots in stress and isolation. She stresses the importance of using ""an evolutionary tool set to repair an evolutionary short circuit."" I thought the book was a little light in its treatment and could have gone deeper in many instances. Some of the material is better dealt with in other works, such as zoonotic disease spread written about in David Quamman's Spillover. Natterson-Horowitz is sometimes breathless over making the connections between animal and human diseases so that the phrases ""until that moment"" and ""imagine my surprise"" show up a few too many times. All in all, it was a light read and is a good non-fiction summer book. It was ok, perfectly ok; no more or less."
295,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7787544-taylor,4,"4.5/5For what this book *is* --a multispecies medical ethnography targeted at showing people the interconnectedness between humans and animals-- it is quite good. It has a goal in mind and meets it well.Barbara Natterson-Horowitz has written a medial treatise for general audiences to educate them (and maybe successfully convince some) on the benefits of cross species study in the medical field. She (and her coauthor) covers everything from fainting, to obesity, STDs, and growing up in the animal kingdom, providing evidence for each.If readers have successfully completed high school science courses (and beyond), much of this information will not be new. Rather, what is most informative is the intricate workings of the human body in terms of certain diseases, etc., and the similarities between those that are  not mammals.There is almost nothing wrong with this text, which is why I rate it so high. However, I did find myself with a few unanswerable questions that I would love to discuss with the author. Perhaps these questions could have been answered if the book itself was longer (really, it's only 244 pages in hardcover) and was not such a succinct read (i.e. more like a dense academic paper). Overall, this book just confirms the benefits of my personal beliefs and interest in multispecies study in all academic and professional fields (where relevant)."
296,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7508307-ronald,4,"We are animals. It's with other creatures that we share our anatomy. With lizards, horses, rhinos, frogs, dogs and cats we share organs like the heart, stomach and brain. And it's about time the medical community realized that. For too long, says Barbara Natterson-Horowitz, doctors and veterinarians have ignored each other. Well, the first group has done most of the ignoring.Uncovering diseases that are thought be uniquely human, Natterson-Horowitz builds a strong case that they are in fact really ubiquitous (common) in the animal kingdom. Hence the title 'Zoobiquity'. Diabetes, heart failure and even psychological problems such as anorexia and obsessive compulsive disorder have their analogs in other creatures.The downside is that the huge amount of information in the book is presented in repeatedly the same way. Each chapter starts with a strange affliction (whether in humans or animals), and then - surprise! - the affliction apparently can be found in many different species of animals. The novelty of it all wears off pretty quick, and by the last few chapters, 'Zoobiquity' feels like repetitive read.A must-read, but I guess it's best to check out in chunks. One chapter per week, or something."
297,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10196629-beverly,4,"This was really a fascinating book. It sometimes became a little dry and sometimes a little over the top with medical information but all in all, it was an eye-opening listen. Read by Karen White, who did a wonderful job, this amazing book taught me a number of things. I found out that koalas can contract chlamydia and, in fact, the species is actually being decimated by the disease. Gorillas can suffer from clinical depression and dinosaur remains show signs of brain tumors. The author, Barbara Natterson-Horowitz, is a cardiologist and had been asked to look at a Emperor tamarin at the Los Angeles Zoo. Although the patient was soon lost, Dr. Natterson-Horowitz discovered that wild animals can actually die from of cardiac arrest brought on by extreme emotional stress--just like humans. This set her on a path of looking into and writing about additional similarities between animals and us and she found plenty. She then teamed up with science journalist Kathryn Bowers, and together completed this book. Once you've read it, you'll realize that we not only have to worry about how we treat our planet and the environment but how we keep our pets and wild life as healthy as possible, it all is just very much intertwined. Very informative and interesting."
298,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3093693-angie-boyter,4,"This book is a real winner. The chapter on obesity was especially fascinating;I learned some things I would rather not know about my food.My only regret is that, not surprisingly given the author's profession as a physician (From the book: What do you call a physician? A veterinarian who can only treat one species.), the emphasis is on how what we learn about animals can help us with human health. I would have liked to see more about how we can use human medicine to improve animal health. All too many of us have loved our companion animals and lost them to medical conditions that would have been treatable in a human.Also, again ot surprising given the fact that the author is a cardiologist who started out as a psychiatrist, the emphasis was on heart problems and mental health. But Zoobiquity does not pretend to be a complete compendium comparing all interspecies medical issues. It effectively conveys the message that we are doing our health a disservice by our tendency to consider ourselves ""above"" and different from other animals and, along the way, very clearly and entertainingly presents fascinating information about health issues for humans and other species. "
299,0307477436,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1906917-judith,3,"Zoobiquity: What Animals Can Teach Us about Health and the Science of Healing by Barbara Natterson-Horowitz and Kathryn Bowers began with the investigations of Dr. Natterson-Horowitz, cardiologist and professor at the UCLA Medical Center, based on her experience as Cardiac Consultant at the Los Angeles Zoo. Learning from veterinarians, she came to understand that the differences between human and animal medicine are comparatively minor, and that the potential benefits of collaboration are as vast as the huge numbers of disorders and diseases common to humans and other species. Until the Industrial Revolution made veterinary medicine into a rural speciality, many a country physician assisted as needed when farmers called. The subsequent barriers between veterinary and medical scientists were social constructs, not scientific distinctions. Dr. Natterson-Horowitz and journalist Kathryn Bowers offer a fascinating narrative of discovery in which they demonstrate the ubiquity of the same diseases in both animals and humans and how cooperation in the medical/veterinary community can advance healthcare for all.
