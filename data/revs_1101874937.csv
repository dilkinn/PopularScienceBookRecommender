Science has taught me that everything is more complicated than we first assume, and that being able to derive happiness from discovery is a recipe for a beautiful life.
While it may be a beautiful life in many ways, it has not been an easy one. Anne Hope Jahren is a geobiologist currently working at the University of Oslo. This represents a bit of homecoming, as her ancestors emigrated from Norway to Minnesota. Her father was a science teacher at a community college. She writes about having the run of the science facilities at the school while with her dad when she was a kid, and loving it. Science was clearly in her blood from an early age. Jahren is a much awarded researcher who studies biological bits from ancient plants to determine climatic conditions of their time. Incorporating biology into geology is what has set her work apart. She won the Donath Medal from the Geological Society of America and the American Geophysical Union’s Macelwane Award. (Yeah, I never heard of them either, but they are a pretty big deal. Winning both is an even bigger deal, as only four people have ever done that and Jahren is the only woman so honored.)Hope Jahren - from her site A good memoir, like any good book, runs on two tracks. One is the up-front story, the author begins here, winds up there, and notes their stops, people and experiences, and what they learned, observed, thought and felt along the way. In this case Hope Jahren's personal journey begins with her being a very science-focused kid, then offers a brief look at her school experience. We follow her from grad student to doctorate, from California to Georgia, to Norway, to Hawaii, building labs, working in the field, blowing things up (not on purpose), slogging through industrial strength muck, being temporarily deformed by a serious overexposure to poison ivy, and other fun adventures. We follow her from single to coupled to mom in what seems a flash. But mostly we follow her working lifeThe second element of a good book is what the author can tell us about the world. One of the wonderful things about Lab Girl is that Jahren includes short chapters on biology, things like the importance of sugar to life and how plants are the only things that can make it from inorganic ingredients. There are chapters on the hardiness of the hackberry tree, on what to avoid when selecting a tree of your own to plant, on the value of wood to trees, and one particularly fascinating bit on mushrooms.
You may think a mushroom is a fungus. This is exactly like believing that a penis is a man. [insert mandatory joke here….although sometimes a man can be a dick…ok?] Every toadstool, from the deliciously edible to the deathly poisonous, is merely a sex organ that is attached to something more whole, complex, and hidden. [I leave the joke construction for you to complete here, something like usually not] Underneath every mushroom is a web of stringy hyphae that may extend for kilometers, [if you are now thinking about large swaths of unwashed dishes and undone laundry, I apologize] wrapping around countless clumps of soil and holding the landscape together. The ephemeral mushroom appears briefly above the surface while the webbing that anchors it lives for years within a darker and richer world. [World of Warcraft?]
There are plenty more, all short, and all very interesting. I loved these, although not all lend themselves so compellingly to snarkiness. The splicing of these two tracks takes place in following her career. We see her struggling, not only with personal challenges, but with the barriers that make working at science a daunting prospect. This is a world of diminishing resources and steady pressure to publish and dig up the grant money that funds research and university teaching. It is impressive seeing how tough it actually is for someone wanting to practice science while earning a pittance. It is not only fiscal constraints that get in the way. She writes of the collegial impediments of being a female in what has been very much a male club, offering brief glimpses at what gender-based resistance looks like. She also presents a very clear, and sometimes horrifying portrait of what it means to be a scientist. Glamorous it ain't, particularly given how hard she works. But the joy she experiences at working at what she loves and discovering new things most definitely comes across. There are considerable gaps in Jahren's personal tale. A mention of an occasional boyfriend remains all we learn of her social life for most of the book. There is not nearly enough about her experiences as a kid. And, most glaringly, while it is possible to figure out what malady afflicts her from the description of events, that this malady is not overtly mentioned for so much of the book makes it feel, when it is finally addressed, that it came from out of left field.Jahren leavens her tale with an appreciation for the odd, and sometimes the absurd. On a field trip with Bill and her students, they visit a monkey jungle that offers some nice smirking opportunities. This is not Mary Roach, snorting-your-drink-out-your-nose funny, but it is clear that Jahren has a pretty lively sense of humor, particularly in regards to a student who takes an internship at a zoo.She takes pains to juxtapose how plants develop and adapt with how people do. This is a wonderful element.Another lovely element in the book is her bff relationship with Bill Hagopian. Working on her doctorate while he is an undergrad, she spots him as the best lab person she has ever seen, and takes him on as her assistant. Their relationship is a bit like Don Quixote and Sancho Panza, with Bill offering some real world guidance when Jahren is beset by an attack of madness. It is maybe more that for Jarhen, Bill is like a brother from another mother, a true, if non-genetic, family member. Their connection permeates and strengthens the telling.Bill Hagopian – from Jahrenlab.comI did not think that Lab Girl was a great book on the order of H is for Hawk, but I do think it is a damn good one, succeeding in its dicot-omous mission of telling her personal story while also educating readers. Jahren’s success as a researcher and promoter of women in science has increased the hope that many talented female minds will seek to plant their careers in scientific fields and grow great forests of knowledge that might otherwise have failed to sprout, and that would be a beautiful thing, indeed.Review Posted – 12/16/2016Publication dates-----4/5/2016 - hardcover-----3/7/2017 - Trade PaperbackSummer 2019 - EXTRA STUFF has been moved to (what is currently) comment #8 below"

I have a new crush on 'both' Hope Jahren, ( Geochemist and author of ""Lab Girl), and Hope's lab partner, Bill!!!I'm moved - inspired - speechless - breathless- ( teary-eyed throughout this entire reading experience). I'm grateful -- altered having read Hope Jahren's memoir!!!!5+++++ stars from me!!!!!!!Tidbits....( since I couldn't begin to say enough wonderful things found on EVERY PAGE) .....OMG.... anybody who is 'close' to me ( really close to me)... knows about my history with sugar.... starting from infancy. Sixteen cavities in my baby teeth at age 3... and my years of my 'desire' for sugar. I also happen to be a TREE nut....( my iPhone has an overload of photos that I take on my hikes. Every tree we've planted - front and back yard - has a very emotional history. They are named after my mom, dad, uncle, etc. I've stories throughout our garden - great stories about each plant!!! --- our community luv-tree ( the large walnut tree in the back), has dozens and dozens of treasures - crystals, stones, and other objects friends have either made or bought to hang from branches. Our blue-tinged spruce ( picea pungens) tree in our front yard -- HUGE SHADE Tree... was the childhood tree which Hope remembers most when she was growing up in Minnesota. Our tree --'Uncle Louie' -- wasn't much taller than me when we first moved in ( after Uncle Louie planted it) over 30 years ago --- today is so BIG... it's scary at times! ......BUT.... with all the many types of trees with have --variety of leaves - flowers - plants - what I never 'really' thought about was that ""LEAVES MAKE SUGAR""!!!!MY glucose brain has been getting my supply from LEAVES!!! ( chocolate covered ones... haha)! LAB GIRL just excites me! I was a science major in college too -( Kinesiology) --but man.... it never filled my heart the way - specifically plants - does for Hope Jahren. Her passion is out-of-this- world beautiful and exceptional!!!!Oh.....and I laughed - and smiled when she said, the chilly air smell of eucalyptus always reminds her of Berkeley! ME TOO!!!!!! I lived in the Berkeley Hills surrounded by eucalyptus.... and that smell is tattooed on me--equated with Berkeley forever. I was also so excited 'with' HOPE when she discovered hackberry pits contain opal....Bill ( with his dry sense of humor), was 'also' bright-eye & bright-ears to learn Hope's news. Hope's next goal was to discern a way to back-calculate the temperature that governed its formation 'within' the seed! WHO DOES THAT??? I was mesmerized!!!Her next task was to show that it also worked 'within' a TREE!!!! I was becoming orgasmic!!I could go on and on --- haha 3 sentences my ass with this review!!! Tell me where to send this woman money.... I'll donate to her cause of study!!! PS... I'm sooo excited ... I just 'now' checked ( listened to a sample), Hope Jahren does the narration to her own audiobook!!!! Yippy!!!! I'm going to listen to her while I walk in the enchanted forests!!!!PSS... I wrote this review faster than the speed of light - out of pure excitement-- forgive my mistakes and nutty obsessive enthusiasm!!! -- but maybe a few of you have tolerated me before - and found a way to just let me be. Thank You from my deepest heart of truths if you read this!!!!!Perfect FIT BOOK for me!!!"
2,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12620745-debbie-dj,5,"So yesterday, I had to take down a smaller tree in my yard. I knew what was happening as I pulled on the root, seeing the main taproot, the one my tree had grown straight down and spent it's lifetime trying to maintain. Then came the side roots, the ones put out for stability, called runners. My tree had suckers, green shoots coming from the runners, still living, still choosing life, even though its main source had died. Taking down that tree of mine was an emotional experience. I'll never look at a tree the same way after reading this book. Hope Jahren is truly gifted. Her memoir was fantastic! I loved how she explained the science of paleobiology in easy to understand terminology, some of which, as a geologist myself, I had never fully understood. But, this book is so much more! It's her story. Of being a woman in a mans world, of her long term relationship with her assistant Bill. She is always in the pursuit of knowledge, and their travels take them all over the world. Always on a shoestring budget, these travels are adventurous, and downright daring. They had me laughing and at times crying. Our destruction of our planet is truly heartbreaking, but Jahren does not lecture or make this the main focus. One of the things she asks us readers is to plant a tree of our own. My dead tree will be replaced, and knowing what I do now, I'm pretty darn excited about the whole process!To quote another Goodreads reviewer (yes you Cynthia) the women are on a roll this year! "
3,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3643764-esil,4,"A high 4 stars. I can't possibly describe what Lab Girl is about or review it with any linearity, because this is a tangled web of strands of memoir, natural history, philosophical musings and random thoughts. Here are my own thoughts in no particular order:-This is an ode to trees and plants.-This is a love letter to friendship generally and to Jahren's friend and lab partner Bill in particular.-This is a reflection on the potency of motherhood.-This is a peek into the lives of quirky people trying to make a place for themselves in the world.-This is a plea for conservation and better funding of scientific research.-This is a shout out to all women who work in traditionally male professions.-This is a stark account of living life with bipolar disease.-This is funny, sad, affecting, thoughtful, and consistently surprising.And did I mention that Jahren is a crazy good writer? There's something unconventional and potent about how she phrases her story and thoughts.A note on the audio: Jahren reads it herself. At times, her narration is painfully slow. But her voice does convey a lot of emotion.Thanks to a few GR friends and their enthusiastic reviews. I never would have considered reading this one otherwise."
4,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14596170-cristina-monica,3,"No 300-page book should have an audiobook lasting 12 hours. There was no need for the author to pause for two seconds after every sentence. That being said, this was a unique, meaningful and informative memoir. I didn’t care much for the scientific facts, but I sure enjoyed the passion in the author’s voice. I considered giving up on it multiple times, due to the length of the audiobook, but I listened to it while browsing the web and choosing my courses for next fall, which wasn’t bad. (Is there really anyone who can pick their courses in five seconds??) Also, the narrator’s voice is quite soothing."
5,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4159922-diane-s,3,"3.5 When I first started reading this I was more interested in the chapters, which alternated with her personal story, on the trees and plants. That changed though as I read on. Loved her story too, her beginning passion for the sciences, her childhood and going with her dad to his lab, her first jobs which I found eye opening, and her wonderful long term friendship with Bill. He would become her lab partner, the person she bounced ideas off of and shared triumphs and disappointments with. The truly difficult work of starting a new lab, the constant quest for funding, grants and other studies. Trying to formulate new experiments that would be found worthy of significant money. The many years of struggle, constant paperwork and the tweaking of ideas. The chapters on plants, trees and seeds were illuminating but sometimes a bit mind boggling.. still learned and immeasurable amount there too.I was blown away by the clarity of her writing, her passion, her vulnerability all of which shone through in this book. Her honesty with her doubts, mistakes and the hard work that this type of career entails. This is a book to reread there is so much information in it about the nature we see out of our windows and take for granted. She showed me a whole different way of looking at these things. Simple wonderful.ARC from publisher."
6,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane,4,"I am not a scientist, but I loved this memoir about science.Hope Jahren is a botanist who is passionate about her field. Lab Girl is a beautifully written book about her life — her childhood in Minnesota with taciturn parents; how she developed a love of trees and plants; her early experiences in laboratory work; the ongoing struggle to get research funding; her battle with anxiety and depression; the longtime friendship with her lab partner, Bill; and how she eventually met her spouse and became a mother. (Warning to sensitive readers: there is a description of a difficult childbirth, and the scene made me so anxious I had to shut the book and take a short break.)Jahren intersperses the chapters of her personal life with anecdotes about nature. A few of these ""tree chapters"" were great, but I sometimes grew impatient with the plant and soil lectures and wanted to get back to Jahren's story, which I found more compelling.Overall, I truly enjoyed this book and would highly recommend it to anyone who appreciates a well-written memoir or who likes reading about the life of a scientist. If I ever get the opportunity to fund some research, I'm giving Jahren a call.Favorite Quotes""People will tell you that you have to know math to be a scientist, or physics or chemistry.

7,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8036318-kim,2,"I really wish Dr. Jahren had confined herself to talking about her work, which was interesting and inspiring. The rest of the book, especially the personal aspects, was tedious and full of endless whining. In my experience (having worked in R&D for over 25 years) women are judged on their merits as scientists. If you’re good, you’re taken seriously. Finding funding for academic research is a separate problem that affects scientists of both sexes. I also disliked her implication that there’s only one kind of scientist that’s real and worthwhile -- the kind that lives and breathes the lab and always puts work first. I’m not sure that makes you a better scientist, but it surely makes you a lonelier one."
8,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3263980-adam-dalva,4,"Fascinating, fast, often moving look at the twining between trees and the life of a hugely accomplished plant scientist. The tree details were excellent throughout, and I enjoyed Jahren's quick, lucid writing, and the way she details the hustle she and her long-term colleague Bill exhibit in putting their careers together. If one is interested in work in the sciences, this is a clear-eyed look at the many short-comings and beautiful moments that can come with it. The writing has some odd beats (characters are described vaguely, and sometimes very late -never will I forgot learning 180 pages into the book that I'd been picturing Bill wrong), and the central relationship in the book remains strangely underexamined. Most of all, I appreciated Jahren's clear-eyed, frank look at her own bi-polar disorder."
9,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2641948-iris-p,5,"Lab Girl★★★★★ 5 Stars!! I think something really special happens when a scientist has the ability to use the written word to successfully communicate and explain to the rest of us what they do.It's like in Baseball when the pitcher also happens to be good at batting. It's not in their job description, we don't expect them to, but when it happens is extremely exhilarating! I don't know if Hope Jahren likes baseball, but I found her writing utterly exquisite.As the daughter of a father who was a physics and earth science teacher and a mother who instilled in her a love for literature, Jahren charmingly blends both those passions in this remarkable memoir.



Hope and Bill in the labJahren's audio narration felt a little flat at first, but she increasingly grew on me. Listening to her as she describes a difficult episode in her ongoing struggle with mental illness was heartbreaking and perhaps the most moving account I've ever heard of someone suffering from bipolar disorder. As I was listening to this particular part of her story, I found myself crying and overwhelmed by her willingness to share these painful experiences.I have never heard a scientist of any field, speak so passionately and lyrically about what they do as Jahren does here. She captured my imagination, I have a new sense of respect for geobiologists and perhaps most importantly, for plants, what they mean for us and the viability of our planet. Lab Girl was informative, enlightening, quirky and even funny at times. Also, I think most of us can be so lucky to find a friend as loyal as Bill, Hope's lab partner. So here's hoping that many young women read this book and get inspired by Jahren's life and her admirable devotion to science."
10,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38544962-guy-austin,5,"I found this in an Independent Book store one day, not by actually seeing the book, there was a note on a card attached to an empty shelf. It said, “Lab Girl by Hope Jahren - THE BEST BOOK I HAVE READ IN A LONG WHILE – Buy it!” So I asked where it was and the gal behind the stacks ran off, returned, and placed it in my hand, “You'll love it I promise.” Her enthusiasm caused me to not hesitate and pay full retail on the spot. This is not just a Memoir as far as memoirs go. It is well written with imagery and story telling. I can almost picture the young girl walking home silently with her father on a frigid late February evening in a southern Minnesota town. If the first chapter was an indicator, this is going to be a great read indeed.And it was. This book has stayed with me. I finished a few weeks back and had not had the time to write about it, but I have thought about it a lot. Hope has a way of speaking about soil, leafs, stems and root systems that brings me to the point of understanding and appreciation just as she seems to have for them. I am not a science guy. She is using everyday language mixed with scientific jargon and I stop… suddenly realizing I just read a lecture on the life of the Willow Tree. I want to know more. I stare out the window next to my reading chair and see the trees in my view and they suddenly look different. Alive. Amazing, how did she do this?It is simply fascinating. I really enjoy the way she speaks about her life and passions and ups and downs and intertwines them with the natural world that has become her life’s work. How she can make intricate concepts seems so matter of fact and entertaining is special. Much the same way she makes Bill, her assistant, sound so fascinating and entertaining and wonderful. It is strange and amazing that two people so driven and focused could happen upon each other and create a band that can create great science together.I laughed and thought and imagined and learned along the way. What a trip. Perhaps another book will come. I really hope another book will come. Perhaps it will be called the “The Tao of Bill.” THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I HAVE READ IN A LONG WHILE – BUY IT! You'll will love it, I promise. "
11,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9827967-deb-martens,5,"""For trees that live in the snow, winter is a journey. Plants do not travel through space as we do; as a rule they do not move from place to place. Instead they travel through time, enduring one event after the other, and in this sense, winter is a particularly long trip. Trees follow the standard advice given for any extended travel within a rustic setting: pack carefully.""I came away, after reading Lab Girl, awed and delighted. How amazing to be able to walk along side the mind of a scientist, who queries an apparent norm or discerns an aberration, and then has the drive and patience to follow through with hours of tedious preparation and careful research. Hope Jahren's memoir is about her life, yes, her personal challenges, the misogynistic world of scientists, bipolar disorder, but also her inspiration and courage, and passion for her best friend Bill and eventually her own family. I came away, enthused and awed about LIFE, that of the plants which in their infancy begin as seeds in their casings and develop as embryos, and the optimism required for any to germinate and grow. I learned about willow trees that ""taught"" others miles away how to ward off killing caterpillars, and plants that could live without water for years, just waiting to reawaken with rain, known as resurrection plants, ""ugly and small and useless and special."" When I look at the trees in my yard - and there are many- I realize that the three forty year old trees must have access to an aquifer I haven't been aware of, as have about a dozen tall trees the same age as these near me. Down the block, I have just realized, the old trees are not as tall or have died long ago. ""In order to accumulate all of the soil nutrients that thirty five pounds of leaves require, our tree must first absorb and then evaporate at least eight thousand gallons of water from the soil. That's enough to fill a tanker truck.""I've just looked at these trees with new eyes, thanks to Lab Girl, with due respect for their enterprise while my lawn has browned from water restrictions in my semi-arid climate. I love a book that can inspire, teach and motivate without my realizing it, when I simply settled in for a comfy story that I'd heard was ""Really good"". Yes, it is really good - I highly recommend it."
12,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4086118-michael,5,"A rare and emotionally engaging close-up look at the development and practice of science, its empowerment and challenges, and the ability of Hope Jahren to transform influences from her father and her questing personality into a successful career in fields that could be called eco-geology and paleoecology. From her time helping her father manage the physics lab where he taught at a community college in suburban Minnesota, she came to appreciate the outlook of scientific inquiry, feel empowered in a laboratory full of equipment she could master, and get rewarded from problem solving. I actually wanted more about the science and her contributions, but that would impede the more substantial success this memoir has as a portrait of a partnership and marriage in work with Bill, a graduate student who became a lab manager, technician, and essential collaborator in all her research. I so loved the snap of the quirky dialog she reconstructed from their day to day lives in the lab or on the road at exotic study sites. The humor is fresh, often slapstick, sarcastic or ironic, but it makes an effective channel for them both that combines unconditional support and brutal honesty. The scenarios with Bill that she spins out like acts on a stage careen from low points of self-deprecation and absurdist dissipation of their failures to driven efforts to reach a goal with many all-night stints in the lab or busting ass and threatening their health in the field. And sometimes they get epiphanies over results and rewarding dreams of glory over their discoveries and, more practically, some payback in near-term job security. I also loved the adventures she and Bill have in building labs at different academic postings she climbs and in their entertaining trips to scavenge equipment and in student instruction through field trips. The latter trips with students in soil science involve camping, excavations, and sampling work, occasional disasters with vehicles, and R&R trips to odd tourist spots like “Reptile World.” Here is the kind of kidding and mock insult she could dish out to Bill if he complained too much about troubles she had led them into:Shut up, dwarf. You just be grateful that your job is a goddamn fairy tale.Eventually, we come to learn that Hope and Bill are both victims of stigma and dark secrets. For her, revelations concern the roots of her asocial history and her dysfunctional bouts of bipolar disorder. For his maverick character we are led to consider the contribution of his hardscrabble childhood of abject poverty and overcoming a severe trauma to one hand. This autobiographical look at their partnership can be shelved along with a limited set of books that stand out for rendering non-romantic friendships. Hold that thought. I can’t think of any close parallels in terms of lit about close work friendships in my reading, much less a team in scientific endeavors. Interspersed with the narrative history, Jahren inserts little lyrical reveries and essays on how the lives and wonders of plants inform her understanding of herself and the planet. Many of these mental excursions make for metaphors of lessons for her own life. Like how vines gamble lightning growth and low investment in a sturdy wood body to attaining the light at the crown of the host trees they climb.  Vines resolve to fight their way up to the light by any means necessary. They do not play be the rules of the forest. …A vine finds its way to the sun not using wood, but pure grit and undiluted gall. She dwells on how small the chances that of the zillion seeds a tree produces so few will grow to a sapling and the less than 5% of saplings will make it to a young tree a year later. When it came time for describing how she found her first love partner, Clint, she refers to how a plant in the face of new resources takes one of four choices to either “grow, repair, defend, or reproduce itself.” Finally, it was her time to grow and reproduce as a mother, and lucky for her: The love that I had to give someone had been packed too tightly and too long in a small box, and so it all tumbled out when opened. She had to work through the impact of the marriage to on her work marriage with Bill. Fortunately, he took it in stride: ”Guess what? We got married!”There was a long pause while Bill looked at us blankly. “Does that mean I have to buy you a present?” he asked. “No” answered Clint, while I simultaneously responded, “Yes.”Jahren bravely recounts the relapse in her controlled disorder that she experienced after going off psych medications during her pregnancy. That’s a tough section suffering with her metamorphosis into paranoid, hallucinating being who is led to take recourse in ECT treatment. Those sections can stand up well among famous first-person accounts of madness.As much as I loved the book as a window on the life of a scientist, I felt disappointed in how much her trajectory is not generally true for the majority of scientists. The obsession over work in a lab to the point of limited social development rings true from grad student beginnings onward. But from my experience in a biomedical field for 20 years (neuroscience), most scientists do not go directly from completing their PhD to a college teaching position. Instead, for most there is a period of one to several years as a post-doctoral fellow and soft-money positions as a research associate. A lab with one or two technicians rarely wins the race as the successful scientists compete well for a stable of graduate and post-doctoral students which get applied to big grant projects and generating a flood of publications. Such a typical picture of research factories and serious competition gets no coverage in the story here of Jahren’s smaller, more isolated endeavors in what she calls “curiosity driven research” that “will never result in a marketable product, useful machine, prescribable pill, a formidable weapon, or any material gain”. Still, the book captures a great view of the kind of creativity and unsung sacrifice that a lot of scientists go through to become a success. "
13,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca,4,"“Because I am a female scientist, nobody knows what the hell I am, and it has given me the delicious freedom to make it up as I go along.” This memoir puts so many things together that it shouldn’t work, yet somehow – delightfully – does. With witty anecdotes and recreated dialogue, Jahren tells about her Minnesota upbringing, her long years in education, her ultimate specialization in geobiology/botany, crossing the country to take up academic posts in Atlanta, Baltimore and Hawaii, her long-time platonic relationship with eccentric lab partner Bill, and zany road trips across America for conferences and field work.On the serious side, she writes about how bipolar disorder complicated work life, marriage and motherhood. Add to all that the interspersed chapters illuminating aspects of plant biology and you get a truly varied and intricate narrative. What I think the author does best is simply conveying what it is like to have true passion for your work, a rare thing: “being able to derive happiness from discovery is a recipe for a beautiful life.” You don’t have to be a science type to enjoy this book. All that’s required is curiosity about how other people live. Jahren might even inspire you to go plant a tree.Another favorite passage:“All the baffling things that arrived unwelcome with adulthood – tax returns and car insurance and Pap smears – none of them matter when I am in the lab. … My laboratory is like a church because it is where I figure out what I believe.”P.S. Bill exists! (Lest you thought, like I did for a while, that he was just so kooky he must be made up.) He appears in the photo illustrating this Popular Science article."
14,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3978225-carol,0,"Feeble attempt at reading a story about a female scientist, which might have been up my alley. The beginning was a challenge. I felt like the narrative was jumpy, although that might have been Jahren's attempt at an 'overview.' She eventually seems to settle and go for chronological order, but suffered enough from Daddy-Worship-Syndrome that I lost a contact in the back of my head. To make matters worse, somehow the pages got crimped and the library now insists that I owe them $22 for this book. This is definitely not $22 worth of storytelling, so I'm afraid I'm just going to hate it forever.  "
15,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,3,"Hope Jahren is a paleo-botanist. She studies growing plants as well as ancient ones. She has been working as a scientist her entire life, and her dedication to the profession shines through every single page of this book.Chapters about her own life alternate with chapters about botany. At first, this is a bit disconcerting, as the alternating chapters have little to do with each other. It is like reading two books at once, with their chapters intermingled. In addition, there seems to be very little coherence among the chapters about either subject.But somehow, the scheme seems to work. The chapters about Jahren's life are interesting, while those about botany are fascinating.Hope Jahren did not have it easy growing up. Her academic career was difficult, to say the least. She goes into some detail about how the scientific establishment disregarded her because she was new to the field and her research tended to oppose the current thinking. But more than that, the establishment disregarded her because of sexism. She was a woman, and that was just about unheard of. It was pathetic when the administrator banned her from entering her own lab building when she was pregnant; she was probably the first--and maybe the last--pregnant woman ever to enter the lab building at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.The book is also about a remarkable friendship between Jahren and her lab partner and best friend, Bill. They are like fraternal brother and sister. The depth of their friendship seems limitless. Bill's crazy sense of humor, his out-of-the-ballpark witticisms, and their deep caring for each other is simply remarkable. It is a testament to both of them, as Bill has some deep problems that are not quite asserted, while Jahren is manic depressive.This book deals with all the problems of a young woman who becomes an academic scientist. It describes the difficulties in getting research grants, and for some reason, the story ignores Jahren's scientific triumphs. I am not sure why; perhaps it is modesty. Jahren and Bill put in incredibly long hours, so it is not like they were given anything for free. Their academic awards were definitely earned. But you won't read about these things in the book; you need to look outside the book to learn about their true scientific accomplishments. This seems to be the biggest question I have after reading this book; what exactly were their discoveries, and why is the scientific acclaim not even hinted at in the book?"
16,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2933855-brina,4,"True confession. I never wanted to read Lab Girl when it first came out because I am phobic about needles and by word association I think of triage when the word lab comes up. Growing up, I visited chemistry labs on many occasions because my dad worked at a pharmaceutical company for his entire career. I grew up fascinated with chemistry sets- making volcanoes out of kitchen products, looking under a microscope, and later when I advanced to high school chemistry classes, identifying esters and their smells and equations. I never thought of lab girl taking place in a chemistry or biology lab because, sadly, renown female scientists are still a rarity. For a bonus word in my summer scrabble challenge, I drew the word “hop” and Lab Girl was the first book to come up when I typed “hop” into my search. When I saw that this best selling memoir was about plants, and not the medicine (for the most part), I decided to read about a decorated female scientist. Hope Jahren grew up in rural Minnesota, the youngest child and only daughter in her family. Among her fondest memories were following her father to his chemistry lab, where he taught at a community college. It was her responsibility to prep equipment before class and, if she was lucky, to run a few experiments for herself. When it was time for college, Hope attended the University of Minnesota, first as a literature major, but then switched to paleo-biology. Although she can quote Dickens and Beckett from memory, Hope realized that her place was in a science lab. In addition to her memories of attending her father’s chemistry classes, Hope was drawn to the study of genetics and of plants, specifically the tree that grew outside of her family’s home. After graduating from Minnesota, she moved cross country to Berkeley to peruse a PhD in paleobotany, the field that she felt she was born to study. Jahren must be a prolific teacher in the classroom because she makes the study of plants sound fascinating. She has spent her career charting carbon isotopes of plants all over the world to find patterns in growth in order for us to save the world from itself. Jahren’s research has taken her from Georgia Tech to John’s Hopkins to the University of Hawaii and now to Oslo, Norway. Since being a graduate instructor at Berkeley, Jahren has been assisted by her counterpart, or, in her words, soul mate, Bill Hagopian. An Armenian who spent most of his adolescence living in a hole in his parents’ backyard, Bill was born to study paleobotany. While not the renown scientist that Hope is, Bill can ably run a lab at all hours of the night, dissemble fancy equipment and transport it cross country, and relate to students in a way that Hope sometimes cannot. The two make up the perfect team of yin and yang and the memories that focus on Bill are among the most humorous of the book. I would read his memoir too, but, Hope points out, she is the one who takes copious notes and writes, whereas he is her partner and foil in research, in essence a soul mate. Jahren adeptly balances her personal and professional life during the course of the memoir. Readers go from hearing humorous stories about a class field trip to the Monkey Jungle in Miami leading to the Jahren Lab’s nickname to being fascinated by knowing that a hackberry seed is made out of opal. With my birthstone being opal, I was captivated by this section. Hope and Bill have charted trees along the Mississippi and seen why they don’t sweat in the summer whereas people do. They have spent summers in the Canadian Arctic measuring the age of glaciers and carbon dating, and have researched variations of plant life in southwestern Ireland. Although she has done more in her professional life than most, Jahren was not taken seriously by the old boys network until she started a family. It was at that point that she was not viewed as complete threat and began to earn grants, having earned at this point three Fulbright grants over the course of her career. The Monkey Jungle might be low budget and subsist on snickers bars and twenty four hour shifts, but it is a well oiled machine that studied the world of plants and noted how they are vital to maintain the earth. I regret waiting as long as I have to read Lab Girl. In Hope Jahren I have found a kindred spirit who grew up with a scientific minded father and literature loving mother. Today she is an example of a well balanced renaissance woman, continuing her research at the University of Oslo, Norway, Bill continuing their partnership after all these years. This spring Jahren has come out with a second book about where we go from here to preserve plant life to sustain the planet. Needless to say, I will not be waiting as long to read this one as I now know that Hope Jahren studies plants, not medicine. 🧪🔬 4+ 👩‍🔬 stars "

18,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3675162-j-l-sutton,3,"I enjoyed Hope Jahren's Lab Girl. Still, I wanted to like it more than I did. Jahren's memoir follows her pursuits of science along with all the achievements and disappointments. Another engaging aspect of the book is the complex relationship Jahren forms with a fellow student (now her lab manager), Bill. That said, I really wanted to hear more about the science, about her actual discoveries rather than how she happened to move from this to that university. Perhaps I went into reading this with the wrong set of expectations. I kept wondering when she was going to get to the science. It did come, but that wasn't the point of the book. "
19,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1899836-snotchocheez,4,"4 starsDidn't expect to like this, despite the handful of glowing reviews from my friends. (For some reason I thought this was going to be a plant-centric  H is For Hawk, which was okay, but not a book I'd care to revisit.) Hope Jahren's lovely affirmation to the scientific world,  Lab Girl, is a must-read for anyone with even a passing interest in plants and trees and flora of all types. How she took botanist vignettes (e.g. plants that sweat, hackberry husks made of opal, the South's kudzu infestation, Arctic soil) and interwove them into her own life of never-ending scientific inquiry is truly genius. (Equally genius is her ability to make dummies like me care about botany and soil). The co-star, her trusty companion and comedic foil, Bill, all but steals the show. I never really understood the pains real life science trailblazers like Ms.Jehren go through to get answers (like getting funding for snoozy-sounding, unglamorous lab trials, or battling manic depression, or contending with sexism in a male-dominated pursuit). After two tornadic events in '09 and '11 here in NE Alabama, I never wanted anything to do with trees again; sure as heck didn't want to read a book about them. Ms(er, Dr.) Jahren, though, through her humorous and informative memoir, has given me a newfound appreciation for our life-giving (and alarmingly depleted) arboreal neighbors. (It's not their fault they topple onto houses and drive manic scientists crazy). Even if you have no interest in trees and other flora, there's plenty of other topics here to please most everyone. (Even a couple of can't-miss funny/scary road trips, one with butt-naked monkeys.) Recommended."

The author reads the book herself, and during the parts that are supposed to be sad, she's reading in one of those choked-up/half-crying voices which is beyond annoying. But, what with lady scientist solidarity and such, I'm rounding up. "

22,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5364077-connie-g,5,"Hope Jahren's love of science comes through loud and clear in her memoir. She grew up in a rural Minnesota home where there was not much family interaction. The highlight of her day as a child was spending the afternoon in her father's science lab at the local community college. Jahren is presently a professor of geobiology at the University of Hawaii. Her memoir chronicles her personal history and the challenges of running her own laboratory. It also contains short chapters giving fascinating information about plants.Her lab manager, Bill, has been working with Jahren for twenty years, going with her as she changed jobs. He's eccentric, loyal, hard-working, brilliant, and Jahren's best friend. His quirky sense of humor always comes through, even in the worst of times. It's not easy being a woman running a laboratory in departments that seem to be men's clubs. Even though she works long hours in the lab, Jahren feels that procuring grant money is the hardest part of the job.Jahren has a passion for understanding how plants and the soil work together. Some of her work has been in paleobiology, researching the layers of soil in the Arctic. Other projects involved researching live plants. The chapters on plants are written at a level where most readers will pick up lots of interesting information, but not so technical that it's difficult to understand.Jahren also has a love of literature, and her memoir is not written like a dry science text. She writes beautifully about how she looks at nature with awe. Her emotions come through as she tells us about her challenges with her bipolar condition, finding love with her husband Clint, and the joy of motherhood. She's not afraid to poke fun at herself and Bill, and shared humorous events from some unconventional field trips. I found her memoir to be entertaining as well as informative. 4.5 stars."
23,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie,2,"The book is not bad, it is OK. It spreads itself thin. It is an autobiography of one specific woman, a woman both ordinary and exceptional. The book depicts the life of a female botanical research scientist at the turn of the 21st century, a central issue being the difficulty in attaining adequate research grants to survive on. It is about friendship. It is about choosing where one's main interests lie - family or job. What I think it does best is draw the author's fervent passion for plants, research and ecology. She loves what she does almost to the point where it destroys her. It only touches upon the latest research on trees.The book begins by showing how the author’s Norwegian descent and relationship with her parents led her toward a career in research science. The reader watches her emotional involvement, sense of responsibility and compulsion to do a good job grow as she through scholarships and hard work gets an education. In May 1996she got her Doctorate at University of California Berkeley and began teaching as well as pursuing independent research in paleobiology. We then follow her for another twenty years, twenty years of struggles to get money, recognition and lab facilities. It is the struggle rather than her particular scientific goals that are focused upon. For example, she travels to San Francisco to give a talk at a conference. We are given a lengthy description of the horrendous trip, rather than what she spoke about! We are told in detail how the four traveling practically killed themselves in a car accident, of their miserable hotel rooms and Hope’s reliance upon her work associate, Bill. This friendship runs straight through the entire book. Any reader of this book will be gripped by the importance of research work to Hope. However, it is not her scientific results per se that is the central focus. The research work that is detailed is more often about lab techniques or sterility procedures or the proper statistical means of accounting data rather than a detailed explanation of her discoveries in plant science. These are merely touched upon. Neither does one get a complete coverage of all that she has done in these twenty years. Near the end of the book she travels with Bill to Ireland; we are told then that she had been to Ireland many times before! This book contains little about contemporary plant research. It is instead about one researcher’s struggles. The author reads her own book, and she does it very well. You hear her engagement. You hear her frustration. Her emotions come through very, very well. At emotional crises her voice trembles. However there are parts where she is more detached, in the epilog and the endnote for example, which drag on f-o-r-e-v-e-r! I suppose here the main fault is not the narration, but rather a more rigorous editing would have helped. "
24,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5004971-joseph,5,"Full disclosure: I knew Hope in high school, lost touch after graduation and reconnected 20+ years later (see? it's possible for good to come of Facebook!), so I'm not going to even pretend to be objective.But if were to pretend, I might point out that this book is about trees and science and love and sheer bloodymindedness and may or may not have made me cry."
25,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1733683-petra,2,"A strange book, for sure. There's mention of Hope's schooling, her family, her friendship with Bill over 20+ years, her husband, her son, some interesting details of plants and trees, her labs.....but nothing about her work, research, lectures, scientific presentations, etc. Although this is a memoir of her working life, there's very little of her work included. For example, we're told in detail of a multi-day car trip to a conference....but not a word about the talk she gave at the conference or how it was accepted by her peers. I enjoyed the short chapters on plants and trees. I found these very interesting and wish there had been more on this.I wasn't as interested in her personal life. Hope comes across as rather whiny and woeful at times. However, the stories of her son and husband are touching. Her love for them comes through the pages. All in all, an okay read but not very engaging most of the time. "
26,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26755281-donia,1,"I grew up spending my free time in my fathers lab and later I was married to a scientist. We celebrated together with deep appreciation and wonder when he purchased his first mass spectrometer. Our children grew up wandering about his lab, helping out during summer time breaks. We have a tremendous love and appreciation of the outdoors, camping, travelling, hiking, collecting.Ah, I thought, here is the perfect book for me to read!Though I consider myself to be a broad minded intellect I can't understand what people see in this monotonous bio. I hung in there page after page, chapter after chapter hoping it would get better. It never did. "
27,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19559507-carolyn,5,"Hope Jahren's memoir is a fascinating insight into what it takes to be a successful research scientist in America today. She writes of the struggle to establish herself in a male-dominated world and the constant fight for recognition of ideas that don't fit in with the conventional view. She also touches on her struggle with bipolar disease and it's effect on her work, her life and motherhood. She describes the constant fight for funding and making do on a shoe-string, which will resonate with research scientists all over the world. Fortunately she has a passion for her work in paleobiology and through working extraordinary hours, she does eventually win through and become recognised and rewarded with awards and a tenured position, but even then she must worry about how to keep her lab funded. Throughout the book there are chapters on trees where she explains in fascinating detail what it is they need to grow and thrive. I learnt a lot about how they interconnect with each other above and below ground and will never look at trees the same way again. I also enjoyed her tales of field trips with her students, piling them into a minibus with camping supplies and a cooler box of food to go and dig pits and collect specimens in wild locations. The star of her book is undoubtably Bill, her loyal assistant and lab manager who moved several times with her to set up new labs all over the country. He is a magician in the lab, fixing and adapting equipment and in the early days survived on a meagre salary for his love of the job. Their platonic relationship and shared passion for their work has obviously been central to Hope's success and life and his encouragement has helped to buoy her up in the difficult times. Thoughtful and well written, this is a different and interesting memoir."
28,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6257531-caroline,5,"This book is both wonderful and idiosyncratic; I found it full of surprises. It's a mixture of various aspects of Hope Jahren's life. In different parts it is the author's life story, a description of a deep and unusual friendship, the trials of being an academic and researcher, and a monument of her devotion to ecology and botany. Hope Jahren is an unusual person, overflowing with warmth, wit and originality. Her story makes for a fascinating and delightful read.  I am going to finish this by simply giving two extracts from her book. These focus on her passion and lyricism when writing about nature, but her writing about her life in other spheres is equally gripping. (view spoiler)[
  ""You may think a mushroom is a fungus. This is exactly like believing that a penis is a man. Every toadstool from the deliciously edible to the deathly poisonous, is merely a sex organ that is attached to something more whole, complex, and hidden. Underneath every mushroom is a web of stringy hyphae that may extend for kilometres, wrapping around countless clumps of soil and holding the landscape together. The ephemeral mushroom appears briefly above the surface while the webbing that anchors it lives for years within a darker and richer world. A very small minority of these fungi - just five thousand species - have strategically entered into a deep and enduring truce with plants. They cast their stringy webbing around and through the roots of trees, sharing the burden of drawing water into the trunk. They also mine the soil for rare metals, such as manganese, copper, and phosphorous, and then present them to the tree as precious gifts of the magi.""-----------------------------""For trees, losing limbs is the rule, not the exception. The vast majority of the branches that any tree produces are severed before they become large, usually by external forces like wind, lightning, or just plain old gravity. Misfortunes that cannot be prevented must be endured, and trees possess a ready strategy. Within a year after the loss, the cambium will cast a healthy new sheath fully over the broken base of what used to be the branch, and then layer upon it year after year until no scar is visible at the surface....In the city of Honolulu, just where Manoa Road crosses Oahu Avenue, there stands a gigantic monkeypod tree. The trunk of this tree is fifty feet tall and its branches form a giant arch....Wild orchids grown on the branches: they sit in companionable bunches shaped like pineapple tops and their naked roots dangle down beneath them....From the tourists perspective, the tree has achieved its perfect form: they do not see a tree that is less than it might have been, or one that was forced to grow in a different ways after its limbs were torn. If the monkeypod tree at Manoa Road and Oahu Avenue were to be cut down, we could count the knots and see the buried scars of the hundreds of branches that it has lost during the last century of its life....Every piece of wood in your house - from your windowsills to the furniture to the rafters - was once part of a living being, thriving in the open and pulsing with sap. If you look at these wooden objects across the grain, you might be able to trace out the boundaries of a couple of rings. The delicate shape of those lines tells you the story of a couple of years. If you know how to listen, each ring describes how the rain fell and the wind blew and the sun appeared every day at dawn.""

29,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4739465-monica,4,"The title evokes a vision of some woman's whacky science adventures as a lab assistant. The book blurb tells us that Hope Jahren is a scientist who has opened 3 labs blah blah blah relationships. The results for me were a little unexpected but overall positive. A combination of eccentricity, obsession and real friendship. Jahren has written primarily a memoir interspersed with some science-y anecdotes about plant life. It was also a love letter to her coworker and lifelong companion.Jahren starts at her childhood. She idolized her father a science teacher and yearns for a good relationship with her emotionally unavailable mother who loved literature and writing. Jahren clearly has a talent in both areas. While in graduate school she meets undergraduate Bill, a bit of a recluse and misfit. They click and the rest of the book revolves around some of their struggles and triumphs. Clearly Jahren attributes her successes as directly linked to Bill. The relationship with Bill is spelled out at length in the book and in my view is one of the most compelling and convincing portrayals of true friendship. It is in the details of this relationship that the book shines. The book also provided a look into the world of science in academia and what is expected of scientists. What it means to open labs and how much responsibility really is put on the shoulders of the scientists. Funding not only the lab but it's employees. Building the lab, acquiring resources and equipment, conducting research and teaching courses. Oh and you must show progress or profits, be published in scientific journals etc. Publish or perish and that's after convincing some benefactor that you are worth funding. It's more than a little unsettling. I am only now beginning to realize what it means when we talk about higher education and the measurements of worthiness and success and its connections to what is being taught. Jahren eventually finds love and marriage with another professor. It's through her pregnancy that she discusses her crippling bipolar issues. The book ends positively with Jahren et al, living in Hawaii with a long term contract (by their standards…3 years) and life on an upward trajectory.I liked this memoir very much. It felt very intimate and Jahren revealed a lot about her own struggles and her relationship with Bill. They have a very lovely, meaningful, relationship. It appears to be a mutual affection. The tales were fascinating and the information about plants was just enough to make me want to learn more. But there is a lot missing. Jahren's husband (Clint) and son are mentioned towards the end. Jahren scratches the surface of her mental illness, and barely touches on Bill's struggles with migraines and his personal history is very minorly detailed. He is quirky but otherwise, not a blemish on him in this memoir. Also, it appears that Jahren is very modest and humble. She is a renowned scientist who has had lots of success that she does not address in the book. Jahren is by her own admission, a bit of a unicorn. She's a female scientist. The implication was that it's a man's world, yet the book didn't much touch upon the struggles she endured as a female. I also get the impression (though not expressly stated) that academia is a viper pit. We get only a small taste of the steel spine, determination, perseverance and possible callousness and indifference likely needed to survive in that environment. As I said there were lots of untold stories that would have helped form a complete picture. Overall this was an interesting read. I should mention that I found Jahren's writing to be very engaging. Again, not at all expected. My impression is that Jahren (and Bill) are amazing people. And I want to follow her advice and plant a tree. Watch it grow. Save the earth.4 StarsRead on kindle"
30,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/260116-janb,5,"I finished this memoir a few days ago and in trying to get my thoughts together for a review, I read what my GR friends said about the book, and I realized it's all been said and said so much better and eloquently than I could.So I'll just say I loved it. I listened to the audiobook, read by the author , and she does an excellent job. I loved hearing about her life and passion as a scientist, her illness (bipolar), her quirky friend Bill, her marriage, motherhood, and yes, I even loved the science-y parts. I'll never look at a tree the same and I now have even more respect for research scientists.Highly recommended."
31,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4271946-jessica-woodbury,4,"I waited for a long time to read this book even though it came highly recommended from several scientists. I was skeptical about the title. And while I am not a scientist by profession, I did train as an undergrad and earn a BS. The thing about scientists is we are very territorial. I am a Chemist. My Physicist friends say, ""But Chemistry is all Physics!"" and they are not entirely wrong. I often scoff at Biology, Botany, Zoology, etc. and say, ""But you're ignoring all the Chemistry!"" So the Botany angle here did not move it up my TBR list.But. As a baby scientist myself, and as someone who spent several years married to a scientist during his PhD and basically lived and breathed lab culture, ultimately I couldn't stay away. I had to see what all the fuss about and I had to see if Jahren got it right. Many people don't. If you are intimidated by a very scientific read, don't be afraid. Jahren's years of teaching experience have clearly created someone who is skilled at turning complex scientific processes and ideas into easily digestible narratives. If you are concerned it will not be scientific enough, there's enough interesting data here to sate you, though I did wish I learned more about Jahren's own research.The thing about this book, though, the thing that makes it one of my favorites of the year isn't just that Jahren gets lab life right, it's how skillfully she tells the stories of trees alongside her own story. I have never ever cared about a tree more than I did during this book. And I was lucky enough to listen to the audio (read beautifully by Jahren herself) while I drove past the blazing autumn leaves of New England, so every tree seemed somehow magical. If someone had taught me about plants the way Jahren does, where it is not just a process to learn and a life cycle to memorize, but where every single step along the way is a miracle in and of itself, I can see myself seriously considering Botany as a potential major. This book in the hands of a college student could be life changing.Some may find Jahren's story not interesting enough for a memoir. But this is not a memoir that is built around a journey. It is showing you who she is, and a big part of it focuses on the incredibly close relationship she has with her lab partner, Bill. While they mean absolutely everything to one another, they are not intimate friends, not secret sharers, not confidants. Learning the rhythms of their conversation and the routines of their friendship will show you the kind of relationship you probably haven't seen before. Jahren covers many things here besides science. Parenthood, the chill Scandinavian traditions of the Midwest, the slog of early academic life, and her own struggle with bipolar disorder. Her writing is simple but deliberate and lovely. I enjoyed every moment listening to her read. "
32,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10001905-lynn,0,"My first thoughts, this book is in a word, odd. It is a memoir written by a bipolar paleobiologist and her Asperger’s like, one-handed best friend/lab assistant. They stumble through the US and Europe trying to do good science. The book is about three things. 1. Science: we learn about the scientific method, how a mass spectrometer works, and that trees have memory (all of which was much more interesting than I would have thought). 2. Love and Family: in all its permutations, good/bad, expressed/unexpressed, chosen/not chosen. 3. Academia: a close and accurate look at the tarnished Ivory tower with tales of sexism, cut throat competition, and the never ending search for money. Despite her struggles, she becomes an award winning and accomplished scholar with her best friend by her side. My final thoughts: this book is in a word, captivating. "
33,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5159766-l-a-starks,5,"What a shame this utterly amazing book has such a lame title. My advice is to forget the title and read the book. Jahren, a three-time Fulbright winner, has written a reader-friendly, relationship-centered sequence of stories about her experience as a paleobotany researcher. There is much to learn and Jahren doesn't shrink from explaining it. However, the terms and structure are highly accessible. The book is one of those rare fusions of science and humanity that many readers so often wish for but can seldom find. The reason is simple--it takes a polymath like Ms. Jahren to understand and love the labwork and yet also be able to explain it to non-scientists. This is the biology class--really much more--you wish you'd experienced. At the same time, Jahren is clear about the difficulties of an academic scientist's life--getting grants, writing proposals, acquiring equipment, paying lab assistants, the necessity of moving on to better opportunities. She writes with joy about marriage, her son, her struggle with bipolarity, and most of all about her talented, brilliant assistant, Bill.About the title: this is apparently the season of ""The Girl Who..."" after the success of The Girl on the Train. Unfortunately, ""Lab GIRL"" is diminutive, and diminishes, the complex, warm, fascinating PhD scientist we meet in its pages. I wish the publishers had worked harder to come up with a title that better represents this story. "

35,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3965659-rachel,2,"This is a textbook case of 'it's not you, it's me.' I understand the appeal, and in a lot of ways I'm thrilled about this book's mainstream success (women in STEM fields and healthy, platonic relationships between men and women are two things we need more of in media), but there were only so many loving descriptions of trees I could take after a while. There was just too much science and not enough human interest to keep me engaged, and while I wouldn't say you need to be knowledgeable about biology to approach this book, a certain amount of interest would be helpful, and I just don't have that, at all. And the audiobook was a mistake; the author narrates it with a positively bizarre amount of melodrama (like, actually in tears at multiple points, and I'm sorry if that makes me sound callous but I really don't react well to overly sentimental narration), so I can't say it was a pleasant listening experience... But anyway, really not a bad book, just not my kind of book."
36,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56398848-nisa,5,"Firstly i want to thank Elyse for recommending this book and letting me have a chance to read it :)Hope firstly began with her childhood and then suddenly make a jumb to her recent life (to introduce herself but kept it short) in lab with Bill (of course they can't be thought apart :)) It was nice in the beginning but after she met with Bill and they began to work together in her lab it's like everything fell into place and real story began. When she told about her studies it was not boring but interesting some of them was long but she kept its length good enough and she shared with us interesting facts about plants. First i began listening this novel as an audio book but because when i listened i kept lost track when i came places she talks about her studies (they are not in my domain and English is my second language and i'm not good enough to listen everything) after that i bought it as an e book and went on by reading.If i think as a whole i loved this book and i loved the way she finished it. But if i talk about its part some part was boring, some exiting and make me happy, sad and worried (I want to say life is not so different). When Hope writing about her life she was so sincere and because of that when she was happy i was happy with her, and worried about her when she feel desperate. I think she is so good at telling her life story and i want to that everything would be good for her. I loved her and the way she tells her story but mostly and all i loved Bill and his answers (I usually marked what he said). In addition i think i love more Bill because she loved (as an important friend) Bill more than herself. And i would love to have friendship like theirs . ""He is strong where I am weak, and so together we make one complete person, each of us gaining half of what we need from the world and the other half from each other."" this is the way she describe their friendship with her words.Here the things that Bill said and make me laugh :)This conversation happened when Hope and Bill met first time. She was assisting a lecture that in this class students need to dig earth. She realize he was digging alone and he cought attention of her""I stood there and watched him dig for a while, and began to notice the uncommonly large amount of earth that he was moving with each shovelful and the implied strength that must have accompanied his wiry frame. I also noticed that he was digging with something that looked like an old harpoon flattened at one end – a sword beaten into a real plowshare.""“Where did you get that shovel?” I asked, figuring it was from the pile of junk I had hauled out of the department’s equipment locker, which had been located in the basement next to an old coal hull. “It’s mine,” he said. “Don’t judge it until you’ve dug a mile in its shoes.” “You mean you brought your own shovel from home?” I laughed in friendly surprise and delight. “Hell yes,” he affirmed. “I wasn’t going to leave this thing unattended for six weeks.” “I like your thinking,” I replied.And this one when they go to monkey jungle and when he said that he was looking a monkey it seems shocked as much as him. ""Bill finally stated, without redirecting his stare, “It’s like looking in a fucking mirror.”""Well if i share all of them this review will be too long and i would be more happy if you decide to read and see for yourself :)) Have a great week. :))"
37,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17951043-perri,4,"I love a book that educates me in a non-painful way. Jahren alternates chapters between her journey as a scientist and her knowledge and passion for botany. Of special interest to me was reading about the difficulties she faced especially as a Research Botanist. Some readers in my book club found her whiny, but I thought she was just being honest in her struggles with an antiseptic upbringing, mental illness, and sexist road blocks from being a woman in a male dominated fields. I learned it takes a really special person to do research experiments.The tension to me of mind numbing monotonous tasks coupled with the stringent standards of proof, well let's just say it's not a field for most people. Added to that is the constant struggle for adequate funding. I found it quite enjoyable with bonus botanic bits."

40,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6449756-sonja-arlow,3,"3 1/2 starsI have always had a love of medicine and science (all though my high school results on science may tell another story) so I was immediately drawn to this book.Hope grew up in her father’s laboratory surrounded by Bunsen burners, petri dishes and access to everything a curious child my want to investigate in a lab. It’s not surprising that she was brought up in an academically focused household and even her mother studied part time and included her daughter in her learning process.I really appreciated the fact that all the experiments or processes in the book was explained so that any person no matter how unenlightened about science, could grasp the concepts.”My laboratory is like a church because it is where I figure out what I believe”I loved reading about her part-time work at a local hospital while studying – it gave me glimpses of the nuts and bolts of running a hospital and more than once I wished that she had become a doctor rather than a botanist.My feelings towards flora is neither here nor there so naturally some of the chapters dealing with the workings of plants didn’t really interest me but one thing came across crystal clear and that is her absolute passion about what she does for a living.  “I will never stop being ravenously hungry for science, no matter how well it feeds me”I also found the sections dealing with just how difficult it is to secure funding for scientific projects are as well as glimpses on Hope dealing with her bi-polar disease, eye-opening. But it’s her friendship with Bill, her lab partner, that stood out for me. So this is a mix between work as a scientist, information about botany and a young woman trying to carve a foothold for herself in a male dominated industry. This may not be for everyone but it was a very enjoyable and informative read for me."
41,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27078093-alice-lippart,4,Enjoyable and really interesting. Loved all the science!
42,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5637143-anna,2,"I'm very curious what other scientists, particularly women, think of this book. To me, the best writing in the book was in the short chapters about plants, even though some of the cool plant insights were already familiar to me since I've worked in plant labs for some years. The rest was uneven, tended toward telling instead of showing, and I think because of this the relationships come out feeling flat, even her relationship with Bill which is clearly important and meant to feel more three-dimensional. Overall, although I certainly support women in science telling their stories, this didn't live up to my expectations, not even close, and I would take Evelyn Fox Keller's 'A Feeling for the Organism' or Susan Brind Morrow's 'Wolves and Honey' or Lauren Redniss's 'Radioactive' over Lab Girl any day of the week. One more note: Jahren sometimes explicitly or implicitly gives the impression that there's one correct way to be a scientist: you have to be immediately driven forward by your failures, never discouraged by them, you have to be able to work for 48 hours straight, you have to have always known science is what you wanted. There is no one way to be a scientist: this is completely untrue, as it is untrue of any profession, and don't let it discourage you or any young girl you know from pursuing science."
43,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1881113-andrea,3,"Such a short book, but it took me forever to read it. I should have liked it more than I actually did. Hope Jahren's part-memoir, part-scientific reflection has humour, memorable personalities, fun educational material, and some truly moving recollections. The problem was that sometimes Jahren's could become too dramatic. I had the misfortune to listen to the audiobook while walking my dog, and I swear it made me want to pull my hair out. The teary, choking voice at the end of nearly every chapter that was supposed to make me feel emotions while the author dwelled in self-pity was like nails on chalkboard. I also went into the book thinking this would be more of a love letter to botany and some interesting findings the author discovered during her career (I never read blurbs), but instead I got mostly a memoir, interlaced some musings on plants that supported the mood for these memories. And this is officially the longest sentence I've ever written. Needless to say, I am sort of underwhelmed. If you are going to read Lab Girl, please avoid the audio, and be prepared for a lifetime worth of over-reactions to ordinary events. "

So I can't really fault Hope for telling her story. But I can caution potential readers: if you want to know what's it is like to be a scientist, don't rely on this book. This is just one story, and it is not at all typical. You don't have to work 80 hours per week to be a scientist. You can have a life AND be a scientist. If you're a student, you can find a grad advisor who cares about you and invests in your success and doesn't haze you when you first join the lab. In short, Future Scientists, don't be discouraged by reading this. Science takes all kinds, and life in science can be what you want it to be."

I like how she writes about her personal life, including her career in academia. Great read."

Rhythm and cycles permeate the narrative, bouncing between Hope Jahren's ups and downs as a career scientist, and the intricate lives of vegetation. I hadn't even read a synopsis before before I began, and was pleasantly surprised by the delicate unfolding of the book … made from paper, derived from intelligent trees … ~ Just Trust Me: In Praise Of Strange Books (All 3 are 5 star reads!)~Hope Jahren is a celebrated geochemist and geobiologist, not to mention an exceptionally interesting human being. Currently she works at the University of Oslo, and this book is her origin story.Jahren worked with her mother in the garden growing up, first sparking her love of growing things.“By the end of June the whole crop was well on its way and the world around us was so green that it seemed impossible that it could ever have been otherwise. By July, the sweating leaves of all these plants had pumped the air so full of moisture that the humidity caused the electrical lines to buzz and crackle overhead.” She also played in her father’s lab from a young age, inspiring her love for science and hunger to know how things work.“There I transformed from a girl into a scientist, just like Peter Parker becoming Spider-Man, only kind of backward.” Eventually, Jahren’s life intersects with a man named Bill, in a lab—where else? He becomes her loyal assistant, moving locations and building labs with her. There was one point where I kind of hoped they’d get together, but their relationship is unique and special—more like best friends or brother and sister.Did I mention the writing is beautiful? Jahren deals with mental illness and loneliness in such a heartfelt manner it’s impossible not to empathize alongside her. She reads the audiobook and you can hear the emotion in her voice, bleeding through the words. The tone remains positive and manages not to be depressing even when dealing with tough topics. There is hope, and the beauty of science unveiling new understanding to the world. The history and lives of trees are presented in a fascinating way, paralleling various aspects of human lives.If you enjoy plants and true tails of scientific superstars — this book is for you.Quotes:“She set her hair in curlers while listening to records of Carl Sandburg’s poems over and over, and instructed me on how to hear the words differently each time. After discovering Susan Sontag, she explained to me that even meaning itself is a constructed concept, and I learned how to nod and pretend to understand.” “Full-blown mania lets you see the other side of death. Its onset is profoundly visceral and unexpected, no matter how many times you’ve been through it. It is your body that first senses the urgency of a new world about to bloom. Your vertebrae seem to detach from one another and you elongate as if toward the sun’s light. You can’t hear above the sloshing roar of blood pushed through your head by some impossibly sustained orgasm within your beating heart. For the next twenty-four, forty-eight, seventy-two hours you will have to yell to hear yourself over this whooshing. Nothing, nothing can be loud enough or bright enough or move fast enough. The world appears as if through a fish-eye lens; your view is fuzzy with sparkling edges. You have received a grand, systemic injection of Novocain and your entire body tingles briefly before it becomes flaccidly foreign and unreal. Your raised arms are the fleshy petals of a magnificent lily bursting into flower. It deeply dawns on you that this new world about to bloom is you.” “There at the end of the world, he danced in the broad and endless daylight, and I accepted him for what he was, instead of what he wished he could be. The potency of my acceptance made me wonder, just a little, if I could turn it inward and accept myself.” "
47,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13977687-taryn,4,"This memoir could be subtitled “The Private Lives of Plants,” because paleobiologist Hope Jahren can’t help but wax poetic at times about her chosen field of study, with which she is clearly enraptured. Fortunately, she’s pretty convincing. Since my tastes run more toward gossipy tell-alls than science texts, my favorite parts of Lab Girl were Jahren's personal stories of her romance with her husband and decidedly unromantic relationship with her (occasionally homeless but forever loyal) research partner Bill. Amazingly enough, though, I didn't glaze over during the parts about trees and mosses. Jahren is one of those rare scientists able to express her enthusiasm for her subject in a way that translates to the average Jane. The audio version is read by Jahren herself, which makes the more emotional parts of the book ring with authenticity, but if you're bothered by soft, whispery voices, you might prefer to pick up this one in print. If you close your eyes, Jahren sounds just like Ana Gasteyer's character from the classic SNL sketch “Schweddy Balls.”More book recommendations by me at www.readingwithhippos.com"
48,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1291915-lauren,3,"The name of this book never worked for me - it didn't seem to capture what the book was about, and it is diminuitive in nature. Jahren is not a ""girl"", and this book is not cutesy, as the title, and even the cover art, would lead you to believe. Jahren's work in geobotany is fascinating, and I really enjoyed the interspersed chapters on plants, trees, natural history. The personal memoir sections were okay - they showed devotion and commitment to the science. I was frustrated with the roadblocks and glass ceilings that Jahren hit/endured as a female scientist, but I was also grew frustrated with Jahren for her continuous lack of foresight and planning, and the ways her actions (and inactions) impacted those around her. I know these symptoms are directly tied to her mental illness, and she writes about that with candor and bravery, and I do agree that we need more of this - normalizing, familiarizing. Thankfully, with time and experience, things did get better - for everyone. My favorite part was Jahren and Bill's time in the Arctic, digging up ancient trees. I really enjoyed that scene of Bill dancing, and her description of it. 3.5 stars"
49,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48087215-joce-squibblesreads,4,"I def recommend the audiobook! Hope Jahren reads it herself and you can really feel the emotion as she tells you her life story. I always enjoy listening to women in science talk about their work and their experience navigating the field when especially in the past, men were lauded and revered for their accomplishments and women really had to fight for everything. The only thing I’d say which is entirely. a personal thing is that I don’t naturally gravitate toward her field and don’t find it super compelling but the way she told it made me infinitely more interested so no negatives there.

50,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6108495-marnie-enchanted-bibliophile,5,"This is simply brilliant.From the idea, to the writing, to the narration, and all the feelings it awakes makes writing a review useless in my opinion. JUST GO READ IT YOURSELF!"
51,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115473-siria,3,"My rating for this book is a reflection not so much of my enjoyment of it as my acknowledgement of its importance. Hope Jahren is a successful female research scientist working within a STEM field that's still overwhelmingly male-dominated, a woman with mental illness who has been able to forge an academic career—voices like hers are too rarely heard in academia in general and STEM fields in particular. Jahren focuses less on the highs of her career (she's won multiple Fulbrights, for instance, but I'm not sure that she even mentions that in the book) than she does on the lows and even more so the monotonous middle: the antisocial hours spent doing repetitive prep work in the lab, the constant scrabble to secure funding, the gauntlet of aggressions (micro and macro) faced by women in academia.However, for all Jahren's ability to be very upfront about her experiences (she clearly prides herself on her bluntness), Lab Girl is the kind of memoir that suffers from the author's lack of self-awareness. Although I'm not in a STEM field, I am a woman in academia, and so I'm quite familiar with other women (almost always white women) like Jahren: women for whom sexism is odious inasmuch as it affects them, but who care not one jot about systemic sexism or how it affects other women. Almost the only women to feature in the book are Jahren and her mother (who is treated with a hostility which I find inexplicable, given that nothing in the behaviour attributed to her seems particularly egregious or all that different from that ascribed to Jahren's beloved father), and I was almost surprised to end a book not having encountered a paragraph in which Jahren explains why she's Not Like the Other Girls. More overtly jarring were Jahren's descriptions of her interactions with students and the means by which she ""trains in"" new graduate students. If these were the anecdotes she thought made her look like a competent instructor, I'm hoping her grad students have insurance which lets them access a good therapist—or failing that, that they have access to a steady supply of palatable beer. Don't haze your students! Don't pass on fucked-up measures of academic ""worth"" to students just because academia is messed up and most graduate advisors don't know pedagogical theory from a hole in the wall!Listening to this as an audiobook was also a mistake. Jahren's talents are undoubtedly many, but acting out even her own words is not one she possesses. The vocal quivering and gulping she employed were distracting and maudlin; it was like listening to an audiobook from the Victorian period. Listening to the audiobook version also made the section set in Ireland extra obnoxious to me (an Irishwoman), and retroactively made me question the trustworthiness of great swathes of the book. The most egregious example of this is when Jahren describes getting lost in Limerick City, and attributes this to the fact that all of the street signs are in Irish. (Now, I've heard Americans mangle Irish over the years, but never so comprehensively as Hope Jahren. I honestly asked myself if she'd just spoken in Klingon, had to go look up the text of the book on Google Books, and then shrieked at the realisation that she was trying to say ""Sráid Eibhlín.) Here's the thing: street signs in Ireland are bilingual, with the English-language text generally appearing in larger font, and the Irish-language version smaller and in italics. There's no way that Jahren was lost and distractedly trying to figure out where ""Sráid Eibhlín"" was; she had to have known all along that she was on Ellen Street. This might seem like nitpicking, but such an obvious twisting of the truth—whether in service of a little bit of drama or getting an extra bit of comedy out of the Weird Irish—felt like the literary version of the bad scientific practice of p-hacking."
52,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13126933-lata,5,"This was excellent. From the beautiful writing about her family, or of her struggles with building and maintaining a lab, or her long friendship with colleague Bill, or of her struggles with bipolar disorder, or the lyrical sections about plant life, I thoroughly enjoyed this memoir. I was fascinated, and listened, rapt, though the many events of Hope Jahren's life, and I learned some great things too, about the glorious plants on this planet that we couldn't exist without."
53,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/99765491-jimz,3,"I give this memoir 3 stars. Pros:•	Her descriptions of how plants and trees grow were in general fabulous. Terribly complicated biology and she was able to describe it in language that was not condescending but just was utterly fascinating. She explained a number of biological phenomena throughout the book and her explanations in most cases at least for me were just at about the right length...long enough so I could understand the basic phenomenon but not so long as to make me lose interest. So kudos to her for that. •	Her descriptions of her mania and depression were scary-sad. It’s obvious she had some major hurdles in her life that her own body were creating for her…I am glad that she is at the position she is at today… Her troubles reminded me of the memoir, An Unquiet Mind, by Kay Redfield Jamison, a psychologist who herself had bipolar disorder (which I highly recommend GR folks to read). •	Dr. Jahren’s description of growing up and her going to her father’s lab was quite interesting, as well as the family dynamics (and sometimes lack thereof….there was not a lot of overt affection that her parents showed her apparently and she also was not close to her brothers). In a later part of the book she made a comment that “I didn’t know if I was crying because I was nobody’s wife or mother – or because I felt like nobody’s daughter–…”. So it appeared she had next to no relationship with her family after she left home for grad school and beyond, yet there is this book dedication which seemed odd at least to me: “Everything I write is dedicated to my mother.”•	Her description of academia is for the most part (I am in and come from academia) realistic. She for many a year lived on what is called “soft money” in which her lab was dependent on governmental grants. “Her lab” means her salary and her assistants’ salaries and money needed to conduct her experiments. One is always having to write research grants (with no guarantee that a particular grant will ever get funded), because the money always seems to be running out. And that’s OK in a way…there is no free lunch…but still it is stressful not only for principal investigators but those working for them (in this memoir for example, Bill her lab manager).Cons:•	The book was way too long for its own good. •	Some of the long drawn-out conversations between her and her comrade-in-arms Bill that she relates to us could have been either shortened or deleted. She wrote the conversations in a verbatim style as if they just happened yesterday when in many instances the conversations happened in the late 1990s or early 2000s. Some of the conversations were “dopey” for lack of a better word – people just do not talk like that. •	I really did not like Bill. Just my problem I guess. He appeared to be satisfied working 80-hour weeks, not having a life outside of the lab, working apparently at times on starvation wages, literally living in the lab building at times, living in a van… She portrays him as some sort of hero to her…he never grew on me. To me he had an anti-social personality. And he sure swore a lot. •	She is introducing us to a scientific field, plant biology, and she does a fantastic job. But there was one part of the book that just got me pissed off. It’s when she and her lab visited a place that housed monkeys called the Monkey Jungle. And what she did, as an esteemed scientist, was anthropomorphize the primates to an extent in which it was in one respect laughable (not funny laughable), but in another respect a disservice to both the animals and to science (“…she saw in Monkey Jungle a doppelganger for her lab”). “…Two small squirrel monkeys seemed to be trapped in their own private Samuel Beckett play, caught in a web made of equal parts dependence and loathing. … A single howler monkey sat high on a branch in the back, wailing out the entire Book of Job in his native tongue while periodically raising his arms in an age-old supplication for an explanation as to why the righteous must suffer.” Went beyond the pale for me.Reviews:https://www.theguardian.com/books/201... https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/29/bo...

54,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2329065-joanie,4,"'Science is work, nothing more and nothing less. And so we will keep working as another day dawns and this week turns into next week, and then this month becomes next month. I can feel the warmth of the same brilliant sun that shines above the forest and onto the green world, but in my heart I know that I am not a plant. I am more like an ant, driven to find and carry single dead needles, one after the other, all the way across the forest and then add them one by one to a pile so massive that I can only fully imagine one small corner of it.' (p. 277)This book was such a joy. A part memoir, part ode to plant life and the grind of a scientist, written so engagingly that you can't help but feel ready to kick off your shoes, then step right into the soil to collect some samples to label the next thousand times over. That's a lot coming from me. As much as I can appreciate nature, I'm far from being outdoorsy, with my city living and my rampant fear of bugs. Hope Jahren allows us all to feel like we have that curiosity inside us to be scientists in our own lives, in small but by no means insignificant ways. She burns with such infectious passion for her work that you can't help but be drawn in too. The book's journey is divided lovingly into: Roots and Leaves, Wood and Knots, and Flowers and Fruit, with individual chapters then going into her work and rhapsodies of the wonder of nature that it all around us (have you looked at a leaf lately and thought about how miraculous it is?), then somehow works it all in with her personal life and her relationship with Bill, which is utterly undefinable in the most wonderful of ways. Here's one of the many, many plant-related passages that I loved, which described not just nature but her and Bill:'Why are they together, the tree and the fungus? We don't know. The fungus could certainly live very well alone almost anywhere, but it chooses to entwine itself with the tree over an easier and more independent life. It has adapted to seek the rush of pure sweetness that comes directly from a plant root, such a strange and concentrated compound, unlike anything to be found elsewhere in the forest. And perhaps the fungus can somehow sense that when it is part of a symbiosis, it is also not alone.' (p. 105)I suppose a caveat is in order: for those readers who aren't too interested in the science, it can be a bit tedious and may lose you a bit if you haven't been in a science class since high school, however the enthusiasm and dedication that Jahren has will win you over. I felt comforted reading about all her experiments out in the fields and how meticulously everything had to be done, and then rejoiced when results came through that led to conclusions and consequently, more funding! You'll root (ha!) for her and Bill every step of the way. She's also quite honest about her struggles, not just at work but at home as well, which I didn't expect. It's very difficult to admit to desperate times when you can't see what's ahead of you, or loneliness, much less mental health struggles. I appreciated the book even more for Jahren's willingness to talk about all this and the vulnerability that comes with it. A very moving memoir. It may surprise you how much you will want to read about the inner workings and patience of a seed, or how the surprisingly softness of spongy moss led to a way of finding solid people to work with, until you pick this up, and then it doesn't. It just feels right to see the world like this."

When I saw it on the new book shelf at the library I brought it home with me.""Each beginning is the end of a waiting. We are each given exactly one chance to be. Each of us is both impossible and inevitable. Every replete tree was first a seed that waited.""Jahren has faced many challenges: a lonely childhood, working herself through school, struggling as a female scientist against the prejudices of a male dominated field, finding funding for her projects. Her success can be verified by her choice as one of Time's 100 Most Influential People, her Fulbright Scholarships, and her long relationship with her lab partner Bill. She found love and faced a difficult pregnancy sans medication for her bipolar disorder to have the child that changed her life.""I have learned that raising a child is essentially one long, slow agony of letting go.""Jahren's writing is so lovely to read. Her love of her work as a geobioloist and her awe of nature shines through the pages. She alternates chapters on her life with chapters about the world of green growing things around us.The self-portrait Jahren paints reveals her personal challenges and insecurities without being confessional and raw.

56,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3788241-elena,5,"In my mind, a great memoir has you singing along with the writer when she is happy, and aching with her when she is sad. Hope Jahren's excellent memoir Lab Girl does just that. Jahren intersperses stories about plants with stories about science with stories about her own life in a way that is masterful and utterly engaging. I didn't expect to enjoy reading about plants or to learn about them (I'm an ecologist) but I found myself loving those sections. Jahren's unique insights into why it is important to understand how plants grow add a fascinating layer to what in lesser hands might have been 'just biology'. The stories about science illuminate how science really works - what it takes to get money to do the work, and how it all really unfolds in the lab. And the stories about Jahren's life and how her choices led her to be the person she is bring the book together as a complete whole.As Heather says, this is a book for those who love science or memoir. But it is also a book for all those who simply love well-crafted stories about courageous lives and courageous women and learning how to be a good person in a complex world.  "
57,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/714583-anita-pomerantz,5,"Fascinating read that is hard to parse. Is it about a female scientist? A relationship between a man and a woman like no other? Manic depression? Botany?The author really holds nothing back in this memoir, and I found Hope to be pretty fascinating. She's nerdy and mentally ill and loving and a workaholic. She is an incredible scientist and a tremendous writer. For me, the highlight of this book is her description of her relationship with her lab employee (partner?), Bill. I couldn't decide what to make of it. Were they in love? Like siblings? Just great colleagues with a shared passion for the work? Whatever it is/was, it was very interesting.In addition, the structure of the book is well done. The reader alternately learns something about plant life, and then the subsequent chapter highlights parallels in human life. I have little science background, but thought most of the explanations were clear and educational. I imagine Hope is an excellent teacher, with the ability to both be engaging and impart knowledge at the same time.Really, almost a five star read for me."
58,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19126246-kaitlin,0,"I ended up DNF-ing this one at 200pages in (which I know is fairly close to the end). I actually loved the science-y bits of this, where the author shows her flair for studying plants, her passion for their care, and also her stunning ability to write beautifully about them. However, although I think these sections were great, Hope Jahren's actual backstory and the way she wrote about her journey just didn't 'click' with me and I found it super hard to connect or relate at all. This really took me out of the book and so ultimately I was forcing myself to pick it up, and that's no fun, so I just decided it was time to put it down and give it to someone else who may enjoy it far more. Ah well. "
59,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4059160-amy,5,"Jahren's book is full of passion and love for her family, friends and work. It is a memoir of sorts with the life cycle of a tree interspersed with her own stories. A fantastic read!"
60,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/260116-janb,5,"I finished this memoir a few days ago and in trying to get my thoughts together for a review, I read what my GR friends said about the book, and I realized it's all been said and said so much better and eloquently than I could.So I'll just say I loved it. I listened to the audiobook, read by the author , and she does an excellent job. I loved hearing about her life and passion as a scientist, her illness (bipolar), her quirky friend Bill, her marriage, motherhood, and yes, I even loved the science-y parts. I'll never look at a tree the same and I now have even more respect for research scientists.Highly recommended."
61,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4271946-jessica-woodbury,4,"I waited for a long time to read this book even though it came highly recommended from several scientists. I was skeptical about the title. And while I am not a scientist by profession, I did train as an undergrad and earn a BS. The thing about scientists is we are very territorial. I am a Chemist. My Physicist friends say, ""But Chemistry is all Physics!"" and they are not entirely wrong. I often scoff at Biology, Botany, Zoology, etc. and say, ""But you're ignoring all the Chemistry!"" So the Botany angle here did not move it up my TBR list.But. As a baby scientist myself, and as someone who spent several years married to a scientist during his PhD and basically lived and breathed lab culture, ultimately I couldn't stay away. I had to see what all the fuss about and I had to see if Jahren got it right. Many people don't. If you are intimidated by a very scientific read, don't be afraid. Jahren's years of teaching experience have clearly created someone who is skilled at turning complex scientific processes and ideas into easily digestible narratives. If you are concerned it will not be scientific enough, there's enough interesting data here to sate you, though I did wish I learned more about Jahren's own research.The thing about this book, though, the thing that makes it one of my favorites of the year isn't just that Jahren gets lab life right, it's how skillfully she tells the stories of trees alongside her own story. I have never ever cared about a tree more than I did during this book. And I was lucky enough to listen to the audio (read beautifully by Jahren herself) while I drove past the blazing autumn leaves of New England, so every tree seemed somehow magical. If someone had taught me about plants the way Jahren does, where it is not just a process to learn and a life cycle to memorize, but where every single step along the way is a miracle in and of itself, I can see myself seriously considering Botany as a potential major. This book in the hands of a college student could be life changing.Some may find Jahren's story not interesting enough for a memoir. But this is not a memoir that is built around a journey. It is showing you who she is, and a big part of it focuses on the incredibly close relationship she has with her lab partner, Bill. While they mean absolutely everything to one another, they are not intimate friends, not secret sharers, not confidants. Learning the rhythms of their conversation and the routines of their friendship will show you the kind of relationship you probably haven't seen before. Jahren covers many things here besides science. Parenthood, the chill Scandinavian traditions of the Midwest, the slog of early academic life, and her own struggle with bipolar disorder. Her writing is simple but deliberate and lovely. I enjoyed every moment listening to her read. "
62,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10001905-lynn,0,"My first thoughts, this book is in a word, odd. It is a memoir written by a bipolar paleobiologist and her Asperger’s like, one-handed best friend/lab assistant. They stumble through the US and Europe trying to do good science. The book is about three things. 1. Science: we learn about the scientific method, how a mass spectrometer works, and that trees have memory (all of which was much more interesting than I would have thought). 2. Love and Family: in all its permutations, good/bad, expressed/unexpressed, chosen/not chosen. 3. Academia: a close and accurate look at the tarnished Ivory tower with tales of sexism, cut throat competition, and the never ending search for money. Despite her struggles, she becomes an award winning and accomplished scholar with her best friend by her side. My final thoughts: this book is in a word, captivating. "
63,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5159766-l-a-starks,5,"What a shame this utterly amazing book has such a lame title. My advice is to forget the title and read the book. Jahren, a three-time Fulbright winner, has written a reader-friendly, relationship-centered sequence of stories about her experience as a paleobotany researcher. There is much to learn and Jahren doesn't shrink from explaining it. However, the terms and structure are highly accessible. The book is one of those rare fusions of science and humanity that many readers so often wish for but can seldom find. The reason is simple--it takes a polymath like Ms. Jahren to understand and love the labwork and yet also be able to explain it to non-scientists. This is the biology class--really much more--you wish you'd experienced. At the same time, Jahren is clear about the difficulties of an academic scientist's life--getting grants, writing proposals, acquiring equipment, paying lab assistants, the necessity of moving on to better opportunities. She writes with joy about marriage, her son, her struggle with bipolarity, and most of all about her talented, brilliant assistant, Bill.About the title: this is apparently the season of ""The Girl Who..."" after the success of The Girl on the Train. Unfortunately, ""Lab GIRL"" is diminutive, and diminishes, the complex, warm, fascinating PhD scientist we meet in its pages. I wish the publishers had worked harder to come up with a title that better represents this story. "
64,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6677659-marchpane,3,"An uneven read for me. Loved the science-y bits, found the personal memoir sections either tedious or grating. "
65,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3965659-rachel,2,"This is a textbook case of 'it's not you, it's me.' I understand the appeal, and in a lot of ways I'm thrilled about this book's mainstream success (women in STEM fields and healthy, platonic relationships between men and women are two things we need more of in media), but there were only so many loving descriptions of trees I could take after a while. There was just too much science and not enough human interest to keep me engaged, and while I wouldn't say you need to be knowledgeable about biology to approach this book, a certain amount of interest would be helpful, and I just don't have that, at all. And the audiobook was a mistake; the author narrates it with a positively bizarre amount of melodrama (like, actually in tears at multiple points, and I'm sorry if that makes me sound callous but I really don't react well to overly sentimental narration), so I can't say it was a pleasant listening experience... But anyway, really not a bad book, just not my kind of book."
66,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56398848-nisa,5,"Firstly i want to thank Elyse for recommending this book and letting me have a chance to read it :)Hope firstly began with her childhood and then suddenly make a jumb to her recent life (to introduce herself but kept it short) in lab with Bill (of course they can't be thought apart :)) It was nice in the beginning but after she met with Bill and they began to work together in her lab it's like everything fell into place and real story began. When she told about her studies it was not boring but interesting some of them was long but she kept its length good enough and she shared with us interesting facts about plants. First i began listening this novel as an audio book but because when i listened i kept lost track when i came places she talks about her studies (they are not in my domain and English is my second language and i'm not good enough to listen everything) after that i bought it as an e book and went on by reading.If i think as a whole i loved this book and i loved the way she finished it. But if i talk about its part some part was boring, some exiting and make me happy, sad and worried (I want to say life is not so different). When Hope writing about her life she was so sincere and because of that when she was happy i was happy with her, and worried about her when she feel desperate. I think she is so good at telling her life story and i want to that everything would be good for her. I loved her and the way she tells her story but mostly and all i loved Bill and his answers (I usually marked what he said). In addition i think i love more Bill because she loved (as an important friend) Bill more than herself. And i would love to have friendship like theirs . ""He is strong where I am weak, and so together we make one complete person, each of us gaining half of what we need from the world and the other half from each other."" this is the way she describe their friendship with her words.Here the things that Bill said and make me laugh :)This conversation happened when Hope and Bill met first time. She was assisting a lecture that in this class students need to dig earth. She realize he was digging alone and he cought attention of her""I stood there and watched him dig for a while, and began to notice the uncommonly large amount of earth that he was moving with each shovelful and the implied strength that must have accompanied his wiry frame. I also noticed that he was digging with something that looked like an old harpoon flattened at one end – a sword beaten into a real plowshare.""“Where did you get that shovel?” I asked, figuring it was from the pile of junk I had hauled out of the department’s equipment locker, which had been located in the basement next to an old coal hull. “It’s mine,” he said. “Don’t judge it until you’ve dug a mile in its shoes.” “You mean you brought your own shovel from home?” I laughed in friendly surprise and delight. “Hell yes,” he affirmed. “I wasn’t going to leave this thing unattended for six weeks.” “I like your thinking,” I replied.And this one when they go to monkey jungle and when he said that he was looking a monkey it seems shocked as much as him. ""Bill finally stated, without redirecting his stare, “It’s like looking in a fucking mirror.”""Well if i share all of them this review will be too long and i would be more happy if you decide to read and see for yourself :)) Have a great week. :))"
67,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17951043-perri,4,"I love a book that educates me in a non-painful way. Jahren alternates chapters between her journey as a scientist and her knowledge and passion for botany. Of special interest to me was reading about the difficulties she faced especially as a Research Botanist. Some readers in my book club found her whiny, but I thought she was just being honest in her struggles with an antiseptic upbringing, mental illness, and sexist road blocks from being a woman in a male dominated fields. I learned it takes a really special person to do research experiments.The tension to me of mind numbing monotonous tasks coupled with the stringent standards of proof, well let's just say it's not a field for most people. Added to that is the constant struggle for adequate funding. I found it quite enjoyable with bonus botanic bits."
68,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6787827-linda,4,"I bought this book because it was a good deal, wondering if I would ever read it. What a surprise! It is a great combination of life and science. I found it very interesting and will never look at trees or plants in the same way."
69,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8024272-kasia,4,I might never look at a trees and plants the same way. Seriously thinking about planting my own oak tree on the back yard and watch it grow. 
70,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6449756-sonja-arlow,3,"3 1/2 starsI have always had a love of medicine and science (all though my high school results on science may tell another story) so I was immediately drawn to this book.Hope grew up in her father’s laboratory surrounded by Bunsen burners, petri dishes and access to everything a curious child my want to investigate in a lab. It’s not surprising that she was brought up in an academically focused household and even her mother studied part time and included her daughter in her learning process.I really appreciated the fact that all the experiments or processes in the book was explained so that any person no matter how unenlightened about science, could grasp the concepts.”My laboratory is like a church because it is where I figure out what I believe”I loved reading about her part-time work at a local hospital while studying – it gave me glimpses of the nuts and bolts of running a hospital and more than once I wished that she had become a doctor rather than a botanist.My feelings towards flora is neither here nor there so naturally some of the chapters dealing with the workings of plants didn’t really interest me but one thing came across crystal clear and that is her absolute passion about what she does for a living.  “I will never stop being ravenously hungry for science, no matter how well it feeds me”I also found the sections dealing with just how difficult it is to secure funding for scientific projects are as well as glimpses on Hope dealing with her bi-polar disease, eye-opening. But it’s her friendship with Bill, her lab partner, that stood out for me. So this is a mix between work as a scientist, information about botany and a young woman trying to carve a foothold for herself in a male dominated industry. This may not be for everyone but it was a very enjoyable and informative read for me."
71,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27078093-alice-lippart,4,Enjoyable and really interesting. Loved all the science!
72,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5637143-anna,2,"I'm very curious what other scientists, particularly women, think of this book. To me, the best writing in the book was in the short chapters about plants, even though some of the cool plant insights were already familiar to me since I've worked in plant labs for some years. The rest was uneven, tended toward telling instead of showing, and I think because of this the relationships come out feeling flat, even her relationship with Bill which is clearly important and meant to feel more three-dimensional. Overall, although I certainly support women in science telling their stories, this didn't live up to my expectations, not even close, and I would take Evelyn Fox Keller's 'A Feeling for the Organism' or Susan Brind Morrow's 'Wolves and Honey' or Lauren Redniss's 'Radioactive' over Lab Girl any day of the week. One more note: Jahren sometimes explicitly or implicitly gives the impression that there's one correct way to be a scientist: you have to be immediately driven forward by your failures, never discouraged by them, you have to be able to work for 48 hours straight, you have to have always known science is what you wanted. There is no one way to be a scientist: this is completely untrue, as it is untrue of any profession, and don't let it discourage you or any young girl you know from pursuing science."
73,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1881113-andrea,3,"Such a short book, but it took me forever to read it. I should have liked it more than I actually did. Hope Jahren's part-memoir, part-scientific reflection has humour, memorable personalities, fun educational material, and some truly moving recollections. The problem was that sometimes Jahren's could become too dramatic. I had the misfortune to listen to the audiobook while walking my dog, and I swear it made me want to pull my hair out. The teary, choking voice at the end of nearly every chapter that was supposed to make me feel emotions while the author dwelled in self-pity was like nails on chalkboard. I also went into the book thinking this would be more of a love letter to botany and some interesting findings the author discovered during her career (I never read blurbs), but instead I got mostly a memoir, interlaced some musings on plants that supported the mood for these memories. And this is officially the longest sentence I've ever written. Needless to say, I am sort of underwhelmed. If you are going to read Lab Girl, please avoid the audio, and be prepared for a lifetime worth of over-reactions to ordinary events. "

So I can't really fault Hope for telling her story. But I can caution potential readers: if you want to know what's it is like to be a scientist, don't rely on this book. This is just one story, and it is not at all typical. You don't have to work 80 hours per week to be a scientist. You can have a life AND be a scientist. If you're a student, you can find a grad advisor who cares about you and invests in your success and doesn't haze you when you first join the lab. In short, Future Scientists, don't be discouraged by reading this. Science takes all kinds, and life in science can be what you want it to be."

Rhythm and cycles permeate the narrative, bouncing between Hope Jahren's ups and downs as a career scientist, and the intricate lives of vegetation. I hadn't even read a synopsis before before I began, and was pleasantly surprised by the delicate unfolding of the book … made from paper, derived from intelligent trees … ~ Just Trust Me: In Praise Of Strange Books (All 3 are 5 star reads!)~Hope Jahren is a celebrated geochemist and geobiologist, not to mention an exceptionally interesting human being. Currently she works at the University of Oslo, and this book is her origin story.Jahren worked with her mother in the garden growing up, first sparking her love of growing things.“By the end of June the whole crop was well on its way and the world around us was so green that it seemed impossible that it could ever have been otherwise. By July, the sweating leaves of all these plants had pumped the air so full of moisture that the humidity caused the electrical lines to buzz and crackle overhead.” She also played in her father’s lab from a young age, inspiring her love for science and hunger to know how things work.“There I transformed from a girl into a scientist, just like Peter Parker becoming Spider-Man, only kind of backward.” Eventually, Jahren’s life intersects with a man named Bill, in a lab—where else? He becomes her loyal assistant, moving locations and building labs with her. There was one point where I kind of hoped they’d get together, but their relationship is unique and special—more like best friends or brother and sister.Did I mention the writing is beautiful? Jahren deals with mental illness and loneliness in such a heartfelt manner it’s impossible not to empathize alongside her. She reads the audiobook and you can hear the emotion in her voice, bleeding through the words. The tone remains positive and manages not to be depressing even when dealing with tough topics. There is hope, and the beauty of science unveiling new understanding to the world. The history and lives of trees are presented in a fascinating way, paralleling various aspects of human lives.If you enjoy plants and true tails of scientific superstars — this book is for you.Quotes:“She set her hair in curlers while listening to records of Carl Sandburg’s poems over and over, and instructed me on how to hear the words differently each time. After discovering Susan Sontag, she explained to me that even meaning itself is a constructed concept, and I learned how to nod and pretend to understand.” “Full-blown mania lets you see the other side of death. Its onset is profoundly visceral and unexpected, no matter how many times you’ve been through it. It is your body that first senses the urgency of a new world about to bloom. Your vertebrae seem to detach from one another and you elongate as if toward the sun’s light. You can’t hear above the sloshing roar of blood pushed through your head by some impossibly sustained orgasm within your beating heart. For the next twenty-four, forty-eight, seventy-two hours you will have to yell to hear yourself over this whooshing. Nothing, nothing can be loud enough or bright enough or move fast enough. The world appears as if through a fish-eye lens; your view is fuzzy with sparkling edges. You have received a grand, systemic injection of Novocain and your entire body tingles briefly before it becomes flaccidly foreign and unreal. Your raised arms are the fleshy petals of a magnificent lily bursting into flower. It deeply dawns on you that this new world about to bloom is you.” “There at the end of the world, he danced in the broad and endless daylight, and I accepted him for what he was, instead of what he wished he could be. The potency of my acceptance made me wonder, just a little, if I could turn it inward and accept myself.” "
77,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13977687-taryn,4,"This memoir could be subtitled “The Private Lives of Plants,” because paleobiologist Hope Jahren can’t help but wax poetic at times about her chosen field of study, with which she is clearly enraptured. Fortunately, she’s pretty convincing. Since my tastes run more toward gossipy tell-alls than science texts, my favorite parts of Lab Girl were Jahren's personal stories of her romance with her husband and decidedly unromantic relationship with her (occasionally homeless but forever loyal) research partner Bill. Amazingly enough, though, I didn't glaze over during the parts about trees and mosses. Jahren is one of those rare scientists able to express her enthusiasm for her subject in a way that translates to the average Jane. The audio version is read by Jahren herself, which makes the more emotional parts of the book ring with authenticity, but if you're bothered by soft, whispery voices, you might prefer to pick up this one in print. If you close your eyes, Jahren sounds just like Ana Gasteyer's character from the classic SNL sketch “Schweddy Balls.”More book recommendations by me at www.readingwithhippos.com"
78,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1291915-lauren,3,"The name of this book never worked for me - it didn't seem to capture what the book was about, and it is diminuitive in nature. Jahren is not a ""girl"", and this book is not cutesy, as the title, and even the cover art, would lead you to believe. Jahren's work in geobotany is fascinating, and I really enjoyed the interspersed chapters on plants, trees, natural history. The personal memoir sections were okay - they showed devotion and commitment to the science. I was frustrated with the roadblocks and glass ceilings that Jahren hit/endured as a female scientist, but I was also grew frustrated with Jahren for her continuous lack of foresight and planning, and the ways her actions (and inactions) impacted those around her. I know these symptoms are directly tied to her mental illness, and she writes about that with candor and bravery, and I do agree that we need more of this - normalizing, familiarizing. Thankfully, with time and experience, things did get better - for everyone. My favorite part was Jahren and Bill's time in the Arctic, digging up ancient trees. I really enjoyed that scene of Bill dancing, and her description of it. 3.5 stars"

Hope Jahren reads it herself and you can really feel the emotion as she tells you her life story. I always enjoy listening to women in science talk about their work and their experience navigating the field when especially in the past, men were lauded and revered for their accomplishments and women really had to fight for everything. The only thing I’d say which is entirely. a personal thing is that I don’t naturally gravitate toward her field and don’t find it super compelling but the way she told it made me infinitely more interested so no negatives there.

80,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6108495-marnie-enchanted-bibliophile,5,"This is simply brilliant.From the idea, to the writing, to the narration, and all the feelings it awakes makes writing a review useless in my opinion. JUST GO READ IT YOURSELF!"
81,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115473-siria,3,"My rating for this book is a reflection not so much of my enjoyment of it as my acknowledgement of its importance. Hope Jahren is a successful female research scientist working within a STEM field that's still overwhelmingly male-dominated, a woman with mental illness who has been able to forge an academic career—voices like hers are too rarely heard in academia in general and STEM fields in particular. Jahren focuses less on the highs of her career (she's won multiple Fulbrights, for instance, but I'm not sure that she even mentions that in the book) than she does on the lows and even more so the monotonous middle: the antisocial hours spent doing repetitive prep work in the lab, the constant scrabble to secure funding, the gauntlet of aggressions (micro and macro) faced by women in academia.However, for all Jahren's ability to be very upfront about her experiences (she clearly prides herself on her bluntness), Lab Girl is the kind of memoir that suffers from the author's lack of self-awareness. Although I'm not in a STEM field, I am a woman in academia, and so I'm quite familiar with other women (almost always white women) like Jahren: women for whom sexism is odious inasmuch as it affects them, but who care not one jot about systemic sexism or how it affects other women. Almost the only women to feature in the book are Jahren and her mother (who is treated with a hostility which I find inexplicable, given that nothing in the behaviour attributed to her seems particularly egregious or all that different from that ascribed to Jahren's beloved father), and I was almost surprised to end a book not having encountered a paragraph in which Jahren explains why she's Not Like the Other Girls. More overtly jarring were Jahren's descriptions of her interactions with students and the means by which she ""trains in"" new graduate students. If these were the anecdotes she thought made her look like a competent instructor, I'm hoping her grad students have insurance which lets them access a good therapist—or failing that, that they have access to a steady supply of palatable beer. Don't haze your students! Don't pass on fucked-up measures of academic ""worth"" to students just because academia is messed up and most graduate advisors don't know pedagogical theory from a hole in the wall!Listening to this as an audiobook was also a mistake. Jahren's talents are undoubtedly many, but acting out even her own words is not one she possesses. The vocal quivering and gulping she employed were distracting and maudlin; it was like listening to an audiobook from the Victorian period. Listening to the audiobook version also made the section set in Ireland extra obnoxious to me (an Irishwoman), and retroactively made me question the trustworthiness of great swathes of the book. The most egregious example of this is when Jahren describes getting lost in Limerick City, and attributes this to the fact that all of the street signs are in Irish. (Now, I've heard Americans mangle Irish over the years, but never so comprehensively as Hope Jahren. I honestly asked myself if she'd just spoken in Klingon, had to go look up the text of the book on Google Books, and then shrieked at the realisation that she was trying to say ""Sráid Eibhlín.) Here's the thing: street signs in Ireland are bilingual, with the English-language text generally appearing in larger font, and the Irish-language version smaller and in italics. There's no way that Jahren was lost and distractedly trying to figure out where ""Sráid Eibhlín"" was; she had to have known all along that she was on Ellen Street. This might seem like nitpicking, but such an obvious twisting of the truth—whether in service of a little bit of drama or getting an extra bit of comedy out of the Weird Irish—felt like the literary version of the bad scientific practice of p-hacking."

From the beautiful writing about her family, or of her struggles with building and maintaining a lab, or her long friendship with colleague Bill, or of her struggles with bipolar disorder, or the lyrical sections about plant life, I thoroughly enjoyed this memoir. I was fascinated, and listened, rapt, though the many events of Hope Jahren's life, and I learned some great things too, about the glorious plants on this planet that we couldn't exist without."
83,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/99765491-jimz,3,"I give this memoir 3 stars. Pros:•	Her descriptions of how plants and trees grow were in general fabulous. Terribly complicated biology and she was able to describe it in language that was not condescending but just was utterly fascinating. She explained a number of biological phenomena throughout the book and her explanations in most cases at least for me were just at about the right length...long enough so I could understand the basic phenomenon but not so long as to make me lose interest. So kudos to her for that. •	Her descriptions of her mania and depression were scary-sad. It’s obvious she had some major hurdles in her life that her own body were creating for her…I am glad that she is at the position she is at today… Her troubles reminded me of the memoir, An Unquiet Mind, by Kay Redfield Jamison, a psychologist who herself had bipolar disorder (which I highly recommend GR folks to read). •	Dr. Jahren’s description of growing up and her going to her father’s lab was quite interesting, as well as the family dynamics (and sometimes lack thereof….there was not a lot of overt affection that her parents showed her apparently and she also was not close to her brothers). In a later part of the book she made a comment that “I didn’t know if I was crying because I was nobody’s wife or mother – or because I felt like nobody’s daughter–…”. So it appeared she had next to no relationship with her family after she left home for grad school and beyond, yet there is this book dedication which seemed odd at least to me: “Everything I write is dedicated to my mother.”•	Her description of academia is for the most part (I am in and come from academia) realistic. She for many a year lived on what is called “soft money” in which her lab was dependent on governmental grants. “Her lab” means her salary and her assistants’ salaries and money needed to conduct her experiments. One is always having to write research grants (with no guarantee that a particular grant will ever get funded), because the money always seems to be running out. And that’s OK in a way…there is no free lunch…but still it is stressful not only for principal investigators but those working for them (in this memoir for example, Bill her lab manager).Cons:•	The book was way too long for its own good. •	Some of the long drawn-out conversations between her and her comrade-in-arms Bill that she relates to us could have been either shortened or deleted. She wrote the conversations in a verbatim style as if they just happened yesterday when in many instances the conversations happened in the late 1990s or early 2000s. Some of the conversations were “dopey” for lack of a better word – people just do not talk like that. •	I really did not like Bill. Just my problem I guess. He appeared to be satisfied working 80-hour weeks, not having a life outside of the lab, working apparently at times on starvation wages, literally living in the lab building at times, living in a van… She portrays him as some sort of hero to her…he never grew on me. To me he had an anti-social personality. And he sure swore a lot. •	She is introducing us to a scientific field, plant biology, and she does a fantastic job. But there was one part of the book that just got me pissed off. It’s when she and her lab visited a place that housed monkeys called the Monkey Jungle. And what she did, as an esteemed scientist, was anthropomorphize the primates to an extent in which it was in one respect laughable (not funny laughable), but in another respect a disservice to both the animals and to science (“…she saw in Monkey Jungle a doppelganger for her lab”). “…Two small squirrel monkeys seemed to be trapped in their own private Samuel Beckett play, caught in a web made of equal parts dependence and loathing. … A single howler monkey sat high on a branch in the back, wailing out the entire Book of Job in his native tongue while periodically raising his arms in an age-old supplication for an explanation as to why the righteous must suffer.” Went beyond the pale for me.Reviews:https://www.theguardian.com/books/201... https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/29/bo...

And so we will keep working as another day dawns and this week turns into next week, and then this month becomes next month. I can feel the warmth of the same brilliant sun that shines above the forest and onto the green world, but in my heart I know that I am not a plant. I am more like an ant, driven to find and carry single dead needles, one after the other, all the way across the forest and then add them one by one to a pile so massive that I can only fully imagine one small corner of it.' (p. 277)This book was such a joy. A part memoir, part ode to plant life and the grind of a scientist, written so engagingly that you can't help but feel ready to kick off your shoes, then step right into the soil to collect some samples to label the next thousand times over. That's a lot coming from me. As much as I can appreciate nature, I'm far from being outdoorsy, with my city living and my rampant fear of bugs. Hope Jahren allows us all to feel like we have that curiosity inside us to be scientists in our own lives, in small but by no means insignificant ways. She burns with such infectious passion for her work that you can't help but be drawn in too. The book's journey is divided lovingly into: Roots and Leaves, Wood and Knots, and Flowers and Fruit, with individual chapters then going into her work and rhapsodies of the wonder of nature that it all around us (have you looked at a leaf lately and thought about how miraculous it is?), then somehow works it all in with her personal life and her relationship with Bill, which is utterly undefinable in the most wonderful of ways. Here's one of the many, many plant-related passages that I loved, which described not just nature but her and Bill:'Why are they together, the tree and the fungus? We don't know. The fungus could certainly live very well alone almost anywhere, but it chooses to entwine itself with the tree over an easier and more independent life. It has adapted to seek the rush of pure sweetness that comes directly from a plant root, such a strange and concentrated compound, unlike anything to be found elsewhere in the forest. And perhaps the fungus can somehow sense that when it is part of a symbiosis, it is also not alone.' (p. 105)I suppose a caveat is in order: for those readers who aren't too interested in the science, it can be a bit tedious and may lose you a bit if you haven't been in a science class since high school, however the enthusiasm and dedication that Jahren has will win you over. I felt comforted reading about all her experiments out in the fields and how meticulously everything had to be done, and then rejoiced when results came through that led to conclusions and consequently, more funding! You'll root (ha!) for her and Bill every step of the way. She's also quite honest about her struggles, not just at work but at home as well, which I didn't expect. It's very difficult to admit to desperate times when you can't see what's ahead of you, or loneliness, much less mental health struggles. I appreciated the book even more for Jahren's willingness to talk about all this and the vulnerability that comes with it. A very moving memoir. It may surprise you how much you will want to read about the inner workings and patience of a seed, or how the surprisingly softness of spongy moss led to a way of finding solid people to work with, until you pick this up, and then it doesn't. It just feels right to see the world like this."

When I saw it on the new book shelf at the library I brought it home with me.""Each beginning is the end of a waiting. We are each given exactly one chance to be. Each of us is both impossible and inevitable. Every replete tree was first a seed that waited.""Jahren has faced many challenges: a lonely childhood, working herself through school, struggling as a female scientist against the prejudices of a male dominated field, finding funding for her projects. Her success can be verified by her choice as one of Time's 100 Most Influential People, her Fulbright Scholarships, and her long relationship with her lab partner Bill. She found love and faced a difficult pregnancy sans medication for her bipolar disorder to have the child that changed her life.""I have learned that raising a child is essentially one long, slow agony of letting go.""Jahren's writing is so lovely to read. Her love of her work as a geobioloist and her awe of nature shines through the pages. She alternates chapters on her life with chapters about the world of green growing things around us.The self-portrait Jahren paints reveals her personal challenges and insecurities without being confessional and raw. Her lab partner/best friend/soul mate Bill is interesting and complicated, eccentric and brilliant. He once lived in a hole in his parent's back yard. We come to love him as much as Jahren does. We are happy when her loneliness is ended by marrying a man who 'gets her.'To read a section of the book go to http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/boo...To read an interview with Jahren go to http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/the-se..."
86,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3788241-elena,5,"In my mind, a great memoir has you singing along with the writer when she is happy, and aching with her when she is sad. Hope Jahren's excellent memoir Lab Girl does just that. Jahren intersperses stories about plants with stories about science with stories about her own life in a way that is masterful and utterly engaging. I didn't expect to enjoy reading about plants or to learn about them (I'm an ecologist) but I found myself loving those sections. Jahren's unique insights into why it is important to understand how plants grow add a fascinating layer to what in lesser hands might have been 'just biology'. The stories about science illuminate how science really works - what it takes to get money to do the work, and how it all really unfolds in the lab. And the stories about Jahren's life and how her choices led her to be the person she is bring the book together as a complete whole.As Heather says, this is a book for those who love science or memoir. But it is also a book for all those who simply love well-crafted stories about courageous lives and courageous women and learning how to be a good person in a complex world.  "
87,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/714583-anita-pomerantz,5,"Fascinating read that is hard to parse. Is it about a female scientist? A relationship between a man and a woman like no other? Manic depression? Botany?The author really holds nothing back in this memoir, and I found Hope to be pretty fascinating. She's nerdy and mentally ill and loving and a workaholic. She is an incredible scientist and a tremendous writer. For me, the highlight of this book is her description of her relationship with her lab employee (partner?), Bill. I couldn't decide what to make of it. Were they in love? Like siblings? Just great colleagues with a shared passion for the work? Whatever it is/was, it was very interesting.In addition, the structure of the book is well done. The reader alternately learns something about plant life, and then the subsequent chapter highlights parallels in human life. I have little science background, but thought most of the explanations were clear and educational. I imagine Hope is an excellent teacher, with the ability to both be engaging and impart knowledge at the same time.Really, almost a five star read for me."
88,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19126246-kaitlin,0,"I ended up DNF-ing this one at 200pages in (which I know is fairly close to the end). I actually loved the science-y bits of this, where the author shows her flair for studying plants, her passion for their care, and also her stunning ability to write beautifully about them. However, although I think these sections were great, Hope Jahren's actual backstory and the way she wrote about her journey just didn't 'click' with me and I found it super hard to connect or relate at all. This really took me out of the book and so ultimately I was forcing myself to pick it up, and that's no fun, so I just decided it was time to put it down and give it to someone else who may enjoy it far more. Ah well. "
89,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4059160-amy,5,"Jahren's book is full of passion and love for her family, friends and work. It is a memoir of sorts with the life cycle of a tree interspersed with her own stories. A fantastic read!"
90,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/260116-janb,5,"I finished this memoir a few days ago and in trying to get my thoughts together for a review, I read what my GR friends said about the book, and I realized it's all been said and said so much better and eloquently than I could.So I'll just say I loved it. I listened to the audiobook, read by the author , and she does an excellent job. I loved hearing about her life and passion as a scientist, her illness (bipolar), her quirky friend Bill, her marriage, motherhood, and yes, I even loved the science-y parts. I'll never look at a tree the same and I now have even more respect for research scientists.Highly recommended."
91,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4271946-jessica-woodbury,4,"I waited for a long time to read this book even though it came highly recommended from several scientists. I was skeptical about the title. And while I am not a scientist by profession, I did train as an undergrad and earn a BS. The thing about scientists is we are very territorial. I am a Chemist. My Physicist friends say, ""But Chemistry is all Physics!"" and they are not entirely wrong. I often scoff at Biology, Botany, Zoology, etc. and say, ""But you're ignoring all the Chemistry!"" So the Botany angle here did not move it up my TBR list.But. As a baby scientist myself, and as someone who spent several years married to a scientist during his PhD and basically lived and breathed lab culture, ultimately I couldn't stay away. I had to see what all the fuss about and I had to see if Jahren got it right. Many people don't. If you are intimidated by a very scientific read, don't be afraid. Jahren's years of teaching experience have clearly created someone who is skilled at turning complex scientific processes and ideas into easily digestible narratives. If you are concerned it will not be scientific enough, there's enough interesting data here to sate you, though I did wish I learned more about Jahren's own research.The thing about this book, though, the thing that makes it one of my favorites of the year isn't just that Jahren gets lab life right, it's how skillfully she tells the stories of trees alongside her own story. I have never ever cared about a tree more than I did during this book. And I was lucky enough to listen to the audio (read beautifully by Jahren herself) while I drove past the blazing autumn leaves of New England, so every tree seemed somehow magical. If someone had taught me about plants the way Jahren does, where it is not just a process to learn and a life cycle to memorize, but where every single step along the way is a miracle in and of itself, I can see myself seriously considering Botany as a potential major. This book in the hands of a college student could be life changing.Some may find Jahren's story not interesting enough for a memoir. But this is not a memoir that is built around a journey. It is showing you who she is, and a big part of it focuses on the incredibly close relationship she has with her lab partner, Bill. While they mean absolutely everything to one another, they are not intimate friends, not secret sharers, not confidants. Learning the rhythms of their conversation and the routines of their friendship will show you the kind of relationship you probably haven't seen before. Jahren covers many things here besides science. Parenthood, the chill Scandinavian traditions of the Midwest, the slog of early academic life, and her own struggle with bipolar disorder. Her writing is simple but deliberate and lovely. I enjoyed every moment listening to her read. "
92,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10001905-lynn,0,"My first thoughts, this book is in a word, odd. It is a memoir written by a bipolar paleobiologist and her Asperger’s like, one-handed best friend/lab assistant. They stumble through the US and Europe trying to do good science. The book is about three things. 1. Science: we learn about the scientific method, how a mass spectrometer works, and that trees have memory (all of which was much more interesting than I would have thought). 2. Love and Family: in all its permutations, good/bad, expressed/unexpressed, chosen/not chosen. 3. Academia: a close and accurate look at the tarnished Ivory tower with tales of sexism, cut throat competition, and the never ending search for money. Despite her struggles, she becomes an award winning and accomplished scholar with her best friend by her side. My final thoughts: this book is in a word, captivating. "
93,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5159766-l-a-starks,5,"What a shame this utterly amazing book has such a lame title. My advice is to forget the title and read the book. Jahren, a three-time Fulbright winner, has written a reader-friendly, relationship-centered sequence of stories about her experience as a paleobotany researcher. There is much to learn and Jahren doesn't shrink from explaining it. However, the terms and structure are highly accessible. The book is one of those rare fusions of science and humanity that many readers so often wish for but can seldom find. The reason is simple--it takes a polymath like Ms. Jahren to understand and love the labwork and yet also be able to explain it to non-scientists. This is the biology class--really much more--you wish you'd experienced. At the same time, Jahren is clear about the difficulties of an academic scientist's life--getting grants, writing proposals, acquiring equipment, paying lab assistants, the necessity of moving on to better opportunities. She writes with joy about marriage, her son, her struggle with bipolarity, and most of all about her talented, brilliant assistant, Bill.About the title: this is apparently the season of ""The Girl Who..."" after the success of The Girl on the Train. Unfortunately, ""Lab GIRL"" is diminutive, and diminishes, the complex, warm, fascinating PhD scientist we meet in its pages. I wish the publishers had worked harder to come up with a title that better represents this story. "
94,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6677659-marchpane,3,"An uneven read for me. Loved the science-y bits, found the personal memoir sections either tedious or grating. "
95,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3965659-rachel,2,"This is a textbook case of 'it's not you, it's me.' I understand the appeal, and in a lot of ways I'm thrilled about this book's mainstream success (women in STEM fields and healthy, platonic relationships between men and women are two things we need more of in media), but there were only so many loving descriptions of trees I could take after a while. There was just too much science and not enough human interest to keep me engaged, and while I wouldn't say you need to be knowledgeable about biology to approach this book, a certain amount of interest would be helpful, and I just don't have that, at all. And the audiobook was a mistake; the author narrates it with a positively bizarre amount of melodrama (like, actually in tears at multiple points, and I'm sorry if that makes me sound callous but I really don't react well to overly sentimental narration), so I can't say it was a pleasant listening experience... But anyway, really not a bad book, just not my kind of book."
96,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56398848-nisa,5,"Firstly i want to thank Elyse for recommending this book and letting me have a chance to read it :)Hope firstly began with her childhood and then suddenly make a jumb to her recent life (to introduce herself but kept it short) in lab with Bill (of course they can't be thought apart :)) It was nice in the beginning but after she met with Bill and they began to work together in her lab it's like everything fell into place and real story began. When she told about her studies it was not boring but interesting some of them was long but she kept its length good enough and she shared with us interesting facts about plants. First i began listening this novel as an audio book but because when i listened i kept lost track when i came places she talks about her studies (they are not in my domain and English is my second language and i'm not good enough to listen everything) after that i bought it as an e book and went on by reading.If i think as a whole i loved this book and i loved the way she finished it. But if i talk about its part some part was boring, some exiting and make me happy, sad and worried (I want to say life is not so different). When Hope writing about her life she was so sincere and because of that when she was happy i was happy with her, and worried about her when she feel desperate. I think she is so good at telling her life story and i want to that everything would be good for her. I loved her and the way she tells her story but mostly and all i loved Bill and his answers (I usually marked what he said). In addition i think i love more Bill because she loved (as an important friend) Bill more than herself. And i would love to have friendship like theirs . ""He is strong where I am weak, and so together we make one complete person, each of us gaining half of what we need from the world and the other half from each other."" this is the way she describe their friendship with her words.Here the things that Bill said and make me laugh :)This conversation happened when Hope and Bill met first time. She was assisting a lecture that in this class students need to dig earth. She realize he was digging alone and he cought attention of her""I stood there and watched him dig for a while, and began to notice the uncommonly large amount of earth that he was moving with each shovelful and the implied strength that must have accompanied his wiry frame. I also noticed that he was digging with something that looked like an old harpoon flattened at one end – a sword beaten into a real plowshare.""“Where did you get that shovel?” I asked, figuring it was from the pile of junk I had hauled out of the department’s equipment locker, which had been located in the basement next to an old coal hull. “It’s mine,” he said. “Don’t judge it until you’ve dug a mile in its shoes.” “You mean you brought your own shovel from home?” I laughed in friendly surprise and delight. “Hell yes,” he affirmed. “I wasn’t going to leave this thing unattended for six weeks.” “I like your thinking,” I replied.And this one when they go to monkey jungle and when he said that he was looking a monkey it seems shocked as much as him. ""Bill finally stated, without redirecting his stare, “It’s like looking in a fucking mirror.”""Well if i share all of them this review will be too long and i would be more happy if you decide to read and see for yourself :)) Have a great week. :))"
97,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17951043-perri,4,"I love a book that educates me in a non-painful way. Jahren alternates chapters between her journey as a scientist and her knowledge and passion for botany. Of special interest to me was reading about the difficulties she faced especially as a Research Botanist. Some readers in my book club found her whiny, but I thought she was just being honest in her struggles with an antiseptic upbringing, mental illness, and sexist road blocks from being a woman in a male dominated fields. I learned it takes a really special person to do research experiments.The tension to me of mind numbing monotonous tasks coupled with the stringent standards of proof, well let's just say it's not a field for most people. Added to that is the constant struggle for adequate funding. I found it quite enjoyable with bonus botanic bits."

100,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6449756-sonja-arlow,3,"3 1/2 starsI have always had a love of medicine and science (all though my high school results on science may tell another story) so I was immediately drawn to this book.Hope grew up in her father’s laboratory surrounded by Bunsen burners, petri dishes and access to everything a curious child my want to investigate in a lab. It’s not surprising that she was brought up in an academically focused household and even her mother studied part time and included her daughter in her learning process.I really appreciated the fact that all the experiments or processes in the book was explained so that any person no matter how unenlightened about science, could grasp the concepts.”My laboratory is like a church because it is where I figure out what I believe”I loved reading about her part-time work at a local hospital while studying – it gave me glimpses of the nuts and bolts of running a hospital and more than once I wished that she had become a doctor rather than a botanist.My feelings towards flora is neither here nor there so naturally some of the chapters dealing with the workings of plants didn’t really interest me but one thing came across crystal clear and that is her absolute passion about what she does for a living.  “I will never stop being ravenously hungry for science, no matter how well it feeds me”I also found the sections dealing with just how difficult it is to secure funding for scientific projects are as well as glimpses on Hope dealing with her bi-polar disease, eye-opening. But it’s her friendship with Bill, her lab partner, that stood out for me. So this is a mix between work as a scientist, information about botany and a young woman trying to carve a foothold for herself in a male dominated industry. This may not be for everyone but it was a very enjoyable and informative read for me."

102,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5637143-anna,2,"I'm very curious what other scientists, particularly women, think of this book. To me, the best writing in the book was in the short chapters about plants, even though some of the cool plant insights were already familiar to me since I've worked in plant labs for some years. The rest was uneven, tended toward telling instead of showing, and I think because of this the relationships come out feeling flat, even her relationship with Bill which is clearly important and meant to feel more three-dimensional. Overall, although I certainly support women in science telling their stories, this didn't live up to my expectations, not even close, and I would take Evelyn Fox Keller's 'A Feeling for the Organism' or Susan Brind Morrow's 'Wolves and Honey' or Lauren Redniss's 'Radioactive' over Lab Girl any day of the week. One more note: Jahren sometimes explicitly or implicitly gives the impression that there's one correct way to be a scientist: you have to be immediately driven forward by your failures, never discouraged by them, you have to be able to work for 48 hours straight, you have to have always known science is what you wanted. There is no one way to be a scientist: this is completely untrue, as it is untrue of any profession, and don't let it discourage you or any young girl you know from pursuing science."
103,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1881113-andrea,3,"Such a short book, but it took me forever to read it. I should have liked it more than I actually did. Hope Jahren's part-memoir, part-scientific reflection has humour, memorable personalities, fun educational material, and some truly moving recollections. The problem was that sometimes Jahren's could become too dramatic. I had the misfortune to listen to the audiobook while walking my dog, and I swear it made me want to pull my hair out. The teary, choking voice at the end of nearly every chapter that was supposed to make me feel emotions while the author dwelled in self-pity was like nails on chalkboard. I also went into the book thinking this would be more of a love letter to botany and some interesting findings the author discovered during her career (I never read blurbs), but instead I got mostly a memoir, interlaced some musings on plants that supported the mood for these memories. And this is officially the longest sentence I've ever written. Needless to say, I am sort of underwhelmed. If you are going to read Lab Girl, please avoid the audio, and be prepared for a lifetime worth of over-reactions to ordinary events. "

So I can't really fault Hope for telling her story. But I can caution potential readers: if you want to know what's it is like to be a scientist, don't rely on this book. This is just one story, and it is not at all typical. You don't have to work 80 hours per week to be a scientist. You can have a life AND be a scientist. If you're a student, you can find a grad advisor who cares about you and invests in your success and doesn't haze you when you first join the lab.

Currently she works at the University of Oslo, and this book is her origin story.Jahren worked with her mother in the garden growing up, first sparking her love of growing things.“By the end of June the whole crop was well on its way and the world around us was so green that it seemed impossible that it could ever have been otherwise. By July, the sweating leaves of all these plants had pumped the air so full of moisture that the humidity caused the electrical lines to buzz and crackle overhead.” She also played in her father’s lab from a young age, inspiring her love for science and hunger to know how things work.“There I transformed from a girl into a scientist, just like Peter Parker becoming Spider-Man, only kind of backward.” Eventually, Jahren’s life intersects with a man named Bill, in a lab—where else? He becomes her loyal assistant, moving locations and building labs with her. There was one point where I kind of hoped they’d get together, but their relationship is unique and special—more like best friends or brother and sister.Did I mention the writing is beautiful? Jahren deals with mental illness and loneliness in such a heartfelt manner it’s impossible not to empathize alongside her. She reads the audiobook and you can hear the emotion in her voice, bleeding through the words. The tone remains positive and manages not to be depressing even when dealing with tough topics. There is hope, and the beauty of science unveiling new understanding to the world. The history and lives of trees are presented in a fascinating way, paralleling various aspects of human lives.If you enjoy plants and true tails of scientific superstars — this book is for you.Quotes:“She set her hair in curlers while listening to records of Carl Sandburg’s poems over and over, and instructed me on how to hear the words differently each time. After discovering Susan Sontag, she explained to me that even meaning itself is a constructed concept, and I learned how to nod and pretend to understand.” “Full-blown mania lets you see the other side of death. Its onset is profoundly visceral and unexpected, no matter how many times you’ve been through it. It is your body that first senses the urgency of a new world about to bloom. Your vertebrae seem to detach from one another and you elongate as if toward the sun’s light. You can’t hear above the sloshing roar of blood pushed through your head by some impossibly sustained orgasm within your beating heart. For the next twenty-four, forty-eight, seventy-two hours you will have to yell to hear yourself over this whooshing. Nothing, nothing can be loud enough or bright enough or move fast enough. The world appears as if through a fish-eye lens; your view is fuzzy with sparkling edges. You have received a grand, systemic injection of Novocain and your entire body tingles briefly before it becomes flaccidly foreign and unreal. Your raised arms are the fleshy petals of a magnificent lily bursting into flower. It deeply dawns on you that this new world about to bloom is you.” “There at the end of the world, he danced in the broad and endless daylight, and I accepted him for what he was, instead of what he wished he could be. The potency of my acceptance made me wonder, just a little, if I could turn it inward and accept myself.” "

Fortunately, she’s pretty convincing. Since my tastes run more toward gossipy tell-alls than science texts, my favorite parts of Lab Girl were Jahren's personal stories of her romance with her husband and decidedly unromantic relationship with her (occasionally homeless but forever loyal) research partner Bill. Amazingly enough, though, I didn't glaze over during the parts about trees and mosses. Jahren is one of those rare scientists able to express her enthusiasm for her subject in a way that translates to the average Jane. The audio version is read by Jahren herself, which makes the more emotional parts of the book ring with authenticity, but if you're bothered by soft, whispery voices, you might prefer to pick up this one in print. If you close your eyes, Jahren sounds just like Ana Gasteyer's character from the classic SNL sketch “Schweddy Balls.”More book recommendations by me at www.readingwithhippos.com"
108,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1291915-lauren,3,"The name of this book never worked for me - it didn't seem to capture what the book was about, and it is diminuitive in nature. Jahren is not a ""girl"", and this book is not cutesy, as the title, and even the cover art, would lead you to believe. Jahren's work in geobotany is fascinating, and I really enjoyed the interspersed chapters on plants, trees, natural history. The personal memoir sections were okay - they showed devotion and commitment to the science. I was frustrated with the roadblocks and glass ceilings that Jahren hit/endured as a female scientist, but I was also grew frustrated with Jahren for her continuous lack of foresight and planning, and the ways her actions (and inactions) impacted those around her. I know these symptoms are directly tied to her mental illness, and she writes about that with candor and bravery, and I do agree that we need more of this - normalizing, familiarizing. Thankfully, with time and experience, things did get better - for everyone. My favorite part was Jahren and Bill's time in the Arctic, digging up ancient trees. I really enjoyed that scene of Bill dancing, and her description of it. 3.5 stars"
109,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48087215-joce-squibblesreads,4,"I def recommend the audiobook! Hope Jahren reads it herself and you can really feel the emotion as she tells you her life story. I always enjoy listening to women in science talk about their work and their experience navigating the field when especially in the past, men were lauded and revered for their accomplishments and women really had to fight for everything. The only thing I’d say which is entirely. a personal thing is that I don’t naturally gravitate toward her field and don’t find it super compelling but the way she told it made me infinitely more interested so no negatives there.

110,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6108495-marnie-enchanted-bibliophile,5,"This is simply brilliant.From the idea, to the writing, to the narration, and all the feelings it awakes makes writing a review useless in my opinion. JUST GO READ IT YOURSELF!"
111,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115473-siria,3,"My rating for this book is a reflection not so much of my enjoyment of it as my acknowledgement of its importance. Hope Jahren is a successful female research scientist working within a STEM field that's still overwhelmingly male-dominated, a woman with mental illness who has been able to forge an academic career—voices like hers are too rarely heard in academia in general and STEM fields in particular. Jahren focuses less on the highs of her career (she's won multiple Fulbrights, for instance, but I'm not sure that she even mentions that in the book) than she does on the lows and even more so the monotonous middle: the antisocial hours spent doing repetitive prep work in the lab, the constant scrabble to secure funding, the gauntlet of aggressions (micro and macro) faced by women in academia.However, for all Jahren's ability to be very upfront about her experiences (she clearly prides herself on her bluntness), Lab Girl is the kind of memoir that suffers from the author's lack of self-awareness. Although I'm not in a STEM field, I am a woman in academia, and so I'm quite familiar with other women (almost always white women) like Jahren: women for whom sexism is odious inasmuch as it affects them, but who care not one jot about systemic sexism or how it affects other women. Almost the only women to feature in the book are Jahren and her mother (who is treated with a hostility which I find inexplicable, given that nothing in the behaviour attributed to her seems particularly egregious or all that different from that ascribed to Jahren's beloved father), and I was almost surprised to end a book not having encountered a paragraph in which Jahren explains why she's Not Like the Other Girls. More overtly jarring were Jahren's descriptions of her interactions with students and the means by which she ""trains in"" new graduate students. If these were the anecdotes she thought made her look like a competent instructor, I'm hoping her grad students have insurance which lets them access a good therapist—or failing that, that they have access to a steady supply of palatable beer. Don't haze your students! Don't pass on fucked-up measures of academic ""worth"" to students just because academia is messed up and most graduate advisors don't know pedagogical theory from a hole in the wall!Listening to this as an audiobook was also a mistake. Jahren's talents are undoubtedly many, but acting out even her own words is not one she possesses. The vocal quivering and gulping she employed were distracting and maudlin; it was like listening to an audiobook from the Victorian period. Listening to the audiobook version also made the section set in Ireland extra obnoxious to me (an Irishwoman), and retroactively made me question the trustworthiness of great swathes of the book. The most egregious example of this is when Jahren describes getting lost in Limerick City, and attributes this to the fact that all of the street signs are in Irish. (Now, I've heard Americans mangle Irish over the years, but never so comprehensively as Hope Jahren. I honestly asked myself if she'd just spoken in Klingon, had to go look up the text of the book on Google Books, and then shrieked at the realisation that she was trying to say ""Sráid Eibhlín.) Here's the thing: street signs in Ireland are bilingual, with the English-language text generally appearing in larger font, and the Irish-language version smaller and in italics. There's no way that Jahren was lost and distractedly trying to figure out where ""Sráid Eibhlín"" was; she had to have known all along that she was on Ellen Street. This might seem like nitpicking, but such an obvious twisting of the truth—whether in service of a little bit of drama or getting an extra bit of comedy out of the Weird Irish—felt like the literary version of the bad scientific practice of p-hacking."
112,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13126933-lata,5,"This was excellent. From the beautiful writing about her family, or of her struggles with building and maintaining a lab, or her long friendship with colleague Bill, or of her struggles with bipolar disorder, or the lyrical sections about plant life, I thoroughly enjoyed this memoir. I was fascinated, and listened, rapt, though the many events of Hope Jahren's life, and I learned some great things too, about the glorious plants on this planet that we couldn't exist without."
113,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/99765491-jimz,3,"I give this memoir 3 stars. Pros:•	Her descriptions of how plants and trees grow were in general fabulous. Terribly complicated biology and she was able to describe it in language that was not condescending but just was utterly fascinating. She explained a number of biological phenomena throughout the book and her explanations in most cases at least for me were just at about the right length...long enough so I could understand the basic phenomenon but not so long as to make me lose interest. So kudos to her for that. •	Her descriptions of her mania and depression were scary-sad. It’s obvious she had some major hurdles in her life that her own body were creating for her…I am glad that she is at the position she is at today… Her troubles reminded me of the memoir, An Unquiet Mind, by Kay Redfield Jamison, a psychologist who herself had bipolar disorder (which I highly recommend GR folks to read). •	Dr. Jahren’s description of growing up and her going to her father’s lab was quite interesting, as well as the family dynamics (and sometimes lack thereof….there was not a lot of overt affection that her parents showed her apparently and she also was not close to her brothers). In a later part of the book she made a comment that “I didn’t know if I was crying because I was nobody’s wife or mother – or because I felt like nobody’s daughter–…”. So it appeared she had next to no relationship with her family after she left home for grad school and beyond, yet there is this book dedication which seemed odd at least to me: “Everything I write is dedicated to my mother.”•	Her description of academia is for the most part (I am in and come from academia) realistic. She for many a year lived on what is called “soft money” in which her lab was dependent on governmental grants. “Her lab” means her salary and her assistants’ salaries and money needed to conduct her experiments. One is always having to write research grants (with no guarantee that a particular grant will ever get funded), because the money always seems to be running out. And that’s OK in a way…there is no free lunch…but still it is stressful not only for principal investigators but those working for them (in this memoir for example, Bill her lab manager).Cons:•	The book was way too long for its own good. •	Some of the long drawn-out conversations between her and her comrade-in-arms Bill that she relates to us could have been either shortened or deleted. She wrote the conversations in a verbatim style as if they just happened yesterday when in many instances the conversations happened in the late 1990s or early 2000s. Some of the conversations were “dopey” for lack of a better word – people just do not talk like that. •	I really did not like Bill. Just my problem I guess. He appeared to be satisfied working 80-hour weeks, not having a life outside of the lab, working apparently at times on starvation wages, literally living in the lab building at times, living in a van… She portrays him as some sort of hero to her…he never grew on me. To me he had an anti-social personality. And he sure swore a lot. •	She is introducing us to a scientific field, plant biology, and she does a fantastic job. But there was one part of the book that just got me pissed off. It’s when she and her lab visited a place that housed monkeys called the Monkey Jungle. And what she did, as an esteemed scientist, was anthropomorphize the primates to an extent in which it was in one respect laughable (not funny laughable), but in another respect a disservice to both the animals and to science (“…she saw in Monkey Jungle a doppelganger for her lab”). “…Two small squirrel monkeys seemed to be trapped in their own private Samuel Beckett play, caught in a web made of equal parts dependence and loathing. … A single howler monkey sat high on a branch in the back, wailing out the entire Book of Job in his native tongue while periodically raising his arms in an age-old supplication for an explanation as to why the righteous must suffer.” Went beyond the pale for me.Reviews:https://www.theguardian.com/books/201... https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/29/bo...

114,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2329065-joanie,4,"'Science is work, nothing more and nothing less. And so we will keep working as another day dawns and this week turns into next week, and then this month becomes next month. I can feel the warmth of the same brilliant sun that shines above the forest and onto the green world, but in my heart I know that I am not a plant. I am more like an ant, driven to find and carry single dead needles, one after the other, all the way across the forest and then add them one by one to a pile so massive that I can only fully imagine one small corner of it.' (p. 277)This book was such a joy. A part memoir, part ode to plant life and the grind of a scientist, written so engagingly that you can't help but feel ready to kick off your shoes, then step right into the soil to collect some samples to label the next thousand times over. That's a lot coming from me. As much as I can appreciate nature, I'm far from being outdoorsy, with my city living and my rampant fear of bugs. Hope Jahren allows us all to feel like we have that curiosity inside us to be scientists in our own lives, in small but by no means insignificant ways. She burns with such infectious passion for her work that you can't help but be drawn in too. The book's journey is divided lovingly into: Roots and Leaves, Wood and Knots, and Flowers and Fruit, with individual chapters then going into her work and rhapsodies of the wonder of nature that it all around us (have you looked at a leaf lately and thought about how miraculous it is?), then somehow works it all in with her personal life and her relationship with Bill, which is utterly undefinable in the most wonderful of ways. Here's one of the many, many plant-related passages that I loved, which described not just nature but her and Bill:'Why are they together, the tree and the fungus? We don't know. The fungus could certainly live very well alone almost anywhere, but it chooses to entwine itself with the tree over an easier and more independent life. It has adapted to seek the rush of pure sweetness that comes directly from a plant root, such a strange and concentrated compound, unlike anything to be found elsewhere in the forest. And perhaps the fungus can somehow sense that when it is part of a symbiosis, it is also not alone.' (p. 105)I suppose a caveat is in order: for those readers who aren't too interested in the science, it can be a bit tedious and may lose you a bit if you haven't been in a science class since high school, however the enthusiasm and dedication that Jahren has will win you over. I felt comforted reading about all her experiments out in the fields and how meticulously everything had to be done, and then rejoiced when results came through that led to conclusions and consequently, more funding! You'll root (ha!) for her and Bill every step of the way. She's also quite honest about her struggles, not just at work but at home as well, which I didn't expect. It's very difficult to admit to desperate times when you can't see what's ahead of you, or loneliness, much less mental health struggles. I appreciated the book even more for Jahren's willingness to talk about all this and the vulnerability that comes with it. A very moving memoir. It may surprise you how much you will want to read about the inner workings and patience of a seed, or how the surprisingly softness of spongy moss led to a way of finding solid people to work with, until you pick this up, and then it doesn't. It just feels right to see the world like this."

When I saw it on the new book shelf at the library I brought it home with me.""Each beginning is the end of a waiting. We are each given exactly one chance to be. Each of us is both impossible and inevitable. Every replete tree was first a seed that waited.""Jahren has faced many challenges: a lonely childhood, working herself through school, struggling as a female scientist against the prejudices of a male dominated field, finding funding for her projects. Her success can be verified by her choice as one of Time's 100 Most Influential People, her Fulbright Scholarships, and her long relationship with her lab partner Bill. She found love and faced a difficult pregnancy sans medication for her bipolar disorder to have the child that changed her life.""I have learned that raising a child is essentially one long, slow agony of letting go.""Jahren's writing is so lovely to read. Her love of her work as a geobioloist and her awe of nature shines through the pages. She alternates chapters on her life with chapters about the world of green growing things around us.The self-portrait Jahren paints reveals her personal challenges and insecurities without being confessional and raw. Her lab partner/best friend/soul mate Bill is interesting and complicated, eccentric and brilliant. He once lived in a hole in his parent's back yard. We come to love him as much as Jahren does.

116,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3788241-elena,5,"In my mind, a great memoir has you singing along with the writer when she is happy, and aching with her when she is sad. Hope Jahren's excellent memoir Lab Girl does just that. Jahren intersperses stories about plants with stories about science with stories about her own life in a way that is masterful and utterly engaging. I didn't expect to enjoy reading about plants or to learn about them (I'm an ecologist) but I found myself loving those sections. Jahren's unique insights into why it is important to understand how plants grow add a fascinating layer to what in lesser hands might have been 'just biology'. The stories about science illuminate how science really works - what it takes to get money to do the work, and how it all really unfolds in the lab. And the stories about Jahren's life and how her choices led her to be the person she is bring the book together as a complete whole.As Heather says, this is a book for those who love science or memoir. But it is also a book for all those who simply love well-crafted stories about courageous lives and courageous women and learning how to be a good person in a complex world.  "
117,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/714583-anita-pomerantz,5,"Fascinating read that is hard to parse. Is it about a female scientist? A relationship between a man and a woman like no other? Manic depression? Botany?The author really holds nothing back in this memoir, and I found Hope to be pretty fascinating. She's nerdy and mentally ill and loving and a workaholic. She is an incredible scientist and a tremendous writer. For me, the highlight of this book is her description of her relationship with her lab employee (partner?), Bill. I couldn't decide what to make of it. Were they in love? Like siblings? Just great colleagues with a shared passion for the work? Whatever it is/was, it was very interesting.In addition, the structure of the book is well done. The reader alternately learns something about plant life, and then the subsequent chapter highlights parallels in human life. I have little science background, but thought most of the explanations were clear and educational. I imagine Hope is an excellent teacher, with the ability to both be engaging and impart knowledge at the same time.Really, almost a five star read for me."
118,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19126246-kaitlin,0,"I ended up DNF-ing this one at 200pages in (which I know is fairly close to the end). I actually loved the science-y bits of this, where the author shows her flair for studying plants, her passion for their care, and also her stunning ability to write beautifully about them. However, although I think these sections were great, Hope Jahren's actual backstory and the way she wrote about her journey just didn't 'click' with me and I found it super hard to connect or relate at all. This really took me out of the book and so ultimately I was forcing myself to pick it up, and that's no fun, so I just decided it was time to put it down and give it to someone else who may enjoy it far more. Ah well. "
119,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4059160-amy,5,"Jahren's book is full of passion and love for her family, friends and work. It is a memoir of sorts with the life cycle of a tree interspersed with her own stories. A fantastic read!"
120,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/260116-janb,5,"I finished this memoir a few days ago and in trying to get my thoughts together for a review, I read what my GR friends said about the book, and I realized it's all been said and said so much better and eloquently than I could.So I'll just say I loved it. I listened to the audiobook, read by the author , and she does an excellent job. I loved hearing about her life and passion as a scientist, her illness (bipolar), her quirky friend Bill, her marriage, motherhood, and yes, I even loved the science-y parts. I'll never look at a tree the same and I now have even more respect for research scientists.Highly recommended."
121,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4271946-jessica-woodbury,4,"I waited for a long time to read this book even though it came highly recommended from several scientists. I was skeptical about the title. And while I am not a scientist by profession, I did train as an undergrad and earn a BS. The thing about scientists is we are very territorial. I am a Chemist. My Physicist friends say, ""But Chemistry is all Physics!"" and they are not entirely wrong. I often scoff at Biology, Botany, Zoology, etc. and say, ""But you're ignoring all the Chemistry!"" So the Botany angle here did not move it up my TBR list.But. As a baby scientist myself, and as someone who spent several years married to a scientist during his PhD and basically lived and breathed lab culture, ultimately I couldn't stay away. I had to see what all the fuss about and I had to see if Jahren got it right. Many people don't. If you are intimidated by a very scientific read, don't be afraid. Jahren's years of teaching experience have clearly created someone who is skilled at turning complex scientific processes and ideas into easily digestible narratives. If you are concerned it will not be scientific enough, there's enough interesting data here to sate you, though I did wish I learned more about Jahren's own research.The thing about this book, though, the thing that makes it one of my favorites of the year isn't just that Jahren gets lab life right, it's how skillfully she tells the stories of trees alongside her own story. I have never ever cared about a tree more than I did during this book. And I was lucky enough to listen to the audio (read beautifully by Jahren herself) while I drove past the blazing autumn leaves of New England, so every tree seemed somehow magical. If someone had taught me about plants the way Jahren does, where it is not just a process to learn and a life cycle to memorize, but where every single step along the way is a miracle in and of itself, I can see myself seriously considering Botany as a potential major. This book in the hands of a college student could be life changing.Some may find Jahren's story not interesting enough for a memoir. But this is not a memoir that is built around a journey. It is showing you who she is, and a big part of it focuses on the incredibly close relationship she has with her lab partner, Bill. While they mean absolutely everything to one another, they are not intimate friends, not secret sharers, not confidants. Learning the rhythms of their conversation and the routines of their friendship will show you the kind of relationship you probably haven't seen before. Jahren covers many things here besides science. Parenthood, the chill Scandinavian traditions of the Midwest, the slog of early academic life, and her own struggle with bipolar disorder. Her writing is simple but deliberate and lovely. I enjoyed every moment listening to her read. "
122,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10001905-lynn,0,"My first thoughts, this book is in a word, odd. It is a memoir written by a bipolar paleobiologist and her Asperger’s like, one-handed best friend/lab assistant. They stumble through the US and Europe trying to do good science. The book is about three things. 1. Science: we learn about the scientific method, how a mass spectrometer works, and that trees have memory (all of which was much more interesting than I would have thought). 2. Love and Family: in all its permutations, good/bad, expressed/unexpressed, chosen/not chosen. 3. Academia: a close and accurate look at the tarnished Ivory tower with tales of sexism, cut throat competition, and the never ending search for money. Despite her struggles, she becomes an award winning and accomplished scholar with her best friend by her side. My final thoughts: this book is in a word, captivating. "
123,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5159766-l-a-starks,5,"What a shame this utterly amazing book has such a lame title. My advice is to forget the title and read the book. Jahren, a three-time Fulbright winner, has written a reader-friendly, relationship-centered sequence of stories about her experience as a paleobotany researcher. There is much to learn and Jahren doesn't shrink from explaining it. However, the terms and structure are highly accessible. The book is one of those rare fusions of science and humanity that many readers so often wish for but can seldom find. The reason is simple--it takes a polymath like Ms. Jahren to understand and love the labwork and yet also be able to explain it to non-scientists. This is the biology class--really much more--you wish you'd experienced. At the same time, Jahren is clear about the difficulties of an academic scientist's life--getting grants, writing proposals, acquiring equipment, paying lab assistants, the necessity of moving on to better opportunities. She writes with joy about marriage, her son, her struggle with bipolarity, and most of all about her talented, brilliant assistant, Bill.About the title: this is apparently the season of ""The Girl Who..."" after the success of The Girl on the Train. Unfortunately, ""Lab GIRL"" is diminutive, and diminishes, the complex, warm, fascinating PhD scientist we meet in its pages. I wish the publishers had worked harder to come up with a title that better represents this story. "
124,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6677659-marchpane,3,"An uneven read for me. Loved the science-y bits, found the personal memoir sections either tedious or grating. "
125,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3965659-rachel,2,"This is a textbook case of 'it's not you, it's me.' I understand the appeal, and in a lot of ways I'm thrilled about this book's mainstream success (women in STEM fields and healthy, platonic relationships between men and women are two things we need more of in media), but there were only so many loving descriptions of trees I could take after a while. There was just too much science and not enough human interest to keep me engaged, and while I wouldn't say you need to be knowledgeable about biology to approach this book, a certain amount of interest would be helpful, and I just don't have that, at all. And the audiobook was a mistake; the author narrates it with a positively bizarre amount of melodrama (like, actually in tears at multiple points, and I'm sorry if that makes me sound callous but I really don't react well to overly sentimental narration), so I can't say it was a pleasant listening experience... But anyway, really not a bad book, just not my kind of book."
126,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56398848-nisa,5,"Firstly i want to thank Elyse for recommending this book and letting me have a chance to read it :)Hope firstly began with her childhood and then suddenly make a jumb to her recent life (to introduce herself but kept it short) in lab with Bill (of course they can't be thought apart :)) It was nice in the beginning but after she met with Bill and they began to work together in her lab it's like everything fell into place and real story began. When she told about her studies it was not boring but interesting some of them was long but she kept its length good enough and she shared with us interesting facts about plants. First i began listening this novel as an audio book but because when i listened i kept lost track when i came places she talks about her studies (they are not in my domain and English is my second language and i'm not good enough to listen everything) after that i bought it as an e book and went on by reading.If i think as a whole i loved this book and i loved the way she finished it. But if i talk about its part some part was boring, some exiting and make me happy, sad and worried (I want to say life is not so different). When Hope writing about her life she was so sincere and because of that when she was happy i was happy with her, and worried about her when she feel desperate. I think she is so good at telling her life story and i want to that everything would be good for her. I loved her and the way she tells her story but mostly and all i loved Bill and his answers (I usually marked what he said). In addition i think i love more Bill because she loved (as an important friend) Bill more than herself. And i would love to have friendship like theirs . ""He is strong where I am weak, and so together we make one complete person, each of us gaining half of what we need from the world and the other half from each other."" this is the way she describe their friendship with her words.Here the things that Bill said and make me laugh :)This conversation happened when Hope and Bill met first time. She was assisting a lecture that in this class students need to dig earth. She realize he was digging alone and he cought attention of her""I stood there and watched him dig for a while, and began to notice the uncommonly large amount of earth that he was moving with each shovelful and the implied strength that must have accompanied his wiry frame. I also noticed that he was digging with something that looked like an old harpoon flattened at one end – a sword beaten into a real plowshare.""“Where did you get that shovel?” I asked, figuring it was from the pile of junk I had hauled out of the department’s equipment locker, which had been located in the basement next to an old coal hull. “It’s mine,” he said. “Don’t judge it until you’ve dug a mile in its shoes.” “You mean you brought your own shovel from home?” I laughed in friendly surprise and delight. “Hell yes,” he affirmed. “I wasn’t going to leave this thing unattended for six weeks.” “I like your thinking,” I replied.And this one when they go to monkey jungle and when he said that he was looking a monkey it seems shocked as much as him. ""Bill finally stated, without redirecting his stare, “It’s like looking in a fucking mirror.”""Well if i share all of them this review will be too long and i would be more happy if you decide to read and see for yourself :)) Have a great week. :))"

Jahren alternates chapters between her journey as a scientist and her knowledge and passion for botany. Of special interest to me was reading about the difficulties she faced especially as a Research Botanist. Some readers in my book club found her whiny, but I thought she was just being honest in her struggles with an antiseptic upbringing, mental illness, and sexist road blocks from being a woman in a male dominated fields. I learned it takes a really special person to do research experiments.The tension to me of mind numbing monotonous tasks coupled with the stringent standards of proof, well let's just say it's not a field for most people. Added to that is the constant struggle for adequate funding. I found it quite enjoyable with bonus botanic bits."
128,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6787827-linda,4,"I bought this book because it was a good deal, wondering if I would ever read it. What a surprise! It is a great combination of life and science. I found it very interesting and will never look at trees or plants in the same way."
129,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8024272-kasia,4,I might never look at a trees and plants the same way. Seriously thinking about planting my own oak tree on the back yard and watch it grow. 
130,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6449756-sonja-arlow,3,"3 1/2 starsI have always had a love of medicine and science (all though my high school results on science may tell another story) so I was immediately drawn to this book.Hope grew up in her father’s laboratory surrounded by Bunsen burners, petri dishes and access to everything a curious child my want to investigate in a lab. It’s not surprising that she was brought up in an academically focused household and even her mother studied part time and included her daughter in her learning process.I really appreciated the fact that all the experiments or processes in the book was explained so that any person no matter how unenlightened about science, could grasp the concepts.”My laboratory is like a church because it is where I figure out what I believe”I loved reading about her part-time work at a local hospital while studying – it gave me glimpses of the nuts and bolts of running a hospital and more than once I wished that she had become a doctor rather than a botanist.My feelings towards flora is neither here nor there so naturally some of the chapters dealing with the workings of plants didn’t really interest me but one thing came across crystal clear and that is her absolute passion about what she does for a living.  “I will never stop being ravenously hungry for science, no matter how well it feeds me”I also found the sections dealing with just how difficult it is to secure funding for scientific projects are as well as glimpses on Hope dealing with her bi-polar disease, eye-opening. But it’s her friendship with Bill, her lab partner, that stood out for me. So this is a mix between work as a scientist, information about botany and a young woman trying to carve a foothold for herself in a male dominated industry. This may not be for everyone but it was a very enjoyable and informative read for me."
131,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27078093-alice-lippart,4,Enjoyable and really interesting. Loved all the science!
132,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5637143-anna,2,"I'm very curious what other scientists, particularly women, think of this book. To me, the best writing in the book was in the short chapters about plants, even though some of the cool plant insights were already familiar to me since I've worked in plant labs for some years. The rest was uneven, tended toward telling instead of showing, and I think because of this the relationships come out feeling flat, even her relationship with Bill which is clearly important and meant to feel more three-dimensional. Overall, although I certainly support women in science telling their stories, this didn't live up to my expectations, not even close, and I would take Evelyn Fox Keller's 'A Feeling for the Organism' or Susan Brind Morrow's 'Wolves and Honey' or Lauren Redniss's 'Radioactive' over Lab Girl any day of the week. One more note: Jahren sometimes explicitly or implicitly gives the impression that there's one correct way to be a scientist: you have to be immediately driven forward by your failures, never discouraged by them, you have to be able to work for 48 hours straight, you have to have always known science is what you wanted. There is no one way to be a scientist: this is completely untrue, as it is untrue of any profession, and don't let it discourage you or any young girl you know from pursuing science."
133,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1881113-andrea,3,"Such a short book, but it took me forever to read it. I should have liked it more than I actually did. Hope Jahren's part-memoir, part-scientific reflection has humour, memorable personalities, fun educational material, and some truly moving recollections. The problem was that sometimes Jahren's could become too dramatic. I had the misfortune to listen to the audiobook while walking my dog, and I swear it made me want to pull my hair out. The teary, choking voice at the end of nearly every chapter that was supposed to make me feel emotions while the author dwelled in self-pity was like nails on chalkboard. I also went into the book thinking this would be more of a love letter to botany and some interesting findings the author discovered during her career (I never read blurbs), but instead I got mostly a memoir, interlaced some musings on plants that supported the mood for these memories. And this is officially the longest sentence I've ever written. Needless to say, I am sort of underwhelmed. If you are going to read Lab Girl, please avoid the audio, and be prepared for a lifetime worth of over-reactions to ordinary events. "

So I can't really fault Hope for telling her story. But I can caution potential readers: if you want to know what's it is like to be a scientist, don't rely on this book. This is just one story, and it is not at all typical. You don't have to work 80 hours per week to be a scientist. You can have a life AND be a scientist. If you're a student, you can find a grad advisor who cares about you and invests in your success and doesn't haze you when you first join the lab. In short, Future Scientists, don't be discouraged by reading this. Science takes all kinds, and life in science can be what you want it to be."

I like how she writes about her personal life, including her career in academia. Great read."

Rhythm and cycles permeate the narrative, bouncing between Hope Jahren's ups and downs as a career scientist, and the intricate lives of vegetation. I hadn't even read a synopsis before before I began, and was pleasantly surprised by the delicate unfolding of the book … made from paper, derived from intelligent trees … ~ Just Trust Me: In Praise Of Strange Books (All 3 are 5 star reads!)~Hope Jahren is a celebrated geochemist and geobiologist, not to mention an exceptionally interesting human being. Currently she works at the University of Oslo, and this book is her origin story.Jahren worked with her mother in the garden growing up, first sparking her love of growing things.“By the end of June the whole crop was well on its way and the world around us was so green that it seemed impossible that it could ever have been otherwise. By July, the sweating leaves of all these plants had pumped the air so full of moisture that the humidity caused the electrical lines to buzz and crackle overhead.” She also played in her father’s lab from a young age, inspiring her love for science and hunger to know how things work.“There I transformed from a girl into a scientist, just like Peter Parker becoming Spider-Man, only kind of backward.” Eventually, Jahren’s life intersects with a man named Bill, in a lab—where else? He becomes her loyal assistant, moving locations and building labs with her. There was one point where I kind of hoped they’d get together, but their relationship is unique and special—more like best friends or brother and sister.Did I mention the writing is beautiful? Jahren deals with mental illness and loneliness in such a heartfelt manner it’s impossible not to empathize alongside her. She reads the audiobook and you can hear the emotion in her voice, bleeding through the words. The tone remains positive and manages not to be depressing even when dealing with tough topics. There is hope, and the beauty of science unveiling new understanding to the world. The history and lives of trees are presented in a fascinating way, paralleling various aspects of human lives.If you enjoy plants and true tails of scientific superstars — this book is for you.Quotes:“She set her hair in curlers while listening to records of Carl Sandburg’s poems over and over, and instructed me on how to hear the words differently each time. After discovering Susan Sontag, she explained to me that even meaning itself is a constructed concept, and I learned how to nod and pretend to understand.” “Full-blown mania lets you see the other side of death. Its onset is profoundly visceral and unexpected, no matter how many times you’ve been through it. It is your body that first senses the urgency of a new world about to bloom. Your vertebrae seem to detach from one another and you elongate as if toward the sun’s light. You can’t hear above the sloshing roar of blood pushed through your head by some impossibly sustained orgasm within your beating heart. For the next twenty-four, forty-eight, seventy-two hours you will have to yell to hear yourself over this whooshing. Nothing, nothing can be loud enough or bright enough or move fast enough. The world appears as if through a fish-eye lens; your view is fuzzy with sparkling edges. You have received a grand, systemic injection of Novocain and your entire body tingles briefly before it becomes flaccidly foreign and unreal. Your raised arms are the fleshy petals of a magnificent lily bursting into flower. It deeply dawns on you that this new world about to bloom is you.” “There at the end of the world, he danced in the broad and endless daylight, and I accepted him for what he was, instead of what he wished he could be. The potency of my acceptance made me wonder, just a little, if I could turn it inward and accept myself.” "
137,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13977687-taryn,4,"This memoir could be subtitled “The Private Lives of Plants,” because paleobiologist Hope Jahren can’t help but wax poetic at times about her chosen field of study, with which she is clearly enraptured. Fortunately, she’s pretty convincing. Since my tastes run more toward gossipy tell-alls than science texts, my favorite parts of Lab Girl were Jahren's personal stories of her romance with her husband and decidedly unromantic relationship with her (occasionally homeless but forever loyal) research partner Bill. Amazingly enough, though, I didn't glaze over during the parts about trees and mosses. Jahren is one of those rare scientists able to express her enthusiasm for her subject in a way that translates to the average Jane. The audio version is read by Jahren herself, which makes the more emotional parts of the book ring with authenticity, but if you're bothered by soft, whispery voices, you might prefer to pick up this one in print. If you close your eyes, Jahren sounds just like Ana Gasteyer's character from the classic SNL sketch “Schweddy Balls.”More book recommendations by me at www.readingwithhippos.com"
138,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1291915-lauren,3,"The name of this book never worked for me - it didn't seem to capture what the book was about, and it is diminuitive in nature. Jahren is not a ""girl"", and this book is not cutesy, as the title, and even the cover art, would lead you to believe. Jahren's work in geobotany is fascinating, and I really enjoyed the interspersed chapters on plants, trees, natural history. The personal memoir sections were okay - they showed devotion and commitment to the science. I was frustrated with the roadblocks and glass ceilings that Jahren hit/endured as a female scientist, but I was also grew frustrated with Jahren for her continuous lack of foresight and planning, and the ways her actions (and inactions) impacted those around her. I know these symptoms are directly tied to her mental illness, and she writes about that with candor and bravery, and I do agree that we need more of this - normalizing, familiarizing. Thankfully, with time and experience, things did get better - for everyone. My favorite part was Jahren and Bill's time in the Arctic, digging up ancient trees. I really enjoyed that scene of Bill dancing, and her description of it. 3.5 stars"
139,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48087215-joce-squibblesreads,4,"I def recommend the audiobook! Hope Jahren reads it herself and you can really feel the emotion as she tells you her life story. I always enjoy listening to women in science talk about their work and their experience navigating the field when especially in the past, men were lauded and revered for their accomplishments and women really had to fight for everything. The only thing I’d say which is entirely. a personal thing is that I don’t naturally gravitate toward her field and don’t find it super compelling but the way she told it made me infinitely more interested so no negatives there.

141,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115473-siria,3,"My rating for this book is a reflection not so much of my enjoyment of it as my acknowledgement of its importance. Hope Jahren is a successful female research scientist working within a STEM field that's still overwhelmingly male-dominated, a woman with mental illness who has been able to forge an academic career—voices like hers are too rarely heard in academia in general and STEM fields in particular. Jahren focuses less on the highs of her career (she's won multiple Fulbrights, for instance, but I'm not sure that she even mentions that in the book) than she does on the lows and even more so the monotonous middle: the antisocial hours spent doing repetitive prep work in the lab, the constant scrabble to secure funding, the gauntlet of aggressions (micro and macro) faced by women in academia.However, for all Jahren's ability to be very upfront about her experiences (she clearly prides herself on her bluntness), Lab Girl is the kind of memoir that suffers from the author's lack of self-awareness. Although I'm not in a STEM field, I am a woman in academia, and so I'm quite familiar with other women (almost always white women) like Jahren: women for whom sexism is odious inasmuch as it affects them, but who care not one jot about systemic sexism or how it affects other women. Almost the only women to feature in the book are Jahren and her mother (who is treated with a hostility which I find inexplicable, given that nothing in the behaviour attributed to her seems particularly egregious or all that different from that ascribed to Jahren's beloved father), and I was almost surprised to end a book not having encountered a paragraph in which Jahren explains why she's Not Like the Other Girls. More overtly jarring were Jahren's descriptions of her interactions with students and the means by which she ""trains in"" new graduate students. If these were the anecdotes she thought made her look like a competent instructor, I'm hoping her grad students have insurance which lets them access a good therapist—or failing that, that they have access to a steady supply of palatable beer. Don't haze your students! Don't pass on fucked-up measures of academic ""worth"" to students just because academia is messed up and most graduate advisors don't know pedagogical theory from a hole in the wall!Listening to this as an audiobook was also a mistake. Jahren's talents are undoubtedly many, but acting out even her own words is not one she possesses. The vocal quivering and gulping she employed were distracting and maudlin; it was like listening to an audiobook from the Victorian period. Listening to the audiobook version also made the section set in Ireland extra obnoxious to me (an Irishwoman), and retroactively made me question the trustworthiness of great swathes of the book. The most egregious example of this is when Jahren describes getting lost in Limerick City, and attributes this to the fact that all of the street signs are in Irish. (Now, I've heard Americans mangle Irish over the years, but never so comprehensively as Hope Jahren. I honestly asked myself if she'd just spoken in Klingon, had to go look up the text of the book on Google Books, and then shrieked at the realisation that she was trying to say ""Sráid Eibhlín.) Here's the thing: street signs in Ireland are bilingual, with the English-language text generally appearing in larger font, and the Irish-language version smaller and in italics. There's no way that Jahren was lost and distractedly trying to figure out where ""Sráid Eibhlín"" was; she had to have known all along that she was on Ellen Street. This might seem like nitpicking, but such an obvious twisting of the truth—whether in service of a little bit of drama or getting an extra bit of comedy out of the Weird Irish—felt like the literary version of the bad scientific practice of p-hacking."
142,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13126933-lata,5,"This was excellent. From the beautiful writing about her family, or of her struggles with building and maintaining a lab, or her long friendship with colleague Bill, or of her struggles with bipolar disorder, or the lyrical sections about plant life, I thoroughly enjoyed this memoir. I was fascinated, and listened, rapt, though the many events of Hope Jahren's life, and I learned some great things too, about the glorious plants on this planet that we couldn't exist without."
143,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/99765491-jimz,3,"I give this memoir 3 stars. Pros:•	Her descriptions of how plants and trees grow were in general fabulous. Terribly complicated biology and she was able to describe it in language that was not condescending but just was utterly fascinating. She explained a number of biological phenomena throughout the book and her explanations in most cases at least for me were just at about the right length...long enough so I could understand the basic phenomenon but not so long as to make me lose interest. So kudos to her for that. •	Her descriptions of her mania and depression were scary-sad. It’s obvious she had some major hurdles in her life that her own body were creating for her…I am glad that she is at the position she is at today… Her troubles reminded me of the memoir, An Unquiet Mind, by Kay Redfield Jamison, a psychologist who herself had bipolar disorder (which I highly recommend GR folks to read). •	Dr. Jahren’s description of growing up and her going to her father’s lab was quite interesting, as well as the family dynamics (and sometimes lack thereof….there was not a lot of overt affection that her parents showed her apparently and she also was not close to her brothers). In a later part of the book she made a comment that “I didn’t know if I was crying because I was nobody’s wife or mother – or because I felt like nobody’s daughter–…”. So it appeared she had next to no relationship with her family after she left home for grad school and beyond, yet there is this book dedication which seemed odd at least to me: “Everything I write is dedicated to my mother.”•	Her description of academia is for the most part (I am in and come from academia) realistic. She for many a year lived on what is called “soft money” in which her lab was dependent on governmental grants. “Her lab” means her salary and her assistants’ salaries and money needed to conduct her experiments. One is always having to write research grants (with no guarantee that a particular grant will ever get funded), because the money always seems to be running out. And that’s OK in a way…there is no free lunch…but still it is stressful not only for principal investigators but those working for them (in this memoir for example, Bill her lab manager).Cons:•	The book was way too long for its own good. •	Some of the long drawn-out conversations between her and her comrade-in-arms Bill that she relates to us could have been either shortened or deleted. She wrote the conversations in a verbatim style as if they just happened yesterday when in many instances the conversations happened in the late 1990s or early 2000s. Some of the conversations were “dopey” for lack of a better word – people just do not talk like that. •	I really did not like Bill. Just my problem I guess. He appeared to be satisfied working 80-hour weeks, not having a life outside of the lab, working apparently at times on starvation wages, literally living in the lab building at times, living in a van… She portrays him as some sort of hero to her…he never grew on me. To me he had an anti-social personality. And he sure swore a lot. •	She is introducing us to a scientific field, plant biology, and she does a fantastic job. But there was one part of the book that just got me pissed off. It’s when she and her lab visited a place that housed monkeys called the Monkey Jungle. And what she did, as an esteemed scientist, was anthropomorphize the primates to an extent in which it was in one respect laughable (not funny laughable), but in another respect a disservice to both the animals and to science (“…she saw in Monkey Jungle a doppelganger for her lab”). “…Two small squirrel monkeys seemed to be trapped in their own private Samuel Beckett play, caught in a web made of equal parts dependence and loathing. … A single howler monkey sat high on a branch in the back, wailing out the entire Book of Job in his native tongue while periodically raising his arms in an age-old supplication for an explanation as to why the righteous must suffer.” Went beyond the pale for me.Reviews:https://www.theguardian.com/books/201... https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/29/bo...

And so we will keep working as another day dawns and this week turns into next week, and then this month becomes next month. I can feel the warmth of the same brilliant sun that shines above the forest and onto the green world, but in my heart I know that I am not a plant. I am more like an ant, driven to find and carry single dead needles, one after the other, all the way across the forest and then add them one by one to a pile so massive that I can only fully imagine one small corner of it.' (p. 277)This book was such a joy. A part memoir, part ode to plant life and the grind of a scientist, written so engagingly that you can't help but feel ready to kick off your shoes, then step right into the soil to collect some samples to label the next thousand times over. That's a lot coming from me. As much as I can appreciate nature, I'm far from being outdoorsy, with my city living and my rampant fear of bugs. Hope Jahren allows us all to feel like we have that curiosity inside us to be scientists in our own lives, in small but by no means insignificant ways. She burns with such infectious passion for her work that you can't help but be drawn in too. The book's journey is divided lovingly into: Roots and Leaves, Wood and Knots, and Flowers and Fruit, with individual chapters then going into her work and rhapsodies of the wonder of nature that it all around us (have you looked at a leaf lately and thought about how miraculous it is?), then somehow works it all in with her personal life and her relationship with Bill, which is utterly undefinable in the most wonderful of ways. Here's one of the many, many plant-related passages that I loved, which described not just nature but her and Bill:'Why are they together, the tree and the fungus? We don't know. The fungus could certainly live very well alone almost anywhere, but it chooses to entwine itself with the tree over an easier and more independent life. It has adapted to seek the rush of pure sweetness that comes directly from a plant root, such a strange and concentrated compound, unlike anything to be found elsewhere in the forest. And perhaps the fungus can somehow sense that when it is part of a symbiosis, it is also not alone.' (p. 105)I suppose a caveat is in order: for those readers who aren't too interested in the science, it can be a bit tedious and may lose you a bit if you haven't been in a science class since high school, however the enthusiasm and dedication that Jahren has will win you over. I felt comforted reading about all her experiments out in the fields and how meticulously everything had to be done, and then rejoiced when results came through that led to conclusions and consequently, more funding! You'll root (ha!) for her and Bill every step of the way. She's also quite honest about her struggles, not just at work but at home as well, which I didn't expect. It's very difficult to admit to desperate times when you can't see what's ahead of you, or loneliness, much less mental health struggles. I appreciated the book even more for Jahren's willingness to talk about all this and the vulnerability that comes with it. A very moving memoir. It may surprise you how much you will want to read about the inner workings and patience of a seed, or how the surprisingly softness of spongy moss led to a way of finding solid people to work with, until you pick this up, and then it doesn't. It just feels right to see the world like this."

Each of us is both impossible and inevitable. Every replete tree was first a seed that waited.""Jahren has faced many challenges: a lonely childhood, working herself through school, struggling as a female scientist against the prejudices of a male dominated field, finding funding for her projects. Her success can be verified by her choice as one of Time's 100 Most Influential People, her Fulbright Scholarships, and her long relationship with her lab partner Bill. She found love and faced a difficult pregnancy sans medication for her bipolar disorder to have the child that changed her life.""I have learned that raising a child is essentially one long, slow agony of letting go.""Jahren's writing is so lovely to read. Her love of her work as a geobioloist and her awe of nature shines through the pages. She alternates chapters on her life with chapters about the world of green growing things around us.The self-portrait Jahren paints reveals her personal challenges and insecurities without being confessional and raw. Her lab partner/best friend/soul mate Bill is interesting and complicated, eccentric and brilliant. He once lived in a hole in his parent's back yard. We come to love him as much as Jahren does.

146,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3788241-elena,5,"In my mind, a great memoir has you singing along with the writer when she is happy, and aching with her when she is sad. Hope Jahren's excellent memoir Lab Girl does just that. Jahren intersperses stories about plants with stories about science with stories about her own life in a way that is masterful and utterly engaging. I didn't expect to enjoy reading about plants or to learn about them (I'm an ecologist) but I found myself loving those sections. Jahren's unique insights into why it is important to understand how plants grow add a fascinating layer to what in lesser hands might have been 'just biology'. The stories about science illuminate how science really works - what it takes to get money to do the work, and how it all really unfolds in the lab. And the stories about Jahren's life and how her choices led her to be the person she is bring the book together as a complete whole.As Heather says, this is a book for those who love science or memoir. But it is also a book for all those who simply love well-crafted stories about courageous lives and courageous women and learning how to be a good person in a complex world.  "
147,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/714583-anita-pomerantz,5,"Fascinating read that is hard to parse. Is it about a female scientist? A relationship between a man and a woman like no other? Manic depression? Botany?The author really holds nothing back in this memoir, and I found Hope to be pretty fascinating. She's nerdy and mentally ill and loving and a workaholic. She is an incredible scientist and a tremendous writer. For me, the highlight of this book is her description of her relationship with her lab employee (partner?), Bill. I couldn't decide what to make of it. Were they in love? Like siblings? Just great colleagues with a shared passion for the work? Whatever it is/was, it was very interesting.In addition, the structure of the book is well done. The reader alternately learns something about plant life, and then the subsequent chapter highlights parallels in human life. I have little science background, but thought most of the explanations were clear and educational. I imagine Hope is an excellent teacher, with the ability to both be engaging and impart knowledge at the same time.Really, almost a five star read for me."

I actually loved the science-y bits of this, where the author shows her flair for studying plants, her passion for their care, and also her stunning ability to write beautifully about them. However, although I think these sections were great, Hope Jahren's actual backstory and the way she wrote about her journey just didn't 'click' with me and I found it super hard to connect or relate at all. This really took me out of the book and so ultimately I was forcing myself to pick it up, and that's no fun, so I just decided it was time to put it down and give it to someone else who may enjoy it far more. Ah well. "
149,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4059160-amy,5,"Jahren's book is full of passion and love for her family, friends and work. It is a memoir of sorts with the life cycle of a tree interspersed with her own stories. A fantastic read!"
150,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/260116-janb,5,"I finished this memoir a few days ago and in trying to get my thoughts together for a review, I read what my GR friends said about the book, and I realized it's all been said and said so much better and eloquently than I could.So I'll just say I loved it. I listened to the audiobook, read by the author , and she does an excellent job. I loved hearing about her life and passion as a scientist, her illness (bipolar), her quirky friend Bill, her marriage, motherhood, and yes, I even loved the science-y parts. I'll never look at a tree the same and I now have even more respect for research scientists.Highly recommended."
151,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4271946-jessica-woodbury,4,"I waited for a long time to read this book even though it came highly recommended from several scientists. I was skeptical about the title. And while I am not a scientist by profession, I did train as an undergrad and earn a BS. The thing about scientists is we are very territorial. I am a Chemist. My Physicist friends say, ""But Chemistry is all Physics!"" and they are not entirely wrong. I often scoff at Biology, Botany, Zoology, etc. and say, ""But you're ignoring all the Chemistry!"" So the Botany angle here did not move it up my TBR list.But. As a baby scientist myself, and as someone who spent several years married to a scientist during his PhD and basically lived and breathed lab culture, ultimately I couldn't stay away. I had to see what all the fuss about and I had to see if Jahren got it right. Many people don't. If you are intimidated by a very scientific read, don't be afraid. Jahren's years of teaching experience have clearly created someone who is skilled at turning complex scientific processes and ideas into easily digestible narratives. If you are concerned it will not be scientific enough, there's enough interesting data here to sate you, though I did wish I learned more about Jahren's own research.The thing about this book, though, the thing that makes it one of my favorites of the year isn't just that Jahren gets lab life right, it's how skillfully she tells the stories of trees alongside her own story. I have never ever cared about a tree more than I did during this book. And I was lucky enough to listen to the audio (read beautifully by Jahren herself) while I drove past the blazing autumn leaves of New England, so every tree seemed somehow magical. If someone had taught me about plants the way Jahren does, where it is not just a process to learn and a life cycle to memorize, but where every single step along the way is a miracle in and of itself, I can see myself seriously considering Botany as a potential major. This book in the hands of a college student could be life changing.Some may find Jahren's story not interesting enough for a memoir. But this is not a memoir that is built around a journey. It is showing you who she is, and a big part of it focuses on the incredibly close relationship she has with her lab partner, Bill. While they mean absolutely everything to one another, they are not intimate friends, not secret sharers, not confidants. Learning the rhythms of their conversation and the routines of their friendship will show you the kind of relationship you probably haven't seen before. Jahren covers many things here besides science. Parenthood, the chill Scandinavian traditions of the Midwest, the slog of early academic life, and her own struggle with bipolar disorder. Her writing is simple but deliberate and lovely. I enjoyed every moment listening to her read. "
152,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10001905-lynn,0,"My first thoughts, this book is in a word, odd. It is a memoir written by a bipolar paleobiologist and her Asperger’s like, one-handed best friend/lab assistant. They stumble through the US and Europe trying to do good science. The book is about three things. 1. Science: we learn about the scientific method, how a mass spectrometer works, and that trees have memory (all of which was much more interesting than I would have thought). 2. Love and Family: in all its permutations, good/bad, expressed/unexpressed, chosen/not chosen. 3. Academia: a close and accurate look at the tarnished Ivory tower with tales of sexism, cut throat competition, and the never ending search for money. Despite her struggles, she becomes an award winning and accomplished scholar with her best friend by her side. My final thoughts: this book is in a word, captivating. "
153,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5159766-l-a-starks,5,"What a shame this utterly amazing book has such a lame title. My advice is to forget the title and read the book. Jahren, a three-time Fulbright winner, has written a reader-friendly, relationship-centered sequence of stories about her experience as a paleobotany researcher. There is much to learn and Jahren doesn't shrink from explaining it. However, the terms and structure are highly accessible. The book is one of those rare fusions of science and humanity that many readers so often wish for but can seldom find. The reason is simple--it takes a polymath like Ms. Jahren to understand and love the labwork and yet also be able to explain it to non-scientists. This is the biology class--really much more--you wish you'd experienced. At the same time, Jahren is clear about the difficulties of an academic scientist's life--getting grants, writing proposals, acquiring equipment, paying lab assistants, the necessity of moving on to better opportunities. She writes with joy about marriage, her son, her struggle with bipolarity, and most of all about her talented, brilliant assistant, Bill.About the title: this is apparently the season of ""The Girl Who..."" after the success of The Girl on the Train. Unfortunately, ""Lab GIRL"" is diminutive, and diminishes, the complex, warm, fascinating PhD scientist we meet in its pages. I wish the publishers had worked harder to come up with a title that better represents this story. "
154,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6677659-marchpane,3,"An uneven read for me. Loved the science-y bits, found the personal memoir sections either tedious or grating. "
155,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3965659-rachel,2,"This is a textbook case of 'it's not you, it's me.' I understand the appeal, and in a lot of ways I'm thrilled about this book's mainstream success (women in STEM fields and healthy, platonic relationships between men and women are two things we need more of in media), but there were only so many loving descriptions of trees I could take after a while. There was just too much science and not enough human interest to keep me engaged, and while I wouldn't say you need to be knowledgeable about biology to approach this book, a certain amount of interest would be helpful, and I just don't have that, at all. And the audiobook was a mistake; the author narrates it with a positively bizarre amount of melodrama (like, actually in tears at multiple points, and I'm sorry if that makes me sound callous but I really don't react well to overly sentimental narration), so I can't say it was a pleasant listening experience... But anyway, really not a bad book, just not my kind of book."
156,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56398848-nisa,5,"Firstly i want to thank Elyse for recommending this book and letting me have a chance to read it :)Hope firstly began with her childhood and then suddenly make a jumb to her recent life (to introduce herself but kept it short) in lab with Bill (of course they can't be thought apart :)) It was nice in the beginning but after she met with Bill and they began to work together in her lab it's like everything fell into place and real story began. When she told about her studies it was not boring but interesting some of them was long but she kept its length good enough and she shared with us interesting facts about plants. First i began listening this novel as an audio book but because when i listened i kept lost track when i came places she talks about her studies (they are not in my domain and English is my second language and i'm not good enough to listen everything) after that i bought it as an e book and went on by reading.If i think as a whole i loved this book and i loved the way she finished it. But if i talk about its part some part was boring, some exiting and make me happy, sad and worried (I want to say life is not so different). When Hope writing about her life she was so sincere and because of that when she was happy i was happy with her, and worried about her when she feel desperate. I think she is so good at telling her life story and i want to that everything would be good for her. I loved her and the way she tells her story but mostly and all i loved Bill and his answers (I usually marked what he said). In addition i think i love more Bill because she loved (as an important friend) Bill more than herself. And i would love to have friendship like theirs . ""He is strong where I am weak, and so together we make one complete person, each of us gaining half of what we need from the world and the other half from each other."" this is the way she describe their friendship with her words.Here the things that Bill said and make me laugh :)This conversation happened when Hope and Bill met first time. She was assisting a lecture that in this class students need to dig earth. She realize he was digging alone and he cought attention of her""I stood there and watched him dig for a while, and began to notice the uncommonly large amount of earth that he was moving with each shovelful and the implied strength that must have accompanied his wiry frame. I also noticed that he was digging with something that looked like an old harpoon flattened at one end – a sword beaten into a real plowshare.""“Where did you get that shovel?” I asked, figuring it was from the pile of junk I had hauled out of the department’s equipment locker, which had been located in the basement next to an old coal hull. “It’s mine,” he said. “Don’t judge it until you’ve dug a mile in its shoes.” “You mean you brought your own shovel from home?” I laughed in friendly surprise and delight. “Hell yes,” he affirmed. “I wasn’t going to leave this thing unattended for six weeks.” “I like your thinking,” I replied.And this one when they go to monkey jungle and when he said that he was looking a monkey it seems shocked as much as him. ""Bill finally stated, without redirecting his stare, “It’s like looking in a fucking mirror.”""Well if i share all of them this review will be too long and i would be more happy if you decide to read and see for yourself :)) Have a great week. :))"
157,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17951043-perri,4,"I love a book that educates me in a non-painful way. Jahren alternates chapters between her journey as a scientist and her knowledge and passion for botany. Of special interest to me was reading about the difficulties she faced especially as a Research Botanist. Some readers in my book club found her whiny, but I thought she was just being honest in her struggles with an antiseptic upbringing, mental illness, and sexist road blocks from being a woman in a male dominated fields. I learned it takes a really special person to do research experiments.The tension to me of mind numbing monotonous tasks coupled with the stringent standards of proof, well let's just say it's not a field for most people. Added to that is the constant struggle for adequate funding. I found it quite enjoyable with bonus botanic bits."
158,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6787827-linda,4,"I bought this book because it was a good deal, wondering if I would ever read it. What a surprise! It is a great combination of life and science. I found it very interesting and will never look at trees or plants in the same way."
159,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8024272-kasia,4,I might never look at a trees and plants the same way. Seriously thinking about planting my own oak tree on the back yard and watch it grow. 
160,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6449756-sonja-arlow,3,"3 1/2 starsI have always had a love of medicine and science (all though my high school results on science may tell another story) so I was immediately drawn to this book.Hope grew up in her father’s laboratory surrounded by Bunsen burners, petri dishes and access to everything a curious child my want to investigate in a lab. It’s not surprising that she was brought up in an academically focused household and even her mother studied part time and included her daughter in her learning process.I really appreciated the fact that all the experiments or processes in the book was explained so that any person no matter how unenlightened about science, could grasp the concepts.”My laboratory is like a church because it is where I figure out what I believe”I loved reading about her part-time work at a local hospital while studying – it gave me glimpses of the nuts and bolts of running a hospital and more than once I wished that she had become a doctor rather than a botanist.My feelings towards flora is neither here nor there so naturally some of the chapters dealing with the workings of plants didn’t really interest me but one thing came across crystal clear and that is her absolute passion about what she does for a living.  “I will never stop being ravenously hungry for science, no matter how well it feeds me”I also found the sections dealing with just how difficult it is to secure funding for scientific projects are as well as glimpses on Hope dealing with her bi-polar disease, eye-opening. But it’s her friendship with Bill, her lab partner, that stood out for me. So this is a mix between work as a scientist, information about botany and a young woman trying to carve a foothold for herself in a male dominated industry. This may not be for everyone but it was a very enjoyable and informative read for me."
161,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27078093-alice-lippart,4,Enjoyable and really interesting. Loved all the science!
162,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5637143-anna,2,"I'm very curious what other scientists, particularly women, think of this book. To me, the best writing in the book was in the short chapters about plants, even though some of the cool plant insights were already familiar to me since I've worked in plant labs for some years. The rest was uneven, tended toward telling instead of showing, and I think because of this the relationships come out feeling flat, even her relationship with Bill which is clearly important and meant to feel more three-dimensional. Overall, although I certainly support women in science telling their stories, this didn't live up to my expectations, not even close, and I would take Evelyn Fox Keller's 'A Feeling for the Organism' or Susan Brind Morrow's 'Wolves and Honey' or Lauren Redniss's 'Radioactive' over Lab Girl any day of the week. One more note: Jahren sometimes explicitly or implicitly gives the impression that there's one correct way to be a scientist: you have to be immediately driven forward by your failures, never discouraged by them, you have to be able to work for 48 hours straight, you have to have always known science is what you wanted. There is no one way to be a scientist: this is completely untrue, as it is untrue of any profession, and don't let it discourage you or any young girl you know from pursuing science."
163,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1881113-andrea,3,"Such a short book, but it took me forever to read it. I should have liked it more than I actually did. Hope Jahren's part-memoir, part-scientific reflection has humour, memorable personalities, fun educational material, and some truly moving recollections. The problem was that sometimes Jahren's could become too dramatic. I had the misfortune to listen to the audiobook while walking my dog, and I swear it made me want to pull my hair out. The teary, choking voice at the end of nearly every chapter that was supposed to make me feel emotions while the author dwelled in self-pity was like nails on chalkboard. I also went into the book thinking this would be more of a love letter to botany and some interesting findings the author discovered during her career (I never read blurbs), but instead I got mostly a memoir, interlaced some musings on plants that supported the mood for these memories. And this is officially the longest sentence I've ever written. Needless to say, I am sort of underwhelmed. If you are going to read Lab Girl, please avoid the audio, and be prepared for a lifetime worth of over-reactions to ordinary events. "

So I can't really fault Hope for telling her story. But I can caution potential readers: if you want to know what's it is like to be a scientist, don't rely on this book. This is just one story, and it is not at all typical. You don't have to work 80 hours per week to be a scientist. You can have a life AND be a scientist. If you're a student, you can find a grad advisor who cares about you and invests in your success and doesn't haze you when you first join the lab. In short, Future Scientists, don't be discouraged by reading this. Science takes all kinds, and life in science can be what you want it to be."

Rhythm and cycles permeate the narrative, bouncing between Hope Jahren's ups and downs as a career scientist, and the intricate lives of vegetation. I hadn't even read a synopsis before before I began, and was pleasantly surprised by the delicate unfolding of the book … made from paper, derived from intelligent trees … ~ Just Trust Me: In Praise Of Strange Books (All 3 are 5 star reads!)~Hope Jahren is a celebrated geochemist and geobiologist, not to mention an exceptionally interesting human being. Currently she works at the University of Oslo, and this book is her origin story.Jahren worked with her mother in the garden growing up, first sparking her love of growing things.“By the end of June the whole crop was well on its way and the world around us was so green that it seemed impossible that it could ever have been otherwise. By July, the sweating leaves of all these plants had pumped the air so full of moisture that the humidity caused the electrical lines to buzz and crackle overhead.” She also played in her father’s lab from a young age, inspiring her love for science and hunger to know how things work.“There I transformed from a girl into a scientist, just like Peter Parker becoming Spider-Man, only kind of backward.” Eventually, Jahren’s life intersects with a man named Bill, in a lab—where else? He becomes her loyal assistant, moving locations and building labs with her. There was one point where I kind of hoped they’d get together, but their relationship is unique and special—more like best friends or brother and sister.Did I mention the writing is beautiful? Jahren deals with mental illness and loneliness in such a heartfelt manner it’s impossible not to empathize alongside her. She reads the audiobook and you can hear the emotion in her voice, bleeding through the words. The tone remains positive and manages not to be depressing even when dealing with tough topics. There is hope, and the beauty of science unveiling new understanding to the world. The history and lives of trees are presented in a fascinating way, paralleling various aspects of human lives.If you enjoy plants and true tails of scientific superstars — this book is for you.Quotes:“She set her hair in curlers while listening to records of Carl Sandburg’s poems over and over, and instructed me on how to hear the words differently each time. After discovering Susan Sontag, she explained to me that even meaning itself is a constructed concept, and I learned how to nod and pretend to understand.” “Full-blown mania lets you see the other side of death. Its onset is profoundly visceral and unexpected, no matter how many times you’ve been through it. It is your body that first senses the urgency of a new world about to bloom. Your vertebrae seem to detach from one another and you elongate as if toward the sun’s light. You can’t hear above the sloshing roar of blood pushed through your head by some impossibly sustained orgasm within your beating heart. For the next twenty-four, forty-eight, seventy-two hours you will have to yell to hear yourself over this whooshing. Nothing, nothing can be loud enough or bright enough or move fast enough. The world appears as if through a fish-eye lens; your view is fuzzy with sparkling edges. You have received a grand, systemic injection of Novocain and your entire body tingles briefly before it becomes flaccidly foreign and unreal. Your raised arms are the fleshy petals of a magnificent lily bursting into flower. It deeply dawns on you that this new world about to bloom is you.” “There at the end of the world, he danced in the broad and endless daylight, and I accepted him for what he was, instead of what he wished he could be. The potency of my acceptance made me wonder, just a little, if I could turn it inward and accept myself.” "
167,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13977687-taryn,4,"This memoir could be subtitled “The Private Lives of Plants,” because paleobiologist Hope Jahren can’t help but wax poetic at times about her chosen field of study, with which she is clearly enraptured. Fortunately, she’s pretty convincing. Since my tastes run more toward gossipy tell-alls than science texts, my favorite parts of Lab Girl were Jahren's personal stories of her romance with her husband and decidedly unromantic relationship with her (occasionally homeless but forever loyal) research partner Bill. Amazingly enough, though, I didn't glaze over during the parts about trees and mosses. Jahren is one of those rare scientists able to express her enthusiasm for her subject in a way that translates to the average Jane. The audio version is read by Jahren herself, which makes the more emotional parts of the book ring with authenticity, but if you're bothered by soft, whispery voices, you might prefer to pick up this one in print. If you close your eyes, Jahren sounds just like Ana Gasteyer's character from the classic SNL sketch “Schweddy Balls.”More book recommendations by me at www.readingwithhippos.com"
168,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1291915-lauren,3,"The name of this book never worked for me - it didn't seem to capture what the book was about, and it is diminuitive in nature. Jahren is not a ""girl"", and this book is not cutesy, as the title, and even the cover art, would lead you to believe. Jahren's work in geobotany is fascinating, and I really enjoyed the interspersed chapters on plants, trees, natural history. The personal memoir sections were okay - they showed devotion and commitment to the science. I was frustrated with the roadblocks and glass ceilings that Jahren hit/endured as a female scientist, but I was also grew frustrated with Jahren for her continuous lack of foresight and planning, and the ways her actions (and inactions) impacted those around her. I know these symptoms are directly tied to her mental illness, and she writes about that with candor and bravery, and I do agree that we need more of this - normalizing, familiarizing. Thankfully, with time and experience, things did get better - for everyone. My favorite part was Jahren and Bill's time in the Arctic, digging up ancient trees. I really enjoyed that scene of Bill dancing, and her description of it. 3.5 stars"

Hope Jahren reads it herself and you can really feel the emotion as she tells you her life story. I always enjoy listening to women in science talk about their work and their experience navigating the field when especially in the past, men were lauded and revered for their accomplishments and women really had to fight for everything. The only thing I’d say which is entirely. a personal thing is that I don’t naturally gravitate toward her field and don’t find it super compelling but the way she told it made me infinitely more interested so no negatives there.

171,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115473-siria,3,"My rating for this book is a reflection not so much of my enjoyment of it as my acknowledgement of its importance. Hope Jahren is a successful female research scientist working within a STEM field that's still overwhelmingly male-dominated, a woman with mental illness who has been able to forge an academic career—voices like hers are too rarely heard in academia in general and STEM fields in particular. Jahren focuses less on the highs of her career (she's won multiple Fulbrights, for instance, but I'm not sure that she even mentions that in the book) than she does on the lows and even more so the monotonous middle: the antisocial hours spent doing repetitive prep work in the lab, the constant scrabble to secure funding, the gauntlet of aggressions (micro and macro) faced by women in academia.However, for all Jahren's ability to be very upfront about her experiences (she clearly prides herself on her bluntness), Lab Girl is the kind of memoir that suffers from the author's lack of self-awareness. Although I'm not in a STEM field, I am a woman in academia, and so I'm quite familiar with other women (almost always white women) like Jahren: women for whom sexism is odious inasmuch as it affects them, but who care not one jot about systemic sexism or how it affects other women. Almost the only women to feature in the book are Jahren and her mother (who is treated with a hostility which I find inexplicable, given that nothing in the behaviour attributed to her seems particularly egregious or all that different from that ascribed to Jahren's beloved father), and I was almost surprised to end a book not having encountered a paragraph in which Jahren explains why she's Not Like the Other Girls. More overtly jarring were Jahren's descriptions of her interactions with students and the means by which she ""trains in"" new graduate students. If these were the anecdotes she thought made her look like a competent instructor, I'm hoping her grad students have insurance which lets them access a good therapist—or failing that, that they have access to a steady supply of palatable beer. Don't haze your students! Don't pass on fucked-up measures of academic ""worth"" to students just because academia is messed up and most graduate advisors don't know pedagogical theory from a hole in the wall!Listening to this as an audiobook was also a mistake. Jahren's talents are undoubtedly many, but acting out even her own words is not one she possesses. The vocal quivering and gulping she employed were distracting and maudlin; it was like listening to an audiobook from the Victorian period. Listening to the audiobook version also made the section set in Ireland extra obnoxious to me (an Irishwoman), and retroactively made me question the trustworthiness of great swathes of the book. The most egregious example of this is when Jahren describes getting lost in Limerick City, and attributes this to the fact that all of the street signs are in Irish. (Now, I've heard Americans mangle Irish over the years, but never so comprehensively as Hope Jahren. I honestly asked myself if she'd just spoken in Klingon, had to go look up the text of the book on Google Books, and then shrieked at the realisation that she was trying to say ""Sráid Eibhlín.) Here's the thing: street signs in Ireland are bilingual, with the English-language text generally appearing in larger font, and the Irish-language version smaller and in italics. There's no way that Jahren was lost and distractedly trying to figure out where ""Sráid Eibhlín"" was; she had to have known all along that she was on Ellen Street. This might seem like nitpicking, but such an obvious twisting of the truth—whether in service of a little bit of drama or getting an extra bit of comedy out of the Weird Irish—felt like the literary version of the bad scientific practice of p-hacking."
172,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13126933-lata,5,"This was excellent. From the beautiful writing about her family, or of her struggles with building and maintaining a lab, or her long friendship with colleague Bill, or of her struggles with bipolar disorder, or the lyrical sections about plant life, I thoroughly enjoyed this memoir. I was fascinated, and listened, rapt, though the many events of Hope Jahren's life, and I learned some great things too, about the glorious plants on this planet that we couldn't exist without."
173,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/99765491-jimz,3,"I give this memoir 3 stars. Pros:•	Her descriptions of how plants and trees grow were in general fabulous. Terribly complicated biology and she was able to describe it in language that was not condescending but just was utterly fascinating. She explained a number of biological phenomena throughout the book and her explanations in most cases at least for me were just at about the right length...long enough so I could understand the basic phenomenon but not so long as to make me lose interest. So kudos to her for that. •	Her descriptions of her mania and depression were scary-sad. It’s obvious she had some major hurdles in her life that her own body were creating for her…I am glad that she is at the position she is at today… Her troubles reminded me of the memoir, An Unquiet Mind, by Kay Redfield Jamison, a psychologist who herself had bipolar disorder (which I highly recommend GR folks to read). •	Dr. Jahren’s description of growing up and her going to her father’s lab was quite interesting, as well as the family dynamics (and sometimes lack thereof….there was not a lot of overt affection that her parents showed her apparently and she also was not close to her brothers). In a later part of the book she made a comment that “I didn’t know if I was crying because I was nobody’s wife or mother – or because I felt like nobody’s daughter–…”. So it appeared she had next to no relationship with her family after she left home for grad school and beyond, yet there is this book dedication which seemed odd at least to me: “Everything I write is dedicated to my mother.”•	Her description of academia is for the most part (I am in and come from academia) realistic. She for many a year lived on what is called “soft money” in which her lab was dependent on governmental grants. “Her lab” means her salary and her assistants’ salaries and money needed to conduct her experiments. One is always having to write research grants (with no guarantee that a particular grant will ever get funded), because the money always seems to be running out. And that’s OK in a way…there is no free lunch…but still it is stressful not only for principal investigators but those working for them (in this memoir for example, Bill her lab manager).Cons:•	The book was way too long for its own good. •	Some of the long drawn-out conversations between her and her comrade-in-arms Bill that she relates to us could have been either shortened or deleted. She wrote the conversations in a verbatim style as if they just happened yesterday when in many instances the conversations happened in the late 1990s or early 2000s. Some of the conversations were “dopey” for lack of a better word – people just do not talk like that. •	I really did not like Bill. Just my problem I guess. He appeared to be satisfied working 80-hour weeks, not having a life outside of the lab, working apparently at times on starvation wages, literally living in the lab building at times, living in a van… She portrays him as some sort of hero to her…he never grew on me. To me he had an anti-social personality. And he sure swore a lot. •	She is introducing us to a scientific field, plant biology, and she does a fantastic job. But there was one part of the book that just got me pissed off. It’s when she and her lab visited a place that housed monkeys called the Monkey Jungle. And what she did, as an esteemed scientist, was anthropomorphize the primates to an extent in which it was in one respect laughable (not funny laughable), but in another respect a disservice to both the animals and to science (“…she saw in Monkey Jungle a doppelganger for her lab”). “…Two small squirrel monkeys seemed to be trapped in their own private Samuel Beckett play, caught in a web made of equal parts dependence and loathing. … A single howler monkey sat high on a branch in the back, wailing out the entire Book of Job in his native tongue while periodically raising his arms in an age-old supplication for an explanation as to why the righteous must suffer.” Went beyond the pale for me.Reviews:https://www.theguardian.com/books/201... https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/29/bo...

And so we will keep working as another day dawns and this week turns into next week, and then this month becomes next month. I can feel the warmth of the same brilliant sun that shines above the forest and onto the green world, but in my heart I know that I am not a plant. I am more like an ant, driven to find and carry single dead needles, one after the other, all the way across the forest and then add them one by one to a pile so massive that I can only fully imagine one small corner of it.' (p. 277)This book was such a joy. A part memoir, part ode to plant life and the grind of a scientist, written so engagingly that you can't help but feel ready to kick off your shoes, then step right into the soil to collect some samples to label the next thousand times over. That's a lot coming from me. As much as I can appreciate nature, I'm far from being outdoorsy, with my city living and my rampant fear of bugs. Hope Jahren allows us all to feel like we have that curiosity inside us to be scientists in our own lives, in small but by no means insignificant ways. She burns with such infectious passion for her work that you can't help but be drawn in too. The book's journey is divided lovingly into: Roots and Leaves, Wood and Knots, and Flowers and Fruit, with individual chapters then going into her work and rhapsodies of the wonder of nature that it all around us (have you looked at a leaf lately and thought about how miraculous it is?), then somehow works it all in with her personal life and her relationship with Bill, which is utterly undefinable in the most wonderful of ways. Here's one of the many, many plant-related passages that I loved, which described not just nature but her and Bill:'Why are they together, the tree and the fungus? We don't know. The fungus could certainly live very well alone almost anywhere, but it chooses to entwine itself with the tree over an easier and more independent life. It has adapted to seek the rush of pure sweetness that comes directly from a plant root, such a strange and concentrated compound, unlike anything to be found elsewhere in the forest. And perhaps the fungus can somehow sense that when it is part of a symbiosis, it is also not alone.' (p. 105)I suppose a caveat is in order: for those readers who aren't too interested in the science, it can be a bit tedious and may lose you a bit if you haven't been in a science class since high school, however the enthusiasm and dedication that Jahren has will win you over. I felt comforted reading about all her experiments out in the fields and how meticulously everything had to be done, and then rejoiced when results came through that led to conclusions and consequently, more funding! You'll root (ha!) for her and Bill every step of the way. She's also quite honest about her struggles, not just at work but at home as well, which I didn't expect. It's very difficult to admit to desperate times when you can't see what's ahead of you, or loneliness, much less mental health struggles. I appreciated the book even more for Jahren's willingness to talk about all this and the vulnerability that comes with it. A very moving memoir. It may surprise you how much you will want to read about the inner workings and patience of a seed, or how the surprisingly softness of spongy moss led to a way of finding solid people to work with, until you pick this up, and then it doesn't. It just feels right to see the world like this."

When I saw it on the new book shelf at the library I brought it home with me.""Each beginning is the end of a waiting. We are each given exactly one chance to be. Each of us is both impossible and inevitable. Every replete tree was first a seed that waited.""Jahren has faced many challenges: a lonely childhood, working herself through school, struggling as a female scientist against the prejudices of a male dominated field, finding funding for her projects. Her success can be verified by her choice as one of Time's 100 Most Influential People, her Fulbright Scholarships, and her long relationship with her lab partner Bill. She found love and faced a difficult pregnancy sans medication for her bipolar disorder to have the child that changed her life.""I have learned that raising a child is essentially one long, slow agony of letting go.""Jahren's writing is so lovely to read. Her love of her work as a geobioloist and her awe of nature shines through the pages. She alternates chapters on her life with chapters about the world of green growing things around us.The self-portrait Jahren paints reveals her personal challenges and insecurities without being confessional and raw. Her lab partner/best friend/soul mate Bill is interesting and complicated, eccentric and brilliant. He once lived in a hole in his parent's back yard. We come to love him as much as Jahren does. We are happy when her loneliness is ended by marrying a man who 'gets her.'To read a section of the book go to http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/boo...To read an interview with Jahren go to http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/the-se..."
176,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3788241-elena,5,"In my mind, a great memoir has you singing along with the writer when she is happy, and aching with her when she is sad. Hope Jahren's excellent memoir Lab Girl does just that. Jahren intersperses stories about plants with stories about science with stories about her own life in a way that is masterful and utterly engaging. I didn't expect to enjoy reading about plants or to learn about them (I'm an ecologist) but I found myself loving those sections. Jahren's unique insights into why it is important to understand how plants grow add a fascinating layer to what in lesser hands might have been 'just biology'. The stories about science illuminate how science really works - what it takes to get money to do the work, and how it all really unfolds in the lab. And the stories about Jahren's life and how her choices led her to be the person she is bring the book together as a complete whole.As Heather says, this is a book for those who love science or memoir. But it is also a book for all those who simply love well-crafted stories about courageous lives and courageous women and learning how to be a good person in a complex world.  "
177,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/714583-anita-pomerantz,5,"Fascinating read that is hard to parse. Is it about a female scientist? A relationship between a man and a woman like no other? Manic depression? Botany?The author really holds nothing back in this memoir, and I found Hope to be pretty fascinating. She's nerdy and mentally ill and loving and a workaholic. She is an incredible scientist and a tremendous writer. For me, the highlight of this book is her description of her relationship with her lab employee (partner?), Bill. I couldn't decide what to make of it. Were they in love? Like siblings? Just great colleagues with a shared passion for the work? Whatever it is/was, it was very interesting.In addition, the structure of the book is well done. The reader alternately learns something about plant life, and then the subsequent chapter highlights parallels in human life. I have little science background, but thought most of the explanations were clear and educational. I imagine Hope is an excellent teacher, with the ability to both be engaging and impart knowledge at the same time.Really, almost a five star read for me."
178,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19126246-kaitlin,0,"I ended up DNF-ing this one at 200pages in (which I know is fairly close to the end). I actually loved the science-y bits of this, where the author shows her flair for studying plants, her passion for their care, and also her stunning ability to write beautifully about them. However, although I think these sections were great, Hope Jahren's actual backstory and the way she wrote about her journey just didn't 'click' with me and I found it super hard to connect or relate at all. This really took me out of the book and so ultimately I was forcing myself to pick it up, and that's no fun, so I just decided it was time to put it down and give it to someone else who may enjoy it far more. Ah well. "
179,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4059160-amy,5,"Jahren's book is full of passion and love for her family, friends and work. It is a memoir of sorts with the life cycle of a tree interspersed with her own stories. A fantastic read!"
180,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/260116-janb,5,"I finished this memoir a few days ago and in trying to get my thoughts together for a review, I read what my GR friends said about the book, and I realized it's all been said and said so much better and eloquently than I could.So I'll just say I loved it. I listened to the audiobook, read by the author , and she does an excellent job. I loved hearing about her life and passion as a scientist, her illness (bipolar), her quirky friend Bill, her marriage, motherhood, and yes, I even loved the science-y parts. I'll never look at a tree the same and I now have even more respect for research scientists.Highly recommended."
181,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4271946-jessica-woodbury,4,"I waited for a long time to read this book even though it came highly recommended from several scientists. I was skeptical about the title. And while I am not a scientist by profession, I did train as an undergrad and earn a BS. The thing about scientists is we are very territorial. I am a Chemist. My Physicist friends say, ""But Chemistry is all Physics!"" and they are not entirely wrong. I often scoff at Biology, Botany, Zoology, etc. and say, ""But you're ignoring all the Chemistry!"" So the Botany angle here did not move it up my TBR list.But. As a baby scientist myself, and as someone who spent several years married to a scientist during his PhD and basically lived and breathed lab culture, ultimately I couldn't stay away. I had to see what all the fuss about and I had to see if Jahren got it right. Many people don't. If you are intimidated by a very scientific read, don't be afraid. Jahren's years of teaching experience have clearly created someone who is skilled at turning complex scientific processes and ideas into easily digestible narratives. If you are concerned it will not be scientific enough, there's enough interesting data here to sate you, though I did wish I learned more about Jahren's own research.The thing about this book, though, the thing that makes it one of my favorites of the year isn't just that Jahren gets lab life right, it's how skillfully she tells the stories of trees alongside her own story. I have never ever cared about a tree more than I did during this book. And I was lucky enough to listen to the audio (read beautifully by Jahren herself) while I drove past the blazing autumn leaves of New England, so every tree seemed somehow magical. If someone had taught me about plants the way Jahren does, where it is not just a process to learn and a life cycle to memorize, but where every single step along the way is a miracle in and of itself, I can see myself seriously considering Botany as a potential major. This book in the hands of a college student could be life changing.Some may find Jahren's story not interesting enough for a memoir. But this is not a memoir that is built around a journey. It is showing you who she is, and a big part of it focuses on the incredibly close relationship she has with her lab partner, Bill. While they mean absolutely everything to one another, they are not intimate friends, not secret sharers, not confidants. Learning the rhythms of their conversation and the routines of their friendship will show you the kind of relationship you probably haven't seen before. Jahren covers many things here besides science. Parenthood, the chill Scandinavian traditions of the Midwest, the slog of early academic life, and her own struggle with bipolar disorder. Her writing is simple but deliberate and lovely. I enjoyed every moment listening to her read. "
182,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10001905-lynn,0,"My first thoughts, this book is in a word, odd. It is a memoir written by a bipolar paleobiologist and her Asperger’s like, one-handed best friend/lab assistant. They stumble through the US and Europe trying to do good science. The book is about three things. 1. Science: we learn about the scientific method, how a mass spectrometer works, and that trees have memory (all of which was much more interesting than I would have thought). 2. Love and Family: in all its permutations, good/bad, expressed/unexpressed, chosen/not chosen. 3. Academia: a close and accurate look at the tarnished Ivory tower with tales of sexism, cut throat competition, and the never ending search for money. Despite her struggles, she becomes an award winning and accomplished scholar with her best friend by her side. My final thoughts: this book is in a word, captivating. "
183,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5159766-l-a-starks,5,"What a shame this utterly amazing book has such a lame title. My advice is to forget the title and read the book. Jahren, a three-time Fulbright winner, has written a reader-friendly, relationship-centered sequence of stories about her experience as a paleobotany researcher. There is much to learn and Jahren doesn't shrink from explaining it. However, the terms and structure are highly accessible. The book is one of those rare fusions of science and humanity that many readers so often wish for but can seldom find. The reason is simple--it takes a polymath like Ms. Jahren to understand and love the labwork and yet also be able to explain it to non-scientists. This is the biology class--really much more--you wish you'd experienced. At the same time, Jahren is clear about the difficulties of an academic scientist's life--getting grants, writing proposals, acquiring equipment, paying lab assistants, the necessity of moving on to better opportunities. She writes with joy about marriage, her son, her struggle with bipolarity, and most of all about her talented, brilliant assistant, Bill.About the title: this is apparently the season of ""The Girl Who..."" after the success of The Girl on the Train. Unfortunately, ""Lab GIRL"" is diminutive, and diminishes, the complex, warm, fascinating PhD scientist we meet in its pages. I wish the publishers had worked harder to come up with a title that better represents this story. "
184,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6677659-marchpane,3,"An uneven read for me. Loved the science-y bits, found the personal memoir sections either tedious or grating. "
185,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3965659-rachel,2,"This is a textbook case of 'it's not you, it's me.' I understand the appeal, and in a lot of ways I'm thrilled about this book's mainstream success (women in STEM fields and healthy, platonic relationships between men and women are two things we need more of in media), but there were only so many loving descriptions of trees I could take after a while. There was just too much science and not enough human interest to keep me engaged, and while I wouldn't say you need to be knowledgeable about biology to approach this book, a certain amount of interest would be helpful, and I just don't have that, at all. And the audiobook was a mistake; the author narrates it with a positively bizarre amount of melodrama (like, actually in tears at multiple points, and I'm sorry if that makes me sound callous but I really don't react well to overly sentimental narration), so I can't say it was a pleasant listening experience... But anyway, really not a bad book, just not my kind of book."
186,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56398848-nisa,5,"Firstly i want to thank Elyse for recommending this book and letting me have a chance to read it :)Hope firstly began with her childhood and then suddenly make a jumb to her recent life (to introduce herself but kept it short) in lab with Bill (of course they can't be thought apart :)) It was nice in the beginning but after she met with Bill and they began to work together in her lab it's like everything fell into place and real story began. When she told about her studies it was not boring but interesting some of them was long but she kept its length good enough and she shared with us interesting facts about plants. First i began listening this novel as an audio book but because when i listened i kept lost track when i came places she talks about her studies (they are not in my domain and English is my second language and i'm not good enough to listen everything) after that i bought it as an e book and went on by reading.If i think as a whole i loved this book and i loved the way she finished it. But if i talk about its part some part was boring, some exiting and make me happy, sad and worried (I want to say life is not so different). When Hope writing about her life she was so sincere and because of that when she was happy i was happy with her, and worried about her when she feel desperate. I think she is so good at telling her life story and i want to that everything would be good for her. I loved her and the way she tells her story but mostly and all i loved Bill and his answers (I usually marked what he said). In addition i think i love more Bill because she loved (as an important friend) Bill more than herself. And i would love to have friendship like theirs . ""He is strong where I am weak, and so together we make one complete person, each of us gaining half of what we need from the world and the other half from each other."" this is the way she describe their friendship with her words.Here the things that Bill said and make me laugh :)This conversation happened when Hope and Bill met first time. She was assisting a lecture that in this class students need to dig earth. She realize he was digging alone and he cought attention of her""I stood there and watched him dig for a while, and began to notice the uncommonly large amount of earth that he was moving with each shovelful and the implied strength that must have accompanied his wiry frame. I also noticed that he was digging with something that looked like an old harpoon flattened at one end – a sword beaten into a real plowshare.""“Where did you get that shovel?” I asked, figuring it was from the pile of junk I had hauled out of the department’s equipment locker, which had been located in the basement next to an old coal hull. “It’s mine,” he said. “Don’t judge it until you’ve dug a mile in its shoes.” “You mean you brought your own shovel from home?” I laughed in friendly surprise and delight. “Hell yes,” he affirmed. “I wasn’t going to leave this thing unattended for six weeks.” “I like your thinking,” I replied.And this one when they go to monkey jungle and when he said that he was looking a monkey it seems shocked as much as him. ""Bill finally stated, without redirecting his stare, “It’s like looking in a fucking mirror.”""Well if i share all of them this review will be too long and i would be more happy if you decide to read and see for yourself :)) Have a great week. :))"
187,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17951043-perri,4,"I love a book that educates me in a non-painful way. Jahren alternates chapters between her journey as a scientist and her knowledge and passion for botany. Of special interest to me was reading about the difficulties she faced especially as a Research Botanist. Some readers in my book club found her whiny, but I thought she was just being honest in her struggles with an antiseptic upbringing, mental illness, and sexist road blocks from being a woman in a male dominated fields. I learned it takes a really special person to do research experiments.The tension to me of mind numbing monotonous tasks coupled with the stringent standards of proof, well let's just say it's not a field for most people. Added to that is the constant struggle for adequate funding. I found it quite enjoyable with bonus botanic bits."

It’s not surprising that she was brought up in an academically focused household and even her mother studied part time and included her daughter in her learning process.I really appreciated the fact that all the experiments or processes in the book was explained so that any person no matter how unenlightened about science, could grasp the concepts.”My laboratory is like a church because it is where I figure out what I believe”I loved reading about her part-time work at a local hospital while studying – it gave me glimpses of the nuts and bolts of running a hospital and more than once I wished that she had become a doctor rather than a botanist.My feelings towards flora is neither here nor there so naturally some of the chapters dealing with the workings of plants didn’t really interest me but one thing came across crystal clear and that is her absolute passion about what she does for a living.  “I will never stop being ravenously hungry for science, no matter how well it feeds me”I also found the sections dealing with just how difficult it is to secure funding for scientific projects are as well as glimpses on Hope dealing with her bi-polar disease, eye-opening. But it’s her friendship with Bill, her lab partner, that stood out for me. So this is a mix between work as a scientist, information about botany and a young woman trying to carve a foothold for herself in a male dominated industry. This may not be for everyone but it was a very enjoyable and informative read for me."

192,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5637143-anna,2,"I'm very curious what other scientists, particularly women, think of this book. To me, the best writing in the book was in the short chapters about plants, even though some of the cool plant insights were already familiar to me since I've worked in plant labs for some years. The rest was uneven, tended toward telling instead of showing, and I think because of this the relationships come out feeling flat, even her relationship with Bill which is clearly important and meant to feel more three-dimensional. Overall, although I certainly support women in science telling their stories, this didn't live up to my expectations, not even close, and I would take Evelyn Fox Keller's 'A Feeling for the Organism' or Susan Brind Morrow's 'Wolves and Honey' or Lauren Redniss's 'Radioactive' over Lab Girl any day of the week. One more note: Jahren sometimes explicitly or implicitly gives the impression that there's one correct way to be a scientist: you have to be immediately driven forward by your failures, never discouraged by them, you have to be able to work for 48 hours straight, you have to have always known science is what you wanted. There is no one way to be a scientist: this is completely untrue, as it is untrue of any profession, and don't let it discourage you or any young girl you know from pursuing science."
193,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1881113-andrea,3,"Such a short book, but it took me forever to read it. I should have liked it more than I actually did. Hope Jahren's part-memoir, part-scientific reflection has humour, memorable personalities, fun educational material, and some truly moving recollections. The problem was that sometimes Jahren's could become too dramatic. I had the misfortune to listen to the audiobook while walking my dog, and I swear it made me want to pull my hair out. The teary, choking voice at the end of nearly every chapter that was supposed to make me feel emotions while the author dwelled in self-pity was like nails on chalkboard. I also went into the book thinking this would be more of a love letter to botany and some interesting findings the author discovered during her career (I never read blurbs), but instead I got mostly a memoir, interlaced some musings on plants that supported the mood for these memories. And this is officially the longest sentence I've ever written. Needless to say, I am sort of underwhelmed. If you are going to read Lab Girl, please avoid the audio, and be prepared for a lifetime worth of over-reactions to ordinary events. "

So I can't really fault Hope for telling her story. But I can caution potential readers: if you want to know what's it is like to be a scientist, don't rely on this book. This is just one story, and it is not at all typical. You don't have to work 80 hours per week to be a scientist. You can have a life AND be a scientist. If you're a student, you can find a grad advisor who cares about you and invests in your success and doesn't haze you when you first join the lab.

Rhythm and cycles permeate the narrative, bouncing between Hope Jahren's ups and downs as a career scientist, and the intricate lives of vegetation. I hadn't even read a synopsis before before I began, and was pleasantly surprised by the delicate unfolding of the book … made from paper, derived from intelligent trees … ~ Just Trust Me: In Praise Of Strange Books (All 3 are 5 star reads!)~Hope Jahren is a celebrated geochemist and geobiologist, not to mention an exceptionally interesting human being. Currently she works at the University of Oslo, and this book is her origin story.Jahren worked with her mother in the garden growing up, first sparking her love of growing things.“By the end of June the whole crop was well on its way and the world around us was so green that it seemed impossible that it could ever have been otherwise. By July, the sweating leaves of all these plants had pumped the air so full of moisture that the humidity caused the electrical lines to buzz and crackle overhead.” She also played in her father’s lab from a young age, inspiring her love for science and hunger to know how things work.“There I transformed from a girl into a scientist, just like Peter Parker becoming Spider-Man, only kind of backward.” Eventually, Jahren’s life intersects with a man named Bill, in a lab—where else? He becomes her loyal assistant, moving locations and building labs with her. There was one point where I kind of hoped they’d get together, but their relationship is unique and special—more like best friends or brother and sister.Did I mention the writing is beautiful? Jahren deals with mental illness and loneliness in such a heartfelt manner it’s impossible not to empathize alongside her. She reads the audiobook and you can hear the emotion in her voice, bleeding through the words. The tone remains positive and manages not to be depressing even when dealing with tough topics. There is hope, and the beauty of science unveiling new understanding to the world. The history and lives of trees are presented in a fascinating way, paralleling various aspects of human lives.If you enjoy plants and true tails of scientific superstars — this book is for you.Quotes:“She set her hair in curlers while listening to records of Carl Sandburg’s poems over and over, and instructed me on how to hear the words differently each time. After discovering Susan Sontag, she explained to me that even meaning itself is a constructed concept, and I learned how to nod and pretend to understand.” “Full-blown mania lets you see the other side of death. Its onset is profoundly visceral and unexpected, no matter how many times you’ve been through it. It is your body that first senses the urgency of a new world about to bloom. Your vertebrae seem to detach from one another and you elongate as if toward the sun’s light. You can’t hear above the sloshing roar of blood pushed through your head by some impossibly sustained orgasm within your beating heart. For the next twenty-four, forty-eight, seventy-two hours you will have to yell to hear yourself over this whooshing. Nothing, nothing can be loud enough or bright enough or move fast enough. The world appears as if through a fish-eye lens; your view is fuzzy with sparkling edges. You have received a grand, systemic injection of Novocain and your entire body tingles briefly before it becomes flaccidly foreign and unreal. Your raised arms are the fleshy petals of a magnificent lily bursting into flower. It deeply dawns on you that this new world about to bloom is you.” “There at the end of the world, he danced in the broad and endless daylight, and I accepted him for what he was, instead of what he wished he could be.

Fortunately, she’s pretty convincing. Since my tastes run more toward gossipy tell-alls than science texts, my favorite parts of Lab Girl were Jahren's personal stories of her romance with her husband and decidedly unromantic relationship with her (occasionally homeless but forever loyal) research partner Bill. Amazingly enough, though, I didn't glaze over during the parts about trees and mosses. Jahren is one of those rare scientists able to express her enthusiasm for her subject in a way that translates to the average Jane. The audio version is read by Jahren herself, which makes the more emotional parts of the book ring with authenticity, but if you're bothered by soft, whispery voices, you might prefer to pick up this one in print. If you close your eyes, Jahren sounds just like Ana Gasteyer's character from the classic SNL sketch “Schweddy Balls.”More book recommendations by me at www.readingwithhippos.com"
198,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1291915-lauren,3,"The name of this book never worked for me - it didn't seem to capture what the book was about, and it is diminuitive in nature. Jahren is not a ""girl"", and this book is not cutesy, as the title, and even the cover art, would lead you to believe. Jahren's work in geobotany is fascinating, and I really enjoyed the interspersed chapters on plants, trees, natural history. The personal memoir sections were okay - they showed devotion and commitment to the science. I was frustrated with the roadblocks and glass ceilings that Jahren hit/endured as a female scientist, but I was also grew frustrated with Jahren for her continuous lack of foresight and planning, and the ways her actions (and inactions) impacted those around her. I know these symptoms are directly tied to her mental illness, and she writes about that with candor and bravery, and I do agree that we need more of this - normalizing, familiarizing. Thankfully, with time and experience, things did get better - for everyone. My favorite part was Jahren and Bill's time in the Arctic, digging up ancient trees. I really enjoyed that scene of Bill dancing, and her description of it. 3.5 stars"
199,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48087215-joce-squibblesreads,4,"I def recommend the audiobook! Hope Jahren reads it herself and you can really feel the emotion as she tells you her life story. I always enjoy listening to women in science talk about their work and their experience navigating the field when especially in the past, men were lauded and revered for their accomplishments and women really had to fight for everything. The only thing I’d say which is entirely. a personal thing is that I don’t naturally gravitate toward her field and don’t find it super compelling but the way she told it made me infinitely more interested so no negatives there.

200,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6108495-marnie-enchanted-bibliophile,5,"This is simply brilliant.From the idea, to the writing, to the narration, and all the feelings it awakes makes writing a review useless in my opinion. JUST GO READ IT YOURSELF!"
201,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115473-siria,3,"My rating for this book is a reflection not so much of my enjoyment of it as my acknowledgement of its importance. Hope Jahren is a successful female research scientist working within a STEM field that's still overwhelmingly male-dominated, a woman with mental illness who has been able to forge an academic career—voices like hers are too rarely heard in academia in general and STEM fields in particular. Jahren focuses less on the highs of her career (she's won multiple Fulbrights, for instance, but I'm not sure that she even mentions that in the book) than she does on the lows and even more so the monotonous middle: the antisocial hours spent doing repetitive prep work in the lab, the constant scrabble to secure funding, the gauntlet of aggressions (micro and macro) faced by women in academia.However, for all Jahren's ability to be very upfront about her experiences (she clearly prides herself on her bluntness), Lab Girl is the kind of memoir that suffers from the author's lack of self-awareness. Although I'm not in a STEM field, I am a woman in academia, and so I'm quite familiar with other women (almost always white women) like Jahren: women for whom sexism is odious inasmuch as it affects them, but who care not one jot about systemic sexism or how it affects other women. Almost the only women to feature in the book are Jahren and her mother (who is treated with a hostility which I find inexplicable, given that nothing in the behaviour attributed to her seems particularly egregious or all that different from that ascribed to Jahren's beloved father), and I was almost surprised to end a book not having encountered a paragraph in which Jahren explains why she's Not Like the Other Girls. More overtly jarring were Jahren's descriptions of her interactions with students and the means by which she ""trains in"" new graduate students. If these were the anecdotes she thought made her look like a competent instructor, I'm hoping her grad students have insurance which lets them access a good therapist—or failing that, that they have access to a steady supply of palatable beer. Don't haze your students! Don't pass on fucked-up measures of academic ""worth"" to students just because academia is messed up and most graduate advisors don't know pedagogical theory from a hole in the wall!Listening to this as an audiobook was also a mistake. Jahren's talents are undoubtedly many, but acting out even her own words is not one she possesses. The vocal quivering and gulping she employed were distracting and maudlin; it was like listening to an audiobook from the Victorian period. Listening to the audiobook version also made the section set in Ireland extra obnoxious to me (an Irishwoman), and retroactively made me question the trustworthiness of great swathes of the book. The most egregious example of this is when Jahren describes getting lost in Limerick City, and attributes this to the fact that all of the street signs are in Irish. (Now, I've heard Americans mangle Irish over the years, but never so comprehensively as Hope Jahren. I honestly asked myself if she'd just spoken in Klingon, had to go look up the text of the book on Google Books, and then shrieked at the realisation that she was trying to say ""Sráid Eibhlín.) Here's the thing: street signs in Ireland are bilingual, with the English-language text generally appearing in larger font, and the Irish-language version smaller and in italics. There's no way that Jahren was lost and distractedly trying to figure out where ""Sráid Eibhlín"" was; she had to have known all along that she was on Ellen Street. This might seem like nitpicking, but such an obvious twisting of the truth—whether in service of a little bit of drama or getting an extra bit of comedy out of the Weird Irish—felt like the literary version of the bad scientific practice of p-hacking."
202,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13126933-lata,5,"This was excellent. From the beautiful writing about her family, or of her struggles with building and maintaining a lab, or her long friendship with colleague Bill, or of her struggles with bipolar disorder, or the lyrical sections about plant life, I thoroughly enjoyed this memoir. I was fascinated, and listened, rapt, though the many events of Hope Jahren's life, and I learned some great things too, about the glorious plants on this planet that we couldn't exist without."
203,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/99765491-jimz,3,"I give this memoir 3 stars. Pros:•	Her descriptions of how plants and trees grow were in general fabulous. Terribly complicated biology and she was able to describe it in language that was not condescending but just was utterly fascinating. She explained a number of biological phenomena throughout the book and her explanations in most cases at least for me were just at about the right length...long enough so I could understand the basic phenomenon but not so long as to make me lose interest. So kudos to her for that. •	Her descriptions of her mania and depression were scary-sad. It’s obvious she had some major hurdles in her life that her own body were creating for her…I am glad that she is at the position she is at today… Her troubles reminded me of the memoir, An Unquiet Mind, by Kay Redfield Jamison, a psychologist who herself had bipolar disorder (which I highly recommend GR folks to read). •	Dr. Jahren’s description of growing up and her going to her father’s lab was quite interesting, as well as the family dynamics (and sometimes lack thereof….there was not a lot of overt affection that her parents showed her apparently and she also was not close to her brothers). In a later part of the book she made a comment that “I didn’t know if I was crying because I was nobody’s wife or mother – or because I felt like nobody’s daughter–…”. So it appeared she had next to no relationship with her family after she left home for grad school and beyond, yet there is this book dedication which seemed odd at least to me: “Everything I write is dedicated to my mother.”•	Her description of academia is for the most part (I am in and come from academia) realistic. She for many a year lived on what is called “soft money” in which her lab was dependent on governmental grants. “Her lab” means her salary and her assistants’ salaries and money needed to conduct her experiments. One is always having to write research grants (with no guarantee that a particular grant will ever get funded), because the money always seems to be running out. And that’s OK in a way…there is no free lunch…but still it is stressful not only for principal investigators but those working for them (in this memoir for example, Bill her lab manager).Cons:•	The book was way too long for its own good. •	Some of the long drawn-out conversations between her and her comrade-in-arms Bill that she relates to us could have been either shortened or deleted. She wrote the conversations in a verbatim style as if they just happened yesterday when in many instances the conversations happened in the late 1990s or early 2000s. Some of the conversations were “dopey” for lack of a better word – people just do not talk like that. •	I really did not like Bill. Just my problem I guess. He appeared to be satisfied working 80-hour weeks, not having a life outside of the lab, working apparently at times on starvation wages, literally living in the lab building at times, living in a van… She portrays him as some sort of hero to her…he never grew on me. To me he had an anti-social personality. And he sure swore a lot. •	She is introducing us to a scientific field, plant biology, and she does a fantastic job. But there was one part of the book that just got me pissed off. It’s when she and her lab visited a place that housed monkeys called the Monkey Jungle. And what she did, as an esteemed scientist, was anthropomorphize the primates to an extent in which it was in one respect laughable (not funny laughable), but in another respect a disservice to both the animals and to science (“…she saw in Monkey Jungle a doppelganger for her lab”). “…Two small squirrel monkeys seemed to be trapped in their own private Samuel Beckett play, caught in a web made of equal parts dependence and loathing. … A single howler monkey sat high on a branch in the back, wailing out the entire Book of Job in his native tongue while periodically raising his arms in an age-old supplication for an explanation as to why the righteous must suffer.” Went beyond the pale for me.Reviews:https://www.theguardian.com/books/201... https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/29/bo...

204,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2329065-joanie,4,"'Science is work, nothing more and nothing less. And so we will keep working as another day dawns and this week turns into next week, and then this month becomes next month. I can feel the warmth of the same brilliant sun that shines above the forest and onto the green world, but in my heart I know that I am not a plant. I am more like an ant, driven to find and carry single dead needles, one after the other, all the way across the forest and then add them one by one to a pile so massive that I can only fully imagine one small corner of it.' (p. 277)This book was such a joy. A part memoir, part ode to plant life and the grind of a scientist, written so engagingly that you can't help but feel ready to kick off your shoes, then step right into the soil to collect some samples to label the next thousand times over. That's a lot coming from me. As much as I can appreciate nature, I'm far from being outdoorsy, with my city living and my rampant fear of bugs. Hope Jahren allows us all to feel like we have that curiosity inside us to be scientists in our own lives, in small but by no means insignificant ways. She burns with such infectious passion for her work that you can't help but be drawn in too. The book's journey is divided lovingly into: Roots and Leaves, Wood and Knots, and Flowers and Fruit, with individual chapters then going into her work and rhapsodies of the wonder of nature that it all around us (have you looked at a leaf lately and thought about how miraculous it is?), then somehow works it all in with her personal life and her relationship with Bill, which is utterly undefinable in the most wonderful of ways. Here's one of the many, many plant-related passages that I loved, which described not just nature but her and Bill:'Why are they together, the tree and the fungus? We don't know. The fungus could certainly live very well alone almost anywhere, but it chooses to entwine itself with the tree over an easier and more independent life. It has adapted to seek the rush of pure sweetness that comes directly from a plant root, such a strange and concentrated compound, unlike anything to be found elsewhere in the forest. And perhaps the fungus can somehow sense that when it is part of a symbiosis, it is also not alone.' (p. 105)I suppose a caveat is in order: for those readers who aren't too interested in the science, it can be a bit tedious and may lose you a bit if you haven't been in a science class since high school, however the enthusiasm and dedication that Jahren has will win you over. I felt comforted reading about all her experiments out in the fields and how meticulously everything had to be done, and then rejoiced when results came through that led to conclusions and consequently, more funding! You'll root (ha!) for her and Bill every step of the way. She's also quite honest about her struggles, not just at work but at home as well, which I didn't expect. It's very difficult to admit to desperate times when you can't see what's ahead of you, or loneliness, much less mental health struggles. I appreciated the book even more for Jahren's willingness to talk about all this and the vulnerability that comes with it. A very moving memoir. It may surprise you how much you will want to read about the inner workings and patience of a seed, or how the surprisingly softness of spongy moss led to a way of finding solid people to work with, until you pick this up, and then it doesn't. It just feels right to see the world like this."

When I saw it on the new book shelf at the library I brought it home with me.""Each beginning is the end of a waiting. We are each given exactly one chance to be. Each of us is both impossible and inevitable. Every replete tree was first a seed that waited.""Jahren has faced many challenges: a lonely childhood, working herself through school, struggling as a female scientist against the prejudices of a male dominated field, finding funding for her projects. Her success can be verified by her choice as one of Time's 100 Most Influential People, her Fulbright Scholarships, and her long relationship with her lab partner Bill. She found love and faced a difficult pregnancy sans medication for her bipolar disorder to have the child that changed her life.""I have learned that raising a child is essentially one long, slow agony of letting go.""Jahren's writing is so lovely to read. Her love of her work as a geobioloist and her awe of nature shines through the pages. She alternates chapters on her life with chapters about the world of green growing things around us.The self-portrait Jahren paints reveals her personal challenges and insecurities without being confessional and raw. Her lab partner/best friend/soul mate Bill is interesting and complicated, eccentric and brilliant. He once lived in a hole in his parent's back yard. We come to love him as much as Jahren does. We are happy when her loneliness is ended by marrying a man who 'gets her.'To read a section of the book go to http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/boo...To read an interview with Jahren go to http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/the-se..."
206,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3788241-elena,5,"In my mind, a great memoir has you singing along with the writer when she is happy, and aching with her when she is sad. Hope Jahren's excellent memoir Lab Girl does just that. Jahren intersperses stories about plants with stories about science with stories about her own life in a way that is masterful and utterly engaging. I didn't expect to enjoy reading about plants or to learn about them (I'm an ecologist) but I found myself loving those sections. Jahren's unique insights into why it is important to understand how plants grow add a fascinating layer to what in lesser hands might have been 'just biology'. The stories about science illuminate how science really works - what it takes to get money to do the work, and how it all really unfolds in the lab. And the stories about Jahren's life and how her choices led her to be the person she is bring the book together as a complete whole.As Heather says, this is a book for those who love science or memoir. But it is also a book for all those who simply love well-crafted stories about courageous lives and courageous women and learning how to be a good person in a complex world.  "
207,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/714583-anita-pomerantz,5,"Fascinating read that is hard to parse. Is it about a female scientist? A relationship between a man and a woman like no other? Manic depression? Botany?The author really holds nothing back in this memoir, and I found Hope to be pretty fascinating. She's nerdy and mentally ill and loving and a workaholic. She is an incredible scientist and a tremendous writer. For me, the highlight of this book is her description of her relationship with her lab employee (partner?), Bill. I couldn't decide what to make of it. Were they in love? Like siblings? Just great colleagues with a shared passion for the work? Whatever it is/was, it was very interesting.In addition, the structure of the book is well done. The reader alternately learns something about plant life, and then the subsequent chapter highlights parallels in human life. I have little science background, but thought most of the explanations were clear and educational. I imagine Hope is an excellent teacher, with the ability to both be engaging and impart knowledge at the same time.Really, almost a five star read for me."
208,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19126246-kaitlin,0,"I ended up DNF-ing this one at 200pages in (which I know is fairly close to the end). I actually loved the science-y bits of this, where the author shows her flair for studying plants, her passion for their care, and also her stunning ability to write beautifully about them. However, although I think these sections were great, Hope Jahren's actual backstory and the way she wrote about her journey just didn't 'click' with me and I found it super hard to connect or relate at all. This really took me out of the book and so ultimately I was forcing myself to pick it up, and that's no fun, so I just decided it was time to put it down and give it to someone else who may enjoy it far more. Ah well. "
209,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4059160-amy,5,"Jahren's book is full of passion and love for her family, friends and work. It is a memoir of sorts with the life cycle of a tree interspersed with her own stories. A fantastic read!"
210,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/260116-janb,5,"I finished this memoir a few days ago and in trying to get my thoughts together for a review, I read what my GR friends said about the book, and I realized it's all been said and said so much better and eloquently than I could.So I'll just say I loved it. I listened to the audiobook, read by the author , and she does an excellent job. I loved hearing about her life and passion as a scientist, her illness (bipolar), her quirky friend Bill, her marriage, motherhood, and yes, I even loved the science-y parts. I'll never look at a tree the same and I now have even more respect for research scientists.Highly recommended."
211,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4271946-jessica-woodbury,4,"I waited for a long time to read this book even though it came highly recommended from several scientists. I was skeptical about the title. And while I am not a scientist by profession, I did train as an undergrad and earn a BS. The thing about scientists is we are very territorial. I am a Chemist. My Physicist friends say, ""But Chemistry is all Physics!"" and they are not entirely wrong. I often scoff at Biology, Botany, Zoology, etc. and say, ""But you're ignoring all the Chemistry!"" So the Botany angle here did not move it up my TBR list.But. As a baby scientist myself, and as someone who spent several years married to a scientist during his PhD and basically lived and breathed lab culture, ultimately I couldn't stay away. I had to see what all the fuss about and I had to see if Jahren got it right. Many people don't. If you are intimidated by a very scientific read, don't be afraid. Jahren's years of teaching experience have clearly created someone who is skilled at turning complex scientific processes and ideas into easily digestible narratives. If you are concerned it will not be scientific enough, there's enough interesting data here to sate you, though I did wish I learned more about Jahren's own research.The thing about this book, though, the thing that makes it one of my favorites of the year isn't just that Jahren gets lab life right, it's how skillfully she tells the stories of trees alongside her own story. I have never ever cared about a tree more than I did during this book. And I was lucky enough to listen to the audio (read beautifully by Jahren herself) while I drove past the blazing autumn leaves of New England, so every tree seemed somehow magical. If someone had taught me about plants the way Jahren does, where it is not just a process to learn and a life cycle to memorize, but where every single step along the way is a miracle in and of itself, I can see myself seriously considering Botany as a potential major. This book in the hands of a college student could be life changing.Some may find Jahren's story not interesting enough for a memoir. But this is not a memoir that is built around a journey. It is showing you who she is, and a big part of it focuses on the incredibly close relationship she has with her lab partner, Bill. While they mean absolutely everything to one another, they are not intimate friends, not secret sharers, not confidants. Learning the rhythms of their conversation and the routines of their friendship will show you the kind of relationship you probably haven't seen before. Jahren covers many things here besides science. Parenthood, the chill Scandinavian traditions of the Midwest, the slog of early academic life, and her own struggle with bipolar disorder. Her writing is simple but deliberate and lovely. I enjoyed every moment listening to her read. "
212,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10001905-lynn,0,"My first thoughts, this book is in a word, odd. It is a memoir written by a bipolar paleobiologist and her Asperger’s like, one-handed best friend/lab assistant. They stumble through the US and Europe trying to do good science. The book is about three things. 1. Science: we learn about the scientific method, how a mass spectrometer works, and that trees have memory (all of which was much more interesting than I would have thought). 2. Love and Family: in all its permutations, good/bad, expressed/unexpressed, chosen/not chosen. 3. Academia: a close and accurate look at the tarnished Ivory tower with tales of sexism, cut throat competition, and the never ending search for money. Despite her struggles, she becomes an award winning and accomplished scholar with her best friend by her side. My final thoughts: this book is in a word, captivating. "
213,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5159766-l-a-starks,5,"What a shame this utterly amazing book has such a lame title. My advice is to forget the title and read the book. Jahren, a three-time Fulbright winner, has written a reader-friendly, relationship-centered sequence of stories about her experience as a paleobotany researcher. There is much to learn and Jahren doesn't shrink from explaining it. However, the terms and structure are highly accessible. The book is one of those rare fusions of science and humanity that many readers so often wish for but can seldom find. The reason is simple--it takes a polymath like Ms. Jahren to understand and love the labwork and yet also be able to explain it to non-scientists. This is the biology class--really much more--you wish you'd experienced. At the same time, Jahren is clear about the difficulties of an academic scientist's life--getting grants, writing proposals, acquiring equipment, paying lab assistants, the necessity of moving on to better opportunities. She writes with joy about marriage, her son, her struggle with bipolarity, and most of all about her talented, brilliant assistant, Bill.About the title: this is apparently the season of ""The Girl Who..."" after the success of The Girl on the Train. Unfortunately, ""Lab GIRL"" is diminutive, and diminishes, the complex, warm, fascinating PhD scientist we meet in its pages. I wish the publishers had worked harder to come up with a title that better represents this story. "
214,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6677659-marchpane,3,"An uneven read for me. Loved the science-y bits, found the personal memoir sections either tedious or grating. "
215,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3965659-rachel,2,"This is a textbook case of 'it's not you, it's me.' I understand the appeal, and in a lot of ways I'm thrilled about this book's mainstream success (women in STEM fields and healthy, platonic relationships between men and women are two things we need more of in media), but there were only so many loving descriptions of trees I could take after a while. There was just too much science and not enough human interest to keep me engaged, and while I wouldn't say you need to be knowledgeable about biology to approach this book, a certain amount of interest would be helpful, and I just don't have that, at all. And the audiobook was a mistake; the author narrates it with a positively bizarre amount of melodrama (like, actually in tears at multiple points, and I'm sorry if that makes me sound callous but I really don't react well to overly sentimental narration), so I can't say it was a pleasant listening experience... But anyway, really not a bad book, just not my kind of book."
216,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56398848-nisa,5,"Firstly i want to thank Elyse for recommending this book and letting me have a chance to read it :)Hope firstly began with her childhood and then suddenly make a jumb to her recent life (to introduce herself but kept it short) in lab with Bill (of course they can't be thought apart :)) It was nice in the beginning but after she met with Bill and they began to work together in her lab it's like everything fell into place and real story began. When she told about her studies it was not boring but interesting some of them was long but she kept its length good enough and she shared with us interesting facts about plants. First i began listening this novel as an audio book but because when i listened i kept lost track when i came places she talks about her studies (they are not in my domain and English is my second language and i'm not good enough to listen everything) after that i bought it as an e book and went on by reading.If i think as a whole i loved this book and i loved the way she finished it. But if i talk about its part some part was boring, some exiting and make me happy, sad and worried (I want to say life is not so different). When Hope writing about her life she was so sincere and because of that when she was happy i was happy with her, and worried about her when she feel desperate. I think she is so good at telling her life story and i want to that everything would be good for her. I loved her and the way she tells her story but mostly and all i loved Bill and his answers (I usually marked what he said). In addition i think i love more Bill because she loved (as an important friend) Bill more than herself. And i would love to have friendship like theirs . ""He is strong where I am weak, and so together we make one complete person, each of us gaining half of what we need from the world and the other half from each other."" this is the way she describe their friendship with her words.Here the things that Bill said and make me laugh :)This conversation happened when Hope and Bill met first time. She was assisting a lecture that in this class students need to dig earth. She realize he was digging alone and he cought attention of her""I stood there and watched him dig for a while, and began to notice the uncommonly large amount of earth that he was moving with each shovelful and the implied strength that must have accompanied his wiry frame. I also noticed that he was digging with something that looked like an old harpoon flattened at one end – a sword beaten into a real plowshare.""“Where did you get that shovel?” I asked, figuring it was from the pile of junk I had hauled out of the department’s equipment locker, which had been located in the basement next to an old coal hull. “It’s mine,” he said. “Don’t judge it until you’ve dug a mile in its shoes.” “You mean you brought your own shovel from home?” I laughed in friendly surprise and delight. “Hell yes,” he affirmed. “I wasn’t going to leave this thing unattended for six weeks.” “I like your thinking,” I replied.And this one when they go to monkey jungle and when he said that he was looking a monkey it seems shocked as much as him. ""Bill finally stated, without redirecting his stare, “It’s like looking in a fucking mirror.”""Well if i share all of them this review will be too long and i would be more happy if you decide to read and see for yourself :)) Have a great week. :))"

Jahren alternates chapters between her journey as a scientist and her knowledge and passion for botany. Of special interest to me was reading about the difficulties she faced especially as a Research Botanist. Some readers in my book club found her whiny, but I thought she was just being honest in her struggles with an antiseptic upbringing, mental illness, and sexist road blocks from being a woman in a male dominated fields. I learned it takes a really special person to do research experiments.The tension to me of mind numbing monotonous tasks coupled with the stringent standards of proof, well let's just say it's not a field for most people. Added to that is the constant struggle for adequate funding. I found it quite enjoyable with bonus botanic bits."

220,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6449756-sonja-arlow,3,"3 1/2 starsI have always had a love of medicine and science (all though my high school results on science may tell another story) so I was immediately drawn to this book.Hope grew up in her father’s laboratory surrounded by Bunsen burners, petri dishes and access to everything a curious child my want to investigate in a lab. It’s not surprising that she was brought up in an academically focused household and even her mother studied part time and included her daughter in her learning process.I really appreciated the fact that all the experiments or processes in the book was explained so that any person no matter how unenlightened about science, could grasp the concepts.”My laboratory is like a church because it is where I figure out what I believe”I loved reading about her part-time work at a local hospital while studying – it gave me glimpses of the nuts and bolts of running a hospital and more than once I wished that she had become a doctor rather than a botanist.My feelings towards flora is neither here nor there so naturally some of the chapters dealing with the workings of plants didn’t really interest me but one thing came across crystal clear and that is her absolute passion about what she does for a living.  “I will never stop being ravenously hungry for science, no matter how well it feeds me”I also found the sections dealing with just how difficult it is to secure funding for scientific projects are as well as glimpses on Hope dealing with her bi-polar disease, eye-opening. But it’s her friendship with Bill, her lab partner, that stood out for me. So this is a mix between work as a scientist, information about botany and a young woman trying to carve a foothold for herself in a male dominated industry. This may not be for everyone but it was a very enjoyable and informative read for me."
221,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27078093-alice-lippart,4,Enjoyable and really interesting. Loved all the science!
222,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5637143-anna,2,"I'm very curious what other scientists, particularly women, think of this book. To me, the best writing in the book was in the short chapters about plants, even though some of the cool plant insights were already familiar to me since I've worked in plant labs for some years. The rest was uneven, tended toward telling instead of showing, and I think because of this the relationships come out feeling flat, even her relationship with Bill which is clearly important and meant to feel more three-dimensional. Overall, although I certainly support women in science telling their stories, this didn't live up to my expectations, not even close, and I would take Evelyn Fox Keller's 'A Feeling for the Organism' or Susan Brind Morrow's 'Wolves and Honey' or Lauren Redniss's 'Radioactive' over Lab Girl any day of the week. One more note: Jahren sometimes explicitly or implicitly gives the impression that there's one correct way to be a scientist: you have to be immediately driven forward by your failures, never discouraged by them, you have to be able to work for 48 hours straight, you have to have always known science is what you wanted. There is no one way to be a scientist: this is completely untrue, as it is untrue of any profession, and don't let it discourage you or any young girl you know from pursuing science."
223,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1881113-andrea,3,"Such a short book, but it took me forever to read it. I should have liked it more than I actually did. Hope Jahren's part-memoir, part-scientific reflection has humour, memorable personalities, fun educational material, and some truly moving recollections. The problem was that sometimes Jahren's could become too dramatic. I had the misfortune to listen to the audiobook while walking my dog, and I swear it made me want to pull my hair out. The teary, choking voice at the end of nearly every chapter that was supposed to make me feel emotions while the author dwelled in self-pity was like nails on chalkboard. I also went into the book thinking this would be more of a love letter to botany and some interesting findings the author discovered during her career (I never read blurbs), but instead I got mostly a memoir, interlaced some musings on plants that supported the mood for these memories. And this is officially the longest sentence I've ever written. Needless to say, I am sort of underwhelmed. If you are going to read Lab Girl, please avoid the audio, and be prepared for a lifetime worth of over-reactions to ordinary events. "

So I can't really fault Hope for telling her story. But I can caution potential readers: if you want to know what's it is like to be a scientist, don't rely on this book. This is just one story, and it is not at all typical. You don't have to work 80 hours per week to be a scientist. You can have a life AND be a scientist. If you're a student, you can find a grad advisor who cares about you and invests in your success and doesn't haze you when you first join the lab. In short, Future Scientists, don't be discouraged by reading this. Science takes all kinds, and life in science can be what you want it to be."

My wife's reading group selected Lab Girl, so I gave it a read, too. Hope is a ""tree scientist,"" and she brings a deep passion to her work. I learned all types of new stuff about trees and plants. I like how she writes about her personal life, including her career in academia. Great read."

Rhythm and cycles permeate the narrative, bouncing between Hope Jahren's ups and downs as a career scientist, and the intricate lives of vegetation. I hadn't even read a synopsis before before I began, and was pleasantly surprised by the delicate unfolding of the book … made from paper, derived from intelligent trees … ~ Just Trust Me: In Praise Of Strange Books (All 3 are 5 star reads!)~Hope Jahren is a celebrated geochemist and geobiologist, not to mention an exceptionally interesting human being. Currently she works at the University of Oslo, and this book is her origin story.Jahren worked with her mother in the garden growing up, first sparking her love of growing things.“By the end of June the whole crop was well on its way and the world around us was so green that it seemed impossible that it could ever have been otherwise. By July, the sweating leaves of all these plants had pumped the air so full of moisture that the humidity caused the electrical lines to buzz and crackle overhead.” She also played in her father’s lab from a young age, inspiring her love for science and hunger to know how things work.“There I transformed from a girl into a scientist, just like Peter Parker becoming Spider-Man, only kind of backward.” Eventually, Jahren’s life intersects with a man named Bill, in a lab—where else? He becomes her loyal assistant, moving locations and building labs with her. There was one point where I kind of hoped they’d get together, but their relationship is unique and special—more like best friends or brother and sister.Did I mention the writing is beautiful? Jahren deals with mental illness and loneliness in such a heartfelt manner it’s impossible not to empathize alongside her. She reads the audiobook and you can hear the emotion in her voice, bleeding through the words. The tone remains positive and manages not to be depressing even when dealing with tough topics. There is hope, and the beauty of science unveiling new understanding to the world. The history and lives of trees are presented in a fascinating way, paralleling various aspects of human lives.If you enjoy plants and true tails of scientific superstars — this book is for you.Quotes:“She set her hair in curlers while listening to records of Carl Sandburg’s poems over and over, and instructed me on how to hear the words differently each time. After discovering Susan Sontag, she explained to me that even meaning itself is a constructed concept, and I learned how to nod and pretend to understand.” “Full-blown mania lets you see the other side of death. Its onset is profoundly visceral and unexpected, no matter how many times you’ve been through it. It is your body that first senses the urgency of a new world about to bloom. Your vertebrae seem to detach from one another and you elongate as if toward the sun’s light. You can’t hear above the sloshing roar of blood pushed through your head by some impossibly sustained orgasm within your beating heart. For the next twenty-four, forty-eight, seventy-two hours you will have to yell to hear yourself over this whooshing. Nothing, nothing can be loud enough or bright enough or move fast enough. The world appears as if through a fish-eye lens; your view is fuzzy with sparkling edges. You have received a grand, systemic injection of Novocain and your entire body tingles briefly before it becomes flaccidly foreign and unreal. Your raised arms are the fleshy petals of a magnificent lily bursting into flower. It deeply dawns on you that this new world about to bloom is you.” “There at the end of the world, he danced in the broad and endless daylight, and I accepted him for what he was, instead of what he wished he could be. The potency of my acceptance made me wonder, just a little, if I could turn it inward and accept myself.” "
227,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13977687-taryn,4,"This memoir could be subtitled “The Private Lives of Plants,” because paleobiologist Hope Jahren can’t help but wax poetic at times about her chosen field of study, with which she is clearly enraptured. Fortunately, she’s pretty convincing. Since my tastes run more toward gossipy tell-alls than science texts, my favorite parts of Lab Girl were Jahren's personal stories of her romance with her husband and decidedly unromantic relationship with her (occasionally homeless but forever loyal) research partner Bill. Amazingly enough, though, I didn't glaze over during the parts about trees and mosses. Jahren is one of those rare scientists able to express her enthusiasm for her subject in a way that translates to the average Jane. The audio version is read by Jahren herself, which makes the more emotional parts of the book ring with authenticity, but if you're bothered by soft, whispery voices, you might prefer to pick up this one in print. If you close your eyes, Jahren sounds just like Ana Gasteyer's character from the classic SNL sketch “Schweddy Balls.”More book recommendations by me at www.readingwithhippos.com"
228,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1291915-lauren,3,"The name of this book never worked for me - it didn't seem to capture what the book was about, and it is diminuitive in nature. Jahren is not a ""girl"", and this book is not cutesy, as the title, and even the cover art, would lead you to believe. Jahren's work in geobotany is fascinating, and I really enjoyed the interspersed chapters on plants, trees, natural history. The personal memoir sections were okay - they showed devotion and commitment to the science. I was frustrated with the roadblocks and glass ceilings that Jahren hit/endured as a female scientist, but I was also grew frustrated with Jahren for her continuous lack of foresight and planning, and the ways her actions (and inactions) impacted those around her. I know these symptoms are directly tied to her mental illness, and she writes about that with candor and bravery, and I do agree that we need more of this - normalizing, familiarizing. Thankfully, with time and experience, things did get better - for everyone. My favorite part was Jahren and Bill's time in the Arctic, digging up ancient trees. I really enjoyed that scene of Bill dancing, and her description of it. 3.5 stars"

Hope Jahren reads it herself and you can really feel the emotion as she tells you her life story. I always enjoy listening to women in science talk about their work and their experience navigating the field when especially in the past, men were lauded and revered for their accomplishments and women really had to fight for everything. The only thing I’d say which is entirely. a personal thing is that I don’t naturally gravitate toward her field and don’t find it super compelling but the way she told it made me infinitely more interested so no negatives there.

230,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6108495-marnie-enchanted-bibliophile,5,"This is simply brilliant.From the idea, to the writing, to the narration, and all the feelings it awakes makes writing a review useless in my opinion. JUST GO READ IT YOURSELF!"
231,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115473-siria,3,"My rating for this book is a reflection not so much of my enjoyment of it as my acknowledgement of its importance. Hope Jahren is a successful female research scientist working within a STEM field that's still overwhelmingly male-dominated, a woman with mental illness who has been able to forge an academic career—voices like hers are too rarely heard in academia in general and STEM fields in particular. Jahren focuses less on the highs of her career (she's won multiple Fulbrights, for instance, but I'm not sure that she even mentions that in the book) than she does on the lows and even more so the monotonous middle: the antisocial hours spent doing repetitive prep work in the lab, the constant scrabble to secure funding, the gauntlet of aggressions (micro and macro) faced by women in academia.However, for all Jahren's ability to be very upfront about her experiences (she clearly prides herself on her bluntness), Lab Girl is the kind of memoir that suffers from the author's lack of self-awareness. Although I'm not in a STEM field, I am a woman in academia, and so I'm quite familiar with other women (almost always white women) like Jahren: women for whom sexism is odious inasmuch as it affects them, but who care not one jot about systemic sexism or how it affects other women. Almost the only women to feature in the book are Jahren and her mother (who is treated with a hostility which I find inexplicable, given that nothing in the behaviour attributed to her seems particularly egregious or all that different from that ascribed to Jahren's beloved father), and I was almost surprised to end a book not having encountered a paragraph in which Jahren explains why she's Not Like the Other Girls. More overtly jarring were Jahren's descriptions of her interactions with students and the means by which she ""trains in"" new graduate students. If these were the anecdotes she thought made her look like a competent instructor, I'm hoping her grad students have insurance which lets them access a good therapist—or failing that, that they have access to a steady supply of palatable beer. Don't haze your students! Don't pass on fucked-up measures of academic ""worth"" to students just because academia is messed up and most graduate advisors don't know pedagogical theory from a hole in the wall!Listening to this as an audiobook was also a mistake. Jahren's talents are undoubtedly many, but acting out even her own words is not one she possesses. The vocal quivering and gulping she employed were distracting and maudlin; it was like listening to an audiobook from the Victorian period. Listening to the audiobook version also made the section set in Ireland extra obnoxious to me (an Irishwoman), and retroactively made me question the trustworthiness of great swathes of the book. The most egregious example of this is when Jahren describes getting lost in Limerick City, and attributes this to the fact that all of the street signs are in Irish. (Now, I've heard Americans mangle Irish over the years, but never so comprehensively as Hope Jahren. I honestly asked myself if she'd just spoken in Klingon, had to go look up the text of the book on Google Books, and then shrieked at the realisation that she was trying to say ""Sráid Eibhlín.) Here's the thing: street signs in Ireland are bilingual, with the English-language text generally appearing in larger font, and the Irish-language version smaller and in italics. There's no way that Jahren was lost and distractedly trying to figure out where ""Sráid Eibhlín"" was; she had to have known all along that she was on Ellen Street. This might seem like nitpicking, but such an obvious twisting of the truth—whether in service of a little bit of drama or getting an extra bit of comedy out of the Weird Irish—felt like the literary version of the bad scientific practice of p-hacking."
232,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13126933-lata,5,"This was excellent. From the beautiful writing about her family, or of her struggles with building and maintaining a lab, or her long friendship with colleague Bill, or of her struggles with bipolar disorder, or the lyrical sections about plant life, I thoroughly enjoyed this memoir. I was fascinated, and listened, rapt, though the many events of Hope Jahren's life, and I learned some great things too, about the glorious plants on this planet that we couldn't exist without."
233,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/99765491-jimz,3,"I give this memoir 3 stars. Pros:•	Her descriptions of how plants and trees grow were in general fabulous. Terribly complicated biology and she was able to describe it in language that was not condescending but just was utterly fascinating. She explained a number of biological phenomena throughout the book and her explanations in most cases at least for me were just at about the right length...long enough so I could understand the basic phenomenon but not so long as to make me lose interest. So kudos to her for that. •	Her descriptions of her mania and depression were scary-sad. It’s obvious she had some major hurdles in her life that her own body were creating for her…I am glad that she is at the position she is at today… Her troubles reminded me of the memoir, An Unquiet Mind, by Kay Redfield Jamison, a psychologist who herself had bipolar disorder (which I highly recommend GR folks to read). •	Dr. Jahren’s description of growing up and her going to her father’s lab was quite interesting, as well as the family dynamics (and sometimes lack thereof….there was not a lot of overt affection that her parents showed her apparently and she also was not close to her brothers). In a later part of the book she made a comment that “I didn’t know if I was crying because I was nobody’s wife or mother – or because I felt like nobody’s daughter–…”. So it appeared she had next to no relationship with her family after she left home for grad school and beyond, yet there is this book dedication which seemed odd at least to me: “Everything I write is dedicated to my mother.”•	Her description of academia is for the most part (I am in and come from academia) realistic. She for many a year lived on what is called “soft money” in which her lab was dependent on governmental grants. “Her lab” means her salary and her assistants’ salaries and money needed to conduct her experiments. One is always having to write research grants (with no guarantee that a particular grant will ever get funded), because the money always seems to be running out. And that’s OK in a way…there is no free lunch…but still it is stressful not only for principal investigators but those working for them (in this memoir for example, Bill her lab manager).Cons:•	The book was way too long for its own good. •	Some of the long drawn-out conversations between her and her comrade-in-arms Bill that she relates to us could have been either shortened or deleted. She wrote the conversations in a verbatim style as if they just happened yesterday when in many instances the conversations happened in the late 1990s or early 2000s. Some of the conversations were “dopey” for lack of a better word – people just do not talk like that. •	I really did not like Bill. Just my problem I guess. He appeared to be satisfied working 80-hour weeks, not having a life outside of the lab, working apparently at times on starvation wages, literally living in the lab building at times, living in a van… She portrays him as some sort of hero to her…he never grew on me. To me he had an anti-social personality. And he sure swore a lot. •	She is introducing us to a scientific field, plant biology, and she does a fantastic job. But there was one part of the book that just got me pissed off. It’s when she and her lab visited a place that housed monkeys called the Monkey Jungle. And what she did, as an esteemed scientist, was anthropomorphize the primates to an extent in which it was in one respect laughable (not funny laughable), but in another respect a disservice to both the animals and to science (“…she saw in Monkey Jungle a doppelganger for her lab”). “…Two small squirrel monkeys seemed to be trapped in their own private Samuel Beckett play, caught in a web made of equal parts dependence and loathing. … A single howler monkey sat high on a branch in the back, wailing out the entire Book of Job in his native tongue while periodically raising his arms in an age-old supplication for an explanation as to why the righteous must suffer.” Went beyond the pale for me.Reviews:https://www.theguardian.com/books/201... https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/29/bo...

234,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2329065-joanie,4,"'Science is work, nothing more and nothing less. And so we will keep working as another day dawns and this week turns into next week, and then this month becomes next month. I can feel the warmth of the same brilliant sun that shines above the forest and onto the green world, but in my heart I know that I am not a plant. I am more like an ant, driven to find and carry single dead needles, one after the other, all the way across the forest and then add them one by one to a pile so massive that I can only fully imagine one small corner of it.' (p. 277)This book was such a joy. A part memoir, part ode to plant life and the grind of a scientist, written so engagingly that you can't help but feel ready to kick off your shoes, then step right into the soil to collect some samples to label the next thousand times over. That's a lot coming from me. As much as I can appreciate nature, I'm far from being outdoorsy, with my city living and my rampant fear of bugs. Hope Jahren allows us all to feel like we have that curiosity inside us to be scientists in our own lives, in small but by no means insignificant ways. She burns with such infectious passion for her work that you can't help but be drawn in too. The book's journey is divided lovingly into: Roots and Leaves, Wood and Knots, and Flowers and Fruit, with individual chapters then going into her work and rhapsodies of the wonder of nature that it all around us (have you looked at a leaf lately and thought about how miraculous it is?), then somehow works it all in with her personal life and her relationship with Bill, which is utterly undefinable in the most wonderful of ways. Here's one of the many, many plant-related passages that I loved, which described not just nature but her and Bill:'Why are they together, the tree and the fungus? We don't know. The fungus could certainly live very well alone almost anywhere, but it chooses to entwine itself with the tree over an easier and more independent life. It has adapted to seek the rush of pure sweetness that comes directly from a plant root, such a strange and concentrated compound, unlike anything to be found elsewhere in the forest. And perhaps the fungus can somehow sense that when it is part of a symbiosis, it is also not alone.' (p. 105)I suppose a caveat is in order: for those readers who aren't too interested in the science, it can be a bit tedious and may lose you a bit if you haven't been in a science class since high school, however the enthusiasm and dedication that Jahren has will win you over. I felt comforted reading about all her experiments out in the fields and how meticulously everything had to be done, and then rejoiced when results came through that led to conclusions and consequently, more funding! You'll root (ha!) for her and Bill every step of the way. She's also quite honest about her struggles, not just at work but at home as well, which I didn't expect. It's very difficult to admit to desperate times when you can't see what's ahead of you, or loneliness, much less mental health struggles. I appreciated the book even more for Jahren's willingness to talk about all this and the vulnerability that comes with it. A very moving memoir. It may surprise you how much you will want to read about the inner workings and patience of a seed, or how the surprisingly softness of spongy moss led to a way of finding solid people to work with, until you pick this up, and then it doesn't. It just feels right to see the world like this."

Each of us is both impossible and inevitable. Every replete tree was first a seed that waited.""Jahren has faced many challenges: a lonely childhood, working herself through school, struggling as a female scientist against the prejudices of a male dominated field, finding funding for her projects. Her success can be verified by her choice as one of Time's 100 Most Influential People, her Fulbright Scholarships, and her long relationship with her lab partner Bill. She found love and faced a difficult pregnancy sans medication for her bipolar disorder to have the child that changed her life.""I have learned that raising a child is essentially one long, slow agony of letting go.""Jahren's writing is so lovely to read. Her love of her work as a geobioloist and her awe of nature shines through the pages. She alternates chapters on her life with chapters about the world of green growing things around us.The self-portrait Jahren paints reveals her personal challenges and insecurities without being confessional and raw.

236,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3788241-elena,5,"In my mind, a great memoir has you singing along with the writer when she is happy, and aching with her when she is sad. Hope Jahren's excellent memoir Lab Girl does just that. Jahren intersperses stories about plants with stories about science with stories about her own life in a way that is masterful and utterly engaging. I didn't expect to enjoy reading about plants or to learn about them (I'm an ecologist) but I found myself loving those sections. Jahren's unique insights into why it is important to understand how plants grow add a fascinating layer to what in lesser hands might have been 'just biology'. The stories about science illuminate how science really works - what it takes to get money to do the work, and how it all really unfolds in the lab. And the stories about Jahren's life and how her choices led her to be the person she is bring the book together as a complete whole.As Heather says, this is a book for those who love science or memoir. But it is also a book for all those who simply love well-crafted stories about courageous lives and courageous women and learning how to be a good person in a complex world.  "
237,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/714583-anita-pomerantz,5,"Fascinating read that is hard to parse. Is it about a female scientist? A relationship between a man and a woman like no other? Manic depression? Botany?The author really holds nothing back in this memoir, and I found Hope to be pretty fascinating. She's nerdy and mentally ill and loving and a workaholic. She is an incredible scientist and a tremendous writer. For me, the highlight of this book is her description of her relationship with her lab employee (partner?), Bill. I couldn't decide what to make of it. Were they in love? Like siblings? Just great colleagues with a shared passion for the work? Whatever it is/was, it was very interesting.In addition, the structure of the book is well done. The reader alternately learns something about plant life, and then the subsequent chapter highlights parallels in human life. I have little science background, but thought most of the explanations were clear and educational. I imagine Hope is an excellent teacher, with the ability to both be engaging and impart knowledge at the same time.Really, almost a five star read for me."
238,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19126246-kaitlin,0,"I ended up DNF-ing this one at 200pages in (which I know is fairly close to the end). I actually loved the science-y bits of this, where the author shows her flair for studying plants, her passion for their care, and also her stunning ability to write beautifully about them. However, although I think these sections were great, Hope Jahren's actual backstory and the way she wrote about her journey just didn't 'click' with me and I found it super hard to connect or relate at all. This really took me out of the book and so ultimately I was forcing myself to pick it up, and that's no fun, so I just decided it was time to put it down and give it to someone else who may enjoy it far more. Ah well. "
239,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4059160-amy,5,"Jahren's book is full of passion and love for her family, friends and work. It is a memoir of sorts with the life cycle of a tree interspersed with her own stories. A fantastic read!"

I listened to the audiobook, read by the author , and she does an excellent job. I loved hearing about her life and passion as a scientist, her illness (bipolar), her quirky friend Bill, her marriage, motherhood, and yes, I even loved the science-y parts. I'll never look at a tree the same and I now have even more respect for research scientists.Highly recommended."
241,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4271946-jessica-woodbury,4,"I waited for a long time to read this book even though it came highly recommended from several scientists. I was skeptical about the title. And while I am not a scientist by profession, I did train as an undergrad and earn a BS. The thing about scientists is we are very territorial. I am a Chemist. My Physicist friends say, ""But Chemistry is all Physics!"" and they are not entirely wrong. I often scoff at Biology, Botany, Zoology, etc. and say, ""But you're ignoring all the Chemistry!"" So the Botany angle here did not move it up my TBR list.But. As a baby scientist myself, and as someone who spent several years married to a scientist during his PhD and basically lived and breathed lab culture, ultimately I couldn't stay away. I had to see what all the fuss about and I had to see if Jahren got it right. Many people don't. If you are intimidated by a very scientific read, don't be afraid. Jahren's years of teaching experience have clearly created someone who is skilled at turning complex scientific processes and ideas into easily digestible narratives. If you are concerned it will not be scientific enough, there's enough interesting data here to sate you, though I did wish I learned more about Jahren's own research.The thing about this book, though, the thing that makes it one of my favorites of the year isn't just that Jahren gets lab life right, it's how skillfully she tells the stories of trees alongside her own story. I have never ever cared about a tree more than I did during this book. And I was lucky enough to listen to the audio (read beautifully by Jahren herself) while I drove past the blazing autumn leaves of New England, so every tree seemed somehow magical. If someone had taught me about plants the way Jahren does, where it is not just a process to learn and a life cycle to memorize, but where every single step along the way is a miracle in and of itself, I can see myself seriously considering Botany as a potential major. This book in the hands of a college student could be life changing.Some may find Jahren's story not interesting enough for a memoir. But this is not a memoir that is built around a journey. It is showing you who she is, and a big part of it focuses on the incredibly close relationship she has with her lab partner, Bill. While they mean absolutely everything to one another, they are not intimate friends, not secret sharers, not confidants. Learning the rhythms of their conversation and the routines of their friendship will show you the kind of relationship you probably haven't seen before. Jahren covers many things here besides science. Parenthood, the chill Scandinavian traditions of the Midwest, the slog of early academic life, and her own struggle with bipolar disorder. Her writing is simple but deliberate and lovely. I enjoyed every moment listening to her read. "
242,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10001905-lynn,0,"My first thoughts, this book is in a word, odd. It is a memoir written by a bipolar paleobiologist and her Asperger’s like, one-handed best friend/lab assistant. They stumble through the US and Europe trying to do good science. The book is about three things. 1. Science: we learn about the scientific method, how a mass spectrometer works, and that trees have memory (all of which was much more interesting than I would have thought). 2. Love and Family: in all its permutations, good/bad, expressed/unexpressed, chosen/not chosen. 3. Academia: a close and accurate look at the tarnished Ivory tower with tales of sexism, cut throat competition, and the never ending search for money. Despite her struggles, she becomes an award winning and accomplished scholar with her best friend by her side. My final thoughts: this book is in a word, captivating. "
243,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5159766-l-a-starks,5,"What a shame this utterly amazing book has such a lame title. My advice is to forget the title and read the book. Jahren, a three-time Fulbright winner, has written a reader-friendly, relationship-centered sequence of stories about her experience as a paleobotany researcher. There is much to learn and Jahren doesn't shrink from explaining it. However, the terms and structure are highly accessible. The book is one of those rare fusions of science and humanity that many readers so often wish for but can seldom find. The reason is simple--it takes a polymath like Ms. Jahren to understand and love the labwork and yet also be able to explain it to non-scientists. This is the biology class--really much more--you wish you'd experienced. At the same time, Jahren is clear about the difficulties of an academic scientist's life--getting grants, writing proposals, acquiring equipment, paying lab assistants, the necessity of moving on to better opportunities. She writes with joy about marriage, her son, her struggle with bipolarity, and most of all about her talented, brilliant assistant, Bill.About the title: this is apparently the season of ""The Girl Who..."" after the success of The Girl on the Train. Unfortunately, ""Lab GIRL"" is diminutive, and diminishes, the complex, warm, fascinating PhD scientist we meet in its pages. I wish the publishers had worked harder to come up with a title that better represents this story. "

245,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3965659-rachel,2,"This is a textbook case of 'it's not you, it's me.' I understand the appeal, and in a lot of ways I'm thrilled about this book's mainstream success (women in STEM fields and healthy, platonic relationships between men and women are two things we need more of in media), but there were only so many loving descriptions of trees I could take after a while. There was just too much science and not enough human interest to keep me engaged, and while I wouldn't say you need to be knowledgeable about biology to approach this book, a certain amount of interest would be helpful, and I just don't have that, at all. And the audiobook was a mistake; the author narrates it with a positively bizarre amount of melodrama (like, actually in tears at multiple points, and I'm sorry if that makes me sound callous but I really don't react well to overly sentimental narration), so I can't say it was a pleasant listening experience... But anyway, really not a bad book, just not my kind of book."
246,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56398848-nisa,5,"Firstly i want to thank Elyse for recommending this book and letting me have a chance to read it :)Hope firstly began with her childhood and then suddenly make a jumb to her recent life (to introduce herself but kept it short) in lab with Bill (of course they can't be thought apart :)) It was nice in the beginning but after she met with Bill and they began to work together in her lab it's like everything fell into place and real story began. When she told about her studies it was not boring but interesting some of them was long but she kept its length good enough and she shared with us interesting facts about plants. First i began listening this novel as an audio book but because when i listened i kept lost track when i came places she talks about her studies (they are not in my domain and English is my second language and i'm not good enough to listen everything) after that i bought it as an e book and went on by reading.If i think as a whole i loved this book and i loved the way she finished it. But if i talk about its part some part was boring, some exiting and make me happy, sad and worried (I want to say life is not so different). When Hope writing about her life she was so sincere and because of that when she was happy i was happy with her, and worried about her when she feel desperate. I think she is so good at telling her life story and i want to that everything would be good for her. I loved her and the way she tells her story but mostly and all i loved Bill and his answers (I usually marked what he said). In addition i think i love more Bill because she loved (as an important friend) Bill more than herself. And i would love to have friendship like theirs . ""He is strong where I am weak, and so together we make one complete person, each of us gaining half of what we need from the world and the other half from each other."" this is the way she describe their friendship with her words.Here the things that Bill said and make me laugh :)This conversation happened when Hope and Bill met first time. She was assisting a lecture that in this class students need to dig earth. She realize he was digging alone and he cought attention of her""I stood there and watched him dig for a while, and began to notice the uncommonly large amount of earth that he was moving with each shovelful and the implied strength that must have accompanied his wiry frame. I also noticed that he was digging with something that looked like an old harpoon flattened at one end – a sword beaten into a real plowshare.""“Where did you get that shovel?” I asked, figuring it was from the pile of junk I had hauled out of the department’s equipment locker, which had been located in the basement next to an old coal hull. “It’s mine,” he said. “Don’t judge it until you’ve dug a mile in its shoes.” “You mean you brought your own shovel from home?” I laughed in friendly surprise and delight. “Hell yes,” he affirmed. “I wasn’t going to leave this thing unattended for six weeks.” “I like your thinking,” I replied.And this one when they go to monkey jungle and when he said that he was looking a monkey it seems shocked as much as him. ""Bill finally stated, without redirecting his stare, “It’s like looking in a fucking mirror.”""Well if i share all of them this review will be too long and i would be more happy if you decide to read and see for yourself :)) Have a great week. :))"

Jahren alternates chapters between her journey as a scientist and her knowledge and passion for botany. Of special interest to me was reading about the difficulties she faced especially as a Research Botanist. Some readers in my book club found her whiny, but I thought she was just being honest in her struggles with an antiseptic upbringing, mental illness, and sexist road blocks from being a woman in a male dominated fields. I learned it takes a really special person to do research experiments.The tension to me of mind numbing monotonous tasks coupled with the stringent standards of proof, well let's just say it's not a field for most people. Added to that is the constant struggle for adequate funding. I found it quite enjoyable with bonus botanic bits."

It’s not surprising that she was brought up in an academically focused household and even her mother studied part time and included her daughter in her learning process.I really appreciated the fact that all the experiments or processes in the book was explained so that any person no matter how unenlightened about science, could grasp the concepts.”My laboratory is like a church because it is where I figure out what I believe”I loved reading about her part-time work at a local hospital while studying – it gave me glimpses of the nuts and bolts of running a hospital and more than once I wished that she had become a doctor rather than a botanist.My feelings towards flora is neither here nor there so naturally some of the chapters dealing with the workings of plants didn’t really interest me but one thing came across crystal clear and that is her absolute passion about what she does for a living.  “I will never stop being ravenously hungry for science, no matter how well it feeds me”I also found the sections dealing with just how difficult it is to secure funding for scientific projects are as well as glimpses on Hope dealing with her bi-polar disease, eye-opening. But it’s her friendship with Bill, her lab partner, that stood out for me. So this is a mix between work as a scientist, information about botany and a young woman trying to carve a foothold for herself in a male dominated industry. This may not be for everyone but it was a very enjoyable and informative read for me."
251,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27078093-alice-lippart,4,Enjoyable and really interesting. Loved all the science!
252,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5637143-anna,2,"I'm very curious what other scientists, particularly women, think of this book. To me, the best writing in the book was in the short chapters about plants, even though some of the cool plant insights were already familiar to me since I've worked in plant labs for some years. The rest was uneven, tended toward telling instead of showing, and I think because of this the relationships come out feeling flat, even her relationship with Bill which is clearly important and meant to feel more three-dimensional. Overall, although I certainly support women in science telling their stories, this didn't live up to my expectations, not even close, and I would take Evelyn Fox Keller's 'A Feeling for the Organism' or Susan Brind Morrow's 'Wolves and Honey' or Lauren Redniss's 'Radioactive' over Lab Girl any day of the week. One more note: Jahren sometimes explicitly or implicitly gives the impression that there's one correct way to be a scientist: you have to be immediately driven forward by your failures, never discouraged by them, you have to be able to work for 48 hours straight, you have to have always known science is what you wanted. There is no one way to be a scientist: this is completely untrue, as it is untrue of any profession, and don't let it discourage you or any young girl you know from pursuing science."
253,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1881113-andrea,3,"Such a short book, but it took me forever to read it. I should have liked it more than I actually did. Hope Jahren's part-memoir, part-scientific reflection has humour, memorable personalities, fun educational material, and some truly moving recollections. The problem was that sometimes Jahren's could become too dramatic. I had the misfortune to listen to the audiobook while walking my dog, and I swear it made me want to pull my hair out. The teary, choking voice at the end of nearly every chapter that was supposed to make me feel emotions while the author dwelled in self-pity was like nails on chalkboard. I also went into the book thinking this would be more of a love letter to botany and some interesting findings the author discovered during her career (I never read blurbs), but instead I got mostly a memoir, interlaced some musings on plants that supported the mood for these memories. And this is officially the longest sentence I've ever written. Needless to say, I am sort of underwhelmed. If you are going to read Lab Girl, please avoid the audio, and be prepared for a lifetime worth of over-reactions to ordinary events. "

So I can't really fault Hope for telling her story. But I can caution potential readers: if you want to know what's it is like to be a scientist, don't rely on this book. This is just one story, and it is not at all typical. You don't have to work 80 hours per week to be a scientist. You can have a life AND be a scientist. If you're a student, you can find a grad advisor who cares about you and invests in your success and doesn't haze you when you first join the lab. In short, Future Scientists, don't be discouraged by reading this. Science takes all kinds, and life in science can be what you want it to be."

Rhythm and cycles permeate the narrative, bouncing between Hope Jahren's ups and downs as a career scientist, and the intricate lives of vegetation. I hadn't even read a synopsis before before I began, and was pleasantly surprised by the delicate unfolding of the book … made from paper, derived from intelligent trees … ~ Just Trust Me: In Praise Of Strange Books (All 3 are 5 star reads!)~Hope Jahren is a celebrated geochemist and geobiologist, not to mention an exceptionally interesting human being. Currently she works at the University of Oslo, and this book is her origin story.Jahren worked with her mother in the garden growing up, first sparking her love of growing things.“By the end of June the whole crop was well on its way and the world around us was so green that it seemed impossible that it could ever have been otherwise. By July, the sweating leaves of all these plants had pumped the air so full of moisture that the humidity caused the electrical lines to buzz and crackle overhead.” She also played in her father’s lab from a young age, inspiring her love for science and hunger to know how things work.“There I transformed from a girl into a scientist, just like Peter Parker becoming Spider-Man, only kind of backward.” Eventually, Jahren’s life intersects with a man named Bill, in a lab—where else? He becomes her loyal assistant, moving locations and building labs with her. There was one point where I kind of hoped they’d get together, but their relationship is unique and special—more like best friends or brother and sister.Did I mention the writing is beautiful? Jahren deals with mental illness and loneliness in such a heartfelt manner it’s impossible not to empathize alongside her. She reads the audiobook and you can hear the emotion in her voice, bleeding through the words. The tone remains positive and manages not to be depressing even when dealing with tough topics. There is hope, and the beauty of science unveiling new understanding to the world. The history and lives of trees are presented in a fascinating way, paralleling various aspects of human lives.If you enjoy plants and true tails of scientific superstars — this book is for you.Quotes:“She set her hair in curlers while listening to records of Carl Sandburg’s poems over and over, and instructed me on how to hear the words differently each time. After discovering Susan Sontag, she explained to me that even meaning itself is a constructed concept, and I learned how to nod and pretend to understand.” “Full-blown mania lets you see the other side of death. Its onset is profoundly visceral and unexpected, no matter how many times you’ve been through it. It is your body that first senses the urgency of a new world about to bloom. Your vertebrae seem to detach from one another and you elongate as if toward the sun’s light. You can’t hear above the sloshing roar of blood pushed through your head by some impossibly sustained orgasm within your beating heart. For the next twenty-four, forty-eight, seventy-two hours you will have to yell to hear yourself over this whooshing. Nothing, nothing can be loud enough or bright enough or move fast enough. The world appears as if through a fish-eye lens; your view is fuzzy with sparkling edges. You have received a grand, systemic injection of Novocain and your entire body tingles briefly before it becomes flaccidly foreign and unreal. Your raised arms are the fleshy petals of a magnificent lily bursting into flower. It deeply dawns on you that this new world about to bloom is you.” “There at the end of the world, he danced in the broad and endless daylight, and I accepted him for what he was, instead of what he wished he could be. The potency of my acceptance made me wonder, just a little, if I could turn it inward and accept myself.” "
257,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13977687-taryn,4,"This memoir could be subtitled “The Private Lives of Plants,” because paleobiologist Hope Jahren can’t help but wax poetic at times about her chosen field of study, with which she is clearly enraptured. Fortunately, she’s pretty convincing. Since my tastes run more toward gossipy tell-alls than science texts, my favorite parts of Lab Girl were Jahren's personal stories of her romance with her husband and decidedly unromantic relationship with her (occasionally homeless but forever loyal) research partner Bill. Amazingly enough, though, I didn't glaze over during the parts about trees and mosses. Jahren is one of those rare scientists able to express her enthusiasm for her subject in a way that translates to the average Jane. The audio version is read by Jahren herself, which makes the more emotional parts of the book ring with authenticity, but if you're bothered by soft, whispery voices, you might prefer to pick up this one in print. If you close your eyes, Jahren sounds just like Ana Gasteyer's character from the classic SNL sketch “Schweddy Balls.”More book recommendations by me at www.readingwithhippos.com"
258,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1291915-lauren,3,"The name of this book never worked for me - it didn't seem to capture what the book was about, and it is diminuitive in nature. Jahren is not a ""girl"", and this book is not cutesy, as the title, and even the cover art, would lead you to believe. Jahren's work in geobotany is fascinating, and I really enjoyed the interspersed chapters on plants, trees, natural history. The personal memoir sections were okay - they showed devotion and commitment to the science. I was frustrated with the roadblocks and glass ceilings that Jahren hit/endured as a female scientist, but I was also grew frustrated with Jahren for her continuous lack of foresight and planning, and the ways her actions (and inactions) impacted those around her. I know these symptoms are directly tied to her mental illness, and she writes about that with candor and bravery, and I do agree that we need more of this - normalizing, familiarizing. Thankfully, with time and experience, things did get better - for everyone. My favorite part was Jahren and Bill's time in the Arctic, digging up ancient trees. I really enjoyed that scene of Bill dancing, and her description of it. 3.5 stars"

Hope Jahren reads it herself and you can really feel the emotion as she tells you her life story. I always enjoy listening to women in science talk about their work and their experience navigating the field when especially in the past, men were lauded and revered for their accomplishments and women really had to fight for everything. The only thing I’d say which is entirely. a personal thing is that I don’t naturally gravitate toward her field and don’t find it super compelling but the way she told it made me infinitely more interested so no negatives there.

261,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115473-siria,3,"My rating for this book is a reflection not so much of my enjoyment of it as my acknowledgement of its importance. Hope Jahren is a successful female research scientist working within a STEM field that's still overwhelmingly male-dominated, a woman with mental illness who has been able to forge an academic career—voices like hers are too rarely heard in academia in general and STEM fields in particular. Jahren focuses less on the highs of her career (she's won multiple Fulbrights, for instance, but I'm not sure that she even mentions that in the book) than she does on the lows and even more so the monotonous middle: the antisocial hours spent doing repetitive prep work in the lab, the constant scrabble to secure funding, the gauntlet of aggressions (micro and macro) faced by women in academia.However, for all Jahren's ability to be very upfront about her experiences (she clearly prides herself on her bluntness), Lab Girl is the kind of memoir that suffers from the author's lack of self-awareness. Although I'm not in a STEM field, I am a woman in academia, and so I'm quite familiar with other women (almost always white women) like Jahren: women for whom sexism is odious inasmuch as it affects them, but who care not one jot about systemic sexism or how it affects other women. Almost the only women to feature in the book are Jahren and her mother (who is treated with a hostility which I find inexplicable, given that nothing in the behaviour attributed to her seems particularly egregious or all that different from that ascribed to Jahren's beloved father), and I was almost surprised to end a book not having encountered a paragraph in which Jahren explains why she's Not Like the Other Girls. More overtly jarring were Jahren's descriptions of her interactions with students and the means by which she ""trains in"" new graduate students. If these were the anecdotes she thought made her look like a competent instructor, I'm hoping her grad students have insurance which lets them access a good therapist—or failing that, that they have access to a steady supply of palatable beer. Don't haze your students! Don't pass on fucked-up measures of academic ""worth"" to students just because academia is messed up and most graduate advisors don't know pedagogical theory from a hole in the wall!Listening to this as an audiobook was also a mistake. Jahren's talents are undoubtedly many, but acting out even her own words is not one she possesses. The vocal quivering and gulping she employed were distracting and maudlin; it was like listening to an audiobook from the Victorian period. Listening to the audiobook version also made the section set in Ireland extra obnoxious to me (an Irishwoman), and retroactively made me question the trustworthiness of great swathes of the book. The most egregious example of this is when Jahren describes getting lost in Limerick City, and attributes this to the fact that all of the street signs are in Irish. (Now, I've heard Americans mangle Irish over the years, but never so comprehensively as Hope Jahren. I honestly asked myself if she'd just spoken in Klingon, had to go look up the text of the book on Google Books, and then shrieked at the realisation that she was trying to say ""Sráid Eibhlín.) Here's the thing: street signs in Ireland are bilingual, with the English-language text generally appearing in larger font, and the Irish-language version smaller and in italics. There's no way that Jahren was lost and distractedly trying to figure out where ""Sráid Eibhlín"" was; she had to have known all along that she was on Ellen Street. This might seem like nitpicking, but such an obvious twisting of the truth—whether in service of a little bit of drama or getting an extra bit of comedy out of the Weird Irish—felt like the literary version of the bad scientific practice of p-hacking."
262,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13126933-lata,5,"This was excellent. From the beautiful writing about her family, or of her struggles with building and maintaining a lab, or her long friendship with colleague Bill, or of her struggles with bipolar disorder, or the lyrical sections about plant life, I thoroughly enjoyed this memoir. I was fascinated, and listened, rapt, though the many events of Hope Jahren's life, and I learned some great things too, about the glorious plants on this planet that we couldn't exist without."
263,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/99765491-jimz,3,"I give this memoir 3 stars. Pros:•	Her descriptions of how plants and trees grow were in general fabulous. Terribly complicated biology and she was able to describe it in language that was not condescending but just was utterly fascinating. She explained a number of biological phenomena throughout the book and her explanations in most cases at least for me were just at about the right length...long enough so I could understand the basic phenomenon but not so long as to make me lose interest. So kudos to her for that. •	Her descriptions of her mania and depression were scary-sad. It’s obvious she had some major hurdles in her life that her own body were creating for her…I am glad that she is at the position she is at today… Her troubles reminded me of the memoir, An Unquiet Mind, by Kay Redfield Jamison, a psychologist who herself had bipolar disorder (which I highly recommend GR folks to read). •	Dr. Jahren’s description of growing up and her going to her father’s lab was quite interesting, as well as the family dynamics (and sometimes lack thereof….there was not a lot of overt affection that her parents showed her apparently and she also was not close to her brothers). In a later part of the book she made a comment that “I didn’t know if I was crying because I was nobody’s wife or mother – or because I felt like nobody’s daughter–…”. So it appeared she had next to no relationship with her family after she left home for grad school and beyond, yet there is this book dedication which seemed odd at least to me: “Everything I write is dedicated to my mother.”•	Her description of academia is for the most part (I am in and come from academia) realistic. She for many a year lived on what is called “soft money” in which her lab was dependent on governmental grants. “Her lab” means her salary and her assistants’ salaries and money needed to conduct her experiments. One is always having to write research grants (with no guarantee that a particular grant will ever get funded), because the money always seems to be running out. And that’s OK in a way…there is no free lunch…but still it is stressful not only for principal investigators but those working for them (in this memoir for example, Bill her lab manager).Cons:•	The book was way too long for its own good. •	Some of the long drawn-out conversations between her and her comrade-in-arms Bill that she relates to us could have been either shortened or deleted. She wrote the conversations in a verbatim style as if they just happened yesterday when in many instances the conversations happened in the late 1990s or early 2000s. Some of the conversations were “dopey” for lack of a better word – people just do not talk like that. •	I really did not like Bill. Just my problem I guess. He appeared to be satisfied working 80-hour weeks, not having a life outside of the lab, working apparently at times on starvation wages, literally living in the lab building at times, living in a van… She portrays him as some sort of hero to her…he never grew on me. To me he had an anti-social personality. And he sure swore a lot. •	She is introducing us to a scientific field, plant biology, and she does a fantastic job. But there was one part of the book that just got me pissed off. It’s when she and her lab visited a place that housed monkeys called the Monkey Jungle. And what she did, as an esteemed scientist, was anthropomorphize the primates to an extent in which it was in one respect laughable (not funny laughable), but in another respect a disservice to both the animals and to science (“…she saw in Monkey Jungle a doppelganger for her lab”). “…Two small squirrel monkeys seemed to be trapped in their own private Samuel Beckett play, caught in a web made of equal parts dependence and loathing. … A single howler monkey sat high on a branch in the back, wailing out the entire Book of Job in his native tongue while periodically raising his arms in an age-old supplication for an explanation as to why the righteous must suffer.” Went beyond the pale for me.Reviews:https://www.theguardian.com/books/201... https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/29/bo...

And so we will keep working as another day dawns and this week turns into next week, and then this month becomes next month.

I am more like an ant, driven to find and carry single dead needles, one after the other, all the way across the forest and then add them one by one to a pile so massive that I can only fully imagine one small corner of it.'

That's a lot coming from me. As much as I can appreciate nature, I'm far from being outdoorsy, with my city living and my rampant fear of bugs. Hope Jahren allows us all to feel like we have that curiosity inside us to be scientists in our own lives, in small but by no means insignificant ways. She burns with such infectious passion for her work that you can't help but be drawn in too. The book's journey is divided lovingly into: Roots and Leaves, Wood and Knots, and Flowers and Fruit, with individual chapters then going into her work and rhapsodies of the wonder of nature that it all around us (have you looked at a leaf lately and thought about how miraculous it is?), then somehow works it all in with her personal life and her relationship with Bill, which is utterly undefinable in the most wonderful of ways. Here's one of the many, many plant-related passages that I loved, which described not just nature but her and Bill:'Why are they together, the tree and the fungus? We don't know. The fungus could certainly live very well alone almost anywhere, but it chooses to entwine itself with the tree over an easier and more independent life. It has adapted to seek the rush of pure sweetness that comes directly from a plant root, such a strange and concentrated compound, unlike anything to be found elsewhere in the forest. And perhaps the fungus can somehow sense that when it is part of a symbiosis, it is also not alone.' (p. 105)I suppose a caveat is in order: for those readers who aren't too interested in the science, it can be a bit tedious and may lose you a bit if you haven't been in a science class since high school, however the enthusiasm and dedication that Jahren has will win you over. I felt comforted reading about all her experiments out in the fields and how meticulously everything had to be done, and then rejoiced when results came through that led to conclusions and consequently, more funding! You'll root (ha!) for her and Bill every step of the way. She's also quite honest about her struggles, not just at work but at home as well, which I didn't expect. It's very difficult to admit to desperate times when you can't see what's ahead of you, or loneliness, much less mental health struggles. I appreciated the book even more for Jahren's willingness to talk about all this and the vulnerability that comes with it. A very moving memoir. It may surprise you how much you will want to read about the inner workings and patience of a seed, or how the surprisingly softness of spongy moss led to a way of finding solid people to work with, until you pick this up, and then it doesn't. It just feels right to see the world like this."

When I saw it on the new book shelf at the library I brought it home with me.""Each beginning is the end of a waiting. We are each given exactly one chance to be. Each of us is both impossible and inevitable. Every replete tree was first a seed that waited.""Jahren has faced many challenges: a lonely childhood, working herself through school, struggling as a female scientist against the prejudices of a male dominated field, finding funding for her projects. Her success can be verified by her choice as one of Time's 100 Most Influential People, her Fulbright Scholarships, and her long relationship with her lab partner Bill. She found love and faced a difficult pregnancy sans medication for her bipolar disorder to have the child that changed her life.""I have learned that raising a child is essentially one long, slow agony of letting go.""Jahren's writing is so lovely to read. Her love of her work as a geobioloist and her awe of nature shines through the pages. She alternates chapters on her life with chapters about the world of green growing things around us.The self-portrait Jahren paints reveals her personal challenges and insecurities without being confessional and raw. Her lab partner/best friend/soul mate Bill is interesting and complicated, eccentric and brilliant. He once lived in a hole in his parent's back yard. We come to love him as much as Jahren does. We are happy when her loneliness is ended by marrying a man who 'gets her.'To read a section of the book go to http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/boo...To read an interview with Jahren go to http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/the-se..."
266,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3788241-elena,5,"In my mind, a great memoir has you singing along with the writer when she is happy, and aching with her when she is sad. Hope Jahren's excellent memoir Lab Girl does just that. Jahren intersperses stories about plants with stories about science with stories about her own life in a way that is masterful and utterly engaging. I didn't expect to enjoy reading about plants or to learn about them (I'm an ecologist) but I found myself loving those sections. Jahren's unique insights into why it is important to understand how plants grow add a fascinating layer to what in lesser hands might have been 'just biology'. The stories about science illuminate how science really works - what it takes to get money to do the work, and how it all really unfolds in the lab. And the stories about Jahren's life and how her choices led her to be the person she is bring the book together as a complete whole.As Heather says, this is a book for those who love science or memoir. But it is also a book for all those who simply love well-crafted stories about courageous lives and courageous women and learning how to be a good person in a complex world.  "
267,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/714583-anita-pomerantz,5,"Fascinating read that is hard to parse. Is it about a female scientist? A relationship between a man and a woman like no other? Manic depression? Botany?The author really holds nothing back in this memoir, and I found Hope to be pretty fascinating. She's nerdy and mentally ill and loving and a workaholic. She is an incredible scientist and a tremendous writer. For me, the highlight of this book is her description of her relationship with her lab employee (partner?), Bill. I couldn't decide what to make of it. Were they in love? Like siblings? Just great colleagues with a shared passion for the work? Whatever it is/was, it was very interesting.In addition, the structure of the book is well done. The reader alternately learns something about plant life, and then the subsequent chapter highlights parallels in human life. I have little science background, but thought most of the explanations were clear and educational. I imagine Hope is an excellent teacher, with the ability to both be engaging and impart knowledge at the same time.Really, almost a five star read for me."
268,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19126246-kaitlin,0,"I ended up DNF-ing this one at 200pages in (which I know is fairly close to the end). I actually loved the science-y bits of this, where the author shows her flair for studying plants, her passion for their care, and also her stunning ability to write beautifully about them. However, although I think these sections were great, Hope Jahren's actual backstory and the way she wrote about her journey just didn't 'click' with me and I found it super hard to connect or relate at all. This really took me out of the book and so ultimately I was forcing myself to pick it up, and that's no fun, so I just decided it was time to put it down and give it to someone else who may enjoy it far more. Ah well. "
269,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4059160-amy,5,"Jahren's book is full of passion and love for her family, friends and work. It is a memoir of sorts with the life cycle of a tree interspersed with her own stories. A fantastic read!"
270,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/260116-janb,5,"I finished this memoir a few days ago and in trying to get my thoughts together for a review, I read what my GR friends said about the book, and I realized it's all been said and said so much better and eloquently than I could.So I'll just say I loved it. I listened to the audiobook, read by the author , and she does an excellent job. I loved hearing about her life and passion as a scientist, her illness (bipolar), her quirky friend Bill, her marriage, motherhood, and yes, I even loved the science-y parts. I'll never look at a tree the same and I now have even more respect for research scientists.Highly recommended."
271,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4271946-jessica-woodbury,4,"I waited for a long time to read this book even though it came highly recommended from several scientists. I was skeptical about the title. And while I am not a scientist by profession, I did train as an undergrad and earn a BS. The thing about scientists is we are very territorial. I am a Chemist. My Physicist friends say, ""But Chemistry is all Physics!"" and they are not entirely wrong. I often scoff at Biology, Botany, Zoology, etc. and say, ""But you're ignoring all the Chemistry!"" So the Botany angle here did not move it up my TBR list.But. As a baby scientist myself, and as someone who spent several years married to a scientist during his PhD and basically lived and breathed lab culture, ultimately I couldn't stay away. I had to see what all the fuss about and I had to see if Jahren got it right. Many people don't. If you are intimidated by a very scientific read, don't be afraid. Jahren's years of teaching experience have clearly created someone who is skilled at turning complex scientific processes and ideas into easily digestible narratives. If you are concerned it will not be scientific enough, there's enough interesting data here to sate you, though I did wish I learned more about Jahren's own research.The thing about this book, though, the thing that makes it one of my favorites of the year isn't just that Jahren gets lab life right, it's how skillfully she tells the stories of trees alongside her own story. I have never ever cared about a tree more than I did during this book. And I was lucky enough to listen to the audio (read beautifully by Jahren herself) while I drove past the blazing autumn leaves of New England, so every tree seemed somehow magical. If someone had taught me about plants the way Jahren does, where it is not just a process to learn and a life cycle to memorize, but where every single step along the way is a miracle in and of itself, I can see myself seriously considering Botany as a potential major. This book in the hands of a college student could be life changing.Some may find Jahren's story not interesting enough for a memoir. But this is not a memoir that is built around a journey. It is showing you who she is, and a big part of it focuses on the incredibly close relationship she has with her lab partner, Bill. While they mean absolutely everything to one another, they are not intimate friends, not secret sharers, not confidants. Learning the rhythms of their conversation and the routines of their friendship will show you the kind of relationship you probably haven't seen before. Jahren covers many things here besides science. Parenthood, the chill Scandinavian traditions of the Midwest, the slog of early academic life, and her own struggle with bipolar disorder. Her writing is simple but deliberate and lovely. I enjoyed every moment listening to her read. "
272,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10001905-lynn,0,"My first thoughts, this book is in a word, odd. It is a memoir written by a bipolar paleobiologist and her Asperger’s like, one-handed best friend/lab assistant. They stumble through the US and Europe trying to do good science. The book is about three things. 1. Science: we learn about the scientific method, how a mass spectrometer works, and that trees have memory (all of which was much more interesting than I would have thought). 2. Love and Family: in all its permutations, good/bad, expressed/unexpressed, chosen/not chosen. 3. Academia: a close and accurate look at the tarnished Ivory tower with tales of sexism, cut throat competition, and the never ending search for money. Despite her struggles, she becomes an award winning and accomplished scholar with her best friend by her side. My final thoughts: this book is in a word, captivating. "
273,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5159766-l-a-starks,5,"What a shame this utterly amazing book has such a lame title. My advice is to forget the title and read the book. Jahren, a three-time Fulbright winner, has written a reader-friendly, relationship-centered sequence of stories about her experience as a paleobotany researcher. There is much to learn and Jahren doesn't shrink from explaining it. However, the terms and structure are highly accessible. The book is one of those rare fusions of science and humanity that many readers so often wish for but can seldom find. The reason is simple--it takes a polymath like Ms. Jahren to understand and love the labwork and yet also be able to explain it to non-scientists. This is the biology class--really much more--you wish you'd experienced. At the same time, Jahren is clear about the difficulties of an academic scientist's life--getting grants, writing proposals, acquiring equipment, paying lab assistants, the necessity of moving on to better opportunities. She writes with joy about marriage, her son, her struggle with bipolarity, and most of all about her talented, brilliant assistant, Bill.About the title: this is apparently the season of ""The Girl Who..."" after the success of The Girl on the Train. Unfortunately, ""Lab GIRL"" is diminutive, and diminishes, the complex, warm, fascinating PhD scientist we meet in its pages. I wish the publishers had worked harder to come up with a title that better represents this story. "
274,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6677659-marchpane,3,"An uneven read for me. Loved the science-y bits, found the personal memoir sections either tedious or grating. "
275,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3965659-rachel,2,"This is a textbook case of 'it's not you, it's me.' I understand the appeal, and in a lot of ways I'm thrilled about this book's mainstream success (women in STEM fields and healthy, platonic relationships between men and women are two things we need more of in media), but there were only so many loving descriptions of trees I could take after a while. There was just too much science and not enough human interest to keep me engaged, and while I wouldn't say you need to be knowledgeable about biology to approach this book, a certain amount of interest would be helpful, and I just don't have that, at all. And the audiobook was a mistake; the author narrates it with a positively bizarre amount of melodrama (like, actually in tears at multiple points, and I'm sorry if that makes me sound callous but I really don't react well to overly sentimental narration), so I can't say it was a pleasant listening experience... But anyway, really not a bad book, just not my kind of book."
276,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56398848-nisa,5,"Firstly i want to thank Elyse for recommending this book and letting me have a chance to read it :)Hope firstly began with her childhood and then suddenly make a jumb to her recent life (to introduce herself but kept it short) in lab with Bill (of course they can't be thought apart :)) It was nice in the beginning but after she met with Bill and they began to work together in her lab it's like everything fell into place and real story began. When she told about her studies it was not boring but interesting some of them was long but she kept its length good enough and she shared with us interesting facts about plants. First i began listening this novel as an audio book but because when i listened i kept lost track when i came places she talks about her studies (they are not in my domain and English is my second language and i'm not good enough to listen everything) after that i bought it as an e book and went on by reading.If i think as a whole i loved this book and i loved the way she finished it. But if i talk about its part some part was boring, some exiting and make me happy, sad and worried (I want to say life is not so different). When Hope writing about her life she was so sincere and because of that when she was happy i was happy with her, and worried about her when she feel desperate. I think she is so good at telling her life story and i want to that everything would be good for her. I loved her and the way she tells her story but mostly and all i loved Bill and his answers (I usually marked what he said). In addition i think i love more Bill because she loved (as an important friend) Bill more than herself. And i would love to have friendship like theirs . ""He is strong where I am weak, and so together we make one complete person, each of us gaining half of what we need from the world and the other half from each other."" this is the way she describe their friendship with her words.Here the things that Bill said and make me laugh :)This conversation happened when Hope and Bill met first time. She was assisting a lecture that in this class students need to dig earth. She realize he was digging alone and he cought attention of her""I stood there and watched him dig for a while, and began to notice the uncommonly large amount of earth that he was moving with each shovelful and the implied strength that must have accompanied his wiry frame. I also noticed that he was digging with something that looked like an old harpoon flattened at one end – a sword beaten into a real plowshare.""“Where did you get that shovel?” I asked, figuring it was from the pile of junk I had hauled out of the department’s equipment locker, which had been located in the basement next to an old coal hull. “It’s mine,” he said. “Don’t judge it until you’ve dug a mile in its shoes.” “You mean you brought your own shovel from home?” I laughed in friendly surprise and delight. “Hell yes,” he affirmed. “I wasn’t going to leave this thing unattended for six weeks.” “I like your thinking,” I replied.And this one when they go to monkey jungle and when he said that he was looking a monkey it seems shocked as much as him. ""Bill finally stated, without redirecting his stare, “It’s like looking in a fucking mirror.”""Well if i share all of them this review will be too long and i would be more happy if you decide to read and see for yourself :)) Have a great week. :))"
277,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17951043-perri,4,"I love a book that educates me in a non-painful way. Jahren alternates chapters between her journey as a scientist and her knowledge and passion for botany. Of special interest to me was reading about the difficulties she faced especially as a Research Botanist. Some readers in my book club found her whiny, but I thought she was just being honest in her struggles with an antiseptic upbringing, mental illness, and sexist road blocks from being a woman in a male dominated fields. I learned it takes a really special person to do research experiments.The tension to me of mind numbing monotonous tasks coupled with the stringent standards of proof, well let's just say it's not a field for most people. Added to that is the constant struggle for adequate funding. I found it quite enjoyable with bonus botanic bits."
278,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6787827-linda,4,"I bought this book because it was a good deal, wondering if I would ever read it. What a surprise! It is a great combination of life and science. I found it very interesting and will never look at trees or plants in the same way."
279,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8024272-kasia,4,I might never look at a trees and plants the same way. Seriously thinking about planting my own oak tree on the back yard and watch it grow. 
280,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6449756-sonja-arlow,3,"3 1/2 starsI have always had a love of medicine and science (all though my high school results on science may tell another story) so I was immediately drawn to this book.Hope grew up in her father’s laboratory surrounded by Bunsen burners, petri dishes and access to everything a curious child my want to investigate in a lab. It’s not surprising that she was brought up in an academically focused household and even her mother studied part time and included her daughter in her learning process.I really appreciated the fact that all the experiments or processes in the book was explained so that any person no matter how unenlightened about science, could grasp the concepts.”My laboratory is like a church because it is where I figure out what I believe”I loved reading about her part-time work at a local hospital while studying – it gave me glimpses of the nuts and bolts of running a hospital and more than once I wished that she had become a doctor rather than a botanist.My feelings towards flora is neither here nor there so naturally some of the chapters dealing with the workings of plants didn’t really interest me but one thing came across crystal clear and that is her absolute passion about what she does for a living.  “I will never stop being ravenously hungry for science, no matter how well it feeds me”I also found the sections dealing with just how difficult it is to secure funding for scientific projects are as well as glimpses on Hope dealing with her bi-polar disease, eye-opening. But it’s her friendship with Bill, her lab partner, that stood out for me. So this is a mix between work as a scientist, information about botany and a young woman trying to carve a foothold for herself in a male dominated industry. This may not be for everyone but it was a very enjoyable and informative read for me."
281,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27078093-alice-lippart,4,Enjoyable and really interesting. Loved all the science!
282,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5637143-anna,2,"I'm very curious what other scientists, particularly women, think of this book. To me, the best writing in the book was in the short chapters about plants, even though some of the cool plant insights were already familiar to me since I've worked in plant labs for some years. The rest was uneven, tended toward telling instead of showing, and I think because of this the relationships come out feeling flat, even her relationship with Bill which is clearly important and meant to feel more three-dimensional. Overall, although I certainly support women in science telling their stories, this didn't live up to my expectations, not even close, and I would take Evelyn Fox Keller's 'A Feeling for the Organism' or Susan Brind Morrow's 'Wolves and Honey' or Lauren Redniss's 'Radioactive' over Lab Girl any day of the week. One more note: Jahren sometimes explicitly or implicitly gives the impression that there's one correct way to be a scientist: you have to be immediately driven forward by your failures, never discouraged by them, you have to be able to work for 48 hours straight, you have to have always known science is what you wanted. There is no one way to be a scientist: this is completely untrue, as it is untrue of any profession, and don't let it discourage you or any young girl you know from pursuing science."
283,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1881113-andrea,3,"Such a short book, but it took me forever to read it. I should have liked it more than I actually did. Hope Jahren's part-memoir, part-scientific reflection has humour, memorable personalities, fun educational material, and some truly moving recollections. The problem was that sometimes Jahren's could become too dramatic. I had the misfortune to listen to the audiobook while walking my dog, and I swear it made me want to pull my hair out. The teary, choking voice at the end of nearly every chapter that was supposed to make me feel emotions while the author dwelled in self-pity was like nails on chalkboard. I also went into the book thinking this would be more of a love letter to botany and some interesting findings the author discovered during her career (I never read blurbs), but instead I got mostly a memoir, interlaced some musings on plants that supported the mood for these memories. And this is officially the longest sentence I've ever written. Needless to say, I am sort of underwhelmed. If you are going to read Lab Girl, please avoid the audio, and be prepared for a lifetime worth of over-reactions to ordinary events. "

So I can't really fault Hope for telling her story. But I can caution potential readers: if you want to know what's it is like to be a scientist, don't rely on this book. This is just one story, and it is not at all typical. You don't have to work 80 hours per week to be a scientist. You can have a life AND be a scientist. If you're a student, you can find a grad advisor who cares about you and invests in your success and doesn't haze you when you first join the lab. In short, Future Scientists, don't be discouraged by reading this. Science takes all kinds, and life in science can be what you want it to be."

Rhythm and cycles permeate the narrative, bouncing between Hope Jahren's ups and downs as a career scientist, and the intricate lives of vegetation. I hadn't even read a synopsis before before I began, and was pleasantly surprised by the delicate unfolding of the book … made from paper, derived from intelligent trees … ~ Just Trust Me: In Praise Of Strange Books (All 3 are 5 star reads!)~Hope Jahren is a celebrated geochemist and geobiologist, not to mention an exceptionally interesting human being. Currently she works at the University of Oslo, and this book is her origin story.Jahren worked with her mother in the garden growing up, first sparking her love of growing things.“By the end of June the whole crop was well on its way and the world around us was so green that it seemed impossible that it could ever have been otherwise. By July, the sweating leaves of all these plants had pumped the air so full of moisture that the humidity caused the electrical lines to buzz and crackle overhead.” She also played in her father’s lab from a young age, inspiring her love for science and hunger to know how things work.“There I transformed from a girl into a scientist, just like Peter Parker becoming Spider-Man, only kind of backward.” Eventually, Jahren’s life intersects with a man named Bill, in a lab—where else? He becomes her loyal assistant, moving locations and building labs with her. There was one point where I kind of hoped they’d get together, but their relationship is unique and special—more like best friends or brother and sister.Did I mention the writing is beautiful? Jahren deals with mental illness and loneliness in such a heartfelt manner it’s impossible not to empathize alongside her. She reads the audiobook and you can hear the emotion in her voice, bleeding through the words. The tone remains positive and manages not to be depressing even when dealing with tough topics. There is hope, and the beauty of science unveiling new understanding to the world. The history and lives of trees are presented in a fascinating way, paralleling various aspects of human lives.If you enjoy plants and true tails of scientific superstars — this book is for you.Quotes:“She set her hair in curlers while listening to records of Carl Sandburg’s poems over and over, and instructed me on how to hear the words differently each time. After discovering Susan Sontag, she explained to me that even meaning itself is a constructed concept, and I learned how to nod and pretend to understand.” “Full-blown mania lets you see the other side of death. Its onset is profoundly visceral and unexpected, no matter how many times you’ve been through it. It is your body that first senses the urgency of a new world about to bloom. Your vertebrae seem to detach from one another and you elongate as if toward the sun’s light. You can’t hear above the sloshing roar of blood pushed through your head by some impossibly sustained orgasm within your beating heart. For the next twenty-four, forty-eight, seventy-two hours you will have to yell to hear yourself over this whooshing. Nothing, nothing can be loud enough or bright enough or move fast enough. The world appears as if through a fish-eye lens; your view is fuzzy with sparkling edges. You have received a grand, systemic injection of Novocain and your entire body tingles briefly before it becomes flaccidly foreign and unreal. Your raised arms are the fleshy petals of a magnificent lily bursting into flower. It deeply dawns on you that this new world about to bloom is you.” “There at the end of the world, he danced in the broad and endless daylight, and I accepted him for what he was, instead of what he wished he could be. The potency of my acceptance made me wonder, just a little, if I could turn it inward and accept myself.” "
287,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13977687-taryn,4,"This memoir could be subtitled “The Private Lives of Plants,” because paleobiologist Hope Jahren can’t help but wax poetic at times about her chosen field of study, with which she is clearly enraptured. Fortunately, she’s pretty convincing. Since my tastes run more toward gossipy tell-alls than science texts, my favorite parts of Lab Girl were Jahren's personal stories of her romance with her husband and decidedly unromantic relationship with her (occasionally homeless but forever loyal) research partner Bill. Amazingly enough, though, I didn't glaze over during the parts about trees and mosses. Jahren is one of those rare scientists able to express her enthusiasm for her subject in a way that translates to the average Jane. The audio version is read by Jahren herself, which makes the more emotional parts of the book ring with authenticity, but if you're bothered by soft, whispery voices, you might prefer to pick up this one in print. If you close your eyes, Jahren sounds just like Ana Gasteyer's character from the classic SNL sketch “Schweddy Balls.”More book recommendations by me at www.readingwithhippos.com"
288,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1291915-lauren,3,"The name of this book never worked for me - it didn't seem to capture what the book was about, and it is diminuitive in nature. Jahren is not a ""girl"", and this book is not cutesy, as the title, and even the cover art, would lead you to believe. Jahren's work in geobotany is fascinating, and I really enjoyed the interspersed chapters on plants, trees, natural history. The personal memoir sections were okay - they showed devotion and commitment to the science. I was frustrated with the roadblocks and glass ceilings that Jahren hit/endured as a female scientist, but I was also grew frustrated with Jahren for her continuous lack of foresight and planning, and the ways her actions (and inactions) impacted those around her. I know these symptoms are directly tied to her mental illness, and she writes about that with candor and bravery, and I do agree that we need more of this - normalizing, familiarizing. Thankfully, with time and experience, things did get better - for everyone. My favorite part was Jahren and Bill's time in the Arctic, digging up ancient trees. I really enjoyed that scene of Bill dancing, and her description of it. 3.5 stars"

Hope Jahren reads it herself and you can really feel the emotion as she tells you her life story. I always enjoy listening to women in science talk about their work and their experience navigating the field when especially in the past, men were lauded and revered for their accomplishments and women really had to fight for everything. The only thing I’d say which is entirely. a personal thing is that I don’t naturally gravitate toward her field and don’t find it super compelling but the way she told it made me infinitely more interested so no negatives there.

291,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115473-siria,3,"My rating for this book is a reflection not so much of my enjoyment of it as my acknowledgement of its importance. Hope Jahren is a successful female research scientist working within a STEM field that's still overwhelmingly male-dominated, a woman with mental illness who has been able to forge an academic career—voices like hers are too rarely heard in academia in general and STEM fields in particular. Jahren focuses less on the highs of her career (she's won multiple Fulbrights, for instance, but I'm not sure that she even mentions that in the book) than she does on the lows and even more so the monotonous middle: the antisocial hours spent doing repetitive prep work in the lab, the constant scrabble to secure funding, the gauntlet of aggressions (micro and macro) faced by women in academia.However, for all Jahren's ability to be very upfront about her experiences (she clearly prides herself on her bluntness), Lab Girl is the kind of memoir that suffers from the author's lack of self-awareness. Although I'm not in a STEM field, I am a woman in academia, and so I'm quite familiar with other women (almost always white women) like Jahren: women for whom sexism is odious inasmuch as it affects them, but who care not one jot about systemic sexism or how it affects other women. Almost the only women to feature in the book are Jahren and her mother (who is treated with a hostility which I find inexplicable, given that nothing in the behaviour attributed to her seems particularly egregious or all that different from that ascribed to Jahren's beloved father), and I was almost surprised to end a book not having encountered a paragraph in which Jahren explains why she's Not Like the Other Girls. More overtly jarring were Jahren's descriptions of her interactions with students and the means by which she ""trains in"" new graduate students. If these were the anecdotes she thought made her look like a competent instructor, I'm hoping her grad students have insurance which lets them access a good therapist—or failing that, that they have access to a steady supply of palatable beer. Don't haze your students! Don't pass on fucked-up measures of academic ""worth"" to students just because academia is messed up and most graduate advisors don't know pedagogical theory from a hole in the wall!Listening to this as an audiobook was also a mistake. Jahren's talents are undoubtedly many, but acting out even her own words is not one she possesses. The vocal quivering and gulping she employed were distracting and maudlin; it was like listening to an audiobook from the Victorian period. Listening to the audiobook version also made the section set in Ireland extra obnoxious to me (an Irishwoman), and retroactively made me question the trustworthiness of great swathes of the book. The most egregious example of this is when Jahren describes getting lost in Limerick City, and attributes this to the fact that all of the street signs are in Irish. (Now, I've heard Americans mangle Irish over the years, but never so comprehensively as Hope Jahren. I honestly asked myself if she'd just spoken in Klingon, had to go look up the text of the book on Google Books, and then shrieked at the realisation that she was trying to say ""Sráid Eibhlín.) Here's the thing: street signs in Ireland are bilingual, with the English-language text generally appearing in larger font, and the Irish-language version smaller and in italics. There's no way that Jahren was lost and distractedly trying to figure out where ""Sráid Eibhlín"" was; she had to have known all along that she was on Ellen Street. This might seem like nitpicking, but such an obvious twisting of the truth—whether in service of a little bit of drama or getting an extra bit of comedy out of the Weird Irish—felt like the literary version of the bad scientific practice of p-hacking."
292,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13126933-lata,5,"This was excellent. From the beautiful writing about her family, or of her struggles with building and maintaining a lab, or her long friendship with colleague Bill, or of her struggles with bipolar disorder, or the lyrical sections about plant life, I thoroughly enjoyed this memoir. I was fascinated, and listened, rapt, though the many events of Hope Jahren's life, and I learned some great things too, about the glorious plants on this planet that we couldn't exist without."
293,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/99765491-jimz,3,"I give this memoir 3 stars. Pros:•	Her descriptions of how plants and trees grow were in general fabulous. Terribly complicated biology and she was able to describe it in language that was not condescending but just was utterly fascinating. She explained a number of biological phenomena throughout the book and her explanations in most cases at least for me were just at about the right length...long enough so I could understand the basic phenomenon but not so long as to make me lose interest. So kudos to her for that. •	Her descriptions of her mania and depression were scary-sad. It’s obvious she had some major hurdles in her life that her own body were creating for her…I am glad that she is at the position she is at today… Her troubles reminded me of the memoir, An Unquiet Mind, by Kay Redfield Jamison, a psychologist who herself had bipolar disorder (which I highly recommend GR folks to read). •	Dr. Jahren’s description of growing up and her going to her father’s lab was quite interesting, as well as the family dynamics (and sometimes lack thereof….there was not a lot of overt affection that her parents showed her apparently and she also was not close to her brothers). In a later part of the book she made a comment that “I didn’t know if I was crying because I was nobody’s wife or mother – or because I felt like nobody’s daughter–…”. So it appeared she had next to no relationship with her family after she left home for grad school and beyond, yet there is this book dedication which seemed odd at least to me: “Everything I write is dedicated to my mother.”•	Her description of academia is for the most part (I am in and come from academia) realistic. She for many a year lived on what is called “soft money” in which her lab was dependent on governmental grants. “Her lab” means her salary and her assistants’ salaries and money needed to conduct her experiments. One is always having to write research grants (with no guarantee that a particular grant will ever get funded), because the money always seems to be running out. And that’s OK in a way…there is no free lunch…but still it is stressful not only for principal investigators but those working for them (in this memoir for example, Bill her lab manager).Cons:•	The book was way too long for its own good. •	Some of the long drawn-out conversations between her and her comrade-in-arms Bill that she relates to us could have been either shortened or deleted. She wrote the conversations in a verbatim style as if they just happened yesterday when in many instances the conversations happened in the late 1990s or early 2000s. Some of the conversations were “dopey” for lack of a better word – people just do not talk like that. •	I really did not like Bill. Just my problem I guess. He appeared to be satisfied working 80-hour weeks, not having a life outside of the lab, working apparently at times on starvation wages, literally living in the lab building at times, living in a van… She portrays him as some sort of hero to her…he never grew on me. To me he had an anti-social personality. And he sure swore a lot. •	She is introducing us to a scientific field, plant biology, and she does a fantastic job. But there was one part of the book that just got me pissed off. It’s when she and her lab visited a place that housed monkeys called the Monkey Jungle. And what she did, as an esteemed scientist, was anthropomorphize the primates to an extent in which it was in one respect laughable (not funny laughable), but in another respect a disservice to both the animals and to science (“…she saw in Monkey Jungle a doppelganger for her lab”). “…Two small squirrel monkeys seemed to be trapped in their own private Samuel Beckett play, caught in a web made of equal parts dependence and loathing. … A single howler monkey sat high on a branch in the back, wailing out the entire Book of Job in his native tongue while periodically raising his arms in an age-old supplication for an explanation as to why the righteous must suffer.” Went beyond the pale for me.Reviews:https://www.theguardian.com/books/201... https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/29/bo...

And so we will keep working as another day dawns and this week turns into next week, and then this month becomes next month. I can feel the warmth of the same brilliant sun that shines above the forest and onto the green world, but in my heart I know that I am not a plant. I am more like an ant, driven to find and carry single dead needles, one after the other, all the way across the forest and then add them one by one to a pile so massive that I can only fully imagine one small corner of it.' (p. 277)This book was such a joy. A part memoir, part ode to plant life and the grind of a scientist, written so engagingly that you can't help but feel ready to kick off your shoes, then step right into the soil to collect some samples to label the next thousand times over. That's a lot coming from me. As much as I can appreciate nature, I'm far from being outdoorsy, with my city living and my rampant fear of bugs. Hope Jahren allows us all to feel like we have that curiosity inside us to be scientists in our own lives, in small but by no means insignificant ways. She burns with such infectious passion for her work that you can't help but be drawn in too. The book's journey is divided lovingly into: Roots and Leaves, Wood and Knots, and Flowers and Fruit, with individual chapters then going into her work and rhapsodies of the wonder of nature that it all around us (have you looked at a leaf lately and thought about how miraculous it is?), then somehow works it all in with her personal life and her relationship with Bill, which is utterly undefinable in the most wonderful of ways. Here's one of the many, many plant-related passages that I loved, which described not just nature but her and Bill:'Why are they together, the tree and the fungus? We don't know. The fungus could certainly live very well alone almost anywhere, but it chooses to entwine itself with the tree over an easier and more independent life. It has adapted to seek the rush of pure sweetness that comes directly from a plant root, such a strange and concentrated compound, unlike anything to be found elsewhere in the forest. And perhaps the fungus can somehow sense that when it is part of a symbiosis, it is also not alone.' (p. 105)I suppose a caveat is in order: for those readers who aren't too interested in the science, it can be a bit tedious and may lose you a bit if you haven't been in a science class since high school, however the enthusiasm and dedication that Jahren has will win you over. I felt comforted reading about all her experiments out in the fields and how meticulously everything had to be done, and then rejoiced when results came through that led to conclusions and consequently, more funding! You'll root (ha!) for her and Bill every step of the way. She's also quite honest about her struggles, not just at work but at home as well, which I didn't expect. It's very difficult to admit to desperate times when you can't see what's ahead of you, or loneliness, much less mental health struggles. I appreciated the book even more for Jahren's willingness to talk about all this and the vulnerability that comes with it. A very moving memoir. It may surprise you how much you will want to read about the inner workings and patience of a seed, or how the surprisingly softness of spongy moss led to a way of finding solid people to work with, until you pick this up, and then it doesn't. It just feels right to see the world like this."

When I saw it on the new book shelf at the library I brought it home with me.""Each beginning is the end of a waiting. We are each given exactly one chance to be. Each of us is both impossible and inevitable. Every replete tree was first a seed that waited.""Jahren has faced many challenges: a lonely childhood, working herself through school, struggling as a female scientist against the prejudices of a male dominated field, finding funding for her projects. Her success can be verified by her choice as one of Time's 100 Most Influential People, her Fulbright Scholarships, and her long relationship with her lab partner Bill. She found love and faced a difficult pregnancy sans medication for her bipolar disorder to have the child that changed her life.""I have learned that raising a child is essentially one long, slow agony of letting go.""Jahren's writing is so lovely to read. Her love of her work as a geobioloist and her awe of nature shines through the pages. She alternates chapters on her life with chapters about the world of green growing things around us.The self-portrait Jahren paints reveals her personal challenges and insecurities without being confessional and raw. Her lab partner/best friend/soul mate Bill is interesting and complicated, eccentric and brilliant. He once lived in a hole in his parent's back yard. We come to love him as much as Jahren does. We are happy when her loneliness is ended by marrying a man who 'gets her.'To read a section of the book go to http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/boo...To read an interview with Jahren go to http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/the-se..."
296,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3788241-elena,5,"In my mind, a great memoir has you singing along with the writer when she is happy, and aching with her when she is sad. Hope Jahren's excellent memoir Lab Girl does just that. Jahren intersperses stories about plants with stories about science with stories about her own life in a way that is masterful and utterly engaging. I didn't expect to enjoy reading about plants or to learn about them (I'm an ecologist) but I found myself loving those sections. Jahren's unique insights into why it is important to understand how plants grow add a fascinating layer to what in lesser hands might have been 'just biology'. The stories about science illuminate how science really works - what it takes to get money to do the work, and how it all really unfolds in the lab. And the stories about Jahren's life and how her choices led her to be the person she is bring the book together as a complete whole.As Heather says, this is a book for those who love science or memoir. But it is also a book for all those who simply love well-crafted stories about courageous lives and courageous women and learning how to be a good person in a complex world.  "
297,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/714583-anita-pomerantz,5,"Fascinating read that is hard to parse. Is it about a female scientist? A relationship between a man and a woman like no other? Manic depression? Botany?The author really holds nothing back in this memoir, and I found Hope to be pretty fascinating. She's nerdy and mentally ill and loving and a workaholic. She is an incredible scientist and a tremendous writer. For me, the highlight of this book is her description of her relationship with her lab employee (partner?), Bill. I couldn't decide what to make of it. Were they in love? Like siblings? Just great colleagues with a shared passion for the work? Whatever it is/was, it was very interesting.In addition, the structure of the book is well done. The reader alternately learns something about plant life, and then the subsequent chapter highlights parallels in human life. I have little science background, but thought most of the explanations were clear and educational. I imagine Hope is an excellent teacher, with the ability to both be engaging and impart knowledge at the same time.Really, almost a five star read for me."
298,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19126246-kaitlin,0,"I ended up DNF-ing this one at 200pages in (which I know is fairly close to the end). I actually loved the science-y bits of this, where the author shows her flair for studying plants, her passion for their care, and also her stunning ability to write beautifully about them. However, although I think these sections were great, Hope Jahren's actual backstory and the way she wrote about her journey just didn't 'click' with me and I found it super hard to connect or relate at all. This really took me out of the book and so ultimately I was forcing myself to pick it up, and that's no fun, so I just decided it was time to put it down and give it to someone else who may enjoy it far more. Ah well. "
299,1101874937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4059160-amy,5,"Jahren's book is full of passion and love for her family, friends and work. It is a memoir of sorts with the life cycle of a tree interspersed with her own stories. A fantastic read!"
