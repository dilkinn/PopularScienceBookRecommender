Professor Cox has a way of explaining the complex in the most simple of terms and I loved every moment of my read. I learned more from this one book regarding the universe than from anything else I have read. I began to understand entropy which I never thought I would. And the photos are stunning. Not only does it cover the beginning, progression and the current development of everything in the known universe, it also predicts the future. ""...our understanding of fundamental physics allows us to make concrete predictions about how they will end their days."" And he is talking of the ultimate destiny of the universe in about '10 to the power of 100' years - and as he says, that is a big number. To me, that is the biblical equivalent of sound prophecy - based on science. Thus, although believers in gods may not like it, as this accurately covers all known space/time, past, present and future, to me it is the ultimate Bible - and science is God and people like Cox are his prophets. My all time favourite learning experience, coupled with Dawkins' 'Greatest Show on Earth' through which I gained a similarly satisfying understanding of evolution. "
1,0007395825,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3531937-alazzar,4,"The layout of this book is perfect for the individual with a fleeting attention span (e.g., me): there are lots of pictures, not to mention the occasional page that contains no more text than a single, giant-font sentence. These little ""coffee breaks"" are properly spaced to ensure that, any time my mind is about to start wandering, I get to flip a few pages in rapid succession and feel like I'm still making good progress.That being said, the information provided here is excellent. (And the pictures sure are purdy, too!) My favorite sections were ""Stardust"" and ""Falling,"" because they deal with things like the nuts-and-bolts workings of stars and the effects of gravity in (literally) shaping our universe.I was less pleased with the final chapter (""Destiny""), either because I'd reached my threshold for being able to pay attention to non-fiction writing at that point or because I just couldn't stop thinking about the comic books I knew I'd be reading as soon as I was done.In any case, this is a great book for anyone with even the slightest interest in how our universe works--Brian Cox does a great job (as he did with the more advanced Why Does E=mc²?) of dumbing things down for the casual reader without treating us like outright idiots.Oh, and if you're into this sorta thing, I'd also recommend checking out the TV series How the Universe Works, with Mike Rowe. You can find it on Netflix streaming (or, at least, you could at one time), and it's positively excellent."

If you haven't seen the show, you might still enjoy the book, but you might also wonder why there are so many darkly vignetted photos of the sillouete of the author standing with his back turned to the camera, looking at stuff. It is a little cheesy, I admit, but I didn't mind it because Cox really does seem almost giddy about the universe. To him, everything is Awesome, Incredible, Inspiring, Beautiful, etc. At times his giddy enthusiam almost made me chuckle, and I'm almost positive that the ""pale blue dot"" photo and the Hubble deep field photo were ""The most important photo mankind has ever witnessed. Ever."" That he seems to go overboard from time to time doesn't distract from the overall quality of the book, which is fantastic. It really is well written, the photographs are beautiful, and the drawings and diagrams are so cool they would look good hanging on the wall. Somebody with a real sense of design put them together with a simplistic, alsmot retro pop feel to them.The book was a fun read. Now that I'm finished I will probably go back and read it again sometime, and I can definitely wholeheartedly recommend it to anybody who has even a passing interest in the universe. "

However, recent Hubble Space Telescope images have identified older stars within it, making the galaxy as old as others but with new star formations.==========Wonders of the Universe (Brian Cox)- Highlight Loc. 340-42 | Added on Wednesday, December 04, 2013, 12:55 PMOur galaxy, the Milky Way, contains somewhere between 200 and 400 billion stars, depending on the number of faint dwarf stars that are difficult for us to detect. The majority of stars lie in a disc around 100,000 light years in diameter and, on average, around 1,000 light years thick.==========Wonders of the Universe (Brian Cox)- Highlight Loc. 346-49 | Added on Wednesday, December 04, 2013, 12:56 PMAt the centre of our galaxy, and possibly every galaxy in the Universe, there is believed to be a super-massive black hole. Astronomers believe this because of precise measurements of the orbit of a star known as S2. This star orbits around the intense source of radio waves known as Sagittarius A* (pronounced ‘Sagittarius A-star’) that sits at the galactic centre. S2’s orbital period is just over fifteen years, which makes it the fastest-known orbiting object, reaching speeds of up to 2 per cent of the speed of light.==========Wonders of the Universe (Brian Cox)- Highlight Loc. 353-54 | Added on Wednesday, December 04, 2013, 12:57 PMThe only known way of cramming 4.1 million times the mass of the Sun into a space less than 17 light hours across is as a black hole, which is why astronomers are so confident that a giant black hole sits at the centre of the Milky Way.==========Wonders of the Universe (Brian Cox)- Highlight Loc. 359-60 | Added on Wednesday, December 04, 2013, 12:57 PMThe Quintuplet Cluster contains one of the most luminous stars in our galaxy, the Pistol Star, which is thought to be near the end of its life and on the verge of becoming a supernova==========Wonders of the Universe (Brian Cox)- Highlight Loc. 372-74 | Added on Wednesday, December 04, 2013, 12:58 PMIn 2007, scientists using the Very Large Telescope (VLT) at the Paranal Observatory in Chile were able to observe a star in the Galactic Halo that is thought to be the oldest object in the Milky Way.

He discovered that if you push a magnet through a coil of wire, an electric current flows through the wire while the magnet is moving.==========Wonders of the Universe (Brian Cox)- Highlight Loc. 470-72 | Added on Wednesday, December 04, 2013, 01:17 PMAmpère discovered that two parallel wires carrying electric currents experience a force between them; this force is still used today to define the ampere, or amp – the unit of electric current. A single amp is defined as the current that must flow along two parallel wires of infinite length and negligible diameter to produce an attractive force of 0.0000007 Newtons between them.==========Wonders of the Universe (Brian Cox)- Highlight Loc. 476-78 | Added on Wednesday, December 04, 2013, 01:17 PMMaxwell, who, in a series of papers in 1861 and 1862, developed a single theory of electricity and magnetism that was able to explain all of the experimental work of Faraday, Ampère and others. But Maxwell’s crowning glory came in 1864, when he published a paper that is undoubtedly one of the greatest achievements in the history of science.==========Wonders of the Universe (Brian Cox)- Highlight Loc. 481-82 | Added on Wednesday, December 04, 2013, 01:18 PMElectricity and magnetism can be unified by introducing two new concepts: electric and magnetic fields.

The fact that the velocity of light can be measured experimentally on a bench top with wires and magnets was the key piece of evidence that light is an electromagnetic wave. ==========Wonders of the Universe (Brian Cox)- Highlight Loc. 507-10 | Added on Wednesday, December 04, 2013, 01:26 PMMaxwell’s equations also predict exactly how fast these waves must fly away from the electric charges that create them. The speed of the waves is the ratio of the strengths of the electric and magnetic fields – quantities that had been measured by Faraday, Ampère and others and were well known to Maxwell. When Maxwell did the sums, he must have fallen off his chair. He found that his equations predicted that the waves in the electric and magnetic fields travelled at the speed of light!==========Wonders of the Universe (Brian Cox)- Highlight Loc. 513 | Added on Wednesday, December 04, 2013, 01:26 PMIn modern language, we would say that light is an electromagnetic wave.==========Wonders of the Universe (Brian Cox)- Highlight Loc. 515 | Added on Wednesday, December 04, 2013, 01:26 PMit had first been measured by Ole Romer in 1676.==========Wonders of the Universe (Brian Cox)- Highlight Loc. 521-24 | Added on Wednesday, December 04, 2013, 01:29 PMEmpedocles and Galileo, separated by almost two millennia, felt that light must travel at a finite, if extremely high, velocity. Empedocles’s reasoning was elegant, pre-dating Aristotle by a century. He considered light travelling across the vast distance from the Sun to Earth, and noted that everything that travels must move from one point to another.==========Wonders of the Universe (Brian Cox)- Highlight Loc. 527-30 | Added on Wednesday, December 04, 2013, 01:29 PMGalileo set out to measure the speed of light using two lamps. He held one and sent an assistant a large distance away with another. When they were in position, Galileo opened a shutter on his lamp, letting the light out. When his assistant saw the flash, he opened his shutter, and Galileo attempted to note down the time delay between the opening of his shutter and his observation of the flash from his assistant’s lamp. His conclusion was that light must travel extremely rapidly, because he was unable to determine its speed.==========Wonders of the Universe (Brian Cox)- Highlight Loc. 548-50 | Added on Wednesday, December 04, 2013, 01:31 PMThe point at which the Sun crosses the Meridian is also the point at which it reaches its highest position in the sky on any given day as it journeys from sunrise in the east to sunset in the west.

As we look into the skies we see a vast open vacuum, or so it seems. Cox does a brilliant job of describing the beauty and complexity that is up there in a non esoteric way appealing to the everyday reader. He also contrasts the principles of physics with not just phenomena related to space exclusively but touches the surface of phenomena on earth that we can observe with the naked eye which was extraordinary. One of these being the way light rays cause rainbows when they penetrate through water molecules in the atmosphere. This was the first book I have ever read on the universe and to this day much of what Cox describes remains. The great mysteries of the universe are unlocked in this bestseller. A must read to all. We cannot remain in ignorance on our existence. "

It’s a tie in with a BBC tv show (which I have not seen) and this fact distorts the book in odd ways. For tv the author needed to make sure he had interesting images of places around the earth so that viewers had pretty things to look at. This may have made sense for tv, but these bits feel a little forced into the book. On the other hand, this book is packed with gorgeous pictures of space. There is a lot to see and to read and Wonders of the Universe is worth your time if the subject interest you (and how could it not interest you?)"

11,0007395825,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19370357-jack-barten,4,This is an excellent book that explains complex areas of science in a coherent way. One of my frustrations with Brian Cox's TV works is he speaks in a such a slow way that it doesn't cover as much ground an hour could. This could be down to the BBC assuming that people can't take in information as fast as students in a physics lecture would be expected to but at least with the book you can read as fast or slow as you mind and level of knowledge allows. After many people bought and few people read Stephen Hawking's Brief History of Time there was a danger that the broader public had been put off physics books. This book and some others in recent years has changed all that (along with Brian Cow TV shows). This is a remarkable achievement since physics has got so mind-bending now that graduate students today are having to do mental gymnastics way beyond that of their counterparts from 50 years ago. It is great that Cox can find time to do such books and TV shows and I am sure that his influence will encourage new generations of physicists to make sense of problems that are currently beyond anyone's grasp.  
12,0007395825,http://goodreads.com/user/show/800291-andrew,3,Ok my Brian Cox run is carrying on - moving on from the solar system to the universe. The book is as with the first sumptuously illustrated with glossy fascinating images to grab your attention and cleverly worded phrases to pull you in to the text of each section. However as you can imagine the subject matter has grown. This means that much more obscure subjects and facts can be explored - if you like it is building upon the first book (there are many references which although you do not need to have read the first book do certainly become more accessible if you have) The book is a fascinating read and if anything proves that although the internet can store and access more information quicker and more thoroughly than any book. However a book can take you on a journey through it all and give you a sense of truly leaning something rather than just collecting facts along the way.
13,0007395825,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8709909-natasha-holme,4,"""Two and a half million years ago, when our distant relative Homo habilis was foraging for food across the Tanzanian savannah, a beam of light left the Andromeda Galaxy and began its journey across the Universe. As that light beam raced across space at the speed of light, generations of pre-humans and humans lived and died; whole species evolved and became extinct, until one member of that unbroken lineage, me, happened to gaze up into the sky below the constellation we call Cassiopeia and focus that beam of light onto his retina. A two-and-a-half-billion-year journey ends by creating an electrical impulse in a nerve fibre, triggering a cascade of wonder in a complex organ called the human brain that didn’t exist anywhere in the Universe when the journey began""^ ^ ^That kind of mind-blowing observation punctuates this rather thrilling book. Good stuff."

15,0007395825,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5862530-dahlia,0,This book is interesting and informative-you can tell Brian Cox is a professor who is passionate about his subject. If only I had a teacher like him... :) Definitely worth reading.

17,0007395825,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33362779-gareth,4,"Like the other books in the series I really enjoyed reading this one. It went a bit further and deeper into things than wonders of the solar system and wasn't as fragmented.Brian Cox explains how events in the cosmos relate to events on Earth such as how a star turning into a black dwarf is similar to a 100 year old ship rotting away rotting away in a desert. I enjoyed these examples however I did think sometimes that there was too much, when I want to read a book about the universe and the physics surrounding it I'd prefer just a quick reference to something on Earth rather than a detailed explanation of it which took away my universe time!That aside though I have one issue, I'm incredibly jealous of the places this man has been!! Just to film a tv series, I'm definitely in the wrong job!A very good book and well worth a read, even if it's only for the final chapter where the poetic writing sums up the collapse of the Universe into the heat death and how we should be privileged to be alive now, in the fraction of a second when life can exist in a universe which is inexorably hurtling towards entropy and the end of all things. Great book"
18,0007395825,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47247994-chris-waraksa,4,Nice collection of interesting bits about cosmology and science. I picked it up from the library to try and catch up on what is commonly known now that wasn't known in the 1980s when I last took a physics class. The book has a nice format of bite-sized articles about scientific concepts that are really quite interesting. Text and illustrations are both very accessible. I enjoyed the bit that explains what a rainbow is and all of the discussion of the birth and death of stars. 100 billion galaxies in the universe. 
19,0007395825,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2132831-jason-cox,4,"A beautiful book that gives a brief tour of some of the wonders of the universe and explains things at the level of a non-scientist. Excellent photography. With each concept he explains, he tries to tie it with something he has experienced in travels here on earth. (I thought much of that aspect was a bit hokey and felt like an excellent excuse to travel to some pretty exotic locations and deduct the trips... not that there's anything wrong with that!).If you have an interest in science but don't have a lot of background knowledge, this book will be interesting to you. There is precisely ZERO math discussed or involved. If you are well versed with these scientific principles, I suspect you'll find nothing new here, but the photos are beautiful and it's worth flipping through at Barnes and Noble to see if it would make a nice coffee table book for your living room."

The book is full of illustrations and clever analogies that help readers get a grasp of what otherwise are complex concepts. I also found myself reading it in Brian Cox's (somewhat annoying) voice in places - I found it quite hard to NOT do that and it amused me. I found it a really basic, but solid grounding in to a subject that I always found quite mind-boggling and I'd recommend it to anyone who wanted to read a bit of contemporary science; it's probably a little 'basic' for someone with a degree but for someone with an interest in the subject, or someone who wants to understand it it's a perfect introductory book!"

Written to tie in with his Tv series, this nevertheless stands on its own two feet as a detailed yet very approachable journey through the stars and astrophysics. Complicated theories such as entropy, quantum theory, thermodynamics and the beauties and limitations of E=MC2 are all explained in clear enthusiastic language that is never dumbed down or blurred yet anecdotally linked to what we see around us in our every day lives. This provides a thorough introduction to the often intimidating science while never losing sight of the visual beauties that inspired such wonder in the first place. Mixing detailed diagrams and equations alongside artistically wonderful glossy photographs and guided by the warm explanations of the writer that never patronise, this is a real gem that educates and delights in equal measure."
46,0007395825,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3984582-sara-forsberg,5,"See my review of the Wonders of the Solar System - this book is just as magnificent as that one. Perhaps even more so, because this is slightly more ambitious. Its 4 chapters focus on 4 quite complex fundamentals of science (light, formation of stars, gravity and entropy) and attempts to explain them to the layperson reader. And it works - after reading this I obviously don't feel like I understand everything but it's a significant increase in knowledge from what I had before. I never thought I'd be able to come close to grasp Einstein's theories, for instance, or the Second Law of Thermodynamics and what it has to to with the end of the universe, but I can now say I feel like I have a tenuous hold on those theories. It's a rather wonderful experience to feel like you suddenly understand the world around you a little better, and that's what this book ultimately gave me. Everyone should read it."
47,0007395825,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9633121-david-stoney,5,"Although it's been an interesting read so far, unfortunately it uses the same device as the TV series to explain various concepts. Whilst this may be useful on occasion, unfortunately I found the TV version images to be more like a travelogue and the images were too distracting from the concepts being explained.It seems that Prof. Cox allowed some arty producer/director to use the images to dumb it all down - as so often happens when people who've only done media studies and social studies get involved with proper science. It's almost as if they don't trust us to be able to understand the concepts being explained (for further proof just look what they did to anything with maths, or chemistry) and poor old Prof. Jim Al-Kalili (sorry if I spelt his name wrong), but each time the programmes end up like an episode of ""Wish You Were Here"".Other than that the books by Prof. Cox are a fascinating read...."
48,0007395825,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3073743-craig,3,"Enjoyable and informative although I found it to be a little haphazardly organised in places. In large part I think this was due to the layout of the kindle edition I read, wherein illustrations, photos, captions and quotes were seemingly scattered at random, often making reading passages with references to these images a little tough going. Topics did seem to jump around a lot, with a couple of paragraphs on one thing then onto something new, leaving me at times wishing there was more said on the previous topic. Again I get the feeling that the eBook format was not kind to this book and this topic jumping is probably less jarring in the printed form. But in general I was left with the sense of wanting more; what's in here is good, but feels often feels repetitious and not as in depth as I would have liked."

I didn't see much of the TV series although I enjoyed the slightly spurious travel porn involved. I enjoyed the book whilst still not understanding very much of it. I half thought this might be a glossy coffee table book, light but graspable on content. There are some lovely images, some lovely big images, but a heck of a lot of words too.It says a lot about me that the kind of thing which stuck was stuff like Joule (of the energy measurement) was British but I didn't feel the book strayed too far from the science to pander to people like me, a very common mistake in popular publishing and broadcasting. I finished the book with that slightly wobbly ""I'd like to have a little cry now"" feeling. I think all such books deserve 5 stars, even doomed ones."

It's pretty much written in continuous prose with links throughout, so if you start reading bits and pieces you'll get really confused.It's also quite technical, so if you're only a little bit interested in physics then this probably isn't the book for you. The TV series is a lot easier to get through, even though it has the same information, so even if you enjoyed the TV series the book might not be your cup of tea.I personally loved it and found everything it talks about really interesting and at times mind blowing (gravity slows down time? What?!)."

The short essays are great for those with a short attention span! I have read a few similar books mainly by Marcus Chown so I had a background on most of this, but Brian surprisingly covers more topics than most books (eg false dawn), because he doesn't get bogged in the detail. I wondered if some people would struggle to follow some of his explanations because of the brevity, but the reviews below don't suggest that. One reviewer below complains about repetition - but I think this is OK because it helps to cement some of the more important concepts into the brain. "

59,0007395825,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5982358-derek-bridge,4,As poetic and fascinating as its predecessor (Wonders of the Solar System) but not always as clear: the physics here is maybe just that much harder and resists a populist treatment.

Perhaps even more so, because this is slightly more ambitious. Its 4 chapters focus on 4 quite complex fundamentals of science (light, formation of stars, gravity and entropy) and attempts to explain them to the layperson reader. And it works - after reading this I obviously don't feel like I understand everything but it's a significant increase in knowledge from what I had before. I never thought I'd be able to come close to grasp Einstein's theories, for instance, or the Second Law of Thermodynamics and what it has to to with the end of the universe, but I can now say I feel like I have a tenuous hold on those theories. It's a rather wonderful experience to feel like you suddenly understand the world around you a little better, and that's what this book ultimately gave me. Everyone should read it."

It's almost as if they don't trust us to be able to understand the concepts being explained (for further proof just look what they did to anything with maths, or chemistry) and poor old Prof. Jim Al-Kalili (sorry if I spelt his name wrong), but each time the programmes end up like an episode of ""Wish You Were Here"".Other than that the books by Prof. Cox are a fascinating read...."

After watching the TV Series, I really wanted to read the book because I just find that Brian Cox explains things like this in such a way that I remember them. The book was just fantastic and married in with the series perfectly; I loved the history and the mythology and the religious insights to everything too - particularly in the first section when the history of the Sun is explored. The pictures in the book are just awe-inspiring. They're utterly beautiful and I loved reading it on the kindle because it just gave them a whole new quality (I could zoom in and such, they're really, really high quality). It's accessible, covers a lot of territory, educational and it's just really fun to read. The book is full of illustrations and clever analogies that help readers get a grasp of what otherwise are complex concepts. I also found myself reading it in Brian Cox's (somewhat annoying) voice in places - I found it quite hard to NOT do that and it amused me. I found it a really basic, but solid grounding in to a subject that I always found quite mind-boggling and I'd recommend it to anyone who wanted to read a bit of contemporary science; it's probably a little 'basic' for someone with a degree but for someone with an interest in the subject, or someone who wants to understand it it's a perfect introductory book!"

Written to tie in with his Tv series, this nevertheless stands on its own two feet as a detailed yet very approachable journey through the stars and astrophysics. Complicated theories such as entropy, quantum theory, thermodynamics and the beauties and limitations of E=MC2 are all explained in clear enthusiastic language that is never dumbed down or blurred yet anecdotally linked to what we see around us in our every day lives. This provides a thorough introduction to the often intimidating science while never losing sight of the visual beauties that inspired such wonder in the first place. Mixing detailed diagrams and equations alongside artistically wonderful glossy photographs and guided by the warm explanations of the writer that never patronise, this is a real gem that educates and delights in equal measure."

Perhaps even more so, because this is slightly more ambitious. Its 4 chapters focus on 4 quite complex fundamentals of science (light, formation of stars, gravity and entropy) and attempts to explain them to the layperson reader. And it works - after reading this I obviously don't feel like I understand everything but it's a significant increase in knowledge from what I had before. I never thought I'd be able to come close to grasp Einstein's theories, for instance, or the Second Law of Thermodynamics and what it has to to with the end of the universe, but I can now say I feel like I have a tenuous hold on those theories.
