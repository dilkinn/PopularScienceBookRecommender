0,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,5,"There was a moment in Freakonomics where the authors say that the reason violent crime has dropped in America is that there are less people being born now into abject poverty and this is mostly due to access to abortion. When I first read this I thought it was a very interesting correlation. I was even prepared to accept it as probably an accurate description, a kind of ‘fact of life’. But let’s say the same thing in a somewhat less intellectually appealing style. “Bennett (former U.S. Secretary of Education) said, ‘But I do know that it’s true that if you wanted to reduce crime, if that were your sole purpose, you could abort every black baby in this country and your crime rate would go down’.” There is something about the idea of the guy responsible for education in a country saying such a thing that really sends a shiver down my spine. It is like something you might expect to read from a ‘concerned member of the Nazi party’ in 1928 perhaps.Everyone knows that correlation does not imply causation – in fact, if you are the sort of person who likes to get by without having to think too much, but still likes to be thought of as a bit clever then that should become one of your main catch phrases. Unfortunately, although correlation doesn’t imply causation, the real message here is that causation is impossible without correlation, so the fact two things are correlated doesn’t automatically mean there is no causal relationship. And just as importantly, the relationship between correlation and causation isn’t so vague that we get to choose what is the cause on the basis of our ideological preferences. There are statistical tests of causation too, just as there is common sense. A long time ago people used to talk about more than just freedom, but today freedom is our abstract noun of choice. Don’t get me wrong, like Communism, freedom is a really lovely idea in theory. You don’t have to be a lion to get a kick out of humming along with Born Free. The problem is that people seem to have decided that ‘freedom’ means very strange things. For example, we are ‘free’ to drive around in cars the size of living rooms we call SUVs (Sports Utility Vehicles) although none of us ‘do’ sports anymore – properly, they ought to be called TTPs (Trash The Planets). This book speculates that the reason why these cars have become so popular is that in grossly unequal societies our lack of trust in those around us forces us to have cars that make us look intimidating. Here in Australia we live on the driest inhabited continent on earth, but there are still those who believe they should be ‘free’ to hose down concrete. And then the most bizarre of all ‘freedoms’ – our god given freedom to stop homosexuals from marrying. The simplest of all moral maxims would seem to be that your freedom to swing your fists around ends where my nose starts – that your freedom should not impinge on the freedom of anyone else. It is ‘the golden rule’ and the main reason we had to nail that Jesus guy to a tree. But it seems that the most common view of freedom is the very opposite of this – my freedom is only ever really worth having if it imposes costs on everyone else.Such a notion of freedom is, of course, obligatory in our grossly unequal world. The USA and Canada have a bit over 5% of the world’s population but account for 26% of the world’s CO2 emissions – you don’t really get to have five times your ‘share’ in an equal world. So, is it any wonder that equality has become quite so unpopular?There are lots of strange things I simply don’t understand about our world. Talk to the average person and they will tell you just how ‘different’ they are, how uniquely individual they feel – in fact, they may even suggest, if pressed, that it is this very feeling of uniqueness that is at the heart of their sense of freedom – that freedom is the freedom to ‘be yourself’, to express your ‘individuality’. But let’s pretend we are aliens and have just arrived on Earth. Somehow we have gotten a bit lost, we made a sharp right instead of the usual left at the turnpike and rather than finding ourselves out on some dirt road somewhere in the arse end of no where conducting our intensely interesting research into the anatomy of the human rectum (‘Righto boyo, drop them, we have an anal probe with your name on it’) we end up where most Earthlings live – in some remarkably over-crowded city. What would we aliens make of these Earthlings? I suspect we would hardly think, ‘Wow, look at how many of them there are –and yet, it seems that all of them are living their own authentically unique lives, it really is a miracle of freedom’. Rather, I think we would most likely see humans as a species of overgrown ants. Perhaps it is the fact that our freedom is so remarkably limited that we like to exaggerate it so much. The problem is that the best way we can think of ‘displaying’ our ‘freedom’ mostly seems to involve our being told by televisions and magazines things to buy that will make us stand out in the crowd.Now, what this book does not say is that the main problem is poverty. In fact, it says almost the opposite – this book only looks at advanced market economies – so the standard rightwing nonsense about us all having to ‘live in Cuba’ rings a little hollow. The conclusion they make isn’t that the poorest countries have the worst outcomes, but rather that no matter how rich or poor a country is, it will have worse outcomes according to the greater the level of inequity the country has. I recently got into an argument with someone on Good Reads about my ‘politics of envy’ – my belief that the gross levels of inequity in the US (and increasingly also here in Australia) are destroying our social fabric. The statistics in this book show that societies with the greatest inequities within their economy will have very predictable ‘problems’, such as higher crime rates, teenage pregnancy, infant mortality, education failure, health issues and social alienation. Inequity pushes us to distrust those around us, encourages us to live in gated communities, to employ private police (a figure I read recently was that there are more private police in the US then there are public police – since 1984 California built one new collage and twenty-one new prisons, such being our preferences) and therefore to live in a state of near constant fear. But we like to assume – as rugged individuals – that as long as we are okay, everything is okay. Sure, we might need to have armed guards and high walls, but in our own little slice of heaven the rest of the world can crumble and collapse around us, as long as we have the ability to hold back entropy in our own private brave new world. This book shows that for a very long list of issues living in a grossly inequitable society isn’t just bad for those at the bottom (and it is appallingly bad for them, obviously) – that is, those we can blame for their own victimhood – but it is bad for everyone. Some of the figures show that the least well off in more equal countries have better health and life expectancy outcomes that the most well off in unequal countries.Naturally enough the country with the worst of all outcomes is the most unequal country – the USA. The authors make the disturbing claim that if the US went from being by far the most unequal society to being among the average of the most equal countries (you know – on a par with those crazy socialist countries like Japan, Finland, Norway and Sweden) that “the proportion of the population feeling they could trust others might rise by 75 per cent … rates of mental illness and obesity might similarly each be cut by almost two thirds, teenage birth rates could be more than halved, prison populations might be reduced by 75 per cent, and people could live longer while working the equivalent of two months less per year.” You see – because happiness stops being related to the amount of stuff you have above a certain minimum much of the time we now spend at work is spent earning money to buy things we not only don’t need, but actually do little to help to increase our happiness.Something needs to give. The planet cannot sustain our endlessly growing rates of consumption and our rapacity. The immorality of the few taking virtually all while the rest are left gapping is the very basis for envy – the rightwing are right about that – but our system is based on an ever growing sense of envy. It is the prime motivator behind much of our advertising – it seems somewhat hard to believe rightwing types when they complain that envy is a deadly sin – as if this was the only of the seven deadly sins that still applies (we are all to ignore their pride, gluttony, lust, slothfulness, wrath and greed, but to apologise because we want for our kids what is an unquestioned right for theirs).This book might make you angry – but it will also give you a sense of hope. Both your anger and your hope are required, though, I’m afraid."

Chapter 13’Tis very certain that each man carries in his eye the exact indication of his rank in the immense scale of men, and we are always learning to read it. Emerson (Chapter 3)for books which come to similar conclusions see bottom of reviewThe Spirit Level is a book whose importance will probably outweigh its influence. This is unfortunate.It is a vast study, undertaken by the two authors (both trained in epidemiology) starting in the early 1980s. Their initial focus was “to understand the causes of the big differences in life expectancy – the ‘health inequalities’ – between people at different levels in the social hierarchy in modern societies.” From these beginnings, it grew, over the years, into a comprehensive study of how income inequality is correlated to, and indeed is at least part of the cause of, a host of social problems.The methods employed are standard methods from their field, “used to trace the causes of diseases in populations – trying to find out why one group of people gets a particular disease while another group doesn’t, or to explain why some disease is becoming more common. The same methods can, however, also be used to understand the causes of other kinds of problems – not just health.”The authors first focused on the question, How does income inequality relate to the incidence of health and social problems in the rich countries of the world? Then, to provide a different population in which to study the same general issue, they asked, How does income inequality relate to the incidence of health and social problems in the fifty states of the U.S.? See ""Ch. 2"" below.Note: In the remainder of this over-long review, there are links to my Writing area where pieces that wouldn't fit have been placed. I've tried to keep all the most important things in the review proper, so these links needn't be followed unless you're interested.
A Reader’s Guide
Someone who may just want a brief overview, or a plan for reading just parts of the book, can see here.Part One. Material Success, Social Failure or The ProblemCh. 1. The End of an EraCh. 2. Poverty or Inequality?The book uses, for comparing income inequality among developed nations, the ratio of the income received by the top 20% of income earners in the society, to that received by the bottom 20 per cent of the society – not only is it easy to understand, but it is provided ready-made by the United Nations. In the case of comparing income inequality between American states, they have used what’s called the “Gini” coefficient, because that number is favored by economists, and is available from the US Census Bureau.For more details, and examples of the graphs used in the book, see here.Ch. 3. How Inequality Gets Under the Skin.The authors here present an overview of “why people in the developed world are so sensitive to inequality that it can exert such a major influence on the psychological and social well-being of modern populations.” (30)Over 200 studies have documented a continuous upward trend in anxiety in the U.S. since the 1950s. By the late 1980s the average American child was more anxious than child psychiatric patients in the 1950s. (34)Self-esteem and social insecurityNot only is the rise of anxiety alarming, it is also surprising in light of a well-documented rise in teenagers’ “self-esteem” in this same period. But the authors show that this seeming paradox actually turned out to further understanding on the causes of anxiety, and their relation to inequality. (view spoiler)[ Over the years researchers found that there were two different categories of people earning high scores on self-esteem measures. In one category, high self-esteem went with positive outcomes and was associated with happiness, confidence, being able to accept criticism, an ability to make friends, and so on. But as well as positive outcomes, studies repeatedly found that there was another group who scored well … They were people who showed tendencies to violence, to racism, who were insensitive to others and were bad at personal relationships.The second group fit into a pattern in which “increasing anxieties about how we are seen and what others think of us which has, in turn, produced a kind of defensive attempt to shore up our confidence … a kind of self-promoting, insecure egotism which is easily mistaken for high self-esteem.”Once psychological tests were developed to pinpoint these different categories of person (“healthy” and “unhealthy” self-esteem) time series of these populations could be studied. The unhealthy brand is now called ‘threatened egotism’, ‘insecure high self-esteem’, or simply ‘narcissism’. It has been found that “by 2006 two-thirds of American college students scored above what had been the average narcissism score in 1982.” Thus the rise in self-esteem measures of the larger population are now widely accepted as primarily a rise in “insecure narcissism.” (36-7) (hide spoiler)]In the rest of the chapter the authors explore further the ramifications of anxiety, and offer insight its connection to inequality within society. (1) Social evaluative threats. Anxiety (as well as narcissism) are both caused by an increase in ‘social evaluative threat’. A wide variety of studies focusing on the stress hormone cortisol have been done. A meta-study of over 200 of these reports has found that, speaking of the types of stressor tasks used in different experiments, tasks that included a social-evaluative threat (such as threats to self-esteem or social status), in which others could negatively judge performance … provoked larger and more reliable cortisol changes than stressors without these particular threats … suggesting that ‘Human beings are driven to preserve the social self and are vigilant to threats that may jeopardize their social esteem or status’.The most powerful sources of stress affecting health seem to fall into three intensely social categories: low social status, lack of friends, and stress in early life. (37-9)(2) Shame. One eminent sociologist has said that shame is the social emotion. Shame is “the range of emotions to do with feeling foolish, stupid, inadequate, defective, incompetent, awkward, exposed, vulnerable and insecure.” Shame (and pride) “provide the social evaluative feedback as we experience ourselves as if through others’ eyes.” Shame is the “pain through which we are socialized, so that we learn, from early childhood onwards, to behave in socially acceptable ways. (41)(3) Mass society. In time long gone, our social context was our community, the neighborhood or small town we lived in. In today’s society sense of community has become lost, and we are “cast adrift in the anonymity of mass society.” At the core of our interactions with strangers is our concern at the social judgments and evaluations they might make … This vulnerability is part of the modern psychological condition and feeds directly into consumerism. (42)(4) Greater inequality heightens people’s social evaluation anxieties. “Getting the measure of each other becomes more important as status differences widen. We come to see social position as a more important feature of a person’s identity. Between strangers it may often be the dominant feature.” Experiments indicate that we make judgments of each other’s social status “within the first few seconds of meeting” someone new. Surveys have found that when choosing prospective marriage partners, “people in more unequal countries put less emphasis on romantic considerations and more on criteria such as financial prospects, status and ambition …” (43-4)(5) Self-promotion vs. modesty. Comparing the more unequal and more dysfunctional American society with that of Japan, there is a stark contrast:In Japan, people choose a much more self-deprecating and self-critical way of presenting themselves, which contrasts sharply with the much more self-enhancing style in the USA. While American s are more likely to attribute individual success to their own abilities and their failures to external factors, the Japanese tend to do just the opposite. (44)(6) A Revolutionary wrapup. The authors provide their own evaluation of the demand for Liberte, egalite, fraternite in the French Revolution:’Liberty’ meant not being subservient or beholden to the feudal nobility and landed aristocracy … ‘fraternity’ reflects a desire for greater mutuality and reciprocity in social relations … and ‘equality’ comes into the picture as a precondition for getting the other two right. (45)Part Two. The Costs of Inequality or The DataSummary is here.Part Three. A Better Society or The SolutionCh. 13. Dysfunctional Societies.Ch. 14. Our Social Inheritance.Evidence that material self-interest is the governing principle of human life seems to be everywhere.This chapter, while admitting the above, challenges the widely held belief that “greed and avarice are, as (mainstream) economic theory assumes, the overriding human motivations”; and in so doing provides an understanding of how, “without genetically re-engineering ourselves, greater equality allows a more sociable human nature to emerge.”This chapter requires a very detailed summary.Two Sides of the coin. Social status (hierarchical orderings based on power and coercion) and friendship (reciprocity, mutuality, sharing, social obligations, cooperation) are the two opposite ways in which human beings can come together.Friend or Foe. All human beings have the same needs; hence they have (as Thomas Hobbes emphasized) the potential to be each other’s worst rivals; but human beings also have “a unique potential to be each other’s best source of cooperation, learning, love and assistance of every kind” – thus the potential to be each other’s greatest source of comfort and security.Economic Experiments. Economic theory works on the assumption that human behavior is governed by “a tendency to maximize material self-interest.” Studies involving economic games (particularly the ‘ultimatum game’) are cited which indicate that this is not the case. Findings indicate that “at direct cost to ourselves, we come close to sharing equally even with people we never meet and will never interact with again.” The authors conclude that “The egalitarian preferences people reveal in the ultimatum game seem to fly in the face of the actual inequalities in our societies.”Chimps and Bonobos. We are closely related genetically to both chimps and bonobos. These two species of ape have radically different social systems. Chimps settle sexual disputes with power (a dominance hierarchy); bonobos settle power disputes by having sex. Bonobos have a high degree of sexual equality in their groups, dominance hierarchies are much less pronounced, females, although smaller than males, are generally allowed to eat first. They engage in sexual activity very frequently, in all combinations of ages and sexes, in order to relieve tensions that in other species might cause conflict. And research has shown that bonobos are better at cooperative tasks than chimps. The genetic difference between chimps and bonobos involves a section of DNA which is known to be important in the regulation of social, sexual and parenting behavior. For what it’s worth, humans have the bonobo rather than the chimp pattern in this section of DNA.The Social Brain. Humans are first and foremost social animals. We are continually preoccupied with social interaction – “what people have said, what they might have been thinking, whether they were kind, off-hand, rude …, why they behaved as they did, what their motivations were, how we should respond.” Research has shown that “conflicts and tensions with other people are by far the most distressing events in daily life in terms of both initial and enduring effects on emotional wellbeing – more so than the demands of work, money worries, or other difficulties … social interaction has been one of the most powerful influences on the evolution of the human brain.” All of this indicates why and how perceptions of inequality can affect us in extremely negative ways.Our Dual Inheritance. We humans need to operate in both dominance hierarchies and in egalitarian societies. Dominance strategies “are almost certainly pre-human in origin”. ”Despite the modern impression of the permanence and universality of inequality, in the time-scale of human history and pre-history, it is the current highly unequal societies which are exceptional. For over 90 per cent of our existence as human beings we lived, almost exclusively, in highly egalitarian societies.” (See Hierarchy in the Forest). Modern inequality arose and spread with the development of agriculture, which replaced egalitarian foraging groups. (view spoiler)[The same point is made in chapter 28 of State of the World 2013. (hide spoiler)]The chapter includes additional sections on Early Experience (of childhood), Mirror Neurons and Empathy, Oxytocin and Trust, and Co-operative Pleasure and Painful Exclusion. It concludes:For a species which thrives on friendship and enjoys co-operation and trust, which has a strong sense of fairness, which is equipped with mirror neurons allowing us to learn our way of life through a process of identification, it is clear that social structures which create relationships based on inequality, inferiority and social exclusion must inflict a great deal of social pain. In this light we can perhaps begin not only to see why more unequal societies are so socially dysfunctional but, through that, perhaps also to feel more confident that a more humane society may be a great deal more practical than the highly unequal ones in which so many of us live now.The material in this chapter, for me, built an utterly astounding case against assumptions that today seem to be accepted as unarguable truth: the Hobbesian view that humans are involved in a struggle to survive in the face of vicious competition with each other, and the related economic paradigm that we are all, by our very nature, engaged in a never-ending desire to maximize our own material well-being. THESE VIEWS ARE SIMPLY NOT TRUE!I found it to be the highlight of the book.Ch. 15. Equality and Sustainability.The inclusion of this chapter indicates how deeply the authors believe the issue of inequality permeates every important aspect of life in the twenty-first century. It includes sections on Sustainability and the Quality of Life, Reducing Carbon Emission Fairly, New Technology Is Not Enough On Its Own, A Steady-State Economy, and a very long final section, Inequality and Consumerism. I found Figure 15.2 (Human wellbeing and sustainability) particularly interesting. It indicates that of all the 100+ countries shown on the scatter-diagram, Cuba is the only one that combines a quality of life above a “high human development threshold”, with an ecological footprint that is globally sustainable.Ch. 16. Building the Future.The above link is the summary of this concluding chapter. I've moved the final quote from there to here. It pretty well sums up the book's message for me:Reducing inequality would not only make the economic system more stable, it would also make a major contribution to social and environmental sustainability.Modern societies will depend increasingly on being creative, adaptable, inventive, well-informed and flexible communities … Those are characteristics not of societies in hock to the rich, in which people are driven by status insecurities, but of populations used to working together and respecting each other as equals … we must try to bring about a shift in public values so that instead of inspiring admiration and envy, conspicuous consumption is seen as part of the problem, a sign of greed and unfairness which damages society and the planet.Martin Luther King said, ‘The moral arc of the universe is long, but it bends toward justice’. Given that in human prehistory we lived in remarkably equal societies, maintaining a steady state – or sustainable – way of life in what some have called ‘the original affluent society’, it is perhaps right to think of it as an arc, curving back to very basic human principles of fairness and equality …Reception in the mainstream media.As I’ve indicated already, I found this book to be a life-altering read. While I acknowledge that there are minor details of the story that I have quibbles about, I believe that the authors have done a wonderful service to not only those living in first world countries with scandalous and growing income inequality, but also to peoples of countries outside the top tier of economic development. Their analysis of the way in which this one factor affects, and very likely is a contributing cause, to a host of social ills presents a powerful argument for the dismantlement of modern capitalism.This conclusion, that modern capitalism is ruinous, is forcefully made by Organic Marxism and a chapter or two in (State of the World 2013). The former mostly stresses the ecological downside."

That is merely the illusion that wealth and power create.""This refreshingly well-written book, based on scientific research, makes the case for a more equal world to benefit all social strata in our modern, developed democracies. Looking at the social issues that modern societies struggle with, the authors show in comprehensive graphs and analyses that more equal societies have less violence, less teenage pregnancies, less anxiety, and higher education and well-being. Various experiments on the human psyche's need to compare and contrast status within the community show that high levels of inequality seem to trigger high levels of fear, protectionism and anxiety, as well as a need to be recklessly pursuing risky projects in order to enhance relative status within the group. Actual wealth is less determining than relative position within the comparison.The downside of a highly unequal, massively competitive society is evident: it triggers an uncontrolled consumerism which is ultimately leading to a climate catastrophe if it is not at some point reined in, and it leads to stress-related health issues which will lower life quality for great parts of society.More equality is better for humankind as a whole, but paradoxically very hard to achieve, as long as the vicious circle of status competition is not broken. A new definition of social status roles needs to be strived for:""We might hope that we will start to experience ourselves primarily as unranked members of the same society brought together in different combinations according to our various shared interests.""However, currently we still live in a world where consumerism defines desires, and where a small group of wealthy people have a disproportionate part in dictating public opinion in accordance with their status protectionism. Even though this book makes a clear and loud case for equality, I doubt that we will see any changes in mindset in the near future - the machine just keeps running, to our shared disadvantage.But hope dies last, and books like this are needed! Recommended to all of us."
3,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5617661-jan-maat,0,"This is an interesting attempt to support something like evidence based political economy. As a diagnosis of individuals and societies it is striking and impressive combining both long-term individual data from the Whitehall studies of British civil servants to country level outcome comes using World Health Organisation data.As political polemic of course it has sunk with barely a ripple. The brief controversy showed that the problem with any evidence based approach is that on the whole we prefer to stick with our prejudices than accept facts and proofs or even to have a reasonable conversation about data and directions of causation. Everybody has feelings and we can all have an emotional response to social problems and in the wide gap between that and any consideration of data, prejudices grow luxuriantly.In some ways this book contains the empirical evidence that you don't find in The Theory of the Leisure Class, it's also less polysyllabic. The flip side of this is that I don't think it is saying much if anything beyond what Veblen had to say at the dawn of the century, rather it reaches similar conclusions from the perspective of looking at the long term health of national populations.Unfortunately it is precisely because the book proves that we are cultural creatures in a social environment and sensitive to the status signals that surround us that demonstrates that the message of the book will be difficult to accept and that it will struggle to make political headway in less egalitarian societies. The way out of the downward cycle of the invidious comparison is not easy, if indeed any such exit is possible even if it was considered desirable."
4,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6257531-caroline,4,"Introduction....I have now read a detailed blog listing many arguments against this book, and whilst I still think The Spirit Level is a provocative and interesting read, I think it is best read in conjunction with the blog...http://spiritleveldelusion.blogspot.c...(or see my comment, message 25 below, for a short description of the blog).Review....This book is about statistics, so it is going to be very hard for me to convey the excitement of reading it. It IS exciting though, and figure by figure, chart by chart, it unfolds an extraordinary story. A story all about money and human welfare.It is written by two professors of epidemiology. Statisticians who got a list of the 50 richest countries in the world from the World Health Organisation. They then picked out those countries with clear information about income differences between people, and they ended up with 23 countries in total. Now for the nub of the story….looking at a wide range of factors, they found that societies where money is shared more equally between people are tons better – for everyone - than societies with big inequalities.The US and the UK come right up at the top of the list when it comes to economic inequality, along with Singapore. The countries who come out best are Japan and Scandinavia. In the latter countries their citizens have equality for completely different reasons, but these differences are irrelevant. The thing that matters is that the quality of life for people in these countries - across a whole range of factors, and throughout the different stratas of society – is infinitely better. Inequality and big wage differences obviously affect those at the bottom of society most of all, but the effect is experienced by everyone, except perhaps for the odd billionaire at the top of the pile.....and it doesn't do anyone any good. The book ends with a look at problems like global warming and environmentalism, and ways in which different practices might help countries become more sustainable and equal. The more enthusiastic corporate wallahs amongst us might want to take a tranquilliser before reading this section.I found this book utterly gripping, and difficult to put down. In spite of feelings of scepticism at the beginning, the facts are really quite astonishing and persuasive, and I found myself being won over.Herewith some links that may be of interest.1) I thought their research was good. Herewith a link to the background statistics and their methodology.https://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/reso...2) Here is a 16 minute TED lecture on the book. It’s just a taster though, and I would definitely recommend reading the book. http://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/resou...3) And here is an article in today’s Guardian talking about Britain’s inequalities…http://www.theguardian.com/business/2...Finally, I found the book full of interesting information, and include here some bits and pieces - just for my own record - that I want to remember.

In 1998 four times as many people filed for bankruptcy than did in the 1980s….. By 2002, unpaid credit card debt was $9,000 for the average card-holder….. The growth of inequality made it harder for people to maintain standards.The increased pressure to consume led people to save less and borrow more, and this happened to such an extent that the growth of consumer demand became one of the main drivers of the long economic boom and financial speculation which ended in crisis (in 2008)….”Working Hours A study of OECD countries by Sam Bowles, professor emeritus of economics at the University of Massachusetts shows that unequal countries have longer working hours. People in unequal countries do the equivalent of two or three months extra work a year.Recycling waste is done better in societies with high equalityJapan and Sweden (best)Germany and SwitzerlandFranceItalyAustraliaPortugalUSA and SpainUK (worst)Big bucks for the big guys in unequal countries“In 2007 chief executives of 365 of the largest US companies received well over 500 times the average pay of their average employee, and these difference were getting bigger… Among the Fortune 500 companies the pay gap in 2007 was close to ten times as big as it was in 1980, when the long rise in income inequality was just beginning.”Who owns whatThe 5 richest people in the UK have more in money and assets than the bottom 20% of the population.In America, the richest 20% of the population control 84% of the wealth.Homicides are worse in unequal countries”For murder rates to rise in particular places…people have to be made to feel more worthless. Then there are more fights, more brawls, more scuffles, more bottles and knives and more young men die”Danny Dorling, health geographer. There are higher levels of imprisonment in unequal countriesThis is usually due to longer prison sentences, rather than higher levels of crime. In the UK in 1990 there were 46,000 people in prison, by 2007 that figure had almost doubled, and there were 80,000 in prison. Laws which generate longer prison sentences:Three-strikes lawsMinimum mandatory sentences“Truth-in-sentencing” (i.e., no remission).Longer prison sentencing can reach ludicrous extremes….in 2004 in California there were 360 people serving life sentences for shoplifting.Several prisons in America have very harsh environments, and have been criticised by organisations like Amnesty International and the Human Rights Watch. Prisons in places like Japan and the Netherlands are much more benevolent.“You’d think countries with lower prison population per head of population would have higher rates of re-offending (i.e., they must only be imprisoning the worst criminals), but this is not the case. Instead there seems to be a higher rate of re-offending in more punitive systems e.g.UK and USA –Re-offending rates of 60-65%Sweden and Japan – Re-offending rates of 35-40%""Social Mobility and equal opportunityThis is much better in countries that are equal. America and the UK again come bottom of pile when it comes equal opportunity.“Americans, when you want to live the American dream, go to Denmark.”EducationCountries near the top of the equality table spend the most money on public education, e.g., in Norway , almost all ( 97.8%) of its spending on school education is public expenditure.

5,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1859006-john,5,"A pub quiz that asks you to name the world’s richest country seems too easy. The obvious answer – ‘the USA’ – is also the right one. It has an average income of more than $40,000 per head. But does this mean that the American dream has come true? What about if the question asked for the country with the greatest life expectancy? Or highest literacy rate? Or lowest number of infant deaths? Or lowest levels of mental illness? ‘The USA’ is not the right answer to any of these questions. But how can that be if it is the richest country in the world?Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett have uncovered an unwelcome truth about being rich. It might be OK for the rich (though even this is debateable), but it’s no good for the ordinary citizens of an otherwise rich country, if the gap between them and the rich is too large. And this where the American dream falls apart: the country is rich, but far too few people share the riches. The gap between the rich and the poor – or the rich and the average – is bigger in the US than anywhere else.What Wilkinson and Pickett do is to present the graphs in a different way. Instead of measuring progress against overall wealth, they measure it against the size of the gap between rich and poor. And – surprise, surprise – the USA turns out to have more in common with a lowly European country like Portugal than it does with Scandinavia and Japan. The Nordic countries limit the gap between the rich and poor through their taxes. In Japan, the gap is kept narrow by tradition – big Japanese corporations simply don’t pay their executives the exaggerated amounts paid in the US and – you guessed it – here in Britain. Because we come out of it badly too. While not quite as badly off as the United States, we are worse off than most of our Northern European neighbours on a whole range of indicators, including infant deaths. And the reason appears to be the same – our inequality isn’t as bad as the USA or Portugal but it’s a lot worse than most other EU countries. Embarrassingly, the average Brit can expect to live as long as the average Cuban – because Cuba might be poorer but it is much more equal and (of course) also has a comprehensive, free health service.This book covers such a range of factors – obesity, murders and even bullying (yes, we top the list!) – that it is surprising that housing is barely mentioned. Perhaps it would show Britain to be better off. No matter, the central message is the important one: societies that are more equal are better for everyone. There is hard evidence to prove it, and this book presents it in spade loads."
6,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/259402-sebastien,4,"Very solid read. Lots of great points and interesting analysis. Arguments seem well buttressed by research (although I haven't vetted any of the research so I have no idea how solid research may be or what holes there might be). That said the overall argument is strong to me, and the critiques and analysis hit a lot of notes in my political and economic philosophy. Most interesting aspect that sticks in my mind, the concept of status and status-seeking. Beyond a certain point of consumerism, getting the basic food, clothing, and shelter necessities, consumption ends up being about curating what we buy and often times leveraging these consumer items to showcase our status. It's funny because this doesn't just happen with physical goods, but also with cultural consumption. It's actually something I wonder about from time to time. The example used in this book is James Joyce, generally considered canonical high-art/literature. One has to wonder how often one consumes culture and then says they like it not merely because they like it but because of what it says about us, it is a sort of signifier of class, education, status. So if everyone starts reading and liking Joyce, author's argument is that elites will find something else to like and consume. So the idea is that elites (whether cultural, political, economic, often all intertwined) use cultural tastes as status signifiers (not only group who uses cultural tastes as signifiers, its just they are the ones with power), and if something becomes overly popular and spread throughout the mass culture it is ditched, as it loses its value as an elite status signifier, it has become democratized. Even if it is good and we like it we don't say we like it because we are better than ""the rest,"" we have higher culture and status and that separates us from the hoi polloi. Just kind of funny. Probably quite true to a point.That general point does get to fascinating concepts of cultural consumption in general. Why do we like what we like in terms of culture, how are we using it to separate and distinguish us, signify our positions, but also in reverse unite us or put us an in group, and its role in creating social cohesion? Probably gets complicated and I honestly haven't read much on the subject. But for sure my tastes are not really of my own making, part of my time, place, background, class, and who knows how much this status-seeking is entangled in liking what I like. Kind of a fun thought experiment. Or disturbing. Depending on how you view it haha!But I don't know, I do think it is counterbalanced by the fact that quality culture, quality art/literature/music eventually rises through the maelstrom regardless of how people are using these things as signifiers.This book wasn't really focused on these questions, but it got me wondering about this stuff.

8,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5862584-mike,2,"First off I am going to admit that I did not finish this book. This is exceptionally rare for me, especially with non-fiction. However, Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett have produced a work of such little serious worth that I have been compelled to cease wading through its treacle-like flow for fear of the anger it brings on causing a heart attack.Secondly, let me state plainly that I firmly believe that increased equality is advantageous to society in many, many ways. I think that an increased number of well educated, healthy people puts less of a burden on the state and pushes a society forward in terms of productivity and other measures of economic worth.So, to the review. I should have known that when Wilkinson and Picket did not title their work 'Does Equality Make Societies Better', as a serious investigation would have, but rather plastered their biases all over the front cover, that the result would be poor.Yet there is so much attempted good in here. The authors refuse to use their own measures, adopting only widely accepted scales. They draw evidence from a wide range of credible sources (the number of studies investigated is, frankly, staggering), and the work that they put in is worthy of much merit.They appear, however, to have fallen into the giant hole that secondary school pupils are told about in their first science lessons (and which applies equally to 'the dismal science' of economics) - start out assuming nothing and having left your prejudices at the door. Allow me to provide quotes to back up my view.""During the Second World War, for example, working class incomes rose by 9% while incomes of the middle class fell by 7%; rates of relative poverty were halved. The resulting sense of camaraderie and social cohesion not only led to better health - crime rates also fell."" - at no point does it seem to cross the writers' minds to investigate whether working class incomes rose because thousands and thousands of men joined the army, or to ask whether this new-found 'camaraderie' was in fact linked to the burst of patriotism that accompanied the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour and resulting conflict.At another point the authors chose several graphs to aid a point they were trying to make about the idea that ""Life expectancy is related to inequality in rich countries."" The USA and UK have greater social inequality and lower life expectancy than Scandinavian nations and Japan. Would the healthy Japanese diet or active Scandinavian lifestyle not have anything to do with this? Not a word on the subject from Wilkinson and Pickett. The argument put forward on this point reminded me of the tale of the man who woke up one morning with his shoes on, suffering from a raging headache. He deduced that falling asleep without having removed one's footwear is bad for one's health, when in fact he should have realised that drinking a lot of alcohol can result in headaches and an inability to undo shoe laces or think about undressing before bed.One more, to shuffle my tired point a little further along its path. The authors investigated mental health problems and their relation to inequality. They used many examples of what different psychologists, philosophers and economists have called 'status anxiety,' 'luxury fever,' and 'affluenza'. Apparently consumerism is to blame for mental health issues. By the time I got this far I was beginning to wonder when that great bogeyman 'consumerism' was going to have to take the fall for whatever ills the authors had discovered. Mental health issues have been around since time began, which is a small hole shot in this particular argumental boat; the vessel sinks altogether when we consider that many rich people are great consumers AND great sufferers from mental health issues - they can be confident, successful and wealthy, like buying things and STILL lack a vital chemical here or there which causes them undue sadness, depression or other mental ailment. The premise that the increase in products and related adjusted habits of the Western world is responsible for mental health crises is, at best, unproven. Few studies of undeveloped countries' issues and none of pre-consumer society exist for us to compare.In conclusion I can only say that 'The Spirit Level' proved a disappointment to the point I reached. The authors clearly had their conclusion ready before they collated the evidence and failed to adequately question many of the findings to which they came. I regret that such an opportunity to rightly demonstrate that equality is good has been squandered, but squandered it has been and I can only compare the work of Wilkinson and Pickett to that of scientists who falsify climate change data to support their agenda - the result is quite the opposite.This book has been saved from the dustbin of 1* only because nothing is as bad as Jack Kerouac's 'On The Road'."
9,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1823794-jeff,2,"I would have liked the book more if the data sets presented were complete. In numerous graphs the critera is ""more equal vs less equal"" or ""better vs worse"" etc. This is not what I would consider rigorous presentation of the data. Additionally, when a graph did have a numerical scale it would not encompass the total bounds of possible values. For example instead of a graph being on a scale from 0% to 100%, it would instead be something like 20 to 60%, showing a much more drastic relationship than exists in reality.I also feel like the graph data was selected fairly arbitrarily, including only certain countries while leaving out others. In some cases just leaving the US and UK out of the set would imply no or extremely weak correlations to the accompanying point in the text.While I agree that society should be more equitable, I find that the way the supporting evidence is presented is the wrong way to present this point.In the end it was okay: 2 stars."
10,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1045774-mehrsa,5,Turns out there’s really good data that inequality hurts everyone. Even the winners. 
11,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2309246-cassandra-kay-silva,5,"Equality is one of those things that is hard to define. This book takes a look at equality from a mostly financial perspective. It also explores the level of equality in opportunities, education and a few other levels. First of all this book is fabulous. If you are a massive factoid type who loves seeing another way to look at adjoining facts this will be pure pleasure for you. (Please excuse the ridiculousness of some of the graphs that have been dumbed down however). My only one wish for this work would have been a more comprehensive look at the societies themselves and how their own determinations of the ""haves"" and ""have nots"" may play a role in the way that people approach or feel about their quality of life. I think a great majority of this is specific social factors, not only of the LEVEL of the equality but the social environments that tend to garner the expectation of ""fairness"". Remember when you were a child and you used to say to your dad ""but that's just not fair!"" and dad would answer with ""sorry kid life's just not fair"" and that was it? How has this changed over the years? How has our perspective on fairness overall changed? How do different cultures approach the question of what actually is fair and ""equal"" if you will, and what expectations do we have from government, society, and ourselves? I think there is a lot more to this topic that would be worth exploring. "
12,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/472694-e,5,"I'm not wild about the title. I adore the subtitle.Because ""equality"" covers it all. Unlike communism, socialism, feminism, civil rights, or human rights, ""equality"" demands the same result for everyone, while appealing to our modern, individualist obsessions with happiness and egoism. I don't know how many cynics will be converted by this book, but I'm convinced it's our best bet."
13,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22378179-simon-wood,5,"INEQUALITY CORRODES SOCIETY Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett have put the question of inequality under the spotlight in their fine study, ""The Spirit Level: Why Equality is Better for Everyone"". The focus of their efforts is on the richer nations, essentially those that are in the OECD. They make a strong case for the correlation between the amount of inequality in a country, and the incidence of a number of social problems ranging from teenage pregnancies and drug use, to life expectancy, depression and obesity. Not only that, but they make a case for the fact that people across all income levels in the more equal societies benefit - not just those at the lower income levels.Wilkinson and Pickett buttress their assertions with a vast array of data. In some cases the correlation between inequality and social problems is very strong, for example between income inequality and rates of imprisonment, in others it is merely pretty strong. There are a few exceptions, but the general case for the link between inequality and a variety of damaging social problems is concluisively made.Identifying the reason for link between inequality and social problems, disentangling cause and effect, is more problematic. The authors make quite strong cases in some instances, but in others the link is of a more speculative. More studies evidently need to be carried out.The moral of this story: that inequality is damaging to society seems self-evident, at least to this reader. The novelty in this book is the volume of data accumulated to back the argument, and the number of social issues examined. It puts defenders of the unequal societies we live in, particularly the Anglo-Saxon countries, on the back foot during any discussions of inequality. One can see this vividly expressed if one clicks on the one-star reviews of this book, the paucity of the response is impressive.On the downside, it was a disappointment that only rich countries were fully investigated, though the volume and quality of data available from these countries is no doubt of a more comprehensive nature. Certainly (from the data at the beginning of the book) the correlation between social indicators and inequality in less developed countries appears just as, if not more, damaging. The ideas that the authors propose for remedying the situation are of a tentative nature, and rightly so. They are presenting the data; it is the responsibility of society at large to debate these issues, and hopefully for the debate to go beyond the platitudes of the professional political class, the constraints imposed by the corporate media, and other vested interests in an unequal society. To this end the authors along with others have formed the Equality Trust, details of which are in the book.A fine book, which clearly presents arguments and data in a way that should be clear to even the most statistically challenged reader. Other books that examine the links between wealth and social problems that are worth reading include those by Oliver James who has been probing these issues, particularly with regard to mental health, for a number of years (see ""Affluenza"" and ""The Selfish Capitalist: Origins of Affluenza"")."
14,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/911636-j,0,"This book has two big ideas in one, both of which the authors provide data-driven support for: 1) Improving life in countries where national income per person is greater than $10 - $20K will not come from an increase in income. Which leads to this page 11 excerpt: ""We are the first generation to have to find new answers to the question of how we can make further improvements to the real quality of human life. What should we turn to if not economic growth?""2) The book's answer to its own question above: greater equality. This is the bulk of the book. It makes a detailed case that takes data from several countries and connects inequality with levels of trust, mental health and drug use, physical health, life expectancy, education, teen birth rates, violence, social mobility and incarceration rates. It leads up to this optimism (pg 261): ""The relationships between inequality and the prevalence of health and social problems shown in earlier chapters suggest that if the United States was to reduce its income inequality to something like the average of the four most equal of the rich countries (Japan, Norway, Sweden and Finland), the proportion of the population feeling they could trust others might rise by 75 per cent -- presumably with matching improvements in the quality of community life; rates of mental illness and obesity might similarly each be cut by almost two-thirds, teenage birth rates could be more than halved, prison populations might be reduced by 75 per cent, and people could live longer while working the equivalent of two months less per year.""Some ideas about how to do this politically and socially are offered when they break away from the main purpose of the book, to diagnose and support the diagnosis.I'm not 100% convinced that inequality causes things like low trust levels and so on. But if the data analysis is right, inequality is tightly linked to seemingly very disparate phenomena across grossly dissimilar cultures (Japan, Sweden, US, Singapore, and others). Because the problems studied would appear to be totally unrelated if it weren't for the one thing binding them, inequality, I remain quite receptive to the possibility that inequality causes them. Based on this book, I certainly do not doubt it.One of the most interesting findings is that inequality hurts everybody in society, not just those at the bottom.My other criticism is lack of rigor in the graphs. Labeling graph axes with ""low"" and ""high"" is unacceptable: there should be a number with its unit of measurement. Where are the r values for the linear fits? I understand that the book is for mass consumption and most people would be put off with too much of this stuff, but the authors could have put it in an appendix, I think.P.S.: Stats are published on the book's website here."
15,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/351840-jason,1,"I read this book because John thought I would find it interesting. It was very painful to read for me, because it is one of those books that tries to make an argument but begins by making assumptions and statements that I either don't understand or don't agree with. The book starts by saying ""We believe A, B, C, and D"" and then building if-then statements to get to their conclusion, Z (which they helpfully provide as a subtitle). Unfortunately, axioms B and C are sketchy and D is just plain wrong, so then I spent the rest of the book gritting my teeth and muttering ""disgusting"" to myself at some of the more egregious statements.The book makes the argument that everything wrong with societies can be traced to their level of inequality. They posit that inequality causes everything from obesity to high teen birth rates to crime to basically everything that can be wrong with a society. It's written, as many books of the policy argument genre are, in a style that's designed to preach to the choir. It's designed to provide statistics and examples to those who already buy its thesis. It is similar in this way to books that argue for creationism. If you're skeptical of the thesis, as I was, the book falls apart. As it opens and explains how to read a two-parameter graph, I felt a disquiet. If your audience doesn't understand graphs, so that you have to write a prelude about how to read them, that implies that they won't understand how you can very effectively deceive someone with graphical representation.I made it through the book by playing the ""What are they NOT saying"" game. When they make a claim or show a graph or quote a statistic, what are they not including because it doesn't support their case. Nine times out of ten, the unsaid material was on graphs. I don't know how you can write a book about societies in general and have three data points: The US, Japan, and Europe. They make the graphs pretty by breaking Europe into its component states, but really they have about a hundred graphs that are these three data points. Hilariously, even some of their graphs don't support the conclusions they draw. Some of the graphs look like a shotgun target, but they've helpfully drawn a line through the center so that you can draw the right conclusion. This was where I got a good grin. If you've drawn your conclusion at the title of the book, there's no surprises when you look at the data, no matter how scattershot it is.Anyway, my fundamental criticism is that they claim that unequal societies ""do worse"" but immediately exclude countries that don't fit their conclusion, leaving the US, Japan and Europe. Again, the comedy comes later in the book when they try to draw conclusions (e.g. in the section on sustainability) and they need more than these three data points, THEN they bring in a bunch of other countries. Why does Qatar show up on those graphs and not the earlier ones? ""It's not a rich, developed country"" which is defined such that only their three points get counted.I would summarize the book as deeply flawed. Their conclusion may indeed be correct, but I'm skeptical. They support it very poorly. They don't address evidence that contradicts their conclusion (other countries, the Bush administration, etc). They spend a paragraph explaining that although crime is worse in unequal societies, the fact that crime rates in the US have been dropping steadily since the early 90s doesn't hurt them because (wave hands) it's had an uptick recently. *cough*bullshit.It's good to read something that I wouldn't choose for myself, but either I'm deeply cynical, too smart to be railroaded into a conclusion, or just closeminded. Take your pick for why I didn't like the book.EDIT 10/08/09: I thought of a better thesis for this book: More racist societies are always more equal. The Japanese are some of the most racial puritans on the planet, and if you don't see a blonde person in Scandanavia then you aren't in Scandanavia. My point is that racial mixing is a surrogate for diversity, which includes a diversity of backgrounds, which leads to inequality. Thus, the ""bad things"" in a society could be the result of racial diversity, whereas perhaps the author's ideal equal society would be the racially pure and economically just Nazi Germany."
16,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1489622-dave-golombek,4,"I managed to somehow agree with most of what the book said, while being constantly infuriated by how they presented it. The book gets 3 stars, the ideas in it get 5 stars. First, the bad. The book is filled with graphs on which one or BOTH axes are labeled low to high, with no numbers. They don't get around to addressing the differences between correlation and causality until two-thirds of the way through the book. They don't include much in the way of policy suggestions or concrete ways to address the problems they discuss, or or the mechanisms by which the effects work.All of that being said, I do actually believe they collected and displayed a lot of very good data on a very tricky subject. They basically say that many of our disparate social problems (crime rates, teen pregnancy, health care, social isolation, etc) are all highly influenced by the level of inequality between rich and poor within a society. That's a really interesting claim, one that is pretty new and original AFAIK (not being an expert in this field), and has a lot of policy implications. And it's certainly inspiring to think that addressing one issue could help solve many others. Not that it's an easy problem to solve, but it's tractable. This book has garnered some serious reviews, and it's enemies (The Spirit Level Delusion by Snowdon) make me take it even more seriously. Now the question is how to get policy and society to move in the direction this book recommends. I'm still thinking about that part. "

This isn’t a criticism per se, just an advisory that this is best read over a longer period, perhaps a chapter at a time.

19,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14941179-anna,4,"I am five years behind the curve in reading this book. I’ve put it off because I don’t need convincing of its thesis; I already thought that more unequal societies were worse. Still, it’s well known and much-cited, so I’ve finally got round to it. Needless to say, I found its arguments convincing and was impressed with the range of evidence marshalled. As always with such books, accessibility has resulted some slight sacrifice in academic rigour - I would have liked to see some p-values for the regressions. They could have stuck them in the notes & references for social science nerds like me. I also wondered at all the strictly linear correlations - no polynomials? These are mere nitpicks, though. I was initially surprised and slightly baffled by the book’s claims to be apolitical and evidence-based, whilst presenting a very strong argument against capitalism in general and neoliberal capitalism in particular. You can protest neutral objectivity all you like, but in social science there is absolutely no such thing. This is a political book and there is no point in denying it. In chapter 13, the writers comment on alternative explanations to income inequality for their findings. One of them is neoliberalism, which is dismissed because although it may well have caused increases in inequality, it did not intend to! I found this astonishing. Income inequality probably didn’t intend to cause worse health, education, and crime outcomes either. The key point here is that it’s incredibly naive to assume that evidence of negative implications is sufficient to get neoliberal policies changed. Such a view ignores power relations, institutional structures, and the nature of neoliberalism as an ideology. Neoliberalism sees high levels of inequality as an inevitable and acceptable part of economic activity. This professed apolitical stance is then tossed aside in the final two chapters, the former of which deals with climate change. It includes a graph I’ve seen before, comparing Human Development Index (HDI, which measures Gross National Product, life expectancy, and education levels) scores with ecological footprint per capita. One country in the world manages to reach the threshold of ‘high’ HDI whilst remaining within the average world biocapacity. Guess which one! It’s Cuba, which has been governed by a Communist dictatorship since 1965. Infant mortality rates and life expectancy there are almost identical to those of the USA. This fact causes me a certain morbid amusement. Costa Rica also does well for good reasons.The climate change chapter was serviceable overall but inevitably superficial. The final chapter, titled 'Building the Future', was the most interesting to me. It faced up to the difficulties of creating more equal societies, noted that various policy approaches exist, and suggests some specific examples. I was pleased by the admissions that economic growth is a substitute for equality and that a steady-state economy is key to tackling climate change. The discussion of employee-owned firms was interesting, however it is unclear to me how massive multinational corporations could ever transition to such a model. As the writers concede, the ‘basic amorality of the market’ is a critical stumbling block to reducing consumerism, protecting the environment, and prioritising equality over economic growth. I also couldn’t help noting a certain contradiction in the commentary on rich countries that are already relatively equal, such as Sweden and Japan. In each case, the political impetus for pursuing equality was some sort of massive upheaval; in several cases, a world war. Despite this, the writers state hopefully that a transformative reorientation towards equality can be achieved incrementally, without revolution. I wish this was the case but find it hard to believe, especially considering the scale of change needed to reduce carbon emissions. I am being critical of this book, but not because I didn’t like it or don’t agree with what it’s saying. It’s because I wish there was a simple answer to the acute and entrenched problems of inequality and climate change. There isn’t and a plausible complex answer hasn’t yet emerged either. (If it has, let me know ASAP!) ‘The Spirit Level’ is an excellent introduction and very useful contribution to the debate, though. I think it is a lot more anti-capitalist than it dares to admit. Presumably this is elided in order not to cause undue alarm. I was pleasantly surprised by the importance placed on climate change and the eventual recognition of vested interests as a serious barrier to change. Sadly, I can’t help feeling that since 2009 equality has receded further. In the UK, certainly, the Coalition government has worsened the situation - here’s a paper on that. ‘The Spirit Level’ is well worth reading, I just wish it had left me in a more optimistic frame of mind."
20,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18293816-bill-leach,4,"Part 1 - Material Success, Social Failure1. The end of an Era- mainstream politics has moved from considerations of the quality of society- most citizens are concentrating on improving their own position within society2. Poverty or Inequality- ratio between richest 20% and poorest 20% varies from around 4 in Japan and Scandanavia to 7 for the UK and 8 for the US - Canada is almost 6- health and social problems are closely related to inequality in rich countries- ""where income differences are bigger, social distances are bigger and social stratification more important""- ""income inequality reflects how hierarchical societies are""- ""greater equality ... is the key to improving the well-being of the entire population""3. How Inequality Gets Under the Skin- indications are that inequality results in greater anxiety, and affects self esteem- inequality results in greater stress which affects people's mental and physical health- social status affects pride, resulting in variation in lifestyle choices- social status affects the way people evaluate each otherPart 2 - Costs of Inequality4. Community Life and Social Relations- inequality is a social divider, and the less we have to do with others the less we trust them- trust levels vary inversely with inequality from 60% in Scandanavia to to < 40% in the US and 20% in Singapore- in the US trust has fallen from 60% in 1960 to < 40% by 2004- women's status and foreign aid are also vary inversely with inequality5. Mental Health and Drug Use- mental illness varies with inequality from < 10% in Japan to 25% in the US- illegal drug use is more common in inequal countries- it is postulated that inequality causes a feeling of subordination in the have-nots, resulting in mental illness and resorting to drug use6. Physical Health and Life Expectancy- low job status is correlated with heart disease and other chronic illnesses- life expectancy varies inversely with inequality; infant mortality varies with inequality- it is postulated that inequality increases stress which causes adverse health effects7. Obesity- ""Fat is a class issue"" - obesity is more common among the poor than the rich- obesity varies with inequality - obesity varies from 10-15% in Scandanavia to > 20% in the UK and 30% in the US- it is posited that stress affects appetite and fat deposition processes in the body- obesity does not seem to be caused by a lack of nutritional information, as it occurs over all educational levels- obesity appears to affect people's assessment of their self-worth8. Educational Performance- illiteracy varies inversely with inequality; high school dropout rates vary with inequality- literacy varies with parent's education more steeply in those countries where inequality is great- countries with stronger social institutions, such as daycare, parental leave, family allowance, social housing, etc. show better education success- educational aspirations are less with lower income levels, but are lesser yet in countries of higher inequality9. Teenage Births- teenage birthrates vary with inequality from < 10% in Scandanavia (many are married) to 30% in the UK and 50% in the US (< 25% married)- discussion on how teenage birth leads to lesser education and employment10. Violence- violence often results from threats to pride and status- violence varies with inequalitybook11. Imprisonment- imprisonment varies with inequality from < 100 per 100,000 in Scandanavia to 576 in the US- due to longer sentences and imprisonment for crimes that would otherwise have been addressed with fines / community service- number of police and security personnel varies from 181 per 100,000 to 450 in Portugal- hardened attitude in highly inequal countries leads to poorer prison conditions and hardening of criminals12. Social Mobility- difficult to measure but data is presented suggesting that social mobility (the ability to change one's place in society) varies inversely with inequality- this would appear to result from possessions and expenditures acting as cultural markersPart 3 - A Better Society13. Dysfunctional Societies- the above problems in inequal societies are not restricted to the poor but are distributed over all classes within the society - therefore improvement benefits everyone in the society- explores why some societies are inequal - each seems to have it's own story - no relationship to characteristics of the people (such as ethnicity) is found- causality is explored, showing that the ills are caused by equality as opposed to the inequality causing the ills14. Our Social Inheritance- social stratification and friendship are opposites - friend or foe- our dual inheritance results from both- over human history, most societies have been egalitarian - inequal societies are exceptional- sharing, fairness and trust have been factors in the development of equal societies-15. Equality and sustainability- some countries attain acceptable living standards with a sustainable economy (low carbon footprint) - therefore others should- discusses carbon rations, new technology, innovation, consumerism, recycling- suggests that more equal societies are more likely to achieve sustainability16. Building the Future- governments have enacted policies to improve social conditions and equality when they have needed to gain legitimacy- seems unclear as to what leads to inequality - change in norms and political outlook""- studies from the UK and US show that many would like a more equal society- discusses the role of corporations increasing inequality, but the authors seem to believe that trade unions increase equality (no mention of the extreme salaries that unions have obtained for their members)- no discussion of other self interest processes, such as lobbying- the large size of the non-profit sector is described, including municipal utilities, universities, hospitals, building societies, etc- employee owned businesses are presented as having large advantages over corporations, even suggesting improved morality- need a movement toward greater equality- authors clearly believe the self-interest of the rich is a big issue - ""we can stand up to"" them- speak to the importance of ""creating the political will""Postscript - Research Meets Politics- a review of the reception and reaction to the original book, and more recent data is presented"

22,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1874626-kara,3,"I wanted to be able to give this book 5 stars simply because I believe that it is morally right for societies to have a small gap between rich and poor (and morally reprehensible that some of the most advanced nations, like the USA, have huge gaps between the haves and the have nots). All people have the right to the basic necessities of life -- in our modern societies that includes things like clean water to drink, fresh air to breathe, a high likelihood of survival into late adulthood, access to and an appreciation for quality education, the availability of healthy and fresh food, and adequate health care (especially preventative care with a regular doctor). While I believe that Pickett and Wilkinson, the epidemiologists who authored this book, have their facts correct and their hearts in the right place, this book simply preaches to the converted. Their own academic papers, and the ones they cite in this book, appear to be statistically rigorous, but this book is not. None of their graphs with best-fit lines have regression analyses, and many of the statistics they cite in the text lack any sort of significance tests. Perhaps they tried to keep things simple for the average reader; unfortunately, they over-simplified their arguments and thus failed to concisely or convincingly explain just why it is that societies whose citizens are more equal (have less disparate levels of monetary wealth) are more likely to have citizens who are live longer, healthier lives. In addition, the prose is often repetitive, that at times veers towards the condescending. If it weren't for the last third of the book, which prompted me to think about what I can do to promote a more equal society -- how can I curtail conspicuous consumerism, why do I believe so strongly in the redistribution of wealth, who are the people that have the most power to change our society -- I would have given this book 2 stars. So, while I endorse the idea that societies with smaller differences between the rich and poor are better, I cannot recommend this book to those friends of mine who aren’t such ardent supporters of income redistribution. I can however, recommend that interested parties (and even those who don’t know if they are interested) visit the authors’ website: http://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/ where they can learn the gist of the Spirit Level argument, view a PowerPoint summary of their research, and even join discussions and forums with those of us who are committed to alleviating the disparities between rich and poor."
23,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55163554-emre-sevin,5,"The evidence and argumentation is strong in this one. The core idea is simple and powerful, it reveals itself in many aspects of many different societies with very different institutional systems. The core idea is that humans long for better conditions, not only in the sense of absolute material conditions (so, please stop repeating ""but hey, global poverty levels are down, time to celebrate!"", because nobody is arguing against that), but in the sense of relative psychological and sociological security, solidarity, and trust, achieved by low level of inequality.The question is simple: if you really had the choice, what kind of society would you like to live in? A society where there's more trust, more solidarity, better mental and physiological health, less crime, and less depression and anxiety, or a society that is worse in those aspects? It is not very difficult to come up with an answer. The authors take a lot of data sets and many different countries, after which they proceed to show the relationships between the aspects above and inequality levels. Their conclusion is clear: having huge levels of inequality does not lead to very healthy societies. Correlation is of course not causation, and the book has a separate chapter discussing finer points that lead to its conclusions. Taken together with another book, Inequality: What Can Be Done?Inequality: What Can Be Done?, the time is overdue to focus our perspective on helping each other and ourselves to have healthier environments, both mentally and physically, worth living in. Many great accomplishments start with a small, simple, and powerful idea; and if we'll have a better future, then this book will be among the valuable few that put forward the idea of ""less inequality, healthier society""."
24,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2976142-thomas-edmund,5,"Despite sounding like a B-grade supernatural fantasy thriller, The Spirit Level is a non-fiction work that aggregates scientific evidence on societal equality. In a nutshell the point is: More equal societies do better, especially on outcomes that show hierarchical effects. (for example education level is predicted by income status, and thus overall educational achievement is predicted by that countries equality. The book doesn’t begin as a total nightmare for those of right-wing persuasion however by the last section where the authors discuss the solutions to inequality economic conservatives’ stomachs must turn. In saying that the authors are quick to point out that far-left politics is not necessarily the only way to achieve equality and also offer many solutions at a lower level and thus untainted by political ideology. Each chapter also provides brief insights into some social ills, my favourite chapter was the scathing condemnation of modern prison systems, definitely a difficult read for anyone who considers themselves ‘tough on crime’ The Spirit Level is well written, not over-simplified but with layman level clarity. The book is must read for absolutely anyone who cares about anything. It’s almost too obvious to say that left-leaning readers will likely prefer this book, but The Spirit Level is no political-polemic, it is a fact-based altruistic attempt to understand society and how we can do better. "
25,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4963339-evelyn,4,"The title of this book is pretty self-explanatory, as two academics present their case for why equality benefits the whole of society. Their chapters look at a range of common subjects (mental health, obesity and health issues, drug abuse, education, unemployment, prisons, crime, teenage pregnancies etc) and have found that inequality is one of the key (if not the main) determining factors as to why these problems are so prevalent in our modern societies.The evidence for their findings are outlined in chapters with lots of corresponding scatter graphs which show the direct correlations and they have cross-referenced a lot of different countries to show how inequality is causing these problems around the world for often the same reasons.Reading this wasn't a surprise as it's easy to see the links if one wants to see them (they're not hard to find), but I found it interesting and informative all the same. It does come across as an academic study so it's a little dry in places, though with a book like this, it's to be expected. If you want to find out more about this pressing issue, definitely give it a read. "
26,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22591633-zanna,5,"Compelling presentation of evidence that more equal societies have better health and social outcomes, such as trust, life expectancy, violence and child well-being. These benefits affect all income levels, not only the poorest, and are unrelated to GDP. The authors point out that increasing wealth has not benefited people beyond the level where basic needs are met, but that increasing equality brings significant benefits. They also link their case to the sustainability imperative.I can't rate this highly enough! Arguing for egalitarian economics is an uphill struggle against people who support deregulated neo-liberal capitalism, because it has its own myths about all boats rising, aspiration, scroungers and so on. Here's the data to grab in those debates where your interlocutor says 'it's nice to be idealistic but...'"
27,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3186291-leon-m,5,"I reread the book during the last days and this is what I've come up with as a review. If you want it in one line, take the review of The Economist, a notoriously right-wing newspaper, saying that ""The evidence is hard to dispute"". From The Economist, this means a lot!--In „The Spirit Level“, Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett discuss the new evidence that strongly points at inequality as determining factor for most of the social and health problems present in contemporary societies. Before this new paradigm can be examined in detail, it first has to be proven that the factor traditionally thought to be the single most important influence on such problems has stopped to make a relevant influence: average standards of living. Concerning this aspect, modern societies are subject to the law of diminishing returns (a basic concept in utilitarianism that says the first cookie will bring you more happiness than the second one): But „not only have the measures of well-being and happiness stopped to increase with economic growth but […] there have been long-term rises in rates of anxiety, depression and numerous other social problems“ (p.5-6).Plotting the relation between income inequality and a so-called „Index of Health and Social Problems“ on a scatter-graph, the authors prove the correlation between the two factors. This correlation, however, is only present for contemporary rich societies (the authors chose the 50 richest countries for the graphs, excluding countries with populations below 3 million and excluding those countries for which there was no comparable data on income inequality): LEDCs still have a lot to gain from economic growth.How can inequality have such a big influence on countries' performances on the Index of Health and Social Problems? The first cautious approach of explaining this correlation with a causal link is the idea of a social evaluative threat increasing in frequency with the inequality of a society. In more unequal societies, comparisons with other individuals are more common-place because everyone tends to have an attitude of displaying superiority towards inferiors („bicycling effect“).Social evaluative threats are stressful events, leading to a evolutionary fight-or-flight response of the body, involving higher levels of cortisol and other bodily changes. This fight-or-flight response makes sense to activate energy in dangerous situations but in unequal societies it leads to a constant state of stress (due to the abundance of social evaluative threats). Because of this constant stress, more unequal societies score worse on indicators of health.With mental illnesses, both legal and illegal drug use (and abuse) increase. There has been an attempt to prove a causation between one's position in the social hierarchy and the use of drugs in a experiment with monkeys: Monkeys with a lower social position will dispense more cocaine for themselves, supposedly to make up for the social pain of having a low status. A similiar relation is suspected between obesity – acting as substitue satisfaction for a low social status – and income inequality.For obesity, however, there is another quite important hypothesis closely related to the idea of stress resulting from social evaluative threats: the thrifty phenotype. The concept is basically that if mothers are stressed during pregnancy – as they would be if they had a lot of social evaluative threats to cope with – there child would be adapted to a world in which food is scarce: This makes evolutionary sense but has a devastating effect on the child's performance in our affluent societies.Also closely linked to the social evaluative threat hypothesis is the causal link between income inequality and violence. As James Gilligan tells us, almost all violent crimes are the result of a feeling of shame and humiliation. It is interesing to see that almost only men in a certain age commit violent crimes: This is probably due to the fact that their reproductive strategy focuses on social status (unlike women who focus on looks). A loss of social status means lower chances of reproduction, so it makes evolutionary sense to defend one's status even at the danger of losing one's life. Another reason for violence are overcompensatory masculine behaviour in fartherless homes.Not only the amount of violent crimes but also the prison population is correlated with the amount of inequality in a society. This is not only because more crimes are comitted in such societies, but also because they tend to be a lot harsher with their sentences: As of 2004, 360 shoplifters were serving life-long sentences in California. The USA also uses methods like the 'supermax' prison (prolonged solitary confinement), which has even be condemned by the UN Commission against Torture. This stands in harsh contrast to penal systems in Japan and Sweden, where the expression of remorse is generally trusted to be a genuine one. Interestingly enough, the harsher punishments of unequal societies do not push down re-offending rates: quite the opposite. It seems that penal systems in more equal countries were designed in consultation with experts, whereas penal systems in more unequal countries are the result of media pressure.Teenage births are also related to inequality (overall fertility is not), and their causal link is quite similiar to the thrifty phenotype hypothesis used to explain the prevalence of obesity in more unequal states: The idea is that early childhood experience determines whether girls (sub-consciously) choose a quantity reproductive strategy (which they do if they feel relationships not to be rewarding and think of people as not trustworthy) or a quality reproductive strategy (if they feel the opposite). A quantity strategy will lead to earlier biological maturity as well as sexual activity.Concerning educational performance, again, the causal link breaks down to the social evaluative threat hypothesis: Children perform better when they are certain theat they can succeed – feelings of pride are created and the brain chemistry responds. If kids are suspected to perform worse than average, however, they will do so: This has been proven in experiments with low and high-caste kids from India (low-caste performed worse only when they were announced as low-caste) as well as in Jane Elliot's experiment with school-children: Told that brown-eyed children are better in school than blue-eyed, this imaginary fact suddenly became true. It even worked when the children were told that the teacher had got the information mixed up and it was the other way round: Suddenly, the blue-eyed children performed better. So kids do better when they are expected to perform better and this can only be the case when there is no high level of competition in the class-room. A high level of competition, on the other hand, may not lead to higher educational attainment, but it does lead to higher aspirations.As a last factor, social mobility is discussed in the book and shown to be related to income inequality: This is a result of the more rigid social structure (bicycling effect again) in more unequal countries. It means that equality of opportunity and income inequality are contradictory values: I wonder, what the liberals will say about that!One of the interesting implications of the findings is that one can predict a country's overall performance by one single indicator of social well-being: They are all closely related to one factor, after all. Comparing equal and unequal countries, it becomes obvious that the positive effects of equality are shared among the great majority of people: Sweden's lowest class still scores better on infant mortality than the UK's highest one. Taking this both findings together, it is clear that societies tend to fall into one of two categories: socially functional and socially dysfunctional.The theory has been examined by 200 different studies, the overwhelming majority of which came to the conclusion that it holds true. It also predicted a mechanism that creates a causal link between income inequality and social and health problems long before this causal link had been found. The idea that the causal direction runs the other way, with social problems causing inequality, is improbable and can be dismissed on the grounds that people with a high income still do better in more equal societies than in more unequal ones. After all, the idea that inequality is socially corrosive is intuitively right.But if equality is to be the goal, can it be achieved? The authors' thesis is that there are two modes of survival humans are able to use: competition and cooperation, social status or friendship. Economic experiments such as the 'ultimatum game' show that people tend to use both, maybe a bit more cooperation out of their feeling for fairness. Comparing humans to other primates, we are (and the comparison holds true for the relevant chunk of DNA) like bonobos and unlike chimpanzees: the latter have a rigid social system and solve their problems with a clear distribution of power. There are also countless biological examples that show an inherent human ability for cooperation: Just think of mirror neurons or hormons that cause a higher level of trust (which is reciprocal right on the biological level). Also: Studies have shown that social exclusion is processed by the same parts of the brain as physical pain is. This makes a strong evolutionary argument for an inherent human ability to cooperate.But, if we have the chance to attain a mixture of both, cooperation and competition, who makes the decision which survival mode is predominant? It's probably – and again the comparison to the thrifty phenotype hypothesis – a result of epigenetic processes in the early childhood, determined by the amount of stress.The goals of a sustainable and a socially friendly future are really complementary. They explain that, while at the moment only few countries combine high HDI with below average CO2 emissions (most notably Cuba), technology should be able to support industrialized rich countries in achieving this goal. But technology alone will not help, because higher efficiency only results in higher amounts of consumption if there is no change of ideology. Equality as the new ideology would lower levels of consumption and increase general levels of well-being: In the book Happiness, the idea is proposed that the rich impose a certain cost on society by creating social dissatisfaction. The main engine of consumption is status level competition as studies have shown (people would give away half of their income if everybody else gave away more) and has long been suspected (Veblen's Theory of the Leisure Class). From a policy perspective, tradable individual carbon quotas seem to be the best way to enforce both sustainability and equality without too much of an interruption of normal life. Now that it is obvious that more equal societies are not only achievable and a good target to aim for but actually even needed if we don't want to ruin our planet, the last question has to be asked: How to achieve them? The authors propose employee-ownership and participatory management as factors that help achieve equality and are independent of the ups and downs of political will. The idea is that not only do such schemes of employee participation enable a process of social emancipation, but they do also put income inequality under democratic control, redistribute wealth from shareholders to employees and improve productivity, giving such companies the chance to survive on a real market. Apart from this idea, they point to the decreasing marginal costs of nearly all products and argue that it will probably lead to less income-based discrimination anyway.In a nutshell, this book tells the story of two scientists. They observed the data, drew conclusions, tested them, drew new conclusions, sought after ways that explained their conclusions, and - after years of research – have found the solution to most problems in our societies: more equality. This might be an intuitive truth, but I am sure that millions of people will reject it even after they have seen the hard evidence. ----(review after first reading it)This book explains in detailed reasoning why equal societies are better for everyone. The focus in the main part is on the relation between income inequality and different indicators of well-being in a society (like obesity, average educational performance, violence etc.): They all tend to be worse in a society with higher income inequality. But this is not only a statistical analysis of these trends but rather a full blown analysis of the question WHY these factors relate to inequality.But the main part was not what fascinated me about this book. What fascinated me were the conclusions: That economic growth should be limited or even stopped as it no longer increases the well-being of people in the developed societies. That equality and the fight for a sustainable economy have a strong link. That we should try to achieve this equal society by introducing benefits for employee-owned and managed firms.The message of this book is crystal clear: Equality!"

Kate and Richard use simple to read graphs and lead the reader through a variety of potential analysis before explaining why they have interpreted the data their way. They also provide several potential solutions to the inequality conundrum and (in the new edition) provide arguments against their critics.You can buy this wonderful book on US Amazon here: http://amzn.com/1608193411INTRODUCTIONI've read quite a few non-fiction books over the years, but this is my first time reviewing one. Generally speaking, the mileage one gets out of these books, I find, is determined by your political leanings. If you come with an uncertain mind and intellectual curiosity, I think this book will add significantly to your knowledge. If you're already left / liberal / progressive leaning (as I am) then there won't be a significant disconnect between the evidence presented and your worldview. However, if you are conservative / right wing / libertarian then there is definitely going to be some mental barriers to accepting the theories proposed.Therefore, the purpose of this review is not to say if you will enjoy it. I plan on outlining why I agreed with his data, if I enjoyed it and any areas that I found lacking for a non-fiction research book.WRITINGThe writing is crisp, clean and easily accessible to academics and the curious. Although, in saying that, I'm glad I did a statistical course at university several years ago so that I was familiar with statistical terminology: correlation and causation, outliers and so on. At the start I felt a little overwhelmed and had to wait until my brain recollected all the lessons that I tried not to sleep through about statistics before I could really get into it.The structure is pretty simple: There's an outline at the start of what Kate and Richard intend to show and how they sampled the data, several chapters where they delve into the minuscule details and outline for each situation on why they believe what they do and then a summary. Part III is a series of suggestions for how we can get back to an equal society. That's technically the end of the book, but they've added a couple of sections to rebut the arguments made against them and then provide a link to their website which explains their position in more detail.There's also an index and reference section. Essential for a non-fiction book.I know that they kept it at a research level to stop criticism of halo effect and emotional manipulation but sometimes the theory is just too much. Talking about how equality decreases crime, for example, is a really good chapter but what does that actually mean? What does it mean to the thousands of people in jail and what does it mean to a person where a criminal is rehabilitated?I wanted to know and I have no stories to argue to my parents. All I can say is, 'If CEOs earn less then we can live in a community of trust.' But what does that mean to them? What does trust mean in these other countries?That's my only gripe. I really enjoyed the way Kate and Richard would talk about the other reasons for the problems in certain countries and show how these explanations doesn't correlate with the data before presenting their arguments. I think that was a good way to remove my questions, and also ensure that I wasn't tainted by their argument first.STATISTICS and CONTENTI've seen the other book on Amazon: The Spirit Level Delusion: Fact-checking the Left's new theory of everything by Christopher Snowdown so I looked for statistical manipulation and 'cherry picking' of data. I couldn't see any. What I mean by my previous statement is that Kate and Richard are very transparent (as most academics are) with their data and methodology. They list their sources (300 of them!) and explain why they did certain things (their methodology). As best as I could tell, their data sets conformed to statistical standards and they showed situations where the theory didn't match up to reality. (Always the sign of an honest academic).The data they've used was collected from reputable sources and peer reviewed journals. They looked at cultural factors and discussed weak correlations. I mean, it's a theory with pretty robust models but if you want to check each thesis then you should look at their references. All the data is there for us to have an intelligent debate about. Why you would need to buy a book that contains an implied threat (and descriptive phrase) in the title to check it is beyond me.I was impressed and the conclusions, for me, were surprising. I came in a believer that inequality made a little difference on my life and left with evidence that it actually makes a HUGE difference on people's lives. Before I read this book I thought that the only effect of having a class of super rich on society was that there was a class of super rich who were (more than) a little selfish with their money. I left wanting to change the world and give this to everyone who can read.Their arguments are solid and the detail they go into refuting their critics is excellent.BOOK FORMAT and PRICEI bought this on the Kindle and paid $9.99. I don't know, I think that's too steep. I know academic books are priced quite high (traditionally around the $50 mark in Australia) but that's because they're big and the print runs are small. They're solid and clunky. This is a Kindle version. It's digital.They don't lose any money by putting it on the web if only one person buys it or three hundred thousand, and this is a resource that should be the hands of everyone. For a book that talks about equality, I find it odd that it's priced above standard novel price. Shouldn't the idea be to get it into the hands of everyone? Isn't the idea more important than making a few extra dollars?I gripe. I gripe. I just get frustrated with high priced business (and social-political) books because I read them and (generally) enjoy them more than novels.However, the Kindle version is not great. Tragically. The pictures pop in at the wrong times, the headings overlap pages and the chapters are not correctly marked for chapter jumping and the TOC. When I tried to read the charts, it was incredibly difficult. I had to squint at the screen to see which states / countries were represented and where.I think the paperback version will be a better read and I'm looking forward to seeing all the details in their full glory. Also, for referencing and highlighting, the Kindle is not great for academic books.Don't get me wrong, I live in Australia and buying this at a bookstore will almost be impossible. I'm glad I could download it in a second, but for ten dollars it's not well laid out and is definitely lower in quality than its print counterpart will be.SUMMARYThe Spirit Level, for me, is a must read for anyone who cares about society in general. I am looking at buying several copies and sending (at least one) to my local MP. The research is solid, the conclusions understandable and the referencing transparent. At the end I felt like this was the beginning of a wonderful conversation to be having in society. This is what I want to talk about with my friends when I see them next instead of my favourite novel. If you care about your kids, read this today and then think about it for the next week."
29,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6257531-caroline,4,"This book is about statistics, so it is going to be very hard for me to convey the excitement of reading it. It IS exciting though, and figure by figure, chart by chart, it unfolds an extraordinary story. A story all about money and human welfare.It is written by two professors of epidemiology. Statisticians who got a list of the 50 richest countries in the world from the World Health Organisation. They then picked out those countries with clear information about income differences between people, and they ended up with 23 countries in total. Now for the nub of the story….looking at a wide range of factors, they found that societies where money is shared more equally between people are tons better – for everyone - than societies with big inequalities.The US and the UK come right up at the top of the list when it comes to economic inequality, along with Singapore. The countries who come out best are Japan and Scandinavia. In the latter countries their citizens have equality for completely different reasons, but these differences are irrelevant. The thing that matters is that the quality of life for people in these countries - across a whole range of factors, and throughout the different stratas of society – is infinitely better. Inequality and big wage differences obviously affect those at the bottom of society most of all, but the effect is experienced by everyone, except perhaps for the odd billionaire at the top of the pile.....and it doesn't do anyone any good. The book ends with a look at problems like global warming and environmentalism, and ways in which different practices might help countries become more sustainable and equal. The more enthusiastic corporate wallahs amongst us might want to take a tranquilliser before reading this section.I found this book utterly gripping, and difficult to put down. In spite of feelings of scepticism at the beginning, the facts are really quite astonishing and persuasive, and I found myself being won over.Herewith some links that may be of interest.1) I thought their research was good. Herewith a link to the background statistics and their methodology.https://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/reso...2) Here is a 16 minute TED lecture on the book.

Then there are more fights, more brawls, more scuffles, more bottles and knives and more young men die”Danny Dorling, health geographer.There are higher levels of imprisonment in unequal countriesThis is usually due to longer prison sentences, rather than higher levels of crime. In the UK in 1990 there were 46,000 people in prison, by 2007 that figure had almost doubled, and there were 80,000 in prison.Laws which generate longer prison sentences:Three-strikes lawsMinimum mandatory sentences“Truth-in-sentencing” (i.e., no remission).Longer prison sentencing can reach ludicrous extremes….in 2004 in California there were 360 people serving life sentences for shoplifting.Several prisons in America have very harsh environments, and have been criticised by organisations like Amnesty International and the Human Rights Watch. Prisons in places like Japan and the Netherlands are much more benevolent.“You’d think countries with lower prison population per head of population would have higher rates of re-offending (i.e., they must only be imprisoning the worst criminals), but this is not the case. Instead there seems to be a higher rate of re-offending in more punitive systems e.g.UK and USA –Re-offending rates of 60-65%Sweden and Japan – Re-offending rates of 35-40%""Social Mobility and equal opportunityThis is much better in countries that are equal.

While this further provides impetus for wealth distribution, avid readers taking interest in this topic should be quick to recognize that this is a battle waged on multiple fronts. Further focuses on the accessibility of of healthy food, health care, education, and generally stable environments are all necessary, not to mention individual work towards optimizing personal attitudes and lifestyles rather than merely focusing on a change of the externals variables. All of these routes need to be taken seriously to sufficiently alleviate the problem."

The core arguments of this book are fascinating, and the data incredibly convincing. It's a long 300 odd pages though of graphs and explanations that, very quickly, and to the thesis' credit, end up being the same line of reasoning every time. The core message is that the greater the inequality in societies - the gap between the richest and poorest - the greater the levels of many of society's ills, from poor mental health, growing prison populations and declining child wellbeing. "
32,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4454139-linda,5,"Just finished reading The Spirit Level and greatly appreciated the extensive endnotes and clarity with which this book was written. The authors methodically take the reader through their thinking chapter by chapter and support their argument that greater equality in society would lead to a better human experience for everyone - even the wealthy. Contrary to some beliefs, this book does not advocate the control of the government over businesses (authors said that was distinctly NOT the answer), reminds us that it is small businesses which generally are making the largest innovative contributions to society, that Thomas Paine was right regarding aristocracy. As a history teacher and someone who also loves science, I found this book to raise numerous thoughtful questions in which we all need to engage. Reminding me that Thomas Paine rejected the value of a landed aristocracy and connecting that thinking to questioning the value of the multi-national corporations was inspirational and insightful. Logical thinking, which as a student of anthropology I realize may be incorrect when discussing societies, does lead me to believe that having some persons holding enormous pots of wealth may not be the best way to encourage people to value society, family, friends or a sense of community, but rather would encourage people to watch over their shoulders and try to keep up with the values of high consumerism. Not buying into social hierarchies or consumerism would not bring about the collapse of the world, but rather would increase one's happiness in it. Time spent trying to acquire material goods would be spent with family, friends, community service, etc which are actions long understood and supported as ways to greatly increase one's happiness. Personal connections with others would reduce corruption and greed since it is far more difficult to rip off people with whom you associate on a regular basis (yes I know that Madoff did that, but he received all that press because of his unusually egregious antisocial actions) since you would have human connection and relationships that would discourage even the desire to rip off others. The ""solution"" of this book is to move in a direction of more employee owned businesses with less competitive social hierarchies - do not forget, humanity lived for many thousands of years in hunter gatherer societies and the importance of human connection has been bred into us (think some game theory studies). The authors address the increasingly challenging attempts to control and make money on intellectual/patented knowledge and raise some interesting questions as to where this is going - how will we make money on these products as the internet and global access to knowledge increases exponentially? We are being forced to create new economic strategies to address these concerns - so whether we like it or not, we will be forced to change and change is not something the majority of human beings embrace. I found one statement particularly fascinating and worthy of extensive thought: ""An important ideological cost of the Cold War was that America gave up its historical commitment to equality."" I have not decided whether or not that is true, partially true, but I believe this is a statement worth exploring - what has happened to our civil liberties over the past few decades? Are we more free or less free (some groups have obviously achieved more freedom yet overall what is today's current thinking - have we continued to move in a freer direction?) than a few decades ago? What has been the long-term impact of the Cold War on our equality psyche? At the end of the day however, I believe that everyone will agree that inequality costs - as a teacher, I see on a daily basis the long-term impacts of inequality, how much do prisons cost us, how much does violence cost us, how much does having ""gated communities"" cost us, how much does it cost us to have some people with so much money that they behave as if they are above the law (think financial institutions, the multi-national corporations that are impacting the governments of other nations, the financial turmoil that we repeatedly experience) - I say that these things cost all of us and that a more equal, community-based society would not be a utopian dream or perfection, but it would be a great improvement over the way life is now and is something we can achieve. This is not a ""left"" or ""right"" book - this is a book that is questioning our value structure, our way of life, how long is this way of life sustainable and successfully examines the consequences of inequality."
33,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6948668-conor-mcvarnock,5,"Excellent work, the conclusions are largely intuitive and certainly nothing that should be of any sort of surprise to most of us on the socialist left (except maybe all the stuff about Japan being up there with the Scandanavian Countries). The basic point made by the book is that after a certain point, how rich or developed a country is doesn't matter after a certain point, its the level of inequality that is the decisive factor on a range of issues, levels of obesity, mental illness, heart disease, your chances of being violently assaulted. This is not merely asserted, but proven scientifically with a huge raft of peer-reviewed academic research from the field of epidemiology and hard statistical analysis. Seriously, try disagreeing with any of this and you'll end up looking like a fool, there is so much evidence on display that its hard to come to any other conclusion than that a more equal society is necessarily a better one, not just for those at the bottom, the middle and upper classes are healthier in more equal societies compared to their peers in less equal ones.Where we may disagree though is how to get from the shitty unequal state of our contemporary post-neoliberal wrecks. I say that you cannot escape the conclusion that a revolution is whats needed.Anyway, plenty of food for thought and if you enjoy smoking market fundies in debates over any social issue, then you'll find more than enough ammo here."
34,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16475435-joy-b,3,"The only negative thing I can say about this book is that they use evo psyche in two chapters to prove a point. I think this makes their work lose some credibility as evo-psyche is mainly a purely speculative field. It was a shame they had to rely heavily on it in the teenage pregnancies chapter; it was as if they couldn't look past the gender of many of the teenagers and place it in a wider context. There was also some bad neuroscience near the end. This promoted logic of, ""If this part of the area shows activity when we do this and also when we do this it MUST mean the two are the same thing."" which really deliberately reductive and something bad science journalists do. The book was good enough to not need shoddy science to reinforce its points. Other than that this book is inspiring. I recommend it to everyone. The last chapter in particular reminded me of all the reasons I got involved with activism. It's nice to know that equality is an achievable goal."

40,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3299609-ignacio,5,"There is SO MUCH to unpack from this book - I am still processing everything. Spirit Level is an in-depth research that describes the negative effects of wide inequality. Now, while on the surface, this statement might seem kind of obvious - the intricacies behind it are worth the read. The book will bombard you with data, and the results are as alarming as they are broad in terms of impact. According to their studies (and keeping in mind that strong correlation does not necessarily mean causality), countries with higher degree on inequality (leading country: USA), suffer from: - Higher rates of obesity- Higher rates of mental illness- Higher rates of anxiety/depression- Higher rates of racism and sexism- Higher rates of chronic diseases- Higher degree of self-promoting insecure egotism and status insecurity- Higher rates of violence- Higher rates of luxury fever (which pushes for over consumption) - Higher spending on criminal and judicial systems- Higher levels of mistrust- Lower life expectancy ratesIt is important to highlight that these negative consequences are not limited to the lower spectrum of society (the less resourceful) but EVEN those at the top of the scale. Ultimately, this means that you can't escape these consequences regardless of how privilege/fortunate you might be.Now, if this already seems obvious to you, something interesting is the understanding why this might be the case. According to their studies (and this applies mostly to already developed countries) countries have reached a threshold of material living standards and the benefits of further economic growth are less substantial. Economic growth is no longer a driver to wellbeing and happiness - and this comes down to our current social structures and psychology. We, as society, have become ""highly self-conscious, obsessed with how we appear to others, worried that we might come across as unattractive, boring, etc and we are constantly trying to manage the impressions we make"". This vulnerability is part of the modern psychological and societal conditions, which feeds directly into our over consumption mentality, driven by our constant anxiety of comparing ourselves to those who might have more, which ultimately snow balls into deep psychology rooted issues. I will spare the details in case you are interested in reading it - but it is important to note that these consequences reach older and younger people to even babies in the womb. Some interesting psychological/sociological concepts: 1. Luxury Fever: As inequality grows and the super-rich at the top spend more and more on luxury goods, the desire for such things cascades down the income scale and the rest of us struggle to compete and keep up.2. ‘Affluenza’ virus: a ‘set of values which increase our vulnerability to emotional distress’. It entails placing a high value on acquiring money and possessions, looking good in the eyes of others and wanting to be famous. These kinds of values place us at greater risk of depression, anxiety, substance abuse and personality disorder.3. Addiction to income: the more we have, the more we feel we need and the more time we spend on striving for material wealth and possessions, at the expense of our family life, relationships, and quality of life.This is an interesting read; however, I thought the book was light and rushed when it comes to solutions. It is evident that we as society need to change our social dynamics, but it also clear that big government is not the answer."
41,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59510129-chris,5,"The first 2/3 of this book is a thorough investigation of the relationship between income inequality and a specific array of health and social problems. The authors effectively explain the scope of their claims, discuss the mechanisms through which inequality leads to societal problems, and cite specific evidence. If you believe that socioeconomic inequality causes problems for a society - not just for the poor, but for the whole society - but you can’t really put your finger on why that is, this book will clear that question right up for you. The remaining 1/3 addresses the question of what these findings mean in historical and political context. Why are some countries more equal than others? Is change possible? How? The authors are careful not to overstep the bounds of their research here with the same certainty with which they make their claims in the earlier part of the book. And rightly so, as this would dilute the credibility of their earlier claims.They offer a broad framework for change as well as several policies and activist efforts to consider. Given the scope of the authors’ research, I found this an effective conclusion. It would have been irresponsible to ardently advocate a specific course of action without duplicating the volume of investigation. However, it would have been equally irresponsible to present these findings in a vacuum without discussing the implications and touching on how the reader should use the findings. The assertiveness of the call to action was well-calibrated to the thoroughness of the research findings presented: we KNOW greater equality will improve societies. We KNOW it is possible for a society to change its level of equality. We MUST act. We have reason to believe employee ownership, social welfare programs, and other policies have merit in effecting change. Go spread this knowledge, explore these options further, and change your society!"
42,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17878620-margaretdh,4,"You might come to this book through concern about stagnating wages for the middle class, or because you're looking to understand complex public health problems. Or even because you think that competition and a freer market drive the best outcomes for us all. Anyway you get here, I think you'll find this a thought provoking read about the way insidious ways that inequality (of outcome and opportunity) harms societies and individuals.Generally, I think this is fairly well argued. The authors don't start from the premise that inequality causes poor social outcomes (obesity, teen pregnancy, property crime, mental health struggles, higher prison populations, poorer health outcomes etc), they start from the premise that inequality is often correlated with these things. Then they investigate the ways in which inequality erodes trust and increases stress across communities and nations, and the lower outcomes for all levels of society, even the rich.Though they provide citations and an explanation of the data they used and how they analyzed it, I did find one or two of their arguments a little hand-wavy. On the other hand, they intended this book for general consumption, and probably didn't want to overwhelm people with interminable paragraphs. I also wasn't entirely convinced that their proposed solutions to unequal societies were as well thought out as their previous chapters. But that also makes sense. They're researchers, not policy wonks.In any case, this is an important and readable book, and if you're interested in the macro level of how societies work, this is a good one to pick up."

All of this applies across different levels of society (not just for the poor, rich nor middle class, but everyone!). Equality also extends to relations with other people or groups of people, or even between countries; more equality in your community=more trust=more mutual profit for everyone you work with. They certainly make a convincing case. My only concern is that being a welfare-state living, equality loving Finn, I was already inclined to thinking this way, so I should probably get familiar with the critique these guys have encountered :)Anyways, inspiring stuff, and can't wait to read their new book!Update after reading the critique from ""spirit level delusion""-blog:It seems that the writers may have been building on their own biased hyphothesis and not looking for alternative outcomes at all. The data may have been cherry-picked and the results can't necessarily be repeated with another set of countries or at another point in time. However, the critiq seems to also have picked a certain year to look at. How about averages over a longer time period?Had to remove one star for that and stop being excited about the results...

44,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47469897-daniel-foster,3,"I found this book well written but I find it difficult to see how you can compare societies which are culturally fairly homogeneous, such as the Scandinavian countries and japan to much larger multi cultural states like the US and draw any real conclusions. If people are largely similar in culture then why would they not have more equal outcomes then in a country like the US which is so much larger and made up of different groups? There was some attempt to address this in the book but it was fairly brief. It seems to me that things such as crime, education, drug use etc would tend to correlate together and so would not need a separate chapter for each topic.  It will be interesting to see how a country like Sweden fares in the future since it has excepted large numbers of refugees. Will inequality rise or will its welfare programme lift everyone up to a similar status.I feel the book made some very interesting points and I am in agreement that inequality is a bad thing in general but I am unconvinced with much of the central premise of the book."

Reading this book has profoundly changed my opinion and my understanding of the role of inequality (notably on incomes) and its relationship with health and social issues that affect the well-being of society and nation as a whole. Having been living in New Zealand for over twenty years, I do observed the manifestation of health and social issues that can be attributed to inequality. Sadly, the inequality gap in New Zealand has widened since the study. I think New Zealand had forgotten that it was once a nation that was big on fairness and egalitarian ethos.For decades now, the Scandinavian model of social democracy had shown us that the model has the capability to close the inequality gap, perhaps it's time for English-speaking countries to adapt the model if we indeed serious about fairness and equality for our people.A different angle to appreciate how a big deal inequality really is, read: 23 Things They Don't Tell You About Capitalism - Ha-Joon Chang."

Points of learning:Beyond a certain point, rise in GDP makes no material difference to people’s wellbeing.Evaluative threat is a stressor resulting in ‘rising anxiety and a narcissitic defence of an insecure self image’.Violence is more common in unequal societies because ‘loss of face’ when people feel disrespected is the only thing they have to lose.Income inequality is the ‘prime mover’ of trust.Children’s mental health is strongly correlated with income inequality.Surprisingly to me, there is no relationship between health spending per person and life expectancy.Early childhood educational programmes are high yield.Flatter inequality also means flatter ambition (interesting).‘The discouraged among the disadvantaged’ become teenage mothers.John Irwin’s purposes of prison (shudder): official ones are retribution, deterrence, and incapacitation, whereas unofficial ones are class control, scapegoating, and political gain.Penal expansion goes with welfare contraction; as inequality goes up you pay more for police.Bourdieu’s ‘economy of cultural goods’ drives class discrimination.Single parenthood is not remotely as difficult in more equal countries.In a ‘steady state’ economy increasing equality causes increasing, not decreasing, creativity – something I wondered about myself.Working hours per person increase with inequality.I really need to read some Veblen.

I found the writing unengaging, repetitive and (particularly in the interpretation) drenched in bias.The trouble is, the authors seem to pursue their conclusions with such a dogged determination, that they don't seem to notice when they are contradicting themselves or overinterpreting. Several times I found myself frowning and saying to myself ""But... a few chapters ago you said the opposite..."" or ""But... that's not a watertight argument..."" and once or twice ""that makes ZERO sense AT ALL!""

56,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1879990-adam,5,"Science is meant to provide provocative, unexpected insights into our world, providing clues that can help us do whatever it is we want to do. The best scientists find insights that make the world a better place, and present their findings in ways that can inspire communities to act on them. This book is among the very best science books I'm familiar with, ranking up there with The Diversity of Life and Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed. The book takes a simple, obvious progressive mantra - more equal societies are better for people - and scientifically demonstrates its validity in more ways than the most optimistic of us would ever have guessed. Wilkinson and Pickett show how inequality erodes social trust, decreases educational performance, increases homicides, shortens lives, increases consumption, causes greater conflict among children, increases drug use and mental illness, and increases the number of people in prison. Their results are checked on rich nations and among the United States. The relationship is shocking - it seems that inequality is, after a certain level of economic well-being (per capita GDP) is reached, it is by far the most important determinant of societal well-being. Their results showed that it didn't matter how a society became more equal - government organized wealth redistribution or natural market mechanisms or a strong labor movement (trade union membership is apparently the strongest predictor of inequality in a nation). Pickett and Wilkinson included a pleasing amount of speculation and research about HOW inequality causes all of the social ills it does. Apparently, merely being judged constantly as to one's social status is extremely stressful (for everyone, but moreso if you're on the bottom!). This stress leads to all sorts of things - direct health consequences, impaired mental and physical abilities, violent responses to those who question one's status, distrust of others (they are competitors, not friends!), etc. It is passed down from generation to generation, starting with stress hormones that influence a baby's development in the womb, cuing them to prepare for a harsh, antagonistic world. The results demonstrate that poverty really does inhibit peoples' ability to succeed socially, and not just for the host of obvious reasons (disenfranchisement, nutrition, etc) that are usually discussed.I found this conversation quite interesting, since the mechanisms they cite would have been active in all societies since the advent of severe inequality. Of course, inequality was much more severe in many past societies than it is in ours, so the effects were likely more severe. These biological responses to hierarchy likely explain some of the socially corrosive effects associated with civilization.The conclusions of the book are quite obvious, then: make societies more equal and all the other problems will improve on their own. In fact, increasing equality is the most effective measure known to address most of these issues. As the authors say, ""[symptomatic solutions] attempt to break the link between socio-economic disadvantage and the problems it produces. The unstated hope is that people - particularly the poor - can carry on in the same circumstances, but will somehow no longer succumb to mental illness, teenage pregnancy, educational failure, obesity, or drugs.""In summary: “In the figures there is also a clear warning for those who might want to place low public expenditure and taxation at the top of their list of priorities. If you fail to avoid high inequality, you will need more prisons and more police. You will have to deal with higher rates of mental illness, drug abuse, and every other kind of problem. If keeping taxes and benefits down leads to wider income differences, the need to deal with the ensuing social ills may force you to raise public expenditure to cope.” "
57,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14612139-nick,3," To be honest I was disappointed when if finished it. Don't get me wrong, it is not that the book is bad in a literary, academic or political way but it did not wow me. The point is that I have read a lot of the basic premises and facts in this book, indicating the impact the book has made so far, and therefore it was not as surprising as it might have been if I would have read the book in 2009. I for one already knew how badly a social status inequality affects children's educational capacities even if it was helpful to read about it again in a concrete manner with numbers to back it up. Still if did not feel like enough, what did save the book for me, was the inclusion of an additional chapter responding to their critics that was helpful and insightful, humble yet adamant in its tone to defend the vision behind the book. I have to admit that some of the correlations and as the writers claim causal relation between inequality and various social problems is quite staggering. I did get a bit skeptical at some moments, surely all these can't be related to relative and material inequality? But considering the authors never make a definitive claim (a few exceptions) but rather point out a unpleasant truth for many, that when comparing equally wealthy countries, unequal ones are worse on many levels up to homicide and numbers of innovations. I was genuinely surprised to discover that all income groups in general are better off in terms of health(mental and physical) and general life expectancy and that at some level of material wealth and economic growth no substantial gains can be made for any social indicator! Another point I found intriguing and would like to delve deeper into is the link between anxiety and depression surges in society linked to increased status consumption driven by inequality, due mostly for my connection to the feelings of pointlessness described to be felt by a growing portion of the population and my personal rejection of mental consumption coping mechanisms. Perhaps the most compelling point is that the researchers compared wealthy countries, the entire classic liberal argument ""but we will be like the USSR if we want more equality!"" is rubbish, Sweden and Canada aren't socialist dictatorships. most shocking and left me in emotional distress was the segment on junkfood and why poor people choose to eat it, the testimonies of children, homeless and youngsters as to why they spent so much time and money there, were gut wrenching. I did not like the inclusion of animal testing and references to the pre agricultural man, for I never could accept both as solid evidence, one for we are not animals (and i ethically object animal testing) and the second for claims based on how the prehistoric man lived are used by every side to defend every position for we simply can't without doubt reconstruct the mindset of these peoples (referring to current hunter forager societies as way to understand prehistoric man, is as problematic for it is increasingly clear these are not relics of our collective past but rather responses to changing conditions throughout human history). As a citizen of Belgium, one of the countries more favorable in the statistics used, this book and its ideas and vision of modern society as to be more inclusive to achieve collective well being, do not come across as a shock, this book was meant for the anglo saxon world, in tone, content and vision which as a non anglo saxon leaves me a bit underwhelmed. Still considering the times and impact the book has had so far, still makes it worthwhile especially when measures to increase inequality are gaining power in the more equal nations of Belgium and the Netherlands and the ideal of collective progress is being replaced by the need to police and look down on the poor.... unfortunately....

59,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2118933-leo-walsh,4,"An overall very interesting book that examines the negative impacts of inequality on a variety social issues. While it seems to harp on the same theme -- inequality is bad for most of us, even the wealthy -- there are some times where I found myself thinking ""correlation does not imply causation."" There seems little doubt that inequality, though, is driven by government policy. And thus reflects the hidden attitudes of those in power -- since the policies a nation's elite have followed across several decades and their effects are, rhetoric aside, the net effect of the power structures that run a country.So what we are looking at is attitudes wrought in policies. Which impact people's lives, and come out as unequal distribution of income, with the rich getting richer, and the poor getting nothing.The down side to this is that the United States is a negative outlier in nearly ever conceivable dimension when viewed against our peers. The rich get richer. Money flows into ""cost-plus"" military or engineers contracts given to influential contractors. And the profits flow to the wealthy shareholders, while those same companies move manufacturing jobs over seas.There are several stats that still shock me. For instance Cuba -- the small island nation that is much poorer than the US -- has a lower infant mortality rate and slightly higher death rate than the wealthiest nation in the world. And the research that shows that, after a certain level, pursuit wealth does not really bring satisfaction illustrates an ages-old spiritual insight. No doubt it will take more than that. But the overall analysis is sound. There are some Right-Wing attacks of this book floating around. Because word is getting out, and the findings do seem to support Progressive opinions and debunk Conservative notions. And the authors have posted an interesting article that < href=""http://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/sites... the arguments being made by the Right against the insights the authors make in this book because they are, frankly, statistically incorrect. But, more importantly, the author of this rebuttal question the author's overly clean ""to make society better, all we need to do is make income more equal.""Which smacks of intellectual honesty -- rare in any time. But refreshing in political discourse.Highly recommended. The only reason it did not get 5-stars from me is that these findings could have been summarized in about half the pages. And that the majority of it can be had for free on their website The Equality Trust. (http://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/)"

While this further provides impetus for wealth distribution, avid readers taking interest in this topic should be quick to recognize that this is a battle waged on multiple fronts. Further focuses on the accessibility of of healthy food, health care, education, and generally stable environments are all necessary, not to mention individual work towards optimizing personal attitudes and lifestyles rather than merely focusing on a change of the externals variables. All of these routes need to be taken seriously to sufficiently alleviate the problem."

The core arguments of this book are fascinating, and the data incredibly convincing. It's a long 300 odd pages though of graphs and explanations that, very quickly, and to the thesis' credit, end up being the same line of reasoning every time. The core message is that the greater the inequality in societies - the gap between the richest and poorest - the greater the levels of many of society's ills, from poor mental health, growing prison populations and declining child wellbeing. "
62,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4454139-linda,5,"Just finished reading The Spirit Level and greatly appreciated the extensive endnotes and clarity with which this book was written. The authors methodically take the reader through their thinking chapter by chapter and support their argument that greater equality in society would lead to a better human experience for everyone - even the wealthy. Contrary to some beliefs, this book does not advocate the control of the government over businesses (authors said that was distinctly NOT the answer), reminds us that it is small businesses which generally are making the largest innovative contributions to society, that Thomas Paine was right regarding aristocracy. As a history teacher and someone who also loves science, I found this book to raise numerous thoughtful questions in which we all need to engage. Reminding me that Thomas Paine rejected the value of a landed aristocracy and connecting that thinking to questioning the value of the multi-national corporations was inspirational and insightful. Logical thinking, which as a student of anthropology I realize may be incorrect when discussing societies, does lead me to believe that having some persons holding enormous pots of wealth may not be the best way to encourage people to value society, family, friends or a sense of community, but rather would encourage people to watch over their shoulders and try to keep up with the values of high consumerism. Not buying into social hierarchies or consumerism would not bring about the collapse of the world, but rather would increase one's happiness in it. Time spent trying to acquire material goods would be spent with family, friends, community service, etc which are actions long understood and supported as ways to greatly increase one's happiness. Personal connections with others would reduce corruption and greed since it is far more difficult to rip off people with whom you associate on a regular basis (yes I know that Madoff did that, but he received all that press because of his unusually egregious antisocial actions) since you would have human connection and relationships that would discourage even the desire to rip off others. The ""solution"" of this book is to move in a direction of more employee owned businesses with less competitive social hierarchies - do not forget, humanity lived for many thousands of years in hunter gatherer societies and the importance of human connection has been bred into us (think some game theory studies). The authors address the increasingly challenging attempts to control and make money on intellectual/patented knowledge and raise some interesting questions as to where this is going - how will we make money on these products as the internet and global access to knowledge increases exponentially? We are being forced to create new economic strategies to address these concerns - so whether we like it or not, we will be forced to change and change is not something the majority of human beings embrace. I found one statement particularly fascinating and worthy of extensive thought: ""An important ideological cost of the Cold War was that America gave up its historical commitment to equality."" I have not decided whether or not that is true, partially true, but I believe this is a statement worth exploring - what has happened to our civil liberties over the past few decades? Are we more free or less free (some groups have obviously achieved more freedom yet overall what is today's current thinking - have we continued to move in a freer direction?) than a few decades ago? What has been the long-term impact of the Cold War on our equality psyche? At the end of the day however, I believe that everyone will agree that inequality costs - as a teacher, I see on a daily basis the long-term impacts of inequality, how much do prisons cost us, how much does violence cost us, how much does having ""gated communities"" cost us, how much does it cost us to have some people with so much money that they behave as if they are above the law (think financial institutions, the multi-national corporations that are impacting the governments of other nations, the financial turmoil that we repeatedly experience) - I say that these things cost all of us and that a more equal, community-based society would not be a utopian dream or perfection, but it would be a great improvement over the way life is now and is something we can achieve. This is not a ""left"" or ""right"" book - this is a book that is questioning our value structure, our way of life, how long is this way of life sustainable and successfully examines the consequences of inequality."
63,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6948668-conor-mcvarnock,5,"Excellent work, the conclusions are largely intuitive and certainly nothing that should be of any sort of surprise to most of us on the socialist left (except maybe all the stuff about Japan being up there with the Scandanavian Countries). The basic point made by the book is that after a certain point, how rich or developed a country is doesn't matter after a certain point, its the level of inequality that is the decisive factor on a range of issues, levels of obesity, mental illness, heart disease, your chances of being violently assaulted. This is not merely asserted, but proven scientifically with a huge raft of peer-reviewed academic research from the field of epidemiology and hard statistical analysis. Seriously, try disagreeing with any of this and you'll end up looking like a fool, there is so much evidence on display that its hard to come to any other conclusion than that a more equal society is necessarily a better one, not just for those at the bottom, the middle and upper classes are healthier in more equal societies compared to their peers in less equal ones.Where we may disagree though is how to get from the shitty unequal state of our contemporary post-neoliberal wrecks. I say that you cannot escape the conclusion that a revolution is whats needed.Anyway, plenty of food for thought and if you enjoy smoking market fundies in debates over any social issue, then you'll find more than enough ammo here."
64,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16475435-joy-b,3,"The only negative thing I can say about this book is that they use evo psyche in two chapters to prove a point. I think this makes their work lose some credibility as evo-psyche is mainly a purely speculative field. It was a shame they had to rely heavily on it in the teenage pregnancies chapter; it was as if they couldn't look past the gender of many of the teenagers and place it in a wider context. There was also some bad neuroscience near the end. This promoted logic of, ""If this part of the area shows activity when we do this and also when we do this it MUST mean the two are the same thing."" which really deliberately reductive and something bad science journalists do. The book was good enough to not need shoddy science to reinforce its points. Other than that this book is inspiring. I recommend it to everyone. The last chapter in particular reminded me of all the reasons I got involved with activism. It's nice to know that equality is an achievable goal."

70,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3299609-ignacio,5,"There is SO MUCH to unpack from this book - I am still processing everything. Spirit Level is an in-depth research that describes the negative effects of wide inequality. Now, while on the surface, this statement might seem kind of obvious - the intricacies behind it are worth the read. The book will bombard you with data, and the results are as alarming as they are broad in terms of impact. According to their studies (and keeping in mind that strong correlation does not necessarily mean causality), countries with higher degree on inequality (leading country: USA), suffer from: - Higher rates of obesity- Higher rates of mental illness- Higher rates of anxiety/depression- Higher rates of racism and sexism- Higher rates of chronic diseases- Higher degree of self-promoting insecure egotism and status insecurity- Higher rates of violence- Higher rates of luxury fever (which pushes for over consumption) - Higher spending on criminal and judicial systems- Higher levels of mistrust- Lower life expectancy ratesIt is important to highlight that these negative consequences are not limited to the lower spectrum of society (the less resourceful) but EVEN those at the top of the scale. Ultimately, this means that you can't escape these consequences regardless of how privilege/fortunate you might be.Now, if this already seems obvious to you, something interesting is the understanding why this might be the case. According to their studies (and this applies mostly to already developed countries) countries have reached a threshold of material living standards and the benefits of further economic growth are less substantial. Economic growth is no longer a driver to wellbeing and happiness - and this comes down to our current social structures and psychology. We, as society, have become ""highly self-conscious, obsessed with how we appear to others, worried that we might come across as unattractive, boring, etc and we are constantly trying to manage the impressions we make"". This vulnerability is part of the modern psychological and societal conditions, which feeds directly into our over consumption mentality, driven by our constant anxiety of comparing ourselves to those who might have more, which ultimately snow balls into deep psychology rooted issues. I will spare the details in case you are interested in reading it - but it is important to note that these consequences reach older and younger people to even babies in the womb. Some interesting psychological/sociological concepts: 1. Luxury Fever: As inequality grows and the super-rich at the top spend more and more on luxury goods, the desire for such things cascades down the income scale and the rest of us struggle to compete and keep up.2. ‘Affluenza’ virus: a ‘set of values which increase our vulnerability to emotional distress’. It entails placing a high value on acquiring money and possessions, looking good in the eyes of others and wanting to be famous. These kinds of values place us at greater risk of depression, anxiety, substance abuse and personality disorder.3. Addiction to income: the more we have, the more we feel we need and the more time we spend on striving for material wealth and possessions, at the expense of our family life, relationships, and quality of life.This is an interesting read; however, I thought the book was light and rushed when it comes to solutions. It is evident that we as society need to change our social dynamics, but it also clear that big government is not the answer."
71,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59510129-chris,5,"The first 2/3 of this book is a thorough investigation of the relationship between income inequality and a specific array of health and social problems. The authors effectively explain the scope of their claims, discuss the mechanisms through which inequality leads to societal problems, and cite specific evidence. If you believe that socioeconomic inequality causes problems for a society - not just for the poor, but for the whole society - but you can’t really put your finger on why that is, this book will clear that question right up for you. The remaining 1/3 addresses the question of what these findings mean in historical and political context. Why are some countries more equal than others? Is change possible? How? The authors are careful not to overstep the bounds of their research here with the same certainty with which they make their claims in the earlier part of the book. And rightly so, as this would dilute the credibility of their earlier claims.They offer a broad framework for change as well as several policies and activist efforts to consider. Given the scope of the authors’ research, I found this an effective conclusion. It would have been irresponsible to ardently advocate a specific course of action without duplicating the volume of investigation. However, it would have been equally irresponsible to present these findings in a vacuum without discussing the implications and touching on how the reader should use the findings. The assertiveness of the call to action was well-calibrated to the thoroughness of the research findings presented: we KNOW greater equality will improve societies. We KNOW it is possible for a society to change its level of equality. We MUST act. We have reason to believe employee ownership, social welfare programs, and other policies have merit in effecting change. Go spread this knowledge, explore these options further, and change your society!"

Or even because you think that competition and a freer market drive the best outcomes for us all. Anyway you get here, I think you'll find this a thought provoking read about the way insidious ways that inequality (of outcome and opportunity) harms societies and individuals.Generally, I think this is fairly well argued. The authors don't start from the premise that inequality causes poor social outcomes (obesity, teen pregnancy, property crime, mental health struggles, higher prison populations, poorer health outcomes etc), they start from the premise that inequality is often correlated with these things. Then they investigate the ways in which inequality erodes trust and increases stress across communities and nations, and the lower outcomes for all levels of society, even the rich.Though they provide citations and an explanation of the data they used and how they analyzed it, I did find one or two of their arguments a little hand-wavy. On the other hand, they intended this book for general consumption, and probably didn't want to overwhelm people with interminable paragraphs. I also wasn't entirely convinced that their proposed solutions to unequal societies were as well thought out as their previous chapters. But that also makes sense. They're researchers, not policy wonks.In any case, this is an important and readable book, and if you're interested in the macro level of how societies work, this is a good one to pick up."

All of this applies across different levels of society (not just for the poor, rich nor middle class, but everyone!). Equality also extends to relations with other people or groups of people, or even between countries; more equality in your community=more trust=more mutual profit for everyone you work with. They certainly make a convincing case. My only concern is that being a welfare-state living, equality loving Finn, I was already inclined to thinking this way, so I should probably get familiar with the critique these guys have encountered :)Anyways, inspiring stuff, and can't wait to read their new book!Update after reading the critique from ""spirit level delusion""-blog:It seems that the writers may have been building on their own biased hyphothesis and not looking for alternative outcomes at all. The data may have been cherry-picked and the results can't necessarily be repeated with another set of countries or at another point in time.

74,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47469897-daniel-foster,3,"I found this book well written but I find it difficult to see how you can compare societies which are culturally fairly homogeneous, such as the Scandinavian countries and japan to much larger multi cultural states like the US and draw any real conclusions. If people are largely similar in culture then why would they not have more equal outcomes then in a country like the US which is so much larger and made up of different groups? There was some attempt to address this in the book but it was fairly brief. It seems to me that things such as crime, education, drug use etc would tend to correlate together and so would not need a separate chapter for each topic.  It will be interesting to see how a country like Sweden fares in the future since it has excepted large numbers of refugees. Will inequality rise or will its welfare programme lift everyone up to a similar status.I feel the book made some very interesting points and I am in agreement that inequality is a bad thing in general but I am unconvinced with much of the central premise of the book."

Reading this book has profoundly changed my opinion and my understanding of the role of inequality (notably on incomes) and its relationship with health and social issues that affect the well-being of society and nation as a whole. Having been living in New Zealand for over twenty years, I do observed the manifestation of health and social issues that can be attributed to inequality. Sadly, the inequality gap in New Zealand has widened since the study. I think New Zealand had forgotten that it was once a nation that was big on fairness and egalitarian ethos.For decades now, the Scandinavian model of social democracy had shown us that the model has the capability to close the inequality gap, perhaps it's time for English-speaking countries to adapt the model if we indeed serious about fairness and equality for our people.A different angle to appreciate how a big deal inequality really is, read: 23 Things They Don't Tell You About Capitalism - Ha-Joon Chang."

Points of learning:Beyond a certain point, rise in GDP makes no material difference to people’s wellbeing.Evaluative threat is a stressor resulting in ‘rising anxiety and a narcissitic defence of an insecure self image’.Violence is more common in unequal societies because ‘loss of face’ when people feel disrespected is the only thing they have to lose.Income inequality is the ‘prime mover’ of trust.Children’s mental health is strongly correlated with income inequality.Surprisingly to me, there is no relationship between health spending per person and life expectancy.Early childhood educational programmes are high yield.Flatter inequality also means flatter ambition (interesting).‘The discouraged among the disadvantaged’ become teenage mothers.John Irwin’s purposes of prison (shudder): official ones are retribution, deterrence, and incapacitation, whereas unofficial ones are class control, scapegoating, and political gain.Penal expansion goes with welfare contraction; as inequality goes up you pay more for police.Bourdieu’s ‘economy of cultural goods’ drives class discrimination.Single parenthood is not remotely as difficult in more equal countries.In a ‘steady state’ economy increasing equality causes increasing, not decreasing, creativity – something I wondered about myself.Working hours per person increase with inequality.I really need to read some Veblen.

86,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1879990-adam,5,"Science is meant to provide provocative, unexpected insights into our world, providing clues that can help us do whatever it is we want to do. The best scientists find insights that make the world a better place, and present their findings in ways that can inspire communities to act on them. This book is among the very best science books I'm familiar with, ranking up there with The Diversity of Life and Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed. The book takes a simple, obvious progressive mantra - more equal societies are better for people - and scientifically demonstrates its validity in more ways than the most optimistic of us would ever have guessed. Wilkinson and Pickett show how inequality erodes social trust, decreases educational performance, increases homicides, shortens lives, increases consumption, causes greater conflict among children, increases drug use and mental illness, and increases the number of people in prison. Their results are checked on rich nations and among the United States. The relationship is shocking - it seems that inequality is, after a certain level of economic well-being (per capita GDP) is reached, it is by far the most important determinant of societal well-being. Their results showed that it didn't matter how a society became more equal - government organized wealth redistribution or natural market mechanisms or a strong labor movement (trade union membership is apparently the strongest predictor of inequality in a nation). Pickett and Wilkinson included a pleasing amount of speculation and research about HOW inequality causes all of the social ills it does. Apparently, merely being judged constantly as to one's social status is extremely stressful (for everyone, but moreso if you're on the bottom!). This stress leads to all sorts of things - direct health consequences, impaired mental and physical abilities, violent responses to those who question one's status, distrust of others (they are competitors, not friends!), etc. It is passed down from generation to generation, starting with stress hormones that influence a baby's development in the womb, cuing them to prepare for a harsh, antagonistic world. The results demonstrate that poverty really does inhibit peoples' ability to succeed socially, and not just for the host of obvious reasons (disenfranchisement, nutrition, etc) that are usually discussed.I found this conversation quite interesting, since the mechanisms they cite would have been active in all societies since the advent of severe inequality. Of course, inequality was much more severe in many past societies than it is in ours, so the effects were likely more severe. These biological responses to hierarchy likely explain some of the socially corrosive effects associated with civilization.The conclusions of the book are quite obvious, then: make societies more equal and all the other problems will improve on their own. In fact, increasing equality is the most effective measure known to address most of these issues. As the authors say, ""[symptomatic solutions] attempt to break the link between socio-economic disadvantage and the problems it produces. The unstated hope is that people - particularly the poor - can carry on in the same circumstances, but will somehow no longer succumb to mental illness, teenage pregnancy, educational failure, obesity, or drugs.""In summary: “In the figures there is also a clear warning for those who might want to place low public expenditure and taxation at the top of their list of priorities. If you fail to avoid high inequality, you will need more prisons and more police. You will have to deal with higher rates of mental illness, drug abuse, and every other kind of problem. If keeping taxes and benefits down leads to wider income differences, the need to deal with the ensuing social ills may force you to raise public expenditure to cope.” "

The point is that I have read a lot of the basic premises and facts in this book, indicating the impact the book has made so far, and therefore it was not as surprising as it might have been if I would have read the book in 2009. I for one already knew how badly a social status inequality affects children's educational capacities even if it was helpful to read about it again in a concrete manner with numbers to back it up. Still if did not feel like enough, what did save the book for me, was the inclusion of an additional chapter responding to their critics that was helpful and insightful, humble yet adamant in its tone to defend the vision behind the book. I have to admit that some of the correlations and as the writers claim causal relation between inequality and various social problems is quite staggering. I did get a bit skeptical at some moments, surely all these can't be related to relative and material inequality? But considering the authors never make a definitive claim (a few exceptions) but rather point out a unpleasant truth for many, that when comparing equally wealthy countries, unequal ones are worse on many levels up to homicide and numbers of innovations. I was genuinely surprised to discover that all income groups in general are better off in terms of health(mental and physical) and general life expectancy and that at some level of material wealth and economic growth no substantial gains can be made for any social indicator! Another point I found intriguing and would like to delve deeper into is the link between anxiety and depression surges in society linked to increased status consumption driven by inequality, due mostly for my connection to the feelings of pointlessness described to be felt by a growing portion of the population and my personal rejection of mental consumption coping mechanisms. Perhaps the most compelling point is that the researchers compared wealthy countries, the entire classic liberal argument ""but we will be like the USSR if we want more equality!"" is rubbish, Sweden and Canada aren't socialist dictatorships. most shocking and left me in emotional distress was the segment on junkfood and why poor people choose to eat it, the testimonies of children, homeless and youngsters as to why they spent so much time and money there, were gut wrenching. I did not like the inclusion of animal testing and references to the pre agricultural man, for I never could accept both as solid evidence, one for we are not animals (and i ethically object animal testing) and the second for claims based on how the prehistoric man lived are used by every side to defend every position for we simply can't without doubt reconstruct the mindset of these peoples (referring to current hunter forager societies as way to understand prehistoric man, is as problematic for it is increasingly clear these are not relics of our collective past but rather responses to changing conditions throughout human history). As a citizen of Belgium, one of the countries more favorable in the statistics used, this book and its ideas and vision of modern society as to be more inclusive to achieve collective well being, do not come across as a shock, this book was meant for the anglo saxon world, in tone, content and vision which as a non anglo saxon leaves me a bit underwhelmed. Still considering the times and impact the book has had so far, still makes it worthwhile especially when measures to increase inequality are gaining power in the more equal nations of Belgium and the Netherlands and the ideal of collective progress is being replaced by the need to police and look down on the poor.... unfortunately....

89,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2118933-leo-walsh,4,"An overall very interesting book that examines the negative impacts of inequality on a variety social issues. While it seems to harp on the same theme -- inequality is bad for most of us, even the wealthy -- there are some times where I found myself thinking ""correlation does not imply causation."" There seems little doubt that inequality, though, is driven by government policy. And thus reflects the hidden attitudes of those in power -- since the policies a nation's elite have followed across several decades and their effects are, rhetoric aside, the net effect of the power structures that run a country.So what we are looking at is attitudes wrought in policies. Which impact people's lives, and come out as unequal distribution of income, with the rich getting richer, and the poor getting nothing.The down side to this is that the United States is a negative outlier in nearly ever conceivable dimension when viewed against our peers. The rich get richer. Money flows into ""cost-plus"" military or engineers contracts given to influential contractors. And the profits flow to the wealthy shareholders, while those same companies move manufacturing jobs over seas.There are several stats that still shock me. For instance Cuba -- the small island nation that is much poorer than the US -- has a lower infant mortality rate and slightly higher death rate than the wealthiest nation in the world. And the research that shows that, after a certain level, pursuit wealth does not really bring satisfaction illustrates an ages-old spiritual insight. No doubt it will take more than that. But the overall analysis is sound. There are some Right-Wing attacks of this book floating around. Because word is getting out, and the findings do seem to support Progressive opinions and debunk Conservative notions. And the authors have posted an interesting article that < href=""http://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/sites... the arguments being made by the Right against the insights the authors make in this book because they are, frankly, statistically incorrect. But, more importantly, the author of this rebuttal question the author's overly clean ""to make society better, all we need to do is make income more equal.""Which smacks of intellectual honesty -- rare in any time. But refreshing in political discourse.Highly recommended. The only reason it did not get 5-stars from me is that these findings could have been summarized in about half the pages. And that the majority of it can be had for free on their website The Equality Trust. (http://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/)"

While this further provides impetus for wealth distribution, avid readers taking interest in this topic should be quick to recognize that this is a battle waged on multiple fronts. Further focuses on the accessibility of of healthy food, health care, education, and generally stable environments are all necessary, not to mention individual work towards optimizing personal attitudes and lifestyles rather than merely focusing on a change of the externals variables. All of these routes need to be taken seriously to sufficiently alleviate the problem."

The core arguments of this book are fascinating, and the data incredibly convincing. It's a long 300 odd pages though of graphs and explanations that, very quickly, and to the thesis' credit, end up being the same line of reasoning every time. The core message is that the greater the inequality in societies - the gap between the richest and poorest - the greater the levels of many of society's ills, from poor mental health, growing prison populations and declining child wellbeing. "
92,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4454139-linda,5,"Just finished reading The Spirit Level and greatly appreciated the extensive endnotes and clarity with which this book was written. The authors methodically take the reader through their thinking chapter by chapter and support their argument that greater equality in society would lead to a better human experience for everyone - even the wealthy. Contrary to some beliefs, this book does not advocate the control of the government over businesses (authors said that was distinctly NOT the answer), reminds us that it is small businesses which generally are making the largest innovative contributions to society, that Thomas Paine was right regarding aristocracy. As a history teacher and someone who also loves science, I found this book to raise numerous thoughtful questions in which we all need to engage. Reminding me that Thomas Paine rejected the value of a landed aristocracy and connecting that thinking to questioning the value of the multi-national corporations was inspirational and insightful. Logical thinking, which as a student of anthropology I realize may be incorrect when discussing societies, does lead me to believe that having some persons holding enormous pots of wealth may not be the best way to encourage people to value society, family, friends or a sense of community, but rather would encourage people to watch over their shoulders and try to keep up with the values of high consumerism. Not buying into social hierarchies or consumerism would not bring about the collapse of the world, but rather would increase one's happiness in it. Time spent trying to acquire material goods would be spent with family, friends, community service, etc which are actions long understood and supported as ways to greatly increase one's happiness. Personal connections with others would reduce corruption and greed since it is far more difficult to rip off people with whom you associate on a regular basis (yes I know that Madoff did that, but he received all that press because of his unusually egregious antisocial actions) since you would have human connection and relationships that would discourage even the desire to rip off others. The ""solution"" of this book is to move in a direction of more employee owned businesses with less competitive social hierarchies - do not forget, humanity lived for many thousands of years in hunter gatherer societies and the importance of human connection has been bred into us (think some game theory studies). The authors address the increasingly challenging attempts to control and make money on intellectual/patented knowledge and raise some interesting questions as to where this is going - how will we make money on these products as the internet and global access to knowledge increases exponentially? We are being forced to create new economic strategies to address these concerns - so whether we like it or not, we will be forced to change and change is not something the majority of human beings embrace. I found one statement particularly fascinating and worthy of extensive thought: ""An important ideological cost of the Cold War was that America gave up its historical commitment to equality."" I have not decided whether or not that is true, partially true, but I believe this is a statement worth exploring - what has happened to our civil liberties over the past few decades? Are we more free or less free (some groups have obviously achieved more freedom yet overall what is today's current thinking - have we continued to move in a freer direction?) than a few decades ago? What has been the long-term impact of the Cold War on our equality psyche? At the end of the day however, I believe that everyone will agree that inequality costs - as a teacher, I see on a daily basis the long-term impacts of inequality, how much do prisons cost us, how much does violence cost us, how much does having ""gated communities"" cost us, how much does it cost us to have some people with so much money that they behave as if they are above the law (think financial institutions, the multi-national corporations that are impacting the governments of other nations, the financial turmoil that we repeatedly experience) - I say that these things cost all of us and that a more equal, community-based society would not be a utopian dream or perfection, but it would be a great improvement over the way life is now and is something we can achieve. This is not a ""left"" or ""right"" book - this is a book that is questioning our value structure, our way of life, how long is this way of life sustainable and successfully examines the consequences of inequality."
93,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6948668-conor-mcvarnock,5,"Excellent work, the conclusions are largely intuitive and certainly nothing that should be of any sort of surprise to most of us on the socialist left (except maybe all the stuff about Japan being up there with the Scandanavian Countries). The basic point made by the book is that after a certain point, how rich or developed a country is doesn't matter after a certain point, its the level of inequality that is the decisive factor on a range of issues, levels of obesity, mental illness, heart disease, your chances of being violently assaulted. This is not merely asserted, but proven scientifically with a huge raft of peer-reviewed academic research from the field of epidemiology and hard statistical analysis. Seriously, try disagreeing with any of this and you'll end up looking like a fool, there is so much evidence on display that its hard to come to any other conclusion than that a more equal society is necessarily a better one, not just for those at the bottom, the middle and upper classes are healthier in more equal societies compared to their peers in less equal ones.Where we may disagree though is how to get from the shitty unequal state of our contemporary post-neoliberal wrecks. I say that you cannot escape the conclusion that a revolution is whats needed.Anyway, plenty of food for thought and if you enjoy smoking market fundies in debates over any social issue, then you'll find more than enough ammo here."
94,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16475435-joy-b,3,"The only negative thing I can say about this book is that they use evo psyche in two chapters to prove a point. I think this makes their work lose some credibility as evo-psyche is mainly a purely speculative field. It was a shame they had to rely heavily on it in the teenage pregnancies chapter; it was as if they couldn't look past the gender of many of the teenagers and place it in a wider context. There was also some bad neuroscience near the end. This promoted logic of, ""If this part of the area shows activity when we do this and also when we do this it MUST mean the two are the same thing."" which really deliberately reductive and something bad science journalists do. The book was good enough to not need shoddy science to reinforce its points. Other than that this book is inspiring. I recommend it to everyone. The last chapter in particular reminded me of all the reasons I got involved with activism. It's nice to know that equality is an achievable goal."

100,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3299609-ignacio,5,"There is SO MUCH to unpack from this book - I am still processing everything. Spirit Level is an in-depth research that describes the negative effects of wide inequality. Now, while on the surface, this statement might seem kind of obvious - the intricacies behind it are worth the read. The book will bombard you with data, and the results are as alarming as they are broad in terms of impact. According to their studies (and keeping in mind that strong correlation does not necessarily mean causality), countries with higher degree on inequality (leading country: USA), suffer from: - Higher rates of obesity- Higher rates of mental illness- Higher rates of anxiety/depression- Higher rates of racism and sexism- Higher rates of chronic diseases- Higher degree of self-promoting insecure egotism and status insecurity- Higher rates of violence- Higher rates of luxury fever (which pushes for over consumption) - Higher spending on criminal and judicial systems- Higher levels of mistrust- Lower life expectancy ratesIt is important to highlight that these negative consequences are not limited to the lower spectrum of society (the less resourceful) but EVEN those at the top of the scale. Ultimately, this means that you can't escape these consequences regardless of how privilege/fortunate you might be.Now, if this already seems obvious to you, something interesting is the understanding why this might be the case. According to their studies (and this applies mostly to already developed countries) countries have reached a threshold of material living standards and the benefits of further economic growth are less substantial. Economic growth is no longer a driver to wellbeing and happiness - and this comes down to our current social structures and psychology. We, as society, have become ""highly self-conscious, obsessed with how we appear to others, worried that we might come across as unattractive, boring, etc and we are constantly trying to manage the impressions we make"". This vulnerability is part of the modern psychological and societal conditions, which feeds directly into our over consumption mentality, driven by our constant anxiety of comparing ourselves to those who might have more, which ultimately snow balls into deep psychology rooted issues. I will spare the details in case you are interested in reading it - but it is important to note that these consequences reach older and younger people to even babies in the womb. Some interesting psychological/sociological concepts: 1. Luxury Fever: As inequality grows and the super-rich at the top spend more and more on luxury goods, the desire for such things cascades down the income scale and the rest of us struggle to compete and keep up.2. ‘Affluenza’ virus: a ‘set of values which increase our vulnerability to emotional distress’. It entails placing a high value on acquiring money and possessions, looking good in the eyes of others and wanting to be famous. These kinds of values place us at greater risk of depression, anxiety, substance abuse and personality disorder.3. Addiction to income: the more we have, the more we feel we need and the more time we spend on striving for material wealth and possessions, at the expense of our family life, relationships, and quality of life.This is an interesting read; however, I thought the book was light and rushed when it comes to solutions. It is evident that we as society need to change our social dynamics, but it also clear that big government is not the answer."
101,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59510129-chris,5,"The first 2/3 of this book is a thorough investigation of the relationship between income inequality and a specific array of health and social problems. The authors effectively explain the scope of their claims, discuss the mechanisms through which inequality leads to societal problems, and cite specific evidence. If you believe that socioeconomic inequality causes problems for a society - not just for the poor, but for the whole society - but you can’t really put your finger on why that is, this book will clear that question right up for you. The remaining 1/3 addresses the question of what these findings mean in historical and political context. Why are some countries more equal than others? Is change possible? How? The authors are careful not to overstep the bounds of their research here with the same certainty with which they make their claims in the earlier part of the book. And rightly so, as this would dilute the credibility of their earlier claims.They offer a broad framework for change as well as several policies and activist efforts to consider. Given the scope of the authors’ research, I found this an effective conclusion. It would have been irresponsible to ardently advocate a specific course of action without duplicating the volume of investigation. However, it would have been equally irresponsible to present these findings in a vacuum without discussing the implications and touching on how the reader should use the findings. The assertiveness of the call to action was well-calibrated to the thoroughness of the research findings presented: we KNOW greater equality will improve societies. We KNOW it is possible for a society to change its level of equality. We MUST act. We have reason to believe employee ownership, social welfare programs, and other policies have merit in effecting change. Go spread this knowledge, explore these options further, and change your society!"

Or even because you think that competition and a freer market drive the best outcomes for us all. Anyway you get here, I think you'll find this a thought provoking read about the way insidious ways that inequality (of outcome and opportunity) harms societies and individuals.Generally, I think this is fairly well argued. The authors don't start from the premise that inequality causes poor social outcomes (obesity, teen pregnancy, property crime, mental health struggles, higher prison populations, poorer health outcomes etc), they start from the premise that inequality is often correlated with these things. Then they investigate the ways in which inequality erodes trust and increases stress across communities and nations, and the lower outcomes for all levels of society, even the rich.Though they provide citations and an explanation of the data they used and how they analyzed it, I did find one or two of their arguments a little hand-wavy. On the other hand, they intended this book for general consumption, and probably didn't want to overwhelm people with interminable paragraphs. I also wasn't entirely convinced that their proposed solutions to unequal societies were as well thought out as their previous chapters. But that also makes sense. They're researchers, not policy wonks.In any case, this is an important and readable book, and if you're interested in the macro level of how societies work, this is a good one to pick up."

All of this applies across different levels of society (not just for the poor, rich nor middle class, but everyone!). Equality also extends to relations with other people or groups of people, or even between countries; more equality in your community=more trust=more mutual profit for everyone you work with. They certainly make a convincing case. My only concern is that being a welfare-state living, equality loving Finn, I was already inclined to thinking this way, so I should probably get familiar with the critique these guys have encountered :)Anyways, inspiring stuff, and can't wait to read their new book!Update after reading the critique from ""spirit level delusion""-blog:It seems that the writers may have been building on their own biased hyphothesis and not looking for alternative outcomes at all. The data may have been cherry-picked and the results can't necessarily be repeated with another set of countries or at another point in time. However, the critiq seems to also have picked a certain year to look at. How about averages over a longer time period?Had to remove one star for that and stop being excited about the results...

104,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47469897-daniel-foster,3,"I found this book well written but I find it difficult to see how you can compare societies which are culturally fairly homogeneous, such as the Scandinavian countries and japan to much larger multi cultural states like the US and draw any real conclusions. If people are largely similar in culture then why would they not have more equal outcomes then in a country like the US which is so much larger and made up of different groups? There was some attempt to address this in the book but it was fairly brief. It seems to me that things such as crime, education, drug use etc would tend to correlate together and so would not need a separate chapter for each topic.  It will be interesting to see how a country like Sweden fares in the future since it has excepted large numbers of refugees. Will inequality rise or will its welfare programme lift everyone up to a similar status.I feel the book made some very interesting points and I am in agreement that inequality is a bad thing in general but I am unconvinced with much of the central premise of the book."

Reading this book has profoundly changed my opinion and my understanding of the role of inequality (notably on incomes) and its relationship with health and social issues that affect the well-being of society and nation as a whole. Having been living in New Zealand for over twenty years, I do observed the manifestation of health and social issues that can be attributed to inequality. Sadly, the inequality gap in New Zealand has widened since the study. I think New Zealand had forgotten that it was once a nation that was big on fairness and egalitarian ethos.For decades now, the Scandinavian model of social democracy had shown us that the model has the capability to close the inequality gap, perhaps it's time for English-speaking countries to adapt the model if we indeed serious about fairness and equality for our people.A different angle to appreciate how a big deal inequality really is, read: 23 Things They Don't Tell You About Capitalism - Ha-Joon Chang."

Points of learning:Beyond a certain point, rise in GDP makes no material difference to people’s wellbeing.Evaluative threat is a stressor resulting in ‘rising anxiety and a narcissitic defence of an insecure self image’.Violence is more common in unequal societies because ‘loss of face’ when people feel disrespected is the only thing they have to lose.Income inequality is the ‘prime mover’ of trust.Children’s mental health is strongly correlated with income inequality.Surprisingly to me, there is no relationship between health spending per person and life expectancy.Early childhood educational programmes are high yield.Flatter inequality also means flatter ambition (interesting).‘The discouraged among the disadvantaged’ become teenage mothers.John Irwin’s purposes of prison (shudder): official ones are retribution, deterrence, and incapacitation, whereas unofficial ones are class control, scapegoating, and political gain.Penal expansion goes with welfare contraction; as inequality goes up you pay more for police.Bourdieu’s ‘economy of cultural goods’ drives class discrimination.Single parenthood is not remotely as difficult in more equal countries.In a ‘steady state’ economy increasing equality causes increasing, not decreasing, creativity – something I wondered about myself.Working hours per person increase with inequality.I really need to read some Veblen.

116,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1879990-adam,5,"Science is meant to provide provocative, unexpected insights into our world, providing clues that can help us do whatever it is we want to do. The best scientists find insights that make the world a better place, and present their findings in ways that can inspire communities to act on them. This book is among the very best science books I'm familiar with, ranking up there with The Diversity of Life and Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed. The book takes a simple, obvious progressive mantra - more equal societies are better for people - and scientifically demonstrates its validity in more ways than the most optimistic of us would ever have guessed. Wilkinson and Pickett show how inequality erodes social trust, decreases educational performance, increases homicides, shortens lives, increases consumption, causes greater conflict among children, increases drug use and mental illness, and increases the number of people in prison. Their results are checked on rich nations and among the United States. The relationship is shocking - it seems that inequality is, after a certain level of economic well-being (per capita GDP) is reached, it is by far the most important determinant of societal well-being. Their results showed that it didn't matter how a society became more equal - government organized wealth redistribution or natural market mechanisms or a strong labor movement (trade union membership is apparently the strongest predictor of inequality in a nation). Pickett and Wilkinson included a pleasing amount of speculation and research about HOW inequality causes all of the social ills it does. Apparently, merely being judged constantly as to one's social status is extremely stressful (for everyone, but moreso if you're on the bottom!). This stress leads to all sorts of things - direct health consequences, impaired mental and physical abilities, violent responses to those who question one's status, distrust of others (they are competitors, not friends!), etc. It is passed down from generation to generation, starting with stress hormones that influence a baby's development in the womb, cuing them to prepare for a harsh, antagonistic world. The results demonstrate that poverty really does inhibit peoples' ability to succeed socially, and not just for the host of obvious reasons (disenfranchisement, nutrition, etc) that are usually discussed.I found this conversation quite interesting, since the mechanisms they cite would have been active in all societies since the advent of severe inequality. Of course, inequality was much more severe in many past societies than it is in ours, so the effects were likely more severe. These biological responses to hierarchy likely explain some of the socially corrosive effects associated with civilization.The conclusions of the book are quite obvious, then: make societies more equal and all the other problems will improve on their own. In fact, increasing equality is the most effective measure known to address most of these issues. As the authors say, ""[symptomatic solutions] attempt to break the link between socio-economic disadvantage and the problems it produces. The unstated hope is that people - particularly the poor - can carry on in the same circumstances, but will somehow no longer succumb to mental illness, teenage pregnancy, educational failure, obesity, or drugs.""In summary: “In the figures there is also a clear warning for those who might want to place low public expenditure and taxation at the top of their list of priorities. If you fail to avoid high inequality, you will need more prisons and more police. You will have to deal with higher rates of mental illness, drug abuse, and every other kind of problem. If keeping taxes and benefits down leads to wider income differences, the need to deal with the ensuing social ills may force you to raise public expenditure to cope.” "

Don't get me wrong, it is not that the book is bad in a literary, academic or political way but it did not wow me. The point is that I have read a lot of the basic premises and facts in this book, indicating the impact the book has made so far, and therefore it was not as surprising as it might have been if I would have read the book in 2009. I for one already knew how badly a social status inequality affects children's educational capacities even if it was helpful to read about it again in a concrete manner with numbers to back it up. Still if did not feel like enough, what did save the book for me, was the inclusion of an additional chapter responding to their critics that was helpful and insightful, humble yet adamant in its tone to defend the vision behind the book. I have to admit that some of the correlations and as the writers claim causal relation between inequality and various social problems is quite staggering. I did get a bit skeptical at some moments, surely all these can't be related to relative and material inequality? But considering the authors never make a definitive claim (a few exceptions) but rather point out a unpleasant truth for many, that when comparing equally wealthy countries, unequal ones are worse on many levels up to homicide and numbers of innovations. I was genuinely surprised to discover that all income groups in general are better off in terms of health(mental and physical) and general life expectancy and that at some level of material wealth and economic growth no substantial gains can be made for any social indicator! Another point I found intriguing and would like to delve deeper into is the link between anxiety and depression surges in society linked to increased status consumption driven by inequality, due mostly for my connection to the feelings of pointlessness described to be felt by a growing portion of the population and my personal rejection of mental consumption coping mechanisms. Perhaps the most compelling point is that the researchers compared wealthy countries, the entire classic liberal argument ""but we will be like the USSR if we want more equality!"" is rubbish, Sweden and Canada aren't socialist dictatorships. most shocking and left me in emotional distress was the segment on junkfood and why poor people choose to eat it, the testimonies of children, homeless and youngsters as to why they spent so much time and money there, were gut wrenching. I did not like the inclusion of animal testing and references to the pre agricultural man, for I never could accept both as solid evidence, one for we are not animals (and i ethically object animal testing) and the second for claims based on how the prehistoric man lived are used by every side to defend every position for we simply can't without doubt reconstruct the mindset of these peoples (referring to current hunter forager societies as way to understand prehistoric man, is as problematic for it is increasingly clear these are not relics of our collective past but rather responses to changing conditions throughout human history). As a citizen of Belgium, one of the countries more favorable in the statistics used, this book and its ideas and vision of modern society as to be more inclusive to achieve collective well being, do not come across as a shock, this book was meant for the anglo saxon world, in tone, content and vision which as a non anglo saxon leaves me a bit underwhelmed. Still considering the times and impact the book has had so far, still makes it worthwhile especially when measures to increase inequality are gaining power in the more equal nations of Belgium and the Netherlands and the ideal of collective progress is being replaced by the need to police and look down on the poor.... unfortunately....

119,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2118933-leo-walsh,4,"An overall very interesting book that examines the negative impacts of inequality on a variety social issues. While it seems to harp on the same theme -- inequality is bad for most of us, even the wealthy -- there are some times where I found myself thinking ""correlation does not imply causation."" There seems little doubt that inequality, though, is driven by government policy. And thus reflects the hidden attitudes of those in power -- since the policies a nation's elite have followed across several decades and their effects are, rhetoric aside, the net effect of the power structures that run a country.So what we are looking at is attitudes wrought in policies. Which impact people's lives, and come out as unequal distribution of income, with the rich getting richer, and the poor getting nothing.The down side to this is that the United States is a negative outlier in nearly ever conceivable dimension when viewed against our peers. The rich get richer. Money flows into ""cost-plus"" military or engineers contracts given to influential contractors. And the profits flow to the wealthy shareholders, while those same companies move manufacturing jobs over seas.There are several stats that still shock me. For instance Cuba -- the small island nation that is much poorer than the US -- has a lower infant mortality rate and slightly higher death rate than the wealthiest nation in the world. And the research that shows that, after a certain level, pursuit wealth does not really bring satisfaction illustrates an ages-old spiritual insight. No doubt it will take more than that. But the overall analysis is sound. There are some Right-Wing attacks of this book floating around. Because word is getting out, and the findings do seem to support Progressive opinions and debunk Conservative notions. And the authors have posted an interesting article that < href=""http://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/sites... the arguments being made by the Right against the insights the authors make in this book because they are, frankly, statistically incorrect. But, more importantly, the author of this rebuttal question the author's overly clean ""to make society better, all we need to do is make income more equal.""Which smacks of intellectual honesty -- rare in any time. But refreshing in political discourse.Highly recommended. The only reason it did not get 5-stars from me is that these findings could have been summarized in about half the pages. And that the majority of it can be had for free on their website The Equality Trust. (http://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/)"

While this further provides impetus for wealth distribution, avid readers taking interest in this topic should be quick to recognize that this is a battle waged on multiple fronts. Further focuses on the accessibility of of healthy food, health care, education, and generally stable environments are all necessary, not to mention individual work towards optimizing personal attitudes and lifestyles rather than merely focusing on a change of the externals variables. All of these routes need to be taken seriously to sufficiently alleviate the problem."

The core arguments of this book are fascinating, and the data incredibly convincing. It's a long 300 odd pages though of graphs and explanations that, very quickly, and to the thesis' credit, end up being the same line of reasoning every time. The core message is that the greater the inequality in societies - the gap between the richest and poorest - the greater the levels of many of society's ills, from poor mental health, growing prison populations and declining child wellbeing. "
122,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4454139-linda,5,"Just finished reading The Spirit Level and greatly appreciated the extensive endnotes and clarity with which this book was written. The authors methodically take the reader through their thinking chapter by chapter and support their argument that greater equality in society would lead to a better human experience for everyone - even the wealthy. Contrary to some beliefs, this book does not advocate the control of the government over businesses (authors said that was distinctly NOT the answer), reminds us that it is small businesses which generally are making the largest innovative contributions to society, that Thomas Paine was right regarding aristocracy. As a history teacher and someone who also loves science, I found this book to raise numerous thoughtful questions in which we all need to engage. Reminding me that Thomas Paine rejected the value of a landed aristocracy and connecting that thinking to questioning the value of the multi-national corporations was inspirational and insightful. Logical thinking, which as a student of anthropology I realize may be incorrect when discussing societies, does lead me to believe that having some persons holding enormous pots of wealth may not be the best way to encourage people to value society, family, friends or a sense of community, but rather would encourage people to watch over their shoulders and try to keep up with the values of high consumerism. Not buying into social hierarchies or consumerism would not bring about the collapse of the world, but rather would increase one's happiness in it. Time spent trying to acquire material goods would be spent with family, friends, community service, etc which are actions long understood and supported as ways to greatly increase one's happiness. Personal connections with others would reduce corruption and greed since it is far more difficult to rip off people with whom you associate on a regular basis (yes I know that Madoff did that, but he received all that press because of his unusually egregious antisocial actions) since you would have human connection and relationships that would discourage even the desire to rip off others. The ""solution"" of this book is to move in a direction of more employee owned businesses with less competitive social hierarchies - do not forget, humanity lived for many thousands of years in hunter gatherer societies and the importance of human connection has been bred into us (think some game theory studies). The authors address the increasingly challenging attempts to control and make money on intellectual/patented knowledge and raise some interesting questions as to where this is going - how will we make money on these products as the internet and global access to knowledge increases exponentially? We are being forced to create new economic strategies to address these concerns - so whether we like it or not, we will be forced to change and change is not something the majority of human beings embrace. I found one statement particularly fascinating and worthy of extensive thought: ""An important ideological cost of the Cold War was that America gave up its historical commitment to equality."" I have not decided whether or not that is true, partially true, but I believe this is a statement worth exploring - what has happened to our civil liberties over the past few decades? Are we more free or less free (some groups have obviously achieved more freedom yet overall what is today's current thinking - have we continued to move in a freer direction?) than a few decades ago? What has been the long-term impact of the Cold War on our equality psyche? At the end of the day however, I believe that everyone will agree that inequality costs - as a teacher, I see on a daily basis the long-term impacts of inequality, how much do prisons cost us, how much does violence cost us, how much does having ""gated communities"" cost us, how much does it cost us to have some people with so much money that they behave as if they are above the law (think financial institutions, the multi-national corporations that are impacting the governments of other nations, the financial turmoil that we repeatedly experience) - I say that these things cost all of us and that a more equal, community-based society would not be a utopian dream or perfection, but it would be a great improvement over the way life is now and is something we can achieve. This is not a ""left"" or ""right"" book - this is a book that is questioning our value structure, our way of life, how long is this way of life sustainable and successfully examines the consequences of inequality."
123,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6948668-conor-mcvarnock,5,"Excellent work, the conclusions are largely intuitive and certainly nothing that should be of any sort of surprise to most of us on the socialist left (except maybe all the stuff about Japan being up there with the Scandanavian Countries). The basic point made by the book is that after a certain point, how rich or developed a country is doesn't matter after a certain point, its the level of inequality that is the decisive factor on a range of issues, levels of obesity, mental illness, heart disease, your chances of being violently assaulted. This is not merely asserted, but proven scientifically with a huge raft of peer-reviewed academic research from the field of epidemiology and hard statistical analysis. Seriously, try disagreeing with any of this and you'll end up looking like a fool, there is so much evidence on display that its hard to come to any other conclusion than that a more equal society is necessarily a better one, not just for those at the bottom, the middle and upper classes are healthier in more equal societies compared to their peers in less equal ones.Where we may disagree though is how to get from the shitty unequal state of our contemporary post-neoliberal wrecks. I say that you cannot escape the conclusion that a revolution is whats needed.Anyway, plenty of food for thought and if you enjoy smoking market fundies in debates over any social issue, then you'll find more than enough ammo here."
124,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16475435-joy-b,3,"The only negative thing I can say about this book is that they use evo psyche in two chapters to prove a point. I think this makes their work lose some credibility as evo-psyche is mainly a purely speculative field. It was a shame they had to rely heavily on it in the teenage pregnancies chapter; it was as if they couldn't look past the gender of many of the teenagers and place it in a wider context. There was also some bad neuroscience near the end. This promoted logic of, ""If this part of the area shows activity when we do this and also when we do this it MUST mean the two are the same thing."" which really deliberately reductive and something bad science journalists do. The book was good enough to not need shoddy science to reinforce its points. Other than that this book is inspiring. I recommend it to everyone. The last chapter in particular reminded me of all the reasons I got involved with activism. It's nice to know that equality is an achievable goal."

130,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3299609-ignacio,5,"There is SO MUCH to unpack from this book - I am still processing everything. Spirit Level is an in-depth research that describes the negative effects of wide inequality. Now, while on the surface, this statement might seem kind of obvious - the intricacies behind it are worth the read. The book will bombard you with data, and the results are as alarming as they are broad in terms of impact. According to their studies (and keeping in mind that strong correlation does not necessarily mean causality), countries with higher degree on inequality (leading country: USA), suffer from: - Higher rates of obesity- Higher rates of mental illness- Higher rates of anxiety/depression- Higher rates of racism and sexism- Higher rates of chronic diseases- Higher degree of self-promoting insecure egotism and status insecurity- Higher rates of violence- Higher rates of luxury fever (which pushes for over consumption) - Higher spending on criminal and judicial systems- Higher levels of mistrust- Lower life expectancy ratesIt is important to highlight that these negative consequences are not limited to the lower spectrum of society (the less resourceful) but EVEN those at the top of the scale. Ultimately, this means that you can't escape these consequences regardless of how privilege/fortunate you might be.Now, if this already seems obvious to you, something interesting is the understanding why this might be the case. According to their studies (and this applies mostly to already developed countries) countries have reached a threshold of material living standards and the benefits of further economic growth are less substantial. Economic growth is no longer a driver to wellbeing and happiness - and this comes down to our current social structures and psychology. We, as society, have become ""highly self-conscious, obsessed with how we appear to others, worried that we might come across as unattractive, boring, etc and we are constantly trying to manage the impressions we make"". This vulnerability is part of the modern psychological and societal conditions, which feeds directly into our over consumption mentality, driven by our constant anxiety of comparing ourselves to those who might have more, which ultimately snow balls into deep psychology rooted issues. I will spare the details in case you are interested in reading it - but it is important to note that these consequences reach older and younger people to even babies in the womb. Some interesting psychological/sociological concepts: 1. Luxury Fever: As inequality grows and the super-rich at the top spend more and more on luxury goods, the desire for such things cascades down the income scale and the rest of us struggle to compete and keep up.2. ‘Affluenza’ virus: a ‘set of values which increase our vulnerability to emotional distress’. It entails placing a high value on acquiring money and possessions, looking good in the eyes of others and wanting to be famous. These kinds of values place us at greater risk of depression, anxiety, substance abuse and personality disorder.3. Addiction to income: the more we have, the more we feel we need and the more time we spend on striving for material wealth and possessions, at the expense of our family life, relationships, and quality of life.This is an interesting read; however, I thought the book was light and rushed when it comes to solutions. It is evident that we as society need to change our social dynamics, but it also clear that big government is not the answer."
131,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59510129-chris,5,"The first 2/3 of this book is a thorough investigation of the relationship between income inequality and a specific array of health and social problems. The authors effectively explain the scope of their claims, discuss the mechanisms through which inequality leads to societal problems, and cite specific evidence. If you believe that socioeconomic inequality causes problems for a society - not just for the poor, but for the whole society - but you can’t really put your finger on why that is, this book will clear that question right up for you. The remaining 1/3 addresses the question of what these findings mean in historical and political context. Why are some countries more equal than others? Is change possible? How? The authors are careful not to overstep the bounds of their research here with the same certainty with which they make their claims in the earlier part of the book. And rightly so, as this would dilute the credibility of their earlier claims.They offer a broad framework for change as well as several policies and activist efforts to consider. Given the scope of the authors’ research, I found this an effective conclusion. It would have been irresponsible to ardently advocate a specific course of action without duplicating the volume of investigation. However, it would have been equally irresponsible to present these findings in a vacuum without discussing the implications and touching on how the reader should use the findings. The assertiveness of the call to action was well-calibrated to the thoroughness of the research findings presented: we KNOW greater equality will improve societies. We KNOW it is possible for a society to change its level of equality. We MUST act. We have reason to believe employee ownership, social welfare programs, and other policies have merit in effecting change.

Or even because you think that competition and a freer market drive the best outcomes for us all. Anyway you get here, I think you'll find this a thought provoking read about the way insidious ways that inequality (of outcome and opportunity) harms societies and individuals.Generally, I think this is fairly well argued. The authors don't start from the premise that inequality causes poor social outcomes (obesity, teen pregnancy, property crime, mental health struggles, higher prison populations, poorer health outcomes etc), they start from the premise that inequality is often correlated with these things. Then they investigate the ways in which inequality erodes trust and increases stress across communities and nations, and the lower outcomes for all levels of society, even the rich.Though they provide citations and an explanation of the data they used and how they analyzed it, I did find one or two of their arguments a little hand-wavy. On the other hand, they intended this book for general consumption, and probably didn't want to overwhelm people with interminable paragraphs. I also wasn't entirely convinced that their proposed solutions to unequal societies were as well thought out as their previous chapters. But that also makes sense. They're researchers, not policy wonks.In any case, this is an important and readable book, and if you're interested in the macro level of how societies work, this is a good one to pick up."

All of this applies across different levels of society (not just for the poor, rich nor middle class, but everyone!). Equality also extends to relations with other people or groups of people, or even between countries; more equality in your community=more trust=more mutual profit for everyone you work with. They certainly make a convincing case. My only concern is that being a welfare-state living, equality loving Finn, I was already inclined to thinking this way, so I should probably get familiar with the critique these guys have encountered :)Anyways, inspiring stuff, and can't wait to read their new book!Update after reading the critique from ""spirit level delusion""-blog:It seems that the writers may have been building on their own biased hyphothesis and not looking for alternative outcomes at all. The data may have been cherry-picked and the results can't necessarily be repeated with another set of countries or at another point in time.

If people are largely similar in culture then why would they not have more equal outcomes then in a country like the US which is so much larger and made up of different groups? There was some attempt to address this in the book but it was fairly brief. It seems to me that things such as crime, education, drug use etc would tend to correlate together and so would not need a separate chapter for each topic.  It will be interesting to see how a country like Sweden fares in the future since it has excepted large numbers of refugees. Will inequality rise or will its welfare programme lift everyone up to a similar status.I feel the book made some very interesting points and I am in agreement that inequality is a bad thing in general but I am unconvinced with much of the central premise of the book."

Reading this book has profoundly changed my opinion and my understanding of the role of inequality (notably on incomes) and its relationship with health and social issues that affect the well-being of society and nation as a whole. Having been living in New Zealand for over twenty years, I do observed the manifestation of health and social issues that can be attributed to inequality. Sadly, the inequality gap in New Zealand has widened since the study. I think New Zealand had forgotten that it was once a nation that was big on fairness and egalitarian ethos.For decades now, the Scandinavian model of social democracy had shown us that the model has the capability to close the inequality gap, perhaps it's time for English-speaking countries to adapt the model if we indeed serious about fairness and equality for our people.A different angle to appreciate how a big deal inequality really is, read: 23 Things They Don't Tell You About Capitalism - Ha-Joon Chang."

Points of learning:Beyond a certain point, rise in GDP makes no material difference to people’s wellbeing.Evaluative threat is a stressor resulting in ‘rising anxiety and a narcissitic defence of an insecure self image’.Violence is more common in unequal societies because ‘loss of face’ when people feel disrespected is the only thing they have to lose.Income inequality is the ‘prime mover’ of trust.Children’s mental health is strongly correlated with income inequality.Surprisingly to me, there is no relationship between health spending per person and life expectancy.Early childhood educational programmes are high yield.Flatter inequality also means flatter ambition (interesting).‘The discouraged among the disadvantaged’ become teenage mothers.John Irwin’s purposes of prison (shudder): official ones are retribution, deterrence, and incapacitation, whereas unofficial ones are class control, scapegoating, and political gain.Penal expansion goes with welfare contraction; as inequality goes up you pay more for police.Bourdieu’s ‘economy of cultural goods’ drives class discrimination.Single parenthood is not remotely as difficult in more equal countries.In a ‘steady state’ economy increasing equality causes increasing, not decreasing, creativity – something I wondered about myself.Working hours per person increase with inequality.I really need to read some Veblen.

Wilkinson and Pickett show how inequality erodes social trust, decreases educational performance, increases homicides, shortens lives, increases consumption, causes greater conflict among children, increases drug use and mental illness, and increases the number of people in prison. Their results are checked on rich nations and among the United States. The relationship is shocking - it seems that inequality is, after a certain level of economic well-being (per capita GDP) is reached, it is by far the most important determinant of societal well-being. Their results showed that it didn't matter how a society became more equal - government organized wealth redistribution or natural market mechanisms or a strong labor movement (trade union membership is apparently the strongest predictor of inequality in a nation). Pickett and Wilkinson included a pleasing amount of speculation and research about HOW inequality causes all of the social ills it does. Apparently, merely being judged constantly as to one's social status is extremely stressful (for everyone, but moreso if you're on the bottom!). This stress leads to all sorts of things - direct health consequences, impaired mental and physical abilities, violent responses to those who question one's status, distrust of others (they are competitors, not friends!), etc. It is passed down from generation to generation, starting with stress hormones that influence a baby's development in the womb, cuing them to prepare for a harsh, antagonistic world. The results demonstrate that poverty really does inhibit peoples' ability to succeed socially, and not just for the host of obvious reasons (disenfranchisement, nutrition, etc) that are usually discussed.I found this conversation quite interesting, since the mechanisms they cite would have been active in all societies since the advent of severe inequality. Of course, inequality was much more severe in many past societies than it is in ours, so the effects were likely more severe. These biological responses to hierarchy likely explain some of the socially corrosive effects associated with civilization.The conclusions of the book are quite obvious, then: make societies more equal and all the other problems will improve on their own. In fact, increasing equality is the most effective measure known to address most of these issues. As the authors say, ""[symptomatic solutions] attempt to break the link between socio-economic disadvantage and the problems it produces. The unstated hope is that people - particularly the poor - can carry on in the same circumstances, but will somehow no longer succumb to mental illness, teenage pregnancy, educational failure, obesity, or drugs.""In summary: “In the figures there is also a clear warning for those who might want to place low public expenditure and taxation at the top of their list of priorities. If you fail to avoid high inequality, you will need more prisons and more police. You will have to deal with higher rates of mental illness, drug abuse, and every other kind of problem. If keeping taxes and benefits down leads to wider income differences, the need to deal with the ensuing social ills may force you to raise public expenditure to cope.” "

Don't get me wrong, it is not that the book is bad in a literary, academic or political way but it did not wow me. The point is that I have read a lot of the basic premises and facts in this book, indicating the impact the book has made so far, and therefore it was not as surprising as it might have been if I would have read the book in 2009. I for one already knew how badly a social status inequality affects children's educational capacities even if it was helpful to read about it again in a concrete manner with numbers to back it up. Still if did not feel like enough, what did save the book for me, was the inclusion of an additional chapter responding to their critics that was helpful and insightful, humble yet adamant in its tone to defend the vision behind the book. I have to admit that some of the correlations and as the writers claim causal relation between inequality and various social problems is quite staggering. I did get a bit skeptical at some moments, surely all these can't be related to relative and material inequality? But considering the authors never make a definitive claim (a few exceptions) but rather point out a unpleasant truth for many, that when comparing equally wealthy countries, unequal ones are worse on many levels up to homicide and numbers of innovations. I was genuinely surprised to discover that all income groups in general are better off in terms of health(mental and physical) and general life expectancy and that at some level of material wealth and economic growth no substantial gains can be made for any social indicator! Another point I found intriguing and would like to delve deeper into is the link between anxiety and depression surges in society linked to increased status consumption driven by inequality, due mostly for my connection to the feelings of pointlessness described to be felt by a growing portion of the population and my personal rejection of mental consumption coping mechanisms. Perhaps the most compelling point is that the researchers compared wealthy countries, the entire classic liberal argument ""but we will be like the USSR if we want more equality!"" is rubbish, Sweden and Canada aren't socialist dictatorships. most shocking and left me in emotional distress was the segment on junkfood and why poor people choose to eat it, the testimonies of children, homeless and youngsters as to why they spent so much time and money there, were gut wrenching. I did not like the inclusion of animal testing and references to the pre agricultural man, for I never could accept both as solid evidence, one for we are not animals (and i ethically object animal testing) and the second for claims based on how the prehistoric man lived are used by every side to defend every position for we simply can't without doubt reconstruct the mindset of these peoples (referring to current hunter forager societies as way to understand prehistoric man, is as problematic for it is increasingly clear these are not relics of our collective past but rather responses to changing conditions throughout human history). As a citizen of Belgium, one of the countries more favorable in the statistics used, this book and its ideas and vision of modern society as to be more inclusive to achieve collective well being, do not come across as a shock, this book was meant for the anglo saxon world, in tone, content and vision which as a non anglo saxon leaves me a bit underwhelmed. Still considering the times and impact the book has had so far, still makes it worthwhile especially when measures to increase inequality are gaining power in the more equal nations of Belgium and the Netherlands and the ideal of collective progress is being replaced by the need to police and look down on the poor.... unfortunately....

148,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5355264-monica,5,The authors bring evidence to what I knew intuitively. I feel vindicated.
149,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2118933-leo-walsh,4,"An overall very interesting book that examines the negative impacts of inequality on a variety social issues. While it seems to harp on the same theme -- inequality is bad for most of us, even the wealthy -- there are some times where I found myself thinking ""correlation does not imply causation."" There seems little doubt that inequality, though, is driven by government policy. And thus reflects the hidden attitudes of those in power -- since the policies a nation's elite have followed across several decades and their effects are, rhetoric aside, the net effect of the power structures that run a country.So what we are looking at is attitudes wrought in policies. Which impact people's lives, and come out as unequal distribution of income, with the rich getting richer, and the poor getting nothing.The down side to this is that the United States is a negative outlier in nearly ever conceivable dimension when viewed against our peers. The rich get richer. Money flows into ""cost-plus"" military or engineers contracts given to influential contractors. And the profits flow to the wealthy shareholders, while those same companies move manufacturing jobs over seas.There are several stats that still shock me. For instance Cuba -- the small island nation that is much poorer than the US -- has a lower infant mortality rate and slightly higher death rate than the wealthiest nation in the world. And the research that shows that, after a certain level, pursuit wealth does not really bring satisfaction illustrates an ages-old spiritual insight. No doubt it will take more than that. But the overall analysis is sound. There are some Right-Wing attacks of this book floating around. Because word is getting out, and the findings do seem to support Progressive opinions and debunk Conservative notions. And the authors have posted an interesting article that < href=""http://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/sites... the arguments being made by the Right against the insights the authors make in this book because they are, frankly, statistically incorrect. But, more importantly, the author of this rebuttal question the author's overly clean ""to make society better, all we need to do is make income more equal.""Which smacks of intellectual honesty -- rare in any time. But refreshing in political discourse.Highly recommended. The only reason it did not get 5-stars from me is that these findings could have been summarized in about half the pages. And that the majority of it can be had for free on their website The Equality Trust. (http://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/)"

While this further provides impetus for wealth distribution, avid readers taking interest in this topic should be quick to recognize that this is a battle waged on multiple fronts. Further focuses on the accessibility of of healthy food, health care, education, and generally stable environments are all necessary, not to mention individual work towards optimizing personal attitudes and lifestyles rather than merely focusing on a change of the externals variables. All of these routes need to be taken seriously to sufficiently alleviate the problem."

The core arguments of this book are fascinating, and the data incredibly convincing. It's a long 300 odd pages though of graphs and explanations that, very quickly, and to the thesis' credit, end up being the same line of reasoning every time. The core message is that the greater the inequality in societies - the gap between the richest and poorest - the greater the levels of many of society's ills, from poor mental health, growing prison populations and declining child wellbeing. "
152,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4454139-linda,5,"Just finished reading The Spirit Level and greatly appreciated the extensive endnotes and clarity with which this book was written. The authors methodically take the reader through their thinking chapter by chapter and support their argument that greater equality in society would lead to a better human experience for everyone - even the wealthy. Contrary to some beliefs, this book does not advocate the control of the government over businesses (authors said that was distinctly NOT the answer), reminds us that it is small businesses which generally are making the largest innovative contributions to society, that Thomas Paine was right regarding aristocracy. As a history teacher and someone who also loves science, I found this book to raise numerous thoughtful questions in which we all need to engage. Reminding me that Thomas Paine rejected the value of a landed aristocracy and connecting that thinking to questioning the value of the multi-national corporations was inspirational and insightful. Logical thinking, which as a student of anthropology I realize may be incorrect when discussing societies, does lead me to believe that having some persons holding enormous pots of wealth may not be the best way to encourage people to value society, family, friends or a sense of community, but rather would encourage people to watch over their shoulders and try to keep up with the values of high consumerism. Not buying into social hierarchies or consumerism would not bring about the collapse of the world, but rather would increase one's happiness in it. Time spent trying to acquire material goods would be spent with family, friends, community service, etc which are actions long understood and supported as ways to greatly increase one's happiness. Personal connections with others would reduce corruption and greed since it is far more difficult to rip off people with whom you associate on a regular basis (yes I know that Madoff did that, but he received all that press because of his unusually egregious antisocial actions) since you would have human connection and relationships that would discourage even the desire to rip off others. The ""solution"" of this book is to move in a direction of more employee owned businesses with less competitive social hierarchies - do not forget, humanity lived for many thousands of years in hunter gatherer societies and the importance of human connection has been bred into us (think some game theory studies). The authors address the increasingly challenging attempts to control and make money on intellectual/patented knowledge and raise some interesting questions as to where this is going - how will we make money on these products as the internet and global access to knowledge increases exponentially? We are being forced to create new economic strategies to address these concerns - so whether we like it or not, we will be forced to change and change is not something the majority of human beings embrace. I found one statement particularly fascinating and worthy of extensive thought: ""An important ideological cost of the Cold War was that America gave up its historical commitment to equality."" I have not decided whether or not that is true, partially true, but I believe this is a statement worth exploring - what has happened to our civil liberties over the past few decades? Are we more free or less free (some groups have obviously achieved more freedom yet overall what is today's current thinking - have we continued to move in a freer direction?) than a few decades ago? What has been the long-term impact of the Cold War on our equality psyche? At the end of the day however, I believe that everyone will agree that inequality costs - as a teacher, I see on a daily basis the long-term impacts of inequality, how much do prisons cost us, how much does violence cost us, how much does having ""gated communities"" cost us, how much does it cost us to have some people with so much money that they behave as if they are above the law (think financial institutions, the multi-national corporations that are impacting the governments of other nations, the financial turmoil that we repeatedly experience) - I say that these things cost all of us and that a more equal, community-based society would not be a utopian dream or perfection, but it would be a great improvement over the way life is now and is something we can achieve. This is not a ""left"" or ""right"" book - this is a book that is questioning our value structure, our way of life, how long is this way of life sustainable and successfully examines the consequences of inequality."
153,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6948668-conor-mcvarnock,5,"Excellent work, the conclusions are largely intuitive and certainly nothing that should be of any sort of surprise to most of us on the socialist left (except maybe all the stuff about Japan being up there with the Scandanavian Countries). The basic point made by the book is that after a certain point, how rich or developed a country is doesn't matter after a certain point, its the level of inequality that is the decisive factor on a range of issues, levels of obesity, mental illness, heart disease, your chances of being violently assaulted. This is not merely asserted, but proven scientifically with a huge raft of peer-reviewed academic research from the field of epidemiology and hard statistical analysis. Seriously, try disagreeing with any of this and you'll end up looking like a fool, there is so much evidence on display that its hard to come to any other conclusion than that a more equal society is necessarily a better one, not just for those at the bottom, the middle and upper classes are healthier in more equal societies compared to their peers in less equal ones.Where we may disagree though is how to get from the shitty unequal state of our contemporary post-neoliberal wrecks. I say that you cannot escape the conclusion that a revolution is whats needed.Anyway, plenty of food for thought and if you enjoy smoking market fundies in debates over any social issue, then you'll find more than enough ammo here."
154,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16475435-joy-b,3,"The only negative thing I can say about this book is that they use evo psyche in two chapters to prove a point. I think this makes their work lose some credibility as evo-psyche is mainly a purely speculative field. It was a shame they had to rely heavily on it in the teenage pregnancies chapter; it was as if they couldn't look past the gender of many of the teenagers and place it in a wider context. There was also some bad neuroscience near the end. This promoted logic of, ""If this part of the area shows activity when we do this and also when we do this it MUST mean the two are the same thing."" which really deliberately reductive and something bad science journalists do. The book was good enough to not need shoddy science to reinforce its points. Other than that this book is inspiring. I recommend it to everyone. The last chapter in particular reminded me of all the reasons I got involved with activism. It's nice to know that equality is an achievable goal."

160,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3299609-ignacio,5,"There is SO MUCH to unpack from this book - I am still processing everything. Spirit Level is an in-depth research that describes the negative effects of wide inequality. Now, while on the surface, this statement might seem kind of obvious - the intricacies behind it are worth the read. The book will bombard you with data, and the results are as alarming as they are broad in terms of impact. According to their studies (and keeping in mind that strong correlation does not necessarily mean causality), countries with higher degree on inequality (leading country: USA), suffer from: - Higher rates of obesity- Higher rates of mental illness- Higher rates of anxiety/depression- Higher rates of racism and sexism- Higher rates of chronic diseases- Higher degree of self-promoting insecure egotism and status insecurity- Higher rates of violence- Higher rates of luxury fever (which pushes for over consumption) - Higher spending on criminal and judicial systems- Higher levels of mistrust- Lower life expectancy ratesIt is important to highlight that these negative consequences are not limited to the lower spectrum of society (the less resourceful) but EVEN those at the top of the scale. Ultimately, this means that you can't escape these consequences regardless of how privilege/fortunate you might be.Now, if this already seems obvious to you, something interesting is the understanding why this might be the case. According to their studies (and this applies mostly to already developed countries) countries have reached a threshold of material living standards and the benefits of further economic growth are less substantial. Economic growth is no longer a driver to wellbeing and happiness - and this comes down to our current social structures and psychology. We, as society, have become ""highly self-conscious, obsessed with how we appear to others, worried that we might come across as unattractive, boring, etc and we are constantly trying to manage the impressions we make"". This vulnerability is part of the modern psychological and societal conditions, which feeds directly into our over consumption mentality, driven by our constant anxiety of comparing ourselves to those who might have more, which ultimately snow balls into deep psychology rooted issues. I will spare the details in case you are interested in reading it - but it is important to note that these consequences reach older and younger people to even babies in the womb. Some interesting psychological/sociological concepts: 1. Luxury Fever: As inequality grows and the super-rich at the top spend more and more on luxury goods, the desire for such things cascades down the income scale and the rest of us struggle to compete and keep up.2. ‘Affluenza’ virus: a ‘set of values which increase our vulnerability to emotional distress’. It entails placing a high value on acquiring money and possessions, looking good in the eyes of others and wanting to be famous. These kinds of values place us at greater risk of depression, anxiety, substance abuse and personality disorder.3. Addiction to income: the more we have, the more we feel we need and the more time we spend on striving for material wealth and possessions, at the expense of our family life, relationships, and quality of life.This is an interesting read; however, I thought the book was light and rushed when it comes to solutions. It is evident that we as society need to change our social dynamics, but it also clear that big government is not the answer."
161,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59510129-chris,5,"The first 2/3 of this book is a thorough investigation of the relationship between income inequality and a specific array of health and social problems. The authors effectively explain the scope of their claims, discuss the mechanisms through which inequality leads to societal problems, and cite specific evidence. If you believe that socioeconomic inequality causes problems for a society - not just for the poor, but for the whole society - but you can’t really put your finger on why that is, this book will clear that question right up for you. The remaining 1/3 addresses the question of what these findings mean in historical and political context. Why are some countries more equal than others? Is change possible? How? The authors are careful not to overstep the bounds of their research here with the same certainty with which they make their claims in the earlier part of the book. And rightly so, as this would dilute the credibility of their earlier claims.They offer a broad framework for change as well as several policies and activist efforts to consider. Given the scope of the authors’ research, I found this an effective conclusion. It would have been irresponsible to ardently advocate a specific course of action without duplicating the volume of investigation. However, it would have been equally irresponsible to present these findings in a vacuum without discussing the implications and touching on how the reader should use the findings. The assertiveness of the call to action was well-calibrated to the thoroughness of the research findings presented: we KNOW greater equality will improve societies. We KNOW it is possible for a society to change its level of equality. We MUST act. We have reason to believe employee ownership, social welfare programs, and other policies have merit in effecting change.

Or even because you think that competition and a freer market drive the best outcomes for us all. Anyway you get here, I think you'll find this a thought provoking read about the way insidious ways that inequality (of outcome and opportunity) harms societies and individuals.Generally, I think this is fairly well argued. The authors don't start from the premise that inequality causes poor social outcomes (obesity, teen pregnancy, property crime, mental health struggles, higher prison populations, poorer health outcomes etc), they start from the premise that inequality is often correlated with these things. Then they investigate the ways in which inequality erodes trust and increases stress across communities and nations, and the lower outcomes for all levels of society, even the rich.Though they provide citations and an explanation of the data they used and how they analyzed it, I did find one or two of their arguments a little hand-wavy. On the other hand, they intended this book for general consumption, and probably didn't want to overwhelm people with interminable paragraphs. I also wasn't entirely convinced that their proposed solutions to unequal societies were as well thought out as their previous chapters. But that also makes sense. They're researchers, not policy wonks.In any case, this is an important and readable book, and if you're interested in the macro level of how societies work, this is a good one to pick up."

All of this applies across different levels of society (not just for the poor, rich nor middle class, but everyone!). Equality also extends to relations with other people or groups of people, or even between countries; more equality in your community=more trust=more mutual profit for everyone you work with. They certainly make a convincing case. My only concern is that being a welfare-state living, equality loving Finn, I was already inclined to thinking this way, so I should probably get familiar with the critique these guys have encountered :)Anyways, inspiring stuff, and can't wait to read their new book!Update after reading the critique from ""spirit level delusion""-blog:It seems that the writers may have been building on their own biased hyphothesis and not looking for alternative outcomes at all. The data may have been cherry-picked and the results can't necessarily be repeated with another set of countries or at another point in time.

If people are largely similar in culture then why would they not have more equal outcomes then in a country like the US which is so much larger and made up of different groups? There was some attempt to address this in the book but it was fairly brief. It seems to me that things such as crime, education, drug use etc would tend to correlate together and so would not need a separate chapter for each topic.  It will be interesting to see how a country like Sweden fares in the future since it has excepted large numbers of refugees. Will inequality rise or will its welfare programme lift everyone up to a similar status.I feel the book made some very interesting points and I am in agreement that inequality is a bad thing in general but I am unconvinced with much of the central premise of the book."

Reading this book has profoundly changed my opinion and my understanding of the role of inequality (notably on incomes) and its relationship with health and social issues that affect the well-being of society and nation as a whole. Having been living in New Zealand for over twenty years, I do observed the manifestation of health and social issues that can be attributed to inequality. Sadly, the inequality gap in New Zealand has widened since the study. I think New Zealand had forgotten that it was once a nation that was big on fairness and egalitarian ethos.For decades now, the Scandinavian model of social democracy had shown us that the model has the capability to close the inequality gap, perhaps it's time for English-speaking countries to adapt the model if we indeed serious about fairness and equality for our people.A different angle to appreciate how a big deal inequality really is, read: 23 Things They Don't Tell You About Capitalism - Ha-Joon Chang."

Points of learning:Beyond a certain point, rise in GDP makes no material difference to people’s wellbeing.Evaluative threat is a stressor resulting in ‘rising anxiety and a narcissitic defence of an insecure self image’.Violence is more common in unequal societies because ‘loss of face’ when people feel disrespected is the only thing they have to lose.Income inequality is the ‘prime mover’ of trust.Children’s mental health is strongly correlated with income inequality.Surprisingly to me, there is no relationship between health spending per person and life expectancy.Early childhood educational programmes are high yield.Flatter inequality also means flatter ambition (interesting).‘The discouraged among the disadvantaged’ become teenage mothers.John Irwin’s purposes of prison (shudder): official ones are retribution, deterrence, and incapacitation, whereas unofficial ones are class control, scapegoating, and political gain.Penal expansion goes with welfare contraction; as inequality goes up you pay more for police.Bourdieu’s ‘economy of cultural goods’ drives class discrimination.Single parenthood is not remotely as difficult in more equal countries.In a ‘steady state’ economy increasing equality causes increasing, not decreasing, creativity – something I wondered about myself.Working hours per person increase with inequality.I really need to read some Veblen.

Have we the imagination and the courage? "
176,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1879990-adam,5,"Science is meant to provide provocative, unexpected insights into our world, providing clues that can help us do whatever it is we want to do. The best scientists find insights that make the world a better place, and present their findings in ways that can inspire communities to act on them. This book is among the very best science books I'm familiar with, ranking up there with The Diversity of Life and Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed. The book takes a simple, obvious progressive mantra - more equal societies are better for people - and scientifically demonstrates its validity in more ways than the most optimistic of us would ever have guessed. Wilkinson and Pickett show how inequality erodes social trust, decreases educational performance, increases homicides, shortens lives, increases consumption, causes greater conflict among children, increases drug use and mental illness, and increases the number of people in prison. Their results are checked on rich nations and among the United States. The relationship is shocking - it seems that inequality is, after a certain level of economic well-being (per capita GDP) is reached, it is by far the most important determinant of societal well-being. Their results showed that it didn't matter how a society became more equal - government organized wealth redistribution or natural market mechanisms or a strong labor movement (trade union membership is apparently the strongest predictor of inequality in a nation). Pickett and Wilkinson included a pleasing amount of speculation and research about HOW inequality causes all of the social ills it does. Apparently, merely being judged constantly as to one's social status is extremely stressful (for everyone, but moreso if you're on the bottom!). This stress leads to all sorts of things - direct health consequences, impaired mental and physical abilities, violent responses to those who question one's status, distrust of others (they are competitors, not friends!), etc. It is passed down from generation to generation, starting with stress hormones that influence a baby's development in the womb, cuing them to prepare for a harsh, antagonistic world. The results demonstrate that poverty really does inhibit peoples' ability to succeed socially, and not just for the host of obvious reasons (disenfranchisement, nutrition, etc) that are usually discussed.I found this conversation quite interesting, since the mechanisms they cite would have been active in all societies since the advent of severe inequality. Of course, inequality was much more severe in many past societies than it is in ours, so the effects were likely more severe. These biological responses to hierarchy likely explain some of the socially corrosive effects associated with civilization.The conclusions of the book are quite obvious, then: make societies more equal and all the other problems will improve on their own. In fact, increasing equality is the most effective measure known to address most of these issues. As the authors say, ""[symptomatic solutions] attempt to break the link between socio-economic disadvantage and the problems it produces. The unstated hope is that people - particularly the poor - can carry on in the same circumstances, but will somehow no longer succumb to mental illness, teenage pregnancy, educational failure, obesity, or drugs.""In summary: “In the figures there is also a clear warning for those who might want to place low public expenditure and taxation at the top of their list of priorities. If you fail to avoid high inequality, you will need more prisons and more police. You will have to deal with higher rates of mental illness, drug abuse, and every other kind of problem. If keeping taxes and benefits down leads to wider income differences, the need to deal with the ensuing social ills may force you to raise public expenditure to cope.” "

Don't get me wrong, it is not that the book is bad in a literary, academic or political way but it did not wow me. The point is that I have read a lot of the basic premises and facts in this book, indicating the impact the book has made so far, and therefore it was not as surprising as it might have been if I would have read the book in 2009. I for one already knew how badly a social status inequality affects children's educational capacities even if it was helpful to read about it again in a concrete manner with numbers to back it up. Still if did not feel like enough, what did save the book for me, was the inclusion of an additional chapter responding to their critics that was helpful and insightful, humble yet adamant in its tone to defend the vision behind the book. I have to admit that some of the correlations and as the writers claim causal relation between inequality and various social problems is quite staggering. I did get a bit skeptical at some moments, surely all these can't be related to relative and material inequality? But considering the authors never make a definitive claim (a few exceptions) but rather point out a unpleasant truth for many, that when comparing equally wealthy countries, unequal ones are worse on many levels up to homicide and numbers of innovations. I was genuinely surprised to discover that all income groups in general are better off in terms of health(mental and physical) and general life expectancy and that at some level of material wealth and economic growth no substantial gains can be made for any social indicator! Another point I found intriguing and would like to delve deeper into is the link between anxiety and depression surges in society linked to increased status consumption driven by inequality, due mostly for my connection to the feelings of pointlessness described to be felt by a growing portion of the population and my personal rejection of mental consumption coping mechanisms. Perhaps the most compelling point is that the researchers compared wealthy countries, the entire classic liberal argument ""but we will be like the USSR if we want more equality!"" is rubbish, Sweden and Canada aren't socialist dictatorships. most shocking and left me in emotional distress was the segment on junkfood and why poor people choose to eat it, the testimonies of children, homeless and youngsters as to why they spent so much time and money there, were gut wrenching. I did not like the inclusion of animal testing and references to the pre agricultural man, for I never could accept both as solid evidence, one for we are not animals (and i ethically object animal testing) and the second for claims based on how the prehistoric man lived are used by every side to defend every position for we simply can't without doubt reconstruct the mindset of these peoples (referring to current hunter forager societies as way to understand prehistoric man, is as problematic for it is increasingly clear these are not relics of our collective past but rather responses to changing conditions throughout human history). As a citizen of Belgium, one of the countries more favorable in the statistics used, this book and its ideas and vision of modern society as to be more inclusive to achieve collective well being, do not come across as a shock, this book was meant for the anglo saxon world, in tone, content and vision which as a non anglo saxon leaves me a bit underwhelmed. Still considering the times and impact the book has had so far, still makes it worthwhile especially when measures to increase inequality are gaining power in the more equal nations of Belgium and the Netherlands and the ideal of collective progress is being replaced by the need to police and look down on the poor.... unfortunately....

179,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2118933-leo-walsh,4,"An overall very interesting book that examines the negative impacts of inequality on a variety social issues. While it seems to harp on the same theme -- inequality is bad for most of us, even the wealthy -- there are some times where I found myself thinking ""correlation does not imply causation."" There seems little doubt that inequality, though, is driven by government policy. And thus reflects the hidden attitudes of those in power -- since the policies a nation's elite have followed across several decades and their effects are, rhetoric aside, the net effect of the power structures that run a country.So what we are looking at is attitudes wrought in policies. Which impact people's lives, and come out as unequal distribution of income, with the rich getting richer, and the poor getting nothing.The down side to this is that the United States is a negative outlier in nearly ever conceivable dimension when viewed against our peers. The rich get richer. Money flows into ""cost-plus"" military or engineers contracts given to influential contractors. And the profits flow to the wealthy shareholders, while those same companies move manufacturing jobs over seas.There are several stats that still shock me. For instance Cuba -- the small island nation that is much poorer than the US -- has a lower infant mortality rate and slightly higher death rate than the wealthiest nation in the world. And the research that shows that, after a certain level, pursuit wealth does not really bring satisfaction illustrates an ages-old spiritual insight. No doubt it will take more than that. But the overall analysis is sound. There are some Right-Wing attacks of this book floating around. Because word is getting out, and the findings do seem to support Progressive opinions and debunk Conservative notions. And the authors have posted an interesting article that < href=""http://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/sites... the arguments being made by the Right against the insights the authors make in this book because they are, frankly, statistically incorrect. But, more importantly, the author of this rebuttal question the author's overly clean ""to make society better, all we need to do is make income more equal.""Which smacks of intellectual honesty -- rare in any time. But refreshing in political discourse.Highly recommended. The only reason it did not get 5-stars from me is that these findings could have been summarized in about half the pages. And that the majority of it can be had for free on their website The Equality Trust. (http://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/)"

While this further provides impetus for wealth distribution, avid readers taking interest in this topic should be quick to recognize that this is a battle waged on multiple fronts. Further focuses on the accessibility of of healthy food, health care, education, and generally stable environments are all necessary, not to mention individual work towards optimizing personal attitudes and lifestyles rather than merely focusing on a change of the externals variables. All of these routes need to be taken seriously to sufficiently alleviate the problem."

The core arguments of this book are fascinating, and the data incredibly convincing. It's a long 300 odd pages though of graphs and explanations that, very quickly, and to the thesis' credit, end up being the same line of reasoning every time. The core message is that the greater the inequality in societies - the gap between the richest and poorest - the greater the levels of many of society's ills, from poor mental health, growing prison populations and declining child wellbeing. "
182,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4454139-linda,5,"Just finished reading The Spirit Level and greatly appreciated the extensive endnotes and clarity with which this book was written. The authors methodically take the reader through their thinking chapter by chapter and support their argument that greater equality in society would lead to a better human experience for everyone - even the wealthy. Contrary to some beliefs, this book does not advocate the control of the government over businesses (authors said that was distinctly NOT the answer), reminds us that it is small businesses which generally are making the largest innovative contributions to society, that Thomas Paine was right regarding aristocracy. As a history teacher and someone who also loves science, I found this book to raise numerous thoughtful questions in which we all need to engage. Reminding me that Thomas Paine rejected the value of a landed aristocracy and connecting that thinking to questioning the value of the multi-national corporations was inspirational and insightful. Logical thinking, which as a student of anthropology I realize may be incorrect when discussing societies, does lead me to believe that having some persons holding enormous pots of wealth may not be the best way to encourage people to value society, family, friends or a sense of community, but rather would encourage people to watch over their shoulders and try to keep up with the values of high consumerism. Not buying into social hierarchies or consumerism would not bring about the collapse of the world, but rather would increase one's happiness in it. Time spent trying to acquire material goods would be spent with family, friends, community service, etc which are actions long understood and supported as ways to greatly increase one's happiness. Personal connections with others would reduce corruption and greed since it is far more difficult to rip off people with whom you associate on a regular basis (yes I know that Madoff did that, but he received all that press because of his unusually egregious antisocial actions) since you would have human connection and relationships that would discourage even the desire to rip off others. The ""solution"" of this book is to move in a direction of more employee owned businesses with less competitive social hierarchies - do not forget, humanity lived for many thousands of years in hunter gatherer societies and the importance of human connection has been bred into us (think some game theory studies). The authors address the increasingly challenging attempts to control and make money on intellectual/patented knowledge and raise some interesting questions as to where this is going - how will we make money on these products as the internet and global access to knowledge increases exponentially? We are being forced to create new economic strategies to address these concerns - so whether we like it or not, we will be forced to change and change is not something the majority of human beings embrace. I found one statement particularly fascinating and worthy of extensive thought: ""An important ideological cost of the Cold War was that America gave up its historical commitment to equality."" I have not decided whether or not that is true, partially true, but I believe this is a statement worth exploring - what has happened to our civil liberties over the past few decades? Are we more free or less free (some groups have obviously achieved more freedom yet overall what is today's current thinking - have we continued to move in a freer direction?) than a few decades ago? What has been the long-term impact of the Cold War on our equality psyche? At the end of the day however, I believe that everyone will agree that inequality costs - as a teacher, I see on a daily basis the long-term impacts of inequality, how much do prisons cost us, how much does violence cost us, how much does having ""gated communities"" cost us, how much does it cost us to have some people with so much money that they behave as if they are above the law (think financial institutions, the multi-national corporations that are impacting the governments of other nations, the financial turmoil that we repeatedly experience) - I say that these things cost all of us and that a more equal, community-based society would not be a utopian dream or perfection, but it would be a great improvement over the way life is now and is something we can achieve. This is not a ""left"" or ""right"" book - this is a book that is questioning our value structure, our way of life, how long is this way of life sustainable and successfully examines the consequences of inequality."
183,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6948668-conor-mcvarnock,5,"Excellent work, the conclusions are largely intuitive and certainly nothing that should be of any sort of surprise to most of us on the socialist left (except maybe all the stuff about Japan being up there with the Scandanavian Countries). The basic point made by the book is that after a certain point, how rich or developed a country is doesn't matter after a certain point, its the level of inequality that is the decisive factor on a range of issues, levels of obesity, mental illness, heart disease, your chances of being violently assaulted. This is not merely asserted, but proven scientifically with a huge raft of peer-reviewed academic research from the field of epidemiology and hard statistical analysis. Seriously, try disagreeing with any of this and you'll end up looking like a fool, there is so much evidence on display that its hard to come to any other conclusion than that a more equal society is necessarily a better one, not just for those at the bottom, the middle and upper classes are healthier in more equal societies compared to their peers in less equal ones.Where we may disagree though is how to get from the shitty unequal state of our contemporary post-neoliberal wrecks. I say that you cannot escape the conclusion that a revolution is whats needed.Anyway, plenty of food for thought and if you enjoy smoking market fundies in debates over any social issue, then you'll find more than enough ammo here."
184,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16475435-joy-b,3,"The only negative thing I can say about this book is that they use evo psyche in two chapters to prove a point. I think this makes their work lose some credibility as evo-psyche is mainly a purely speculative field. It was a shame they had to rely heavily on it in the teenage pregnancies chapter; it was as if they couldn't look past the gender of many of the teenagers and place it in a wider context. There was also some bad neuroscience near the end. This promoted logic of, ""If this part of the area shows activity when we do this and also when we do this it MUST mean the two are the same thing."" which really deliberately reductive and something bad science journalists do. The book was good enough to not need shoddy science to reinforce its points. Other than that this book is inspiring. I recommend it to everyone. The last chapter in particular reminded me of all the reasons I got involved with activism. It's nice to know that equality is an achievable goal."

190,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3299609-ignacio,5,"There is SO MUCH to unpack from this book - I am still processing everything. Spirit Level is an in-depth research that describes the negative effects of wide inequality. Now, while on the surface, this statement might seem kind of obvious - the intricacies behind it are worth the read. The book will bombard you with data, and the results are as alarming as they are broad in terms of impact. According to their studies (and keeping in mind that strong correlation does not necessarily mean causality), countries with higher degree on inequality (leading country: USA), suffer from: - Higher rates of obesity- Higher rates of mental illness- Higher rates of anxiety/depression- Higher rates of racism and sexism- Higher rates of chronic diseases- Higher degree of self-promoting insecure egotism and status insecurity- Higher rates of violence- Higher rates of luxury fever (which pushes for over consumption) - Higher spending on criminal and judicial systems- Higher levels of mistrust- Lower life expectancy ratesIt is important to highlight that these negative consequences are not limited to the lower spectrum of society (the less resourceful) but EVEN those at the top of the scale. Ultimately, this means that you can't escape these consequences regardless of how privilege/fortunate you might be.Now, if this already seems obvious to you, something interesting is the understanding why this might be the case. According to their studies (and this applies mostly to already developed countries) countries have reached a threshold of material living standards and the benefits of further economic growth are less substantial. Economic growth is no longer a driver to wellbeing and happiness - and this comes down to our current social structures and psychology. We, as society, have become ""highly self-conscious, obsessed with how we appear to others, worried that we might come across as unattractive, boring, etc and we are constantly trying to manage the impressions we make"". This vulnerability is part of the modern psychological and societal conditions, which feeds directly into our over consumption mentality, driven by our constant anxiety of comparing ourselves to those who might have more, which ultimately snow balls into deep psychology rooted issues. I will spare the details in case you are interested in reading it - but it is important to note that these consequences reach older and younger people to even babies in the womb. Some interesting psychological/sociological concepts: 1. Luxury Fever: As inequality grows and the super-rich at the top spend more and more on luxury goods, the desire for such things cascades down the income scale and the rest of us struggle to compete and keep up.2. ‘Affluenza’ virus: a ‘set of values which increase our vulnerability to emotional distress’. It entails placing a high value on acquiring money and possessions, looking good in the eyes of others and wanting to be famous. These kinds of values place us at greater risk of depression, anxiety, substance abuse and personality disorder.3. Addiction to income: the more we have, the more we feel we need and the more time we spend on striving for material wealth and possessions, at the expense of our family life, relationships, and quality of life.This is an interesting read; however, I thought the book was light and rushed when it comes to solutions. It is evident that we as society need to change our social dynamics, but it also clear that big government is not the answer."
191,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59510129-chris,5,"The first 2/3 of this book is a thorough investigation of the relationship between income inequality and a specific array of health and social problems. The authors effectively explain the scope of their claims, discuss the mechanisms through which inequality leads to societal problems, and cite specific evidence. If you believe that socioeconomic inequality causes problems for a society - not just for the poor, but for the whole society - but you can’t really put your finger on why that is, this book will clear that question right up for you. The remaining 1/3 addresses the question of what these findings mean in historical and political context. Why are some countries more equal than others? Is change possible? How? The authors are careful not to overstep the bounds of their research here with the same certainty with which they make their claims in the earlier part of the book. And rightly so, as this would dilute the credibility of their earlier claims.They offer a broad framework for change as well as several policies and activist efforts to consider. Given the scope of the authors’ research, I found this an effective conclusion. It would have been irresponsible to ardently advocate a specific course of action without duplicating the volume of investigation. However, it would have been equally irresponsible to present these findings in a vacuum without discussing the implications and touching on how the reader should use the findings. The assertiveness of the call to action was well-calibrated to the thoroughness of the research findings presented: we KNOW greater equality will improve societies. We KNOW it is possible for a society to change its level of equality. We MUST act. We have reason to believe employee ownership, social welfare programs, and other policies have merit in effecting change.

Or even because you think that competition and a freer market drive the best outcomes for us all. Anyway you get here, I think you'll find this a thought provoking read about the way insidious ways that inequality (of outcome and opportunity) harms societies and individuals.Generally, I think this is fairly well argued. The authors don't start from the premise that inequality causes poor social outcomes (obesity, teen pregnancy, property crime, mental health struggles, higher prison populations, poorer health outcomes etc), they start from the premise that inequality is often correlated with these things. Then they investigate the ways in which inequality erodes trust and increases stress across communities and nations, and the lower outcomes for all levels of society, even the rich.Though they provide citations and an explanation of the data they used and how they analyzed it, I did find one or two of their arguments a little hand-wavy. On the other hand, they intended this book for general consumption, and probably didn't want to overwhelm people with interminable paragraphs. I also wasn't entirely convinced that their proposed solutions to unequal societies were as well thought out as their previous chapters. But that also makes sense. They're researchers, not policy wonks.In any case, this is an important and readable book, and if you're interested in the macro level of how societies work, this is a good one to pick up."

All of this applies across different levels of society (not just for the poor, rich nor middle class, but everyone!). Equality also extends to relations with other people or groups of people, or even between countries; more equality in your community=more trust=more mutual profit for everyone you work with. They certainly make a convincing case. My only concern is that being a welfare-state living, equality loving Finn, I was already inclined to thinking this way, so I should probably get familiar with the critique these guys have encountered :)Anyways, inspiring stuff, and can't wait to read their new book!Update after reading the critique from ""spirit level delusion""-blog:It seems that the writers may have been building on their own biased hyphothesis and not looking for alternative outcomes at all. The data may have been cherry-picked and the results can't necessarily be repeated with another set of countries or at another point in time.

If people are largely similar in culture then why would they not have more equal outcomes then in a country like the US which is so much larger and made up of different groups? There was some attempt to address this in the book but it was fairly brief. It seems to me that things such as crime, education, drug use etc would tend to correlate together and so would not need a separate chapter for each topic.  It will be interesting to see how a country like Sweden fares in the future since it has excepted large numbers of refugees. Will inequality rise or will its welfare programme lift everyone up to a similar status.I feel the book made some very interesting points and I am in agreement that inequality is a bad thing in general but I am unconvinced with much of the central premise of the book."

Reading this book has profoundly changed my opinion and my understanding of the role of inequality (notably on incomes) and its relationship with health and social issues that affect the well-being of society and nation as a whole. Having been living in New Zealand for over twenty years, I do observed the manifestation of health and social issues that can be attributed to inequality. Sadly, the inequality gap in New Zealand has widened since the study. I think New Zealand had forgotten that it was once a nation that was big on fairness and egalitarian ethos.For decades now, the Scandinavian model of social democracy had shown us that the model has the capability to close the inequality gap, perhaps it's time for English-speaking countries to adapt the model if we indeed serious about fairness and equality for our people.A different angle to appreciate how a big deal inequality really is, read: 23 Things They Don't Tell You About Capitalism - Ha-Joon Chang."

Points of learning:Beyond a certain point, rise in GDP makes no material difference to people’s wellbeing.Evaluative threat is a stressor resulting in ‘rising anxiety and a narcissitic defence of an insecure self image’.Violence is more common in unequal societies because ‘loss of face’ when people feel disrespected is the only thing they have to lose.Income inequality is the ‘prime mover’ of trust.Children’s mental health is strongly correlated with income inequality.Surprisingly to me, there is no relationship between health spending per person and life expectancy.Early childhood educational programmes are high yield.Flatter inequality also means flatter ambition (interesting).‘The discouraged among the disadvantaged’ become teenage mothers.John Irwin’s purposes of prison (shudder): official ones are retribution, deterrence, and incapacitation, whereas unofficial ones are class control, scapegoating, and political gain.Penal expansion goes with welfare contraction; as inequality goes up you pay more for police.Bourdieu’s ‘economy of cultural goods’ drives class discrimination.Single parenthood is not remotely as difficult in more equal countries.In a ‘steady state’ economy increasing equality causes increasing, not decreasing, creativity – something I wondered about myself.Working hours per person increase with inequality.I really need to read some Veblen.

206,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1879990-adam,5,"Science is meant to provide provocative, unexpected insights into our world, providing clues that can help us do whatever it is we want to do. The best scientists find insights that make the world a better place, and present their findings in ways that can inspire communities to act on them. This book is among the very best science books I'm familiar with, ranking up there with The Diversity of Life and Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed. The book takes a simple, obvious progressive mantra - more equal societies are better for people - and scientifically demonstrates its validity in more ways than the most optimistic of us would ever have guessed. Wilkinson and Pickett show how inequality erodes social trust, decreases educational performance, increases homicides, shortens lives, increases consumption, causes greater conflict among children, increases drug use and mental illness, and increases the number of people in prison. Their results are checked on rich nations and among the United States. The relationship is shocking - it seems that inequality is, after a certain level of economic well-being (per capita GDP) is reached, it is by far the most important determinant of societal well-being. Their results showed that it didn't matter how a society became more equal - government organized wealth redistribution or natural market mechanisms or a strong labor movement (trade union membership is apparently the strongest predictor of inequality in a nation). Pickett and Wilkinson included a pleasing amount of speculation and research about HOW inequality causes all of the social ills it does. Apparently, merely being judged constantly as to one's social status is extremely stressful (for everyone, but moreso if you're on the bottom!). This stress leads to all sorts of things - direct health consequences, impaired mental and physical abilities, violent responses to those who question one's status, distrust of others (they are competitors, not friends!), etc. It is passed down from generation to generation, starting with stress hormones that influence a baby's development in the womb, cuing them to prepare for a harsh, antagonistic world. The results demonstrate that poverty really does inhibit peoples' ability to succeed socially, and not just for the host of obvious reasons (disenfranchisement, nutrition, etc) that are usually discussed.I found this conversation quite interesting, since the mechanisms they cite would have been active in all societies since the advent of severe inequality. Of course, inequality was much more severe in many past societies than it is in ours, so the effects were likely more severe. These biological responses to hierarchy likely explain some of the socially corrosive effects associated with civilization.The conclusions of the book are quite obvious, then: make societies more equal and all the other problems will improve on their own. In fact, increasing equality is the most effective measure known to address most of these issues. As the authors say, ""[symptomatic solutions] attempt to break the link between socio-economic disadvantage and the problems it produces. The unstated hope is that people - particularly the poor - can carry on in the same circumstances, but will somehow no longer succumb to mental illness, teenage pregnancy, educational failure, obesity, or drugs.""In summary: “In the figures there is also a clear warning for those who might want to place low public expenditure and taxation at the top of their list of priorities. If you fail to avoid high inequality, you will need more prisons and more police. You will have to deal with higher rates of mental illness, drug abuse, and every other kind of problem. If keeping taxes and benefits down leads to wider income differences, the need to deal with the ensuing social ills may force you to raise public expenditure to cope.” "
207,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14612139-nick,3," To be honest I was disappointed when if finished it. Don't get me wrong, it is not that the book is bad in a literary, academic or political way but it did not wow me. The point is that I have read a lot of the basic premises and facts in this book, indicating the impact the book has made so far, and therefore it was not as surprising as it might have been if I would have read the book in 2009. I for one already knew how badly a social status inequality affects children's educational capacities even if it was helpful to read about it again in a concrete manner with numbers to back it up. Still if did not feel like enough, what did save the book for me, was the inclusion of an additional chapter responding to their critics that was helpful and insightful, humble yet adamant in its tone to defend the vision behind the book. I have to admit that some of the correlations and as the writers claim causal relation between inequality and various social problems is quite staggering. I did get a bit skeptical at some moments, surely all these can't be related to relative and material inequality? But considering the authors never make a definitive claim (a few exceptions) but rather point out a unpleasant truth for many, that when comparing equally wealthy countries, unequal ones are worse on many levels up to homicide and numbers of innovations. I was genuinely surprised to discover that all income groups in general are better off in terms of health(mental and physical) and general life expectancy and that at some level of material wealth and economic growth no substantial gains can be made for any social indicator! Another point I found intriguing and would like to delve deeper into is the link between anxiety and depression surges in society linked to increased status consumption driven by inequality, due mostly for my connection to the feelings of pointlessness described to be felt by a growing portion of the population and my personal rejection of mental consumption coping mechanisms. Perhaps the most compelling point is that the researchers compared wealthy countries, the entire classic liberal argument ""but we will be like the USSR if we want more equality!"" is rubbish, Sweden and Canada aren't socialist dictatorships. most shocking and left me in emotional distress was the segment on junkfood and why poor people choose to eat it, the testimonies of children, homeless and youngsters as to why they spent so much time and money there, were gut wrenching. I did not like the inclusion of animal testing and references to the pre agricultural man, for I never could accept both as solid evidence, one for we are not animals (and i ethically object animal testing) and the second for claims based on how the prehistoric man lived are used by every side to defend every position for we simply can't without doubt reconstruct the mindset of these peoples (referring to current hunter forager societies as way to understand prehistoric man, is as problematic for it is increasingly clear these are not relics of our collective past but rather responses to changing conditions throughout human history). As a citizen of Belgium, one of the countries more favorable in the statistics used, this book and its ideas and vision of modern society as to be more inclusive to achieve collective well being, do not come across as a shock, this book was meant for the anglo saxon world, in tone, content and vision which as a non anglo saxon leaves me a bit underwhelmed. Still considering the times and impact the book has had so far, still makes it worthwhile especially when measures to increase inequality are gaining power in the more equal nations of Belgium and the Netherlands and the ideal of collective progress is being replaced by the need to police and look down on the poor.... unfortunately....

208,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5355264-monica,5,The authors bring evidence to what I knew intuitively. I feel vindicated.
209,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2118933-leo-walsh,4,"An overall very interesting book that examines the negative impacts of inequality on a variety social issues. While it seems to harp on the same theme -- inequality is bad for most of us, even the wealthy -- there are some times where I found myself thinking ""correlation does not imply causation."" There seems little doubt that inequality, though, is driven by government policy. And thus reflects the hidden attitudes of those in power -- since the policies a nation's elite have followed across several decades and their effects are, rhetoric aside, the net effect of the power structures that run a country.So what we are looking at is attitudes wrought in policies. Which impact people's lives, and come out as unequal distribution of income, with the rich getting richer, and the poor getting nothing.The down side to this is that the United States is a negative outlier in nearly ever conceivable dimension when viewed against our peers. The rich get richer. Money flows into ""cost-plus"" military or engineers contracts given to influential contractors. And the profits flow to the wealthy shareholders, while those same companies move manufacturing jobs over seas.There are several stats that still shock me. For instance Cuba -- the small island nation that is much poorer than the US -- has a lower infant mortality rate and slightly higher death rate than the wealthiest nation in the world. And the research that shows that, after a certain level, pursuit wealth does not really bring satisfaction illustrates an ages-old spiritual insight. No doubt it will take more than that. But the overall analysis is sound. There are some Right-Wing attacks of this book floating around. Because word is getting out, and the findings do seem to support Progressive opinions and debunk Conservative notions. And the authors have posted an interesting article that < href=""http://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/sites... the arguments being made by the Right against the insights the authors make in this book because they are, frankly, statistically incorrect. But, more importantly, the author of this rebuttal question the author's overly clean ""to make society better, all we need to do is make income more equal.""Which smacks of intellectual honesty -- rare in any time. But refreshing in political discourse.Highly recommended. The only reason it did not get 5-stars from me is that these findings could have been summarized in about half the pages. And that the majority of it can be had for free on their website The Equality Trust. (http://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/)"
210,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72796908-daniel-hageman,4,"The book does an excellent job highlighting inequality as what I would call an 'extrinsic bad' in society, confirming that our well-being, as impacted by various objective variables, is also largely affected by our perceptions of personal wealth as compared to that of our neighbors. While this further provides impetus for wealth distribution, avid readers taking interest in this topic should be quick to recognize that this is a battle waged on multiple fronts. Further focuses on the accessibility of of healthy food, health care, education, and generally stable environments are all necessary, not to mention individual work towards optimizing personal attitudes and lifestyles rather than merely focusing on a change of the externals variables. All of these routes need to be taken seriously to sufficiently alleviate the problem."

The core arguments of this book are fascinating, and the data incredibly convincing. It's a long 300 odd pages though of graphs and explanations that, very quickly, and to the thesis' credit, end up being the same line of reasoning every time. The core message is that the greater the inequality in societies - the gap between the richest and poorest - the greater the levels of many of society's ills, from poor mental health, growing prison populations and declining child wellbeing. "
212,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4454139-linda,5,"Just finished reading The Spirit Level and greatly appreciated the extensive endnotes and clarity with which this book was written. The authors methodically take the reader through their thinking chapter by chapter and support their argument that greater equality in society would lead to a better human experience for everyone - even the wealthy. Contrary to some beliefs, this book does not advocate the control of the government over businesses (authors said that was distinctly NOT the answer), reminds us that it is small businesses which generally are making the largest innovative contributions to society, that Thomas Paine was right regarding aristocracy. As a history teacher and someone who also loves science, I found this book to raise numerous thoughtful questions in which we all need to engage. Reminding me that Thomas Paine rejected the value of a landed aristocracy and connecting that thinking to questioning the value of the multi-national corporations was inspirational and insightful. Logical thinking, which as a student of anthropology I realize may be incorrect when discussing societies, does lead me to believe that having some persons holding enormous pots of wealth may not be the best way to encourage people to value society, family, friends or a sense of community, but rather would encourage people to watch over their shoulders and try to keep up with the values of high consumerism. Not buying into social hierarchies or consumerism would not bring about the collapse of the world, but rather would increase one's happiness in it. Time spent trying to acquire material goods would be spent with family, friends, community service, etc which are actions long understood and supported as ways to greatly increase one's happiness. Personal connections with others would reduce corruption and greed since it is far more difficult to rip off people with whom you associate on a regular basis (yes I know that Madoff did that, but he received all that press because of his unusually egregious antisocial actions) since you would have human connection and relationships that would discourage even the desire to rip off others. The ""solution"" of this book is to move in a direction of more employee owned businesses with less competitive social hierarchies - do not forget, humanity lived for many thousands of years in hunter gatherer societies and the importance of human connection has been bred into us (think some game theory studies). The authors address the increasingly challenging attempts to control and make money on intellectual/patented knowledge and raise some interesting questions as to where this is going - how will we make money on these products as the internet and global access to knowledge increases exponentially? We are being forced to create new economic strategies to address these concerns - so whether we like it or not, we will be forced to change and change is not something the majority of human beings embrace. I found one statement particularly fascinating and worthy of extensive thought: ""An important ideological cost of the Cold War was that America gave up its historical commitment to equality."" I have not decided whether or not that is true, partially true, but I believe this is a statement worth exploring - what has happened to our civil liberties over the past few decades? Are we more free or less free (some groups have obviously achieved more freedom yet overall what is today's current thinking - have we continued to move in a freer direction?) than a few decades ago? What has been the long-term impact of the Cold War on our equality psyche? At the end of the day however, I believe that everyone will agree that inequality costs - as a teacher, I see on a daily basis the long-term impacts of inequality, how much do prisons cost us, how much does violence cost us, how much does having ""gated communities"" cost us, how much does it cost us to have some people with so much money that they behave as if they are above the law (think financial institutions, the multi-national corporations that are impacting the governments of other nations, the financial turmoil that we repeatedly experience) - I say that these things cost all of us and that a more equal, community-based society would not be a utopian dream or perfection, but it would be a great improvement over the way life is now and is something we can achieve. This is not a ""left"" or ""right"" book - this is a book that is questioning our value structure, our way of life, how long is this way of life sustainable and successfully examines the consequences of inequality."
213,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6948668-conor-mcvarnock,5,"Excellent work, the conclusions are largely intuitive and certainly nothing that should be of any sort of surprise to most of us on the socialist left (except maybe all the stuff about Japan being up there with the Scandanavian Countries). The basic point made by the book is that after a certain point, how rich or developed a country is doesn't matter after a certain point, its the level of inequality that is the decisive factor on a range of issues, levels of obesity, mental illness, heart disease, your chances of being violently assaulted. This is not merely asserted, but proven scientifically with a huge raft of peer-reviewed academic research from the field of epidemiology and hard statistical analysis. Seriously, try disagreeing with any of this and you'll end up looking like a fool, there is so much evidence on display that its hard to come to any other conclusion than that a more equal society is necessarily a better one, not just for those at the bottom, the middle and upper classes are healthier in more equal societies compared to their peers in less equal ones.Where we may disagree though is how to get from the shitty unequal state of our contemporary post-neoliberal wrecks. I say that you cannot escape the conclusion that a revolution is whats needed.Anyway, plenty of food for thought and if you enjoy smoking market fundies in debates over any social issue, then you'll find more than enough ammo here."
214,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16475435-joy-b,3,"The only negative thing I can say about this book is that they use evo psyche in two chapters to prove a point. I think this makes their work lose some credibility as evo-psyche is mainly a purely speculative field. It was a shame they had to rely heavily on it in the teenage pregnancies chapter; it was as if they couldn't look past the gender of many of the teenagers and place it in a wider context. There was also some bad neuroscience near the end. This promoted logic of, ""If this part of the area shows activity when we do this and also when we do this it MUST mean the two are the same thing."" which really deliberately reductive and something bad science journalists do. The book was good enough to not need shoddy science to reinforce its points. Other than that this book is inspiring. I recommend it to everyone. The last chapter in particular reminded me of all the reasons I got involved with activism. It's nice to know that equality is an achievable goal."

220,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3299609-ignacio,5,"There is SO MUCH to unpack from this book - I am still processing everything. Spirit Level is an in-depth research that describes the negative effects of wide inequality. Now, while on the surface, this statement might seem kind of obvious - the intricacies behind it are worth the read. The book will bombard you with data, and the results are as alarming as they are broad in terms of impact. According to their studies (and keeping in mind that strong correlation does not necessarily mean causality), countries with higher degree on inequality (leading country: USA), suffer from: - Higher rates of obesity- Higher rates of mental illness- Higher rates of anxiety/depression- Higher rates of racism and sexism- Higher rates of chronic diseases- Higher degree of self-promoting insecure egotism and status insecurity- Higher rates of violence- Higher rates of luxury fever (which pushes for over consumption) - Higher spending on criminal and judicial systems- Higher levels of mistrust- Lower life expectancy ratesIt is important to highlight that these negative consequences are not limited to the lower spectrum of society (the less resourceful) but EVEN those at the top of the scale. Ultimately, this means that you can't escape these consequences regardless of how privilege/fortunate you might be.Now, if this already seems obvious to you, something interesting is the understanding why this might be the case. According to their studies (and this applies mostly to already developed countries) countries have reached a threshold of material living standards and the benefits of further economic growth are less substantial. Economic growth is no longer a driver to wellbeing and happiness - and this comes down to our current social structures and psychology. We, as society, have become ""highly self-conscious, obsessed with how we appear to others, worried that we might come across as unattractive, boring, etc and we are constantly trying to manage the impressions we make"". This vulnerability is part of the modern psychological and societal conditions, which feeds directly into our over consumption mentality, driven by our constant anxiety of comparing ourselves to those who might have more, which ultimately snow balls into deep psychology rooted issues. I will spare the details in case you are interested in reading it - but it is important to note that these consequences reach older and younger people to even babies in the womb. Some interesting psychological/sociological concepts: 1. Luxury Fever: As inequality grows and the super-rich at the top spend more and more on luxury goods, the desire for such things cascades down the income scale and the rest of us struggle to compete and keep up.2. ‘Affluenza’ virus: a ‘set of values which increase our vulnerability to emotional distress’. It entails placing a high value on acquiring money and possessions, looking good in the eyes of others and wanting to be famous. These kinds of values place us at greater risk of depression, anxiety, substance abuse and personality disorder.3. Addiction to income: the more we have, the more we feel we need and the more time we spend on striving for material wealth and possessions, at the expense of our family life, relationships, and quality of life.This is an interesting read; however, I thought the book was light and rushed when it comes to solutions. It is evident that we as society need to change our social dynamics, but it also clear that big government is not the answer."
221,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59510129-chris,5,"The first 2/3 of this book is a thorough investigation of the relationship between income inequality and a specific array of health and social problems. The authors effectively explain the scope of their claims, discuss the mechanisms through which inequality leads to societal problems, and cite specific evidence. If you believe that socioeconomic inequality causes problems for a society - not just for the poor, but for the whole society - but you can’t really put your finger on why that is, this book will clear that question right up for you. The remaining 1/3 addresses the question of what these findings mean in historical and political context. Why are some countries more equal than others? Is change possible? How? The authors are careful not to overstep the bounds of their research here with the same certainty with which they make their claims in the earlier part of the book. And rightly so, as this would dilute the credibility of their earlier claims.They offer a broad framework for change as well as several policies and activist efforts to consider. Given the scope of the authors’ research, I found this an effective conclusion. It would have been irresponsible to ardently advocate a specific course of action without duplicating the volume of investigation. However, it would have been equally irresponsible to present these findings in a vacuum without discussing the implications and touching on how the reader should use the findings. The assertiveness of the call to action was well-calibrated to the thoroughness of the research findings presented: we KNOW greater equality will improve societies. We KNOW it is possible for a society to change its level of equality. We MUST act. We have reason to believe employee ownership, social welfare programs, and other policies have merit in effecting change.

Or even because you think that competition and a freer market drive the best outcomes for us all. Anyway you get here, I think you'll find this a thought provoking read about the way insidious ways that inequality (of outcome and opportunity) harms societies and individuals.Generally, I think this is fairly well argued. The authors don't start from the premise that inequality causes poor social outcomes (obesity, teen pregnancy, property crime, mental health struggles, higher prison populations, poorer health outcomes etc), they start from the premise that inequality is often correlated with these things. Then they investigate the ways in which inequality erodes trust and increases stress across communities and nations, and the lower outcomes for all levels of society, even the rich.Though they provide citations and an explanation of the data they used and how they analyzed it, I did find one or two of their arguments a little hand-wavy. On the other hand, they intended this book for general consumption, and probably didn't want to overwhelm people with interminable paragraphs. I also wasn't entirely convinced that their proposed solutions to unequal societies were as well thought out as their previous chapters. But that also makes sense. They're researchers, not policy wonks.In any case, this is an important and readable book, and if you're interested in the macro level of how societies work, this is a good one to pick up."

All of this applies across different levels of society (not just for the poor, rich nor middle class, but everyone!). Equality also extends to relations with other people or groups of people, or even between countries; more equality in your community=more trust=more mutual profit for everyone you work with. They certainly make a convincing case. My only concern is that being a welfare-state living, equality loving Finn, I was already inclined to thinking this way, so I should probably get familiar with the critique these guys have encountered :)Anyways, inspiring stuff, and can't wait to read their new book!Update after reading the critique from ""spirit level delusion""-blog:It seems that the writers may have been building on their own biased hyphothesis and not looking for alternative outcomes at all. The data may have been cherry-picked and the results can't necessarily be repeated with another set of countries or at another point in time.

If people are largely similar in culture then why would they not have more equal outcomes then in a country like the US which is so much larger and made up of different groups? There was some attempt to address this in the book but it was fairly brief. It seems to me that things such as crime, education, drug use etc would tend to correlate together and so would not need a separate chapter for each topic.  It will be interesting to see how a country like Sweden fares in the future since it has excepted large numbers of refugees. Will inequality rise or will its welfare programme lift everyone up to a similar status.I feel the book made some very interesting points and I am in agreement that inequality is a bad thing in general but I am unconvinced with much of the central premise of the book."

Reading this book has profoundly changed my opinion and my understanding of the role of inequality (notably on incomes) and its relationship with health and social issues that affect the well-being of society and nation as a whole. Having been living in New Zealand for over twenty years, I do observed the manifestation of health and social issues that can be attributed to inequality. Sadly, the inequality gap in New Zealand has widened since the study. I think New Zealand had forgotten that it was once a nation that was big on fairness and egalitarian ethos.For decades now, the Scandinavian model of social democracy had shown us that the model has the capability to close the inequality gap, perhaps it's time for English-speaking countries to adapt the model if we indeed serious about fairness and equality for our people.A different angle to appreciate how a big deal inequality really is, read: 23 Things They Don't Tell You About Capitalism - Ha-Joon Chang."

Points of learning:Beyond a certain point, rise in GDP makes no material difference to people’s wellbeing.Evaluative threat is a stressor resulting in ‘rising anxiety and a narcissitic defence of an insecure self image’.Violence is more common in unequal societies because ‘loss of face’ when people feel disrespected is the only thing they have to lose.Income inequality is the ‘prime mover’ of trust.Children’s mental health is strongly correlated with income inequality.Surprisingly to me, there is no relationship between health spending per person and life expectancy.Early childhood educational programmes are high yield.Flatter inequality also means flatter ambition (interesting).‘The discouraged among the disadvantaged’ become teenage mothers.John Irwin’s purposes of prison (shudder): official ones are retribution, deterrence, and incapacitation, whereas unofficial ones are class control, scapegoating, and political gain.Penal expansion goes with welfare contraction; as inequality goes up you pay more for police.Bourdieu’s ‘economy of cultural goods’ drives class discrimination.Single parenthood is not remotely as difficult in more equal countries.In a ‘steady state’ economy increasing equality causes increasing, not decreasing, creativity – something I wondered about myself.Working hours per person increase with inequality.I really need to read some Veblen.

This is an important piece of work and I'm on board with making society a more equal place! Although the thesis has merit, it was an absolute slog to read. I found the writing unengaging, repetitive and (particularly in the interpretation) drenched in bias.The trouble is, the authors seem to pursue their conclusions with such a dogged determination, that they don't seem to notice when they are contradicting themselves or overinterpreting. Several times I found myself frowning and saying to myself ""But... a few chapters ago you said the opposite..."" or ""But... that's not a watertight argument..."" and once or twice ""that makes ZERO sense AT ALL!"" So although there is a lot of good here, the book is let down by dull commentary, confident assertion of uncertainties and solutions that are a little too authoritarian-seeming for me to fully endorse."

Have we the imagination and the courage? "
236,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1879990-adam,5,"Science is meant to provide provocative, unexpected insights into our world, providing clues that can help us do whatever it is we want to do. The best scientists find insights that make the world a better place, and present their findings in ways that can inspire communities to act on them. This book is among the very best science books I'm familiar with, ranking up there with The Diversity of Life and Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed. The book takes a simple, obvious progressive mantra - more equal societies are better for people - and scientifically demonstrates its validity in more ways than the most optimistic of us would ever have guessed. Wilkinson and Pickett show how inequality erodes social trust, decreases educational performance, increases homicides, shortens lives, increases consumption, causes greater conflict among children, increases drug use and mental illness, and increases the number of people in prison. Their results are checked on rich nations and among the United States. The relationship is shocking - it seems that inequality is, after a certain level of economic well-being (per capita GDP) is reached, it is by far the most important determinant of societal well-being. Their results showed that it didn't matter how a society became more equal - government organized wealth redistribution or natural market mechanisms or a strong labor movement (trade union membership is apparently the strongest predictor of inequality in a nation). Pickett and Wilkinson included a pleasing amount of speculation and research about HOW inequality causes all of the social ills it does. Apparently, merely being judged constantly as to one's social status is extremely stressful (for everyone, but moreso if you're on the bottom!). This stress leads to all sorts of things - direct health consequences, impaired mental and physical abilities, violent responses to those who question one's status, distrust of others (they are competitors, not friends!), etc. It is passed down from generation to generation, starting with stress hormones that influence a baby's development in the womb, cuing them to prepare for a harsh, antagonistic world. The results demonstrate that poverty really does inhibit peoples' ability to succeed socially, and not just for the host of obvious reasons (disenfranchisement, nutrition, etc) that are usually discussed.I found this conversation quite interesting, since the mechanisms they cite would have been active in all societies since the advent of severe inequality. Of course, inequality was much more severe in many past societies than it is in ours, so the effects were likely more severe. These biological responses to hierarchy likely explain some of the socially corrosive effects associated with civilization.The conclusions of the book are quite obvious, then: make societies more equal and all the other problems will improve on their own. In fact, increasing equality is the most effective measure known to address most of these issues. As the authors say, ""[symptomatic solutions] attempt to break the link between socio-economic disadvantage and the problems it produces. The unstated hope is that people - particularly the poor - can carry on in the same circumstances, but will somehow no longer succumb to mental illness, teenage pregnancy, educational failure, obesity, or drugs.""In summary: “In the figures there is also a clear warning for those who might want to place low public expenditure and taxation at the top of their list of priorities. If you fail to avoid high inequality, you will need more prisons and more police. You will have to deal with higher rates of mental illness, drug abuse, and every other kind of problem. If keeping taxes and benefits down leads to wider income differences, the need to deal with the ensuing social ills may force you to raise public expenditure to cope.” "
237,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14612139-nick,3," To be honest I was disappointed when if finished it. Don't get me wrong, it is not that the book is bad in a literary, academic or political way but it did not wow me. The point is that I have read a lot of the basic premises and facts in this book, indicating the impact the book has made so far, and therefore it was not as surprising as it might have been if I would have read the book in 2009. I for one already knew how badly a social status inequality affects children's educational capacities even if it was helpful to read about it again in a concrete manner with numbers to back it up. Still if did not feel like enough, what did save the book for me, was the inclusion of an additional chapter responding to their critics that was helpful and insightful, humble yet adamant in its tone to defend the vision behind the book. I have to admit that some of the correlations and as the writers claim causal relation between inequality and various social problems is quite staggering. I did get a bit skeptical at some moments, surely all these can't be related to relative and material inequality? But considering the authors never make a definitive claim (a few exceptions) but rather point out a unpleasant truth for many, that when comparing equally wealthy countries, unequal ones are worse on many levels up to homicide and numbers of innovations. I was genuinely surprised to discover that all income groups in general are better off in terms of health(mental and physical) and general life expectancy and that at some level of material wealth and economic growth no substantial gains can be made for any social indicator! Another point I found intriguing and would like to delve deeper into is the link between anxiety and depression surges in society linked to increased status consumption driven by inequality, due mostly for my connection to the feelings of pointlessness described to be felt by a growing portion of the population and my personal rejection of mental consumption coping mechanisms. Perhaps the most compelling point is that the researchers compared wealthy countries, the entire classic liberal argument ""but we will be like the USSR if we want more equality!"" is rubbish, Sweden and Canada aren't socialist dictatorships. most shocking and left me in emotional distress was the segment on junkfood and why poor people choose to eat it, the testimonies of children, homeless and youngsters as to why they spent so much time and money there, were gut wrenching. I did not like the inclusion of animal testing and references to the pre agricultural man, for I never could accept both as solid evidence, one for we are not animals (and i ethically object animal testing) and the second for claims based on how the prehistoric man lived are used by every side to defend every position for we simply can't without doubt reconstruct the mindset of these peoples (referring to current hunter forager societies as way to understand prehistoric man, is as problematic for it is increasingly clear these are not relics of our collective past but rather responses to changing conditions throughout human history). As a citizen of Belgium, one of the countries more favorable in the statistics used, this book and its ideas and vision of modern society as to be more inclusive to achieve collective well being, do not come across as a shock, this book was meant for the anglo saxon world, in tone, content and vision which as a non anglo saxon leaves me a bit underwhelmed. Still considering the times and impact the book has had so far, still makes it worthwhile especially when measures to increase inequality are gaining power in the more equal nations of Belgium and the Netherlands and the ideal of collective progress is being replaced by the need to police and look down on the poor.... unfortunately....

238,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5355264-monica,5,The authors bring evidence to what I knew intuitively. I feel vindicated.
239,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2118933-leo-walsh,4,"An overall very interesting book that examines the negative impacts of inequality on a variety social issues. While it seems to harp on the same theme -- inequality is bad for most of us, even the wealthy -- there are some times where I found myself thinking ""correlation does not imply causation."" There seems little doubt that inequality, though, is driven by government policy. And thus reflects the hidden attitudes of those in power -- since the policies a nation's elite have followed across several decades and their effects are, rhetoric aside, the net effect of the power structures that run a country.So what we are looking at is attitudes wrought in policies. Which impact people's lives, and come out as unequal distribution of income, with the rich getting richer, and the poor getting nothing.The down side to this is that the United States is a negative outlier in nearly ever conceivable dimension when viewed against our peers. The rich get richer. Money flows into ""cost-plus"" military or engineers contracts given to influential contractors. And the profits flow to the wealthy shareholders, while those same companies move manufacturing jobs over seas.There are several stats that still shock me. For instance Cuba -- the small island nation that is much poorer than the US -- has a lower infant mortality rate and slightly higher death rate than the wealthiest nation in the world. And the research that shows that, after a certain level, pursuit wealth does not really bring satisfaction illustrates an ages-old spiritual insight. No doubt it will take more than that. But the overall analysis is sound. There are some Right-Wing attacks of this book floating around. Because word is getting out, and the findings do seem to support Progressive opinions and debunk Conservative notions. And the authors have posted an interesting article that < href=""http://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/sites... the arguments being made by the Right against the insights the authors make in this book because they are, frankly, statistically incorrect. But, more importantly, the author of this rebuttal question the author's overly clean ""to make society better, all we need to do is make income more equal.""Which smacks of intellectual honesty -- rare in any time. But refreshing in political discourse.Highly recommended. The only reason it did not get 5-stars from me is that these findings could have been summarized in about half the pages. And that the majority of it can be had for free on their website The Equality Trust. (http://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/)"

While this further provides impetus for wealth distribution, avid readers taking interest in this topic should be quick to recognize that this is a battle waged on multiple fronts. Further focuses on the accessibility of of healthy food, health care, education, and generally stable environments are all necessary, not to mention individual work towards optimizing personal attitudes and lifestyles rather than merely focusing on a change of the externals variables. All of these routes need to be taken seriously to sufficiently alleviate the problem."

It's a long 300 odd pages though of graphs and explanations that, very quickly, and to the thesis' credit, end up being the same line of reasoning every time. The core message is that the greater the inequality in societies - the gap between the richest and poorest - the greater the levels of many of society's ills, from poor mental health, growing prison populations and declining child wellbeing. "
242,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4454139-linda,5,"Just finished reading The Spirit Level and greatly appreciated the extensive endnotes and clarity with which this book was written. The authors methodically take the reader through their thinking chapter by chapter and support their argument that greater equality in society would lead to a better human experience for everyone - even the wealthy. Contrary to some beliefs, this book does not advocate the control of the government over businesses (authors said that was distinctly NOT the answer), reminds us that it is small businesses which generally are making the largest innovative contributions to society, that Thomas Paine was right regarding aristocracy. As a history teacher and someone who also loves science, I found this book to raise numerous thoughtful questions in which we all need to engage. Reminding me that Thomas Paine rejected the value of a landed aristocracy and connecting that thinking to questioning the value of the multi-national corporations was inspirational and insightful. Logical thinking, which as a student of anthropology I realize may be incorrect when discussing societies, does lead me to believe that having some persons holding enormous pots of wealth may not be the best way to encourage people to value society, family, friends or a sense of community, but rather would encourage people to watch over their shoulders and try to keep up with the values of high consumerism. Not buying into social hierarchies or consumerism would not bring about the collapse of the world, but rather would increase one's happiness in it. Time spent trying to acquire material goods would be spent with family, friends, community service, etc which are actions long understood and supported as ways to greatly increase one's happiness. Personal connections with others would reduce corruption and greed since it is far more difficult to rip off people with whom you associate on a regular basis (yes I know that Madoff did that, but he received all that press because of his unusually egregious antisocial actions) since you would have human connection and relationships that would discourage even the desire to rip off others. The ""solution"" of this book is to move in a direction of more employee owned businesses with less competitive social hierarchies - do not forget, humanity lived for many thousands of years in hunter gatherer societies and the importance of human connection has been bred into us (think some game theory studies). The authors address the increasingly challenging attempts to control and make money on intellectual/patented knowledge and raise some interesting questions as to where this is going - how will we make money on these products as the internet and global access to knowledge increases exponentially? We are being forced to create new economic strategies to address these concerns - so whether we like it or not, we will be forced to change and change is not something the majority of human beings embrace. I found one statement particularly fascinating and worthy of extensive thought: ""An important ideological cost of the Cold War was that America gave up its historical commitment to equality."" I have not decided whether or not that is true, partially true, but I believe this is a statement worth exploring - what has happened to our civil liberties over the past few decades? Are we more free or less free (some groups have obviously achieved more freedom yet overall what is today's current thinking - have we continued to move in a freer direction?) than a few decades ago? What has been the long-term impact of the Cold War on our equality psyche? At the end of the day however, I believe that everyone will agree that inequality costs - as a teacher, I see on a daily basis the long-term impacts of inequality, how much do prisons cost us, how much does violence cost us, how much does having ""gated communities"" cost us, how much does it cost us to have some people with so much money that they behave as if they are above the law (think financial institutions, the multi-national corporations that are impacting the governments of other nations, the financial turmoil that we repeatedly experience) - I say that these things cost all of us and that a more equal, community-based society would not be a utopian dream or perfection, but it would be a great improvement over the way life is now and is something we can achieve. This is not a ""left"" or ""right"" book - this is a book that is questioning our value structure, our way of life, how long is this way of life sustainable and successfully examines the consequences of inequality."
243,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6948668-conor-mcvarnock,5,"Excellent work, the conclusions are largely intuitive and certainly nothing that should be of any sort of surprise to most of us on the socialist left (except maybe all the stuff about Japan being up there with the Scandanavian Countries). The basic point made by the book is that after a certain point, how rich or developed a country is doesn't matter after a certain point, its the level of inequality that is the decisive factor on a range of issues, levels of obesity, mental illness, heart disease, your chances of being violently assaulted. This is not merely asserted, but proven scientifically with a huge raft of peer-reviewed academic research from the field of epidemiology and hard statistical analysis. Seriously, try disagreeing with any of this and you'll end up looking like a fool, there is so much evidence on display that its hard to come to any other conclusion than that a more equal society is necessarily a better one, not just for those at the bottom, the middle and upper classes are healthier in more equal societies compared to their peers in less equal ones.Where we may disagree though is how to get from the shitty unequal state of our contemporary post-neoliberal wrecks. I say that you cannot escape the conclusion that a revolution is whats needed.Anyway, plenty of food for thought and if you enjoy smoking market fundies in debates over any social issue, then you'll find more than enough ammo here."
244,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16475435-joy-b,3,"The only negative thing I can say about this book is that they use evo psyche in two chapters to prove a point. I think this makes their work lose some credibility as evo-psyche is mainly a purely speculative field. It was a shame they had to rely heavily on it in the teenage pregnancies chapter; it was as if they couldn't look past the gender of many of the teenagers and place it in a wider context. There was also some bad neuroscience near the end. This promoted logic of, ""If this part of the area shows activity when we do this and also when we do this it MUST mean the two are the same thing."" which really deliberately reductive and something bad science journalists do. The book was good enough to not need shoddy science to reinforce its points. Other than that this book is inspiring. I recommend it to everyone. The last chapter in particular reminded me of all the reasons I got involved with activism. It's nice to know that equality is an achievable goal."

250,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3299609-ignacio,5,"There is SO MUCH to unpack from this book - I am still processing everything. Spirit Level is an in-depth research that describes the negative effects of wide inequality. Now, while on the surface, this statement might seem kind of obvious - the intricacies behind it are worth the read. The book will bombard you with data, and the results are as alarming as they are broad in terms of impact. According to their studies (and keeping in mind that strong correlation does not necessarily mean causality), countries with higher degree on inequality (leading country: USA), suffer from: - Higher rates of obesity- Higher rates of mental illness- Higher rates of anxiety/depression- Higher rates of racism and sexism- Higher rates of chronic diseases- Higher degree of self-promoting insecure egotism and status insecurity- Higher rates of violence- Higher rates of luxury fever (which pushes for over consumption) - Higher spending on criminal and judicial systems- Higher levels of mistrust- Lower life expectancy ratesIt is important to highlight that these negative consequences are not limited to the lower spectrum of society (the less resourceful) but EVEN those at the top of the scale. Ultimately, this means that you can't escape these consequences regardless of how privilege/fortunate you might be.Now, if this already seems obvious to you, something interesting is the understanding why this might be the case. According to their studies (and this applies mostly to already developed countries) countries have reached a threshold of material living standards and the benefits of further economic growth are less substantial. Economic growth is no longer a driver to wellbeing and happiness - and this comes down to our current social structures and psychology. We, as society, have become ""highly self-conscious, obsessed with how we appear to others, worried that we might come across as unattractive, boring, etc and we are constantly trying to manage the impressions we make"". This vulnerability is part of the modern psychological and societal conditions, which feeds directly into our over consumption mentality, driven by our constant anxiety of comparing ourselves to those who might have more, which ultimately snow balls into deep psychology rooted issues. I will spare the details in case you are interested in reading it - but it is important to note that these consequences reach older and younger people to even babies in the womb. Some interesting psychological/sociological concepts: 1. Luxury Fever: As inequality grows and the super-rich at the top spend more and more on luxury goods, the desire for such things cascades down the income scale and the rest of us struggle to compete and keep up.2. ‘Affluenza’ virus: a ‘set of values which increase our vulnerability to emotional distress’. It entails placing a high value on acquiring money and possessions, looking good in the eyes of others and wanting to be famous. These kinds of values place us at greater risk of depression, anxiety, substance abuse and personality disorder.3. Addiction to income: the more we have, the more we feel we need and the more time we spend on striving for material wealth and possessions, at the expense of our family life, relationships, and quality of life.This is an interesting read; however, I thought the book was light and rushed when it comes to solutions. It is evident that we as society need to change our social dynamics, but it also clear that big government is not the answer."
251,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59510129-chris,5,"The first 2/3 of this book is a thorough investigation of the relationship between income inequality and a specific array of health and social problems. The authors effectively explain the scope of their claims, discuss the mechanisms through which inequality leads to societal problems, and cite specific evidence. If you believe that socioeconomic inequality causes problems for a society - not just for the poor, but for the whole society - but you can’t really put your finger on why that is, this book will clear that question right up for you. The remaining 1/3 addresses the question of what these findings mean in historical and political context. Why are some countries more equal than others? Is change possible? How? The authors are careful not to overstep the bounds of their research here with the same certainty with which they make their claims in the earlier part of the book. And rightly so, as this would dilute the credibility of their earlier claims.They offer a broad framework for change as well as several policies and activist efforts to consider. Given the scope of the authors’ research, I found this an effective conclusion. It would have been irresponsible to ardently advocate a specific course of action without duplicating the volume of investigation. However, it would have been equally irresponsible to present these findings in a vacuum without discussing the implications and touching on how the reader should use the findings. The assertiveness of the call to action was well-calibrated to the thoroughness of the research findings presented: we KNOW greater equality will improve societies. We KNOW it is possible for a society to change its level of equality. We MUST act. We have reason to believe employee ownership, social welfare programs, and other policies have merit in effecting change.

Or even because you think that competition and a freer market drive the best outcomes for us all. Anyway you get here, I think you'll find this a thought provoking read about the way insidious ways that inequality (of outcome and opportunity) harms societies and individuals.Generally, I think this is fairly well argued. The authors don't start from the premise that inequality causes poor social outcomes (obesity, teen pregnancy, property crime, mental health struggles, higher prison populations, poorer health outcomes etc), they start from the premise that inequality is often correlated with these things. Then they investigate the ways in which inequality erodes trust and increases stress across communities and nations, and the lower outcomes for all levels of society, even the rich.Though they provide citations and an explanation of the data they used and how they analyzed it, I did find one or two of their arguments a little hand-wavy. On the other hand, they intended this book for general consumption, and probably didn't want to overwhelm people with interminable paragraphs. I also wasn't entirely convinced that their proposed solutions to unequal societies were as well thought out as their previous chapters. But that also makes sense. They're researchers, not policy wonks.In any case, this is an important and readable book, and if you're interested in the macro level of how societies work, this is a good one to pick up."

All of this applies across different levels of society (not just for the poor, rich nor middle class, but everyone!). Equality also extends to relations with other people or groups of people, or even between countries; more equality in your community=more trust=more mutual profit for everyone you work with. They certainly make a convincing case. My only concern is that being a welfare-state living, equality loving Finn, I was already inclined to thinking this way, so I should probably get familiar with the critique these guys have encountered :)Anyways, inspiring stuff, and can't wait to read their new book!Update after reading the critique from ""spirit level delusion""-blog:It seems that the writers may have been building on their own biased hyphothesis and not looking for alternative outcomes at all. The data may have been cherry-picked and the results can't necessarily be repeated with another set of countries or at another point in time.

If people are largely similar in culture then why would they not have more equal outcomes then in a country like the US which is so much larger and made up of different groups? There was some attempt to address this in the book but it was fairly brief. It seems to me that things such as crime, education, drug use etc would tend to correlate together and so would not need a separate chapter for each topic.  It will be interesting to see how a country like Sweden fares in the future since it has excepted large numbers of refugees. Will inequality rise or will its welfare programme lift everyone up to a similar status.I feel the book made some very interesting points and I am in agreement that inequality is a bad thing in general but I am unconvinced with much of the central premise of the book."

Reading this book has profoundly changed my opinion and my understanding of the role of inequality (notably on incomes) and its relationship with health and social issues that affect the well-being of society and nation as a whole. Having been living in New Zealand for over twenty years, I do observed the manifestation of health and social issues that can be attributed to inequality. Sadly, the inequality gap in New Zealand has widened since the study. I think New Zealand had forgotten that it was once a nation that was big on fairness and egalitarian ethos.For decades now, the Scandinavian model of social democracy had shown us that the model has the capability to close the inequality gap, perhaps it's time for English-speaking countries to adapt the model if we indeed serious about fairness and equality for our people.A different angle to appreciate how a big deal inequality really is, read: 23 Things They Don't Tell You About Capitalism - Ha-Joon Chang."

Points of learning:Beyond a certain point, rise in GDP makes no material difference to people’s wellbeing.Evaluative threat is a stressor resulting in ‘rising anxiety and a narcissitic defence of an insecure self image’.Violence is more common in unequal societies because ‘loss of face’ when people feel disrespected is the only thing they have to lose.Income inequality is the ‘prime mover’ of trust.Children’s mental health is strongly correlated with income inequality.Surprisingly to me, there is no relationship between health spending per person and life expectancy.Early childhood educational programmes are high yield.Flatter inequality also means flatter ambition (interesting).‘The discouraged among the disadvantaged’ become teenage mothers.John Irwin’s purposes of prison (shudder): official ones are retribution, deterrence, and incapacitation, whereas unofficial ones are class control, scapegoating, and political gain.Penal expansion goes with welfare contraction; as inequality goes up you pay more for police.Bourdieu’s ‘economy of cultural goods’ drives class discrimination.Single parenthood is not remotely as difficult in more equal countries.In a ‘steady state’ economy increasing equality causes increasing, not decreasing, creativity – something I wondered about myself.Working hours per person increase with inequality.I really need to read some Veblen.

This is an important piece of work and I'm on board with making society a more equal place! Although the thesis has merit, it was an absolute slog to read. I found the writing unengaging, repetitive and (particularly in the interpretation) drenched in bias.The trouble is, the authors seem to pursue their conclusions with such a dogged determination, that they don't seem to notice when they are contradicting themselves or overinterpreting. Several times I found myself frowning and saying to myself ""But... a few chapters ago you said the opposite..."" or ""But... that's not a watertight argument..."" and once or twice ""that makes ZERO sense AT ALL!"" So although there is a lot of good here, the book is let down by dull commentary, confident assertion of uncertainties and solutions that are a little too authoritarian-seeming for me to fully endorse."

Have we the imagination and the courage? "
266,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1879990-adam,5,"Science is meant to provide provocative, unexpected insights into our world, providing clues that can help us do whatever it is we want to do. The best scientists find insights that make the world a better place, and present their findings in ways that can inspire communities to act on them. This book is among the very best science books I'm familiar with, ranking up there with The Diversity of Life and Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed. The book takes a simple, obvious progressive mantra - more equal societies are better for people - and scientifically demonstrates its validity in more ways than the most optimistic of us would ever have guessed. Wilkinson and Pickett show how inequality erodes social trust, decreases educational performance, increases homicides, shortens lives, increases consumption, causes greater conflict among children, increases drug use and mental illness, and increases the number of people in prison. Their results are checked on rich nations and among the United States. The relationship is shocking - it seems that inequality is, after a certain level of economic well-being (per capita GDP) is reached, it is by far the most important determinant of societal well-being. Their results showed that it didn't matter how a society became more equal - government organized wealth redistribution or natural market mechanisms or a strong labor movement (trade union membership is apparently the strongest predictor of inequality in a nation). Pickett and Wilkinson included a pleasing amount of speculation and research about HOW inequality causes all of the social ills it does. Apparently, merely being judged constantly as to one's social status is extremely stressful (for everyone, but moreso if you're on the bottom!). This stress leads to all sorts of things - direct health consequences, impaired mental and physical abilities, violent responses to those who question one's status, distrust of others (they are competitors, not friends!), etc. It is passed down from generation to generation, starting with stress hormones that influence a baby's development in the womb, cuing them to prepare for a harsh, antagonistic world. The results demonstrate that poverty really does inhibit peoples' ability to succeed socially, and not just for the host of obvious reasons (disenfranchisement, nutrition, etc) that are usually discussed.I found this conversation quite interesting, since the mechanisms they cite would have been active in all societies since the advent of severe inequality. Of course, inequality was much more severe in many past societies than it is in ours, so the effects were likely more severe. These biological responses to hierarchy likely explain some of the socially corrosive effects associated with civilization.The conclusions of the book are quite obvious, then: make societies more equal and all the other problems will improve on their own. In fact, increasing equality is the most effective measure known to address most of these issues. As the authors say, ""[symptomatic solutions] attempt to break the link between socio-economic disadvantage and the problems it produces. The unstated hope is that people - particularly the poor - can carry on in the same circumstances, but will somehow no longer succumb to mental illness, teenage pregnancy, educational failure, obesity, or drugs.""In summary: “In the figures there is also a clear warning for those who might want to place low public expenditure and taxation at the top of their list of priorities. If you fail to avoid high inequality, you will need more prisons and more police. You will have to deal with higher rates of mental illness, drug abuse, and every other kind of problem. If keeping taxes and benefits down leads to wider income differences, the need to deal with the ensuing social ills may force you to raise public expenditure to cope.” "
267,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14612139-nick,3," To be honest I was disappointed when if finished it. Don't get me wrong, it is not that the book is bad in a literary, academic or political way but it did not wow me. The point is that I have read a lot of the basic premises and facts in this book, indicating the impact the book has made so far, and therefore it was not as surprising as it might have been if I would have read the book in 2009. I for one already knew how badly a social status inequality affects children's educational capacities even if it was helpful to read about it again in a concrete manner with numbers to back it up. Still if did not feel like enough, what did save the book for me, was the inclusion of an additional chapter responding to their critics that was helpful and insightful, humble yet adamant in its tone to defend the vision behind the book. I have to admit that some of the correlations and as the writers claim causal relation between inequality and various social problems is quite staggering. I did get a bit skeptical at some moments, surely all these can't be related to relative and material inequality? But considering the authors never make a definitive claim (a few exceptions) but rather point out a unpleasant truth for many, that when comparing equally wealthy countries, unequal ones are worse on many levels up to homicide and numbers of innovations. I was genuinely surprised to discover that all income groups in general are better off in terms of health(mental and physical) and general life expectancy and that at some level of material wealth and economic growth no substantial gains can be made for any social indicator! Another point I found intriguing and would like to delve deeper into is the link between anxiety and depression surges in society linked to increased status consumption driven by inequality, due mostly for my connection to the feelings of pointlessness described to be felt by a growing portion of the population and my personal rejection of mental consumption coping mechanisms. Perhaps the most compelling point is that the researchers compared wealthy countries, the entire classic liberal argument ""but we will be like the USSR if we want more equality!"" is rubbish, Sweden and Canada aren't socialist dictatorships. most shocking and left me in emotional distress was the segment on junkfood and why poor people choose to eat it, the testimonies of children, homeless and youngsters as to why they spent so much time and money there, were gut wrenching. I did not like the inclusion of animal testing and references to the pre agricultural man, for I never could accept both as solid evidence, one for we are not animals (and i ethically object animal testing) and the second for claims based on how the prehistoric man lived are used by every side to defend every position for we simply can't without doubt reconstruct the mindset of these peoples (referring to current hunter forager societies as way to understand prehistoric man, is as problematic for it is increasingly clear these are not relics of our collective past but rather responses to changing conditions throughout human history). As a citizen of Belgium, one of the countries more favorable in the statistics used, this book and its ideas and vision of modern society as to be more inclusive to achieve collective well being, do not come across as a shock, this book was meant for the anglo saxon world, in tone, content and vision which as a non anglo saxon leaves me a bit underwhelmed. Still considering the times and impact the book has had so far, still makes it worthwhile especially when measures to increase inequality are gaining power in the more equal nations of Belgium and the Netherlands and the ideal of collective progress is being replaced by the need to police and look down on the poor.... unfortunately....

268,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5355264-monica,5,The authors bring evidence to what I knew intuitively. I feel vindicated.
269,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2118933-leo-walsh,4,"An overall very interesting book that examines the negative impacts of inequality on a variety social issues. While it seems to harp on the same theme -- inequality is bad for most of us, even the wealthy -- there are some times where I found myself thinking ""correlation does not imply causation."" There seems little doubt that inequality, though, is driven by government policy. And thus reflects the hidden attitudes of those in power -- since the policies a nation's elite have followed across several decades and their effects are, rhetoric aside, the net effect of the power structures that run a country.So what we are looking at is attitudes wrought in policies. Which impact people's lives, and come out as unequal distribution of income, with the rich getting richer, and the poor getting nothing.The down side to this is that the United States is a negative outlier in nearly ever conceivable dimension when viewed against our peers. The rich get richer. Money flows into ""cost-plus"" military or engineers contracts given to influential contractors. And the profits flow to the wealthy shareholders, while those same companies move manufacturing jobs over seas.There are several stats that still shock me. For instance Cuba -- the small island nation that is much poorer than the US -- has a lower infant mortality rate and slightly higher death rate than the wealthiest nation in the world. And the research that shows that, after a certain level, pursuit wealth does not really bring satisfaction illustrates an ages-old spiritual insight. No doubt it will take more than that. But the overall analysis is sound. There are some Right-Wing attacks of this book floating around. Because word is getting out, and the findings do seem to support Progressive opinions and debunk Conservative notions. And the authors have posted an interesting article that < href=""http://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/sites... the arguments being made by the Right against the insights the authors make in this book because they are, frankly, statistically incorrect. But, more importantly, the author of this rebuttal question the author's overly clean ""to make society better, all we need to do is make income more equal.""Which smacks of intellectual honesty -- rare in any time. But refreshing in political discourse.Highly recommended. The only reason it did not get 5-stars from me is that these findings could have been summarized in about half the pages. And that the majority of it can be had for free on their website The Equality Trust. (http://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/)"

While this further provides impetus for wealth distribution, avid readers taking interest in this topic should be quick to recognize that this is a battle waged on multiple fronts. Further focuses on the accessibility of of healthy food, health care, education, and generally stable environments are all necessary, not to mention individual work towards optimizing personal attitudes and lifestyles rather than merely focusing on a change of the externals variables. All of these routes need to be taken seriously to sufficiently alleviate the problem."

The core arguments of this book are fascinating, and the data incredibly convincing. It's a long 300 odd pages though of graphs and explanations that, very quickly, and to the thesis' credit, end up being the same line of reasoning every time. The core message is that the greater the inequality in societies - the gap between the richest and poorest - the greater the levels of many of society's ills, from poor mental health, growing prison populations and declining child wellbeing. "
272,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4454139-linda,5,"Just finished reading The Spirit Level and greatly appreciated the extensive endnotes and clarity with which this book was written. The authors methodically take the reader through their thinking chapter by chapter and support their argument that greater equality in society would lead to a better human experience for everyone - even the wealthy. Contrary to some beliefs, this book does not advocate the control of the government over businesses (authors said that was distinctly NOT the answer), reminds us that it is small businesses which generally are making the largest innovative contributions to society, that Thomas Paine was right regarding aristocracy. As a history teacher and someone who also loves science, I found this book to raise numerous thoughtful questions in which we all need to engage. Reminding me that Thomas Paine rejected the value of a landed aristocracy and connecting that thinking to questioning the value of the multi-national corporations was inspirational and insightful. Logical thinking, which as a student of anthropology I realize may be incorrect when discussing societies, does lead me to believe that having some persons holding enormous pots of wealth may not be the best way to encourage people to value society, family, friends or a sense of community, but rather would encourage people to watch over their shoulders and try to keep up with the values of high consumerism. Not buying into social hierarchies or consumerism would not bring about the collapse of the world, but rather would increase one's happiness in it. Time spent trying to acquire material goods would be spent with family, friends, community service, etc which are actions long understood and supported as ways to greatly increase one's happiness. Personal connections with others would reduce corruption and greed since it is far more difficult to rip off people with whom you associate on a regular basis (yes I know that Madoff did that, but he received all that press because of his unusually egregious antisocial actions) since you would have human connection and relationships that would discourage even the desire to rip off others. The ""solution"" of this book is to move in a direction of more employee owned businesses with less competitive social hierarchies - do not forget, humanity lived for many thousands of years in hunter gatherer societies and the importance of human connection has been bred into us (think some game theory studies). The authors address the increasingly challenging attempts to control and make money on intellectual/patented knowledge and raise some interesting questions as to where this is going - how will we make money on these products as the internet and global access to knowledge increases exponentially? We are being forced to create new economic strategies to address these concerns - so whether we like it or not, we will be forced to change and change is not something the majority of human beings embrace. I found one statement particularly fascinating and worthy of extensive thought: ""An important ideological cost of the Cold War was that America gave up its historical commitment to equality."" I have not decided whether or not that is true, partially true, but I believe this is a statement worth exploring - what has happened to our civil liberties over the past few decades? Are we more free or less free (some groups have obviously achieved more freedom yet overall what is today's current thinking - have we continued to move in a freer direction?) than a few decades ago? What has been the long-term impact of the Cold War on our equality psyche? At the end of the day however, I believe that everyone will agree that inequality costs - as a teacher, I see on a daily basis the long-term impacts of inequality, how much do prisons cost us, how much does violence cost us, how much does having ""gated communities"" cost us, how much does it cost us to have some people with so much money that they behave as if they are above the law (think financial institutions, the multi-national corporations that are impacting the governments of other nations, the financial turmoil that we repeatedly experience) - I say that these things cost all of us and that a more equal, community-based society would not be a utopian dream or perfection, but it would be a great improvement over the way life is now and is something we can achieve. This is not a ""left"" or ""right"" book - this is a book that is questioning our value structure, our way of life, how long is this way of life sustainable and successfully examines the consequences of inequality."
273,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6948668-conor-mcvarnock,5,"Excellent work, the conclusions are largely intuitive and certainly nothing that should be of any sort of surprise to most of us on the socialist left (except maybe all the stuff about Japan being up there with the Scandanavian Countries). The basic point made by the book is that after a certain point, how rich or developed a country is doesn't matter after a certain point, its the level of inequality that is the decisive factor on a range of issues, levels of obesity, mental illness, heart disease, your chances of being violently assaulted. This is not merely asserted, but proven scientifically with a huge raft of peer-reviewed academic research from the field of epidemiology and hard statistical analysis. Seriously, try disagreeing with any of this and you'll end up looking like a fool, there is so much evidence on display that its hard to come to any other conclusion than that a more equal society is necessarily a better one, not just for those at the bottom, the middle and upper classes are healthier in more equal societies compared to their peers in less equal ones.Where we may disagree though is how to get from the shitty unequal state of our contemporary post-neoliberal wrecks. I say that you cannot escape the conclusion that a revolution is whats needed.Anyway, plenty of food for thought and if you enjoy smoking market fundies in debates over any social issue, then you'll find more than enough ammo here."
274,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16475435-joy-b,3,"The only negative thing I can say about this book is that they use evo psyche in two chapters to prove a point. I think this makes their work lose some credibility as evo-psyche is mainly a purely speculative field. It was a shame they had to rely heavily on it in the teenage pregnancies chapter; it was as if they couldn't look past the gender of many of the teenagers and place it in a wider context. There was also some bad neuroscience near the end. This promoted logic of, ""If this part of the area shows activity when we do this and also when we do this it MUST mean the two are the same thing."" which really deliberately reductive and something bad science journalists do. The book was good enough to not need shoddy science to reinforce its points. Other than that this book is inspiring. I recommend it to everyone. The last chapter in particular reminded me of all the reasons I got involved with activism. It's nice to know that equality is an achievable goal."

280,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3299609-ignacio,5,"There is SO MUCH to unpack from this book - I am still processing everything. Spirit Level is an in-depth research that describes the negative effects of wide inequality. Now, while on the surface, this statement might seem kind of obvious - the intricacies behind it are worth the read. The book will bombard you with data, and the results are as alarming as they are broad in terms of impact. According to their studies (and keeping in mind that strong correlation does not necessarily mean causality), countries with higher degree on inequality (leading country: USA), suffer from: - Higher rates of obesity- Higher rates of mental illness- Higher rates of anxiety/depression- Higher rates of racism and sexism- Higher rates of chronic diseases- Higher degree of self-promoting insecure egotism and status insecurity- Higher rates of violence- Higher rates of luxury fever (which pushes for over consumption) - Higher spending on criminal and judicial systems- Higher levels of mistrust- Lower life expectancy ratesIt is important to highlight that these negative consequences are not limited to the lower spectrum of society (the less resourceful) but EVEN those at the top of the scale. Ultimately, this means that you can't escape these consequences regardless of how privilege/fortunate you might be.Now, if this already seems obvious to you, something interesting is the understanding why this might be the case. According to their studies (and this applies mostly to already developed countries) countries have reached a threshold of material living standards and the benefits of further economic growth are less substantial. Economic growth is no longer a driver to wellbeing and happiness - and this comes down to our current social structures and psychology. We, as society, have become ""highly self-conscious, obsessed with how we appear to others, worried that we might come across as unattractive, boring, etc and we are constantly trying to manage the impressions we make"". This vulnerability is part of the modern psychological and societal conditions, which feeds directly into our over consumption mentality, driven by our constant anxiety of comparing ourselves to those who might have more, which ultimately snow balls into deep psychology rooted issues. I will spare the details in case you are interested in reading it - but it is important to note that these consequences reach older and younger people to even babies in the womb. Some interesting psychological/sociological concepts: 1. Luxury Fever: As inequality grows and the super-rich at the top spend more and more on luxury goods, the desire for such things cascades down the income scale and the rest of us struggle to compete and keep up.2. ‘Affluenza’ virus: a ‘set of values which increase our vulnerability to emotional distress’. It entails placing a high value on acquiring money and possessions, looking good in the eyes of others and wanting to be famous. These kinds of values place us at greater risk of depression, anxiety, substance abuse and personality disorder.3. Addiction to income: the more we have, the more we feel we need and the more time we spend on striving for material wealth and possessions, at the expense of our family life, relationships, and quality of life.This is an interesting read; however, I thought the book was light and rushed when it comes to solutions. It is evident that we as society need to change our social dynamics, but it also clear that big government is not the answer."
281,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59510129-chris,5,"The first 2/3 of this book is a thorough investigation of the relationship between income inequality and a specific array of health and social problems. The authors effectively explain the scope of their claims, discuss the mechanisms through which inequality leads to societal problems, and cite specific evidence. If you believe that socioeconomic inequality causes problems for a society - not just for the poor, but for the whole society - but you can’t really put your finger on why that is, this book will clear that question right up for you. The remaining 1/3 addresses the question of what these findings mean in historical and political context. Why are some countries more equal than others? Is change possible? How? The authors are careful not to overstep the bounds of their research here with the same certainty with which they make their claims in the earlier part of the book. And rightly so, as this would dilute the credibility of their earlier claims.They offer a broad framework for change as well as several policies and activist efforts to consider. Given the scope of the authors’ research, I found this an effective conclusion. It would have been irresponsible to ardently advocate a specific course of action without duplicating the volume of investigation. However, it would have been equally irresponsible to present these findings in a vacuum without discussing the implications and touching on how the reader should use the findings. The assertiveness of the call to action was well-calibrated to the thoroughness of the research findings presented: we KNOW greater equality will improve societies. We KNOW it is possible for a society to change its level of equality. We MUST act. We have reason to believe employee ownership, social welfare programs, and other policies have merit in effecting change.

Or even because you think that competition and a freer market drive the best outcomes for us all. Anyway you get here, I think you'll find this a thought provoking read about the way insidious ways that inequality (of outcome and opportunity) harms societies and individuals.Generally, I think this is fairly well argued. The authors don't start from the premise that inequality causes poor social outcomes (obesity, teen pregnancy, property crime, mental health struggles, higher prison populations, poorer health outcomes etc), they start from the premise that inequality is often correlated with these things. Then they investigate the ways in which inequality erodes trust and increases stress across communities and nations, and the lower outcomes for all levels of society, even the rich.Though they provide citations and an explanation of the data they used and how they analyzed it, I did find one or two of their arguments a little hand-wavy. On the other hand, they intended this book for general consumption, and probably didn't want to overwhelm people with interminable paragraphs. I also wasn't entirely convinced that their proposed solutions to unequal societies were as well thought out as their previous chapters. But that also makes sense. They're researchers, not policy wonks.In any case, this is an important and readable book, and if you're interested in the macro level of how societies work, this is a good one to pick up."

All of this applies across different levels of society (not just for the poor, rich nor middle class, but everyone!). Equality also extends to relations with other people or groups of people, or even between countries; more equality in your community=more trust=more mutual profit for everyone you work with. They certainly make a convincing case. My only concern is that being a welfare-state living, equality loving Finn, I was already inclined to thinking this way, so I should probably get familiar with the critique these guys have encountered :)Anyways, inspiring stuff, and can't wait to read their new book!Update after reading the critique from ""spirit level delusion""-blog:It seems that the writers may have been building on their own biased hyphothesis and not looking for alternative outcomes at all. The data may have been cherry-picked and the results can't necessarily be repeated with another set of countries or at another point in time.

If people are largely similar in culture then why would they not have more equal outcomes then in a country like the US which is so much larger and made up of different groups? There was some attempt to address this in the book but it was fairly brief. It seems to me that things such as crime, education, drug use etc would tend to correlate together and so would not need a separate chapter for each topic.  It will be interesting to see how a country like Sweden fares in the future since it has excepted large numbers of refugees. Will inequality rise or will its welfare programme lift everyone up to a similar status.I feel the book made some very interesting points and I am in agreement that inequality is a bad thing in general but I am unconvinced with much of the central premise of the book."

Reading this book has profoundly changed my opinion and my understanding of the role of inequality (notably on incomes) and its relationship with health and social issues that affect the well-being of society and nation as a whole. Having been living in New Zealand for over twenty years, I do observed the manifestation of health and social issues that can be attributed to inequality. Sadly, the inequality gap in New Zealand has widened since the study. I think New Zealand had forgotten that it was once a nation that was big on fairness and egalitarian ethos.For decades now, the Scandinavian model of social democracy had shown us that the model has the capability to close the inequality gap, perhaps it's time for English-speaking countries to adapt the model if we indeed serious about fairness and equality for our people.A different angle to appreciate how a big deal inequality really is, read: 23 Things They Don't Tell You About Capitalism - Ha-Joon Chang."

Points of learning:Beyond a certain point, rise in GDP makes no material difference to people’s wellbeing.Evaluative threat is a stressor resulting in ‘rising anxiety and a narcissitic defence of an insecure self image’.Violence is more common in unequal societies because ‘loss of face’ when people feel disrespected is the only thing they have to lose.Income inequality is the ‘prime mover’ of trust.Children’s mental health is strongly correlated with income inequality.Surprisingly to me, there is no relationship between health spending per person and life expectancy.Early childhood educational programmes are high yield.Flatter inequality also means flatter ambition (interesting).‘The discouraged among the disadvantaged’ become teenage mothers.John Irwin’s purposes of prison (shudder): official ones are retribution, deterrence, and incapacitation, whereas unofficial ones are class control, scapegoating, and political gain.Penal expansion goes with welfare contraction; as inequality goes up you pay more for police.Bourdieu’s ‘economy of cultural goods’ drives class discrimination.Single parenthood is not remotely as difficult in more equal countries.In a ‘steady state’ economy increasing equality causes increasing, not decreasing, creativity – something I wondered about myself.Working hours per person increase with inequality.I really need to read some Veblen. The Veblen effect: when goods are chosen for their social, not utility value.Suggestions for change: employee-ownership. (In terms of concrete suggestions, this is pretty much it.)"

This is an important piece of work and I'm on board with making society a more equal place! Although the thesis has merit, it was an absolute slog to read. I found the writing unengaging, repetitive and (particularly in the interpretation) drenched in bias.The trouble is, the authors seem to pursue their conclusions with such a dogged determination, that they don't seem to notice when they are contradicting themselves or overinterpreting. Several times I found myself frowning and saying to myself ""But... a few chapters ago you said the opposite..."" or ""But... that's not a watertight argument..."" and once or twice ""that makes ZERO sense AT ALL!"" So although there is a lot of good here, the book is let down by dull commentary, confident assertion of uncertainties and solutions that are a little too authoritarian-seeming for me to fully endorse."

Basically this book is what you would get if the conventional wisdom / 'common sense' of the NYT Opinion page became a sentient being and then p-hacked / bullshitted its way into 'proving' that its unquestioned background assumptions about the world were true. If this book were written in Victorian England in the 1880s, I'm pretty sure the author(s) would have determined that phrenology and phlogiston theory prove that British colonial subjects were living in the best of all possible worlds."

Have we the imagination and the courage? "
296,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1879990-adam,5,"Science is meant to provide provocative, unexpected insights into our world, providing clues that can help us do whatever it is we want to do. The best scientists find insights that make the world a better place, and present their findings in ways that can inspire communities to act on them. This book is among the very best science books I'm familiar with, ranking up there with The Diversity of Life and Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed. The book takes a simple, obvious progressive mantra - more equal societies are better for people - and scientifically demonstrates its validity in more ways than the most optimistic of us would ever have guessed. Wilkinson and Pickett show how inequality erodes social trust, decreases educational performance, increases homicides, shortens lives, increases consumption, causes greater conflict among children, increases drug use and mental illness, and increases the number of people in prison. Their results are checked on rich nations and among the United States. The relationship is shocking - it seems that inequality is, after a certain level of economic well-being (per capita GDP) is reached, it is by far the most important determinant of societal well-being. Their results showed that it didn't matter how a society became more equal - government organized wealth redistribution or natural market mechanisms or a strong labor movement (trade union membership is apparently the strongest predictor of inequality in a nation). Pickett and Wilkinson included a pleasing amount of speculation and research about HOW inequality causes all of the social ills it does. Apparently, merely being judged constantly as to one's social status is extremely stressful (for everyone, but moreso if you're on the bottom!). This stress leads to all sorts of things - direct health consequences, impaired mental and physical abilities, violent responses to those who question one's status, distrust of others (they are competitors, not friends!), etc. It is passed down from generation to generation, starting with stress hormones that influence a baby's development in the womb, cuing them to prepare for a harsh, antagonistic world. The results demonstrate that poverty really does inhibit peoples' ability to succeed socially, and not just for the host of obvious reasons (disenfranchisement, nutrition, etc) that are usually discussed.I found this conversation quite interesting, since the mechanisms they cite would have been active in all societies since the advent of severe inequality. Of course, inequality was much more severe in many past societies than it is in ours, so the effects were likely more severe. These biological responses to hierarchy likely explain some of the socially corrosive effects associated with civilization.The conclusions of the book are quite obvious, then: make societies more equal and all the other problems will improve on their own. In fact, increasing equality is the most effective measure known to address most of these issues. As the authors say, ""[symptomatic solutions] attempt to break the link between socio-economic disadvantage and the problems it produces. The unstated hope is that people - particularly the poor - can carry on in the same circumstances, but will somehow no longer succumb to mental illness, teenage pregnancy, educational failure, obesity, or drugs.""In summary: “In the figures there is also a clear warning for those who might want to place low public expenditure and taxation at the top of their list of priorities. If you fail to avoid high inequality, you will need more prisons and more police. You will have to deal with higher rates of mental illness, drug abuse, and every other kind of problem. If keeping taxes and benefits down leads to wider income differences, the need to deal with the ensuing social ills may force you to raise public expenditure to cope.” "
297,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14612139-nick,3," To be honest I was disappointed when if finished it. Don't get me wrong, it is not that the book is bad in a literary, academic or political way but it did not wow me. The point is that I have read a lot of the basic premises and facts in this book, indicating the impact the book has made so far, and therefore it was not as surprising as it might have been if I would have read the book in 2009. I for one already knew how badly a social status inequality affects children's educational capacities even if it was helpful to read about it again in a concrete manner with numbers to back it up. Still if did not feel like enough, what did save the book for me, was the inclusion of an additional chapter responding to their critics that was helpful and insightful, humble yet adamant in its tone to defend the vision behind the book. I have to admit that some of the correlations and as the writers claim causal relation between inequality and various social problems is quite staggering. I did get a bit skeptical at some moments, surely all these can't be related to relative and material inequality? But considering the authors never make a definitive claim (a few exceptions) but rather point out a unpleasant truth for many, that when comparing equally wealthy countries, unequal ones are worse on many levels up to homicide and numbers of innovations. I was genuinely surprised to discover that all income groups in general are better off in terms of health(mental and physical) and general life expectancy and that at some level of material wealth and economic growth no substantial gains can be made for any social indicator! Another point I found intriguing and would like to delve deeper into is the link between anxiety and depression surges in society linked to increased status consumption driven by inequality, due mostly for my connection to the feelings of pointlessness described to be felt by a growing portion of the population and my personal rejection of mental consumption coping mechanisms. Perhaps the most compelling point is that the researchers compared wealthy countries, the entire classic liberal argument ""but we will be like the USSR if we want more equality!"" is rubbish, Sweden and Canada aren't socialist dictatorships. most shocking and left me in emotional distress was the segment on junkfood and why poor people choose to eat it, the testimonies of children, homeless and youngsters as to why they spent so much time and money there, were gut wrenching. I did not like the inclusion of animal testing and references to the pre agricultural man, for I never could accept both as solid evidence, one for we are not animals (and i ethically object animal testing) and the second for claims based on how the prehistoric man lived are used by every side to defend every position for we simply can't without doubt reconstruct the mindset of these peoples (referring to current hunter forager societies as way to understand prehistoric man, is as problematic for it is increasingly clear these are not relics of our collective past but rather responses to changing conditions throughout human history). As a citizen of Belgium, one of the countries more favorable in the statistics used, this book and its ideas and vision of modern society as to be more inclusive to achieve collective well being, do not come across as a shock, this book was meant for the anglo saxon world, in tone, content and vision which as a non anglo saxon leaves me a bit underwhelmed. Still considering the times and impact the book has had so far, still makes it worthwhile especially when measures to increase inequality are gaining power in the more equal nations of Belgium and the Netherlands and the ideal of collective progress is being replaced by the need to police and look down on the poor.... unfortunately....

298,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5355264-monica,5,The authors bring evidence to what I knew intuitively. I feel vindicated.
299,1846140390,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2118933-leo-walsh,4,"An overall very interesting book that examines the negative impacts of inequality on a variety social issues. While it seems to harp on the same theme -- inequality is bad for most of us, even the wealthy -- there are some times where I found myself thinking ""correlation does not imply causation."" There seems little doubt that inequality, though, is driven by government policy. And thus reflects the hidden attitudes of those in power -- since the policies a nation's elite have followed across several decades and their effects are, rhetoric aside, the net effect of the power structures that run a country.So what we are looking at is attitudes wrought in policies. Which impact people's lives, and come out as unequal distribution of income, with the rich getting richer, and the poor getting nothing.The down side to this is that the United States is a negative outlier in nearly ever conceivable dimension when viewed against our peers. The rich get richer. Money flows into ""cost-plus"" military or engineers contracts given to influential contractors. And the profits flow to the wealthy shareholders, while those same companies move manufacturing jobs over seas.There are several stats that still shock me. For instance Cuba -- the small island nation that is much poorer than the US -- has a lower infant mortality rate and slightly higher death rate than the wealthiest nation in the world. And the research that shows that, after a certain level, pursuit wealth does not really bring satisfaction illustrates an ages-old spiritual insight. No doubt it will take more than that. But the overall analysis is sound. There are some Right-Wing attacks of this book floating around. Because word is getting out, and the findings do seem to support Progressive opinions and debunk Conservative notions. And the authors have posted an interesting article that < href=""http://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/sites... the arguments being made by the Right against the insights the authors make in this book because they are, frankly, statistically incorrect. But, more importantly, the author of this rebuttal question the author's overly clean ""to make society better, all we need to do is make income more equal.""Which smacks of intellectual honesty -- rare in any time. But refreshing in political discourse.Highly recommended. The only reason it did not get 5-stars from me is that these findings could have been summarized in about half the pages. And that the majority of it can be had for free on their website The Equality Trust. (http://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/)"
