0,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3897817-morgan-blackledge,5,"Author Judith Grisel is a recovered drug addict who got clean in the 80s and became a neuroscientist in search of a cure for addiction.Now, 40 some years later, she‚Äôs all but thrown in the towel on that project. There is no cure. There may never be a ‚Äúcure‚Äù. Addiction is simply not that kind of issue. Addiction has historically been viewed as a weakness of will, or flawed character, or due to an addictive personality. That‚Äôs all a bunch of primitive, punitive, ignorant, dysfunctional, ineffective, grossly inaccurate nonsense. More recently, the disease model of addiction has been promoted to counter all of that. And it is a huge firmware upgrade. But the disease model is still confusing, slightly disingenuous, and somewhat intellectually dishonest.Particularly when you understand the issue with greater resolution. Addiction can be considered a disease, but a very different kind of disease than cancer or the flu. Addiction involves a complexity of interacting biological, psychological, social, environmental, cultural and even ‚Äòspiritual (with an asterisk)‚Äô factors. Yes, it‚Äôs a brain disease of sorts, involving artificially super stimulating compounds that hack, exploit and re-wire a vulnerable brains evolutionarily conditioned motivation, reward and learning systems. But that‚Äôs not what most people think of when they hear ‚Äòaddiction is a disease‚Äô and that‚Äôs not the kind of thing a pill or surgery will ever be able to ‚Äòcure‚Äô. Addiction is (like diabetes) a chronic condition, typically necessitating a long term, comprehensive and systematic program of bio-psycho-social rehabilitation. But that takes a lot of work. And no pill can do all that. Addiction is manageable. Millions of people recover every day, and go on to lead highly productive, meaningful lives, that are frequently highly enriched as a result. People in recovery often develop super human psycho-social skills resulting from the programs of rigorous honesty, personal exploration and growth, self care, radical acceptance and compassion, and commitment to service and community typically necessary to overcome this tremendous adversity.Again, that all takes work. Really really hard as fuck, hard, hard, extremely difficult, extremely rewarding and meaningful, really hard fucking work. It‚Äôs like Britney says. And she should know. Ya gotta work biotch. So Judith Grisel‚Äôs work didn‚Äôt produce a miracle cure. But her decades of work did provide humanity with something that is arguably as important. Clarity. Or good, organized data (GOD). That‚Äôs an old atheist joke (not a very funny one, but then again, it‚Äôs not a very funny subculture).Never Enough toggles between addiction memoir (written in the first person) and neuroscience popularization (written in the third person), providing the reader with a gritty hell ride through personal ruin to recovery, intermittently augmented with extremely fucking interesting neuroscience that normalizes the issue and introduces badly needed clarity to the Tower of Babel that is the current public conversation.In a nutshell: if you tip your your brain out of balance with the happy chemicals in drugs of abuse, your brain compensates in a multitude of problematic ways, including by over producing the opposite neurochemistry, which makes you feel worse than awful when you‚Äôre not high. Recovery necessarily entails healing this imbalance and the underlying issues that initially lead you-me-us-them to the blunt, bottle, pooky or point. And did I mention that takes really hard work?Addiction is a brain disease, a deadly illusion, an evolutionary miss-match, a product of learning gone wild, a public health issue, a spiritual crisis and so much more. Never Enough provides a clear, realistic window into a large section of the issue, from the inside out, written by a former coke slamming neuroscientist. How much more could a reader honestly ask for?FIVE STARS (üåüX5) NOTE: Never Enough is not a self help book. And the author is not an expert in recovery. Additionally, she seems to lack important insight into how good therapy and sober social support can help. Lots of other good books for that. This book is only good for those interested in a clear explanation of the neuroscience, from a trustworthy source. So if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre after, consider yourself informed."
1,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32383826-kristy-k,4,"3.5 Stars An eye-opening and informative book about addiction and neuroscience. Written by an addict turned PhD recipient, there were great insights along with well-researched data. A lot of pieces of information I didn‚Äôt know and having Grisel‚Äôs personal experience interjected really helped flesh out the material. Addiction is a crippling and oft misunderstood mental illness that so many battle and it was good to see text that exposed the reality of addiction while not shaming those who suffer. Grisel covers alcoholism as well as a gamut of drugs, both legal and illegal. Not only does she detail effects of them she also explores the neurological response garnered from taking them. This is the perfect blend of science and memoir (leaning more toward the former) and I‚Äôd recommend to anyone interested in learning more about addiction or drugs in general. I received an advanced copy through Netgalley in return for an honest review."
2,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11820811-camelia-rose,5,"One quarter of memoir and three quarters of neuroscience, Never Enough: The Neuroscience and Experience of Addiction is by far the best popular science book about substance addiction I've read. The author Judith Grisel had been a heavy drug-addict. She started drinking alcohol at age of 13, took weed, cocaine and any drugs she could find, dropped out of university, worked odd jobs and committed petty crimes to feed her addiction, and did not stop abusing drugs until the age 23. After she sought treatment and later came off clean, she decided (naively) to ""cure addiction"". She spent 7 years to finish university, another 7 years to earn a PhD in Behavior Neuroscience and Psychology, and sober for 30 years since. This book is a collection of findings in neuroscience and her experience as a drug user. If you are, like me, not a professional in the field but interested in the physiological mechanism of how drugs work in human brain, why and how they become addictive, look no further. The addiction mechanism is articulated in the book: the A process and B process in brain functions, where A process the process initiated by mind alteration drugs and B process the brain's powerful way to counter-act. Drugs covered in the book:-- Alcohol-- THC (marijuana)-- Sedative drugs (sleeping pills) and other prescription drugs-- Narcotic drugs -- Stimulant (caffeine, nicotine, cocaine, etc...)-- Many other street drugsAmong all the substances discussed in the book:1. Caffeine is ok2. Psychedelic drugs of the narrow definition (including LSD, Psilocybin, DMT/Ayahuasca, Mescaline/ Peyote, not including MDMA, PCP or Ecstasy) are possibly ok, even beneficial under clinic settings3. I am especially interested in THC because of the legalization of marijuana. This is what I've learned:(1) THC is a very potent drug. It highlights your senses and can make mundane experience much more beautiful. The molecule can be found everywhere in the brain when smoking marijuana; its affect has something to do with CB1 receptor, and it works by alternating the signal/noise relationship in the brain.(2) THC is addictive, although it's less addictive than others(3) Its effect varies in different individuals, some may experience sleepiness or paranoia. Long term exposure may cause memory loss or psychosis.Chapter 10 ""Why Me"" discusses why some people are prone to addiction and some are not. The answer is scientists have some clues but they don't know for sure. Genetics, epigenetics and environmental influences all play a part, and the earlier you are exposed to drugs, the more likely you become a chronicle user. Is there a cure for addiction? The answer is no, not for the foreseeable time. What makes the cure of addiction nearly impossible is that the nature of all neuro activities is context-depending. What is reckless in one context, creative in another. The author disapproves War on Drugs, because it is useless in either preventing drugs or helping drug users to quit. ""Punishment seldom works"" on drug users. ""Recovery is an consequence of expansion, not restriction."""
3,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3493901-lindsay-nixon,2,"STOP, read Chasing the Scream: The First and Last Days of the War on Drugs if you want to learn about addiction/neurology re: addiction. and The Body Keeps the Score: Brain, Mind, and Body in the Healing of Trauma helps explain trauma (the root to most addiction) I have never been so disappointed by a book. It's a weird book in that it starts off as, and sometimes returns to being, a memoir of a junkie. The rest feels like a stale book report prepared by a High School student about various drugs or effects, almost as though it was lifted from wikipedia, except wikipedia goes into more depth. Have I mentioned I was sorely disappointed? What a bore. The audible is especially flat and terrible. I was so sure this would be my non-fiction of the year. When clients ask me if they are addicts or addicted to something I tell them #1, addiction is by self-diagnosis, but a test I use with myself often is ""will there ever be enough?"" I like to tell the story of a man who liked a sandwich so much he ordered another (this is from the AA book), or if one Tylenol works, why not take 2 so it works even better? With this very test being the NAME of the book I had the highest of hopes. Again, GOOD FOR HER but this book is a NOPE.I'm SO DISAPPOINTED."
4,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1045774-mehrsa,5,This is a great combination of research and memoir by someone who was both an addict and a scientist. I learned a lot from this. And I appreciate that she did not overplay her hand when it came to drugs like certain natural psychedelics where there is not a scientific consensus that they are harmful. She does make a very very compelling case about all the other drugs being addictive (to those who have addictive personalities) or otherwise have side effects. 
5,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7247217-henk-jan-van-der-klis,4,"After years of experience as drugs addict, Judith Grisel got sober and embraced the chance to scientifically study the mechanisms underneath addictive substances, and their consequences on¬†behavior. Never Enough: The Neuroscience and Experience of Addiction is her accessible and authoritative guide through a taxonomy of stimulants, depressants, uppers and downers, alcoholics, plants, liquids, pills, and needles.Addiction today is epidemic and catastrophic.¬†The personal and social consequences of this widespread and relentless urge are almost too large to grasp.¬†In the United States alone some 16 percent of the population aged twelve and above meet criteria for a substance use disorder.¬†In purely financial terms, it costs more than five times as much as AIDS and twice as much as cancer. The book highlights the current knowledge neuroscience has brought on this topic. How are substances transmitted into cells, synapses and influence behavior, central nerve system, and impact movements, speech, memory, fetus' health, etcetera? When any drug has an effect, it's due to the drug's chemical actions on brain structures. For most drugs of abuse, we know precisely which structures are modified, and this gives us a really good start to understand how they make us feel the way they do. Yet, there's still much we don't know yet.The bottom line in is this book is that there can never be enough drug. Because of the brain's tremendous capacity to adapt, it's impossible for a regular user to get high, and the best a voracious appetite for more drug can hope to accomplish is to stave off withdrawal. This situation is best recognized as a dead end, in the most literal sense. But to wait for a biomedical¬†or any outside cure is to miss asking questions of ourselves and considering our own role in the epidemic. While we are at it, instead of wringing our hands, we might try holding one another's."
6,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4943518-denise,3,"Reads more like a textbook which became a bit monotonous. I much prefer the book Dopesick by Beth Macy for a look at addiction, but it was interesting to hear the authors reflections on her own experience with drugs and addiction. This book would probably be more interesting for those who have only a small knowledge of addiction/drugs and the neuroscience behind it. Its a good introduction that includes the science and factual information on the subject that i find important, but still manageable for those who are not up to date on scientific jargon (though it does become a bit too flooded with jargon at times)."
7,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca,3,"(2.5) Judith Grisel first got drunk at age 13. From then until her early twenties, she was always seeking oblivion via one drug or another. There came a point when she was homeless and, while they were bingeing in a South Florida hotel room, her drug buddy remarked to her that there would never be enough cocaine for them. This served as a turning point: Grisel got clean, embarked on a PhD program in behavioral neuroscience, and for the past 20 years has been investigating the biological basis of addiction and the gender differences involved.Her book raises questions of nature, nurture and culture. Drugs function, Grisel explains, by altering our baseline. Drugs change the rates of biological functions and have inevitable side effects. Over time the nervous system adapts to counteract these effects and return to homeostasis. Drug use is only initially, and briefly, about seeking a high; from fairly early on, it instead becomes a matter of needing to take that drug to simply feel normal. Addiction is a mental illness, the author stresses, and substance abuse disorder affects 16% of the U.S. population, with a whopping 25% of deaths attributable to drug abuse.Grisel proceeds class by class through the various types of drugs, including alcohol, to explore how they affect the body. It‚Äôs difficult to decide who would be an ideal audience for her book. There is too much detail on biology and chemistry (including graphs and diagrams) for it to be suited to the average lay reader. And though I found Grisel‚Äôs experiences interesting, much of the general information about addiction was familiar to me from other books, such as The Recovering by Leslie Jamison, The Trip to Echo Spring by Olivia Laing, and Mayhem by Sigrid Rausing, as well as plenty of memoirs by former addicts. Perhaps if you haven‚Äôt read much about addiction, though, this will prove to be a valuable introduction."
8,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54717607-littlesophie,5,"That was a really informative and engaging book about the neurological implications and pecularities of addiction and specific drugs. The author mixes easy to follow scientific explanations with more colloquial musings about her own experience with addiction, which worked really well, I think, and prevented the book from ever feeling didactive.I really recommend this for an informed, sympathetic and emphatic view on the rising tide of addiction."
9,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23815648-susan,5,"This is not just another drunkalogue, but instead is a review of the way drugs affect our brains, down to specific neurotransmitters and receptor sites that I found fascinating reading. The author does relate some of her own drinking and drug use experience to establish her bona fides, but the most interesting part for me was the science and the way epigenetics may influence who becomes addicted and who doesn't."

11,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68824468-mel,3,"I had to really take my time with this one... Grisel proves her wisdom over and over, detailing the hows and whys of addiction specific to different drugs, but it missed the mark I was hoping it would land on in the end. I guess it's that I was hoping for more of a tell-all about this neuroscientist's own trial with addiction while she was much younger as she still lives to warn us nearly 30 years after getting sober, but instead it read mostly like a textbook. I was glad to have this information in one place, sporadically broken up (mostly in the very beginning and ending) by her insights and allusions to her experiences, but I was hoping for more of a literary bent. The note she ends on is really a good one though, pointing to the fact that we so often perceive addicts as ""them"" and instead of being the people those addicts need when they're at they're worst, we're quick to judge and lament how these people got themselves there on their own and should pull themselves up in the same way- but that is wholly the worst thing we, either the non-addicts or recovering addicts, could possibly do, and after all aren't we ALL just the same kind of human trying to make it through this life in one piece?"
12,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8066070-patrick-horgan,5,"Fascinating and engaging, this book did a wonderful job of helping me understand neuroscience as a whole, in particular how it relates to addiction. I appreciate that the author didn't dumb down any of the science, and explained it at an advanced level. I especially like how the author interwove her own experience in this book at just the right moments, keeping it engaging whenever it would start to become almost a tedious list of facts and studies. However, her own memories do not overpower the book, instead focusing mainly on the actual science.I first discovered this book when I heard the author interview on Fresh Air, and highly recommend giving that episode a listen to see if you'd be interested in the material of this book. The author has a low-key, soothing, and hypnotic voice, and she reads the audiobook which I highly recommend listening to."

The book is eminently readable for the lay person, even riveting at times, despite technical descriptions and jargon that require a little more focus. Autobiographical details are included, but this book is not an addiction memoir. Examples from Grisel‚Äôs own experiences serve to add depth to what is a precise and clear-eyed look at both the way addictive substances interact with the brain as well as how cultural and individual experiences create, affect, and complicate a person‚Äôs lifetime potential for addiction. - Anja P."
14,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85938927-kari,5,"Incredibly informative and insightful investigation of addiction from the perspective of a recovering addict and neuroscientist. I enjoyed Grisel's ability to put the isolation of addiction into context with social movements and the rise of capitalism. Addiction is a personal, social, neuroscientific, and public health issue. She wove in all of the intertwining factors beautifully and in an entertaining way. Highly recommend this book to anyone as the drug crisis is more urgent than ever. "
15,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2118933-leo-walsh,4,"NEVER ENOUGH by Judith Grisel is a really good book about drugs and drug abuse. The first and best part of the book are when Grisel, a one-time drug addict, goes through the maddening, trying life of an addict. Hailing from a solid middle-class upbringing, she soon found herself homeless. And the title of the book comes from an anecdote from this time in her life. She and a friend were running through heroic amounts of cocaine that they'd scored in a shady deal, and her friend looked to her saying that despite how flush they were now, there would ""never be enough"" cocaine in the world. Grisel freed herself. Her friend did not. Many of her friends from this point in her life died, but lucky for her, she had supportive, relatively affluent middle-class parents who sent her through a real, therapeutic rehab. Once she was clean, she returned to college, earning a Ph.D. in neurobiology, specializing in addiction. Due to her experience and education, she is in unique position to comment on drug policy. And she makes it clear that punishment will not work. Addicts, indeed, may become addicts in part because they like punishment, she implies. The second part of the book (about 60-70% of its length) is a basic textbook of addictive substances. From pot to opiates to stimulants, etc., all classes of drugs are covered. The focus is on straight-forward science of how these chemicals ""hijack"" the human brain. The core insight of this section is her assertion that EVERY drug brings about its opposite as the brain tries to right itself. And thus, leads to a life that's often the exact opposite of what a person's aim was in taking the illicit drug in the first place. For instance, people start opiates for the euphoria it brings, but once addicted find themselves always in pain and needing another hit just to feel normal. And people start smoking cannabis because it intensifies everything, making tastes, sounds, and colors more vivid, which makes one more artistic and creative, yet daily users are often catatonic and find themselves working dull jobs, needed a joint to just feel normal. Indeed, this biochemical compensation is why addicts get addicted. All told, a good book. It's really closer to a 3.5-star book, because the encyclopedic catalog section gets sort of dull and repetitive, but the information is good and insights spot-on, about what you;d expect of a respected scientist. So I can easily round this up to 4-stars. "
16,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5722821-sara-gray,4,"This was a fairly easy to understand explanation of the neuroscience behind how particular classes of addictive (and in the case of psychedelics, non-addictive) drugs work on the brain, and why they are addictive in the first place. This made me soberly (hah) look at my cannabis usage and see what aspects of my use are problematic, and it really helped me understand some aspects of my experience of alcohol. "
17,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59817380-yelena-dubovaya,5,"really really enjoyed this book! Part memoir and part neuroscience textbook - the fact that the author is a former addict really helps to shape her views and give her a more pragmatic approach to the experiences of doing certain drugs and their appeal, rather than listening to an academic who can only understand drugs in theory. This book opened my eyes to addiction, and to what it really means to ""have an addictive personality"" (which I formerly thought was just a cop-out for addiction). Grisel really delves into opponent process theory and helps you understand how substances affect the brain and behavior - and describes the neuroscience of it all in a very engaging way. I've always been interested in how drugs affect the brain and have done my fair share of reading on the topic, but she was able to present things in a new light.Overall, really impressed with this book. Highly recommend. "
18,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4045645-connie-hall,5,"Utterly fascinating. As a sober/clean person for many years now, I loved her succinct explanation of each class of drugs and how they work and then stop working. I thought that I was pretty well versed in this area, but found myself learning a lot. I highly recommend!"
19,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91825668-caroline-miller,1,This was a bit too much science talk for me and kinda all for nothing. Basically an addict can never get enough of their preferred drug and there's no cure. The end.
20,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5806448-vy,5,"This is an excellent book that delves into the different facets of addiction. It tackles the biological and psychological aspects of addiction. It also dispels the myths and preconceived notions that people may have around this topic. I feel like this is an important topic and I'm glad she talked about it. Often times, we hear that a weak character is the root cause of addiction and this myth is constantly being propelled even though it is detrimental to those who do suffer from addiction. It limits their prospect and can often lead to forced surgeries/cures because they are viewed as unsuitable for job/housing opportunities and unable to make rational decisions for themselves. The author also went into detail about each category of drugs and discusses the major differences/similarities between the different categorizations that exist. With the neurological impact discussed, it becomes easier to see why some drugs are more addicting than others and why many people can have vastly different experiences with the same drug. The book mentioned the societal context that surrounds each type of drug - why it rose and decline in popularity over the different eras. I found these historical snippets very fascinating and I'm glad the author included it in the book. There were a few reasons listed about why are some people more susceptible to becoming addicts. Ultimately, I believe she mentioned that it's not exactly a single ""You are going to be an addict"". Instead, it's more or less a percentage statically speaking of how likely you are to develop an addiction. This is due to the fact that addiction is not solely based on DNA and our genes. (We apparently we have half the number of genes as the average potato, which isn't very reassuring). It is based in the way our genes interact with one another (how it is expressed aka epigenetics), our environment (something as small as a bad day at school one day), our ancestors (their traumas are actually embedded in our bodies which is one of the major reasons why alcoholism is incredibly rampant in Native American populations where generations of systematic oppression, limited opportunities, genocide, etc occurred in one's community), and our prospects in life.In the end, the author also dedicates a small snippet to address how addiction can be solved. However, this section was only a couple of pages long. After all, the simple answer is with the lack of knowledge that we currently have on the topic of addiction, it does not have a simple solution and people are never truly cured. This book deserves a 5/5 star for me because it just felt like a wealth of knowledge. I felt like the book took me all the different components that go into addiction and the amount of time and effort that went into this book cannot be applauded enough. I loved the way the book tied everything in together in an accessible easy-to-understand way. While the book is heavy with complex jargon at times, the author does a wonderful job of breaking down the concepts so that readers could understand. She balances out these sections with snippets of her own experiences as a former addict. I think this works out very well in the overall layout of the book.I ended up with a long list of notes and highlights. Since I don't want to get sued, I will list only one of the major takeaways I took from this book: * Our body tries to constantly maintain homeostasis* Drugs can produce a high that takes us from our baseline of homeostasis* Our bodies produce chemicals that is opposite of that particular high to counteract it and bring us back to homeostasis* When the downing chemicals outlast the highs or when the body anticipates those highs and produces downing chemicals (but the highs never come), that's when we experience withdrawals and cravings.* This is why withdrawals and craving symptoms often are the polar opposites of the highs that the drug produces. For example, a drug that makes us feel relaxes and at ease makes you feel anxious and stressed during a state of withdrawal."
21,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38699564-nicole-westen,4,"I found this book fascinating. It really delves into how the brain is affected by drugs on a biological level, and how it fights back, so to speak. There is a kind of chemical equilibrium in the brain, and anything that messes with that equilibrium is countered. An apt example used by the author is how if you get too hot, your body sweats, and if you get too cold, you shiver; basically your body is trying to get you back into it's set temperature range. Your brain does that too, which helps explain withdrawal. I mostly read this book for the chapter on Stimulants, ie Nicotine, to help my mother, who is trying to quit smoking. While I definitely learned a lot, there wasn't anything hard and fast that I could implement right away to help. But this book was still and incredibly formative read without being too 'textbook-y'. Technical explanations were coupled with an analogy to help with the visualization of the process that the author is describing. The one thing I really took away from this is that what we know about our brains is only an iota of what our brains actually do, which is why I'm pretty strongly against the whole silicon valley idea of installing computers directly into our brains. We don't even know how the hell our brains work, so how can we know that plugging a computer into it won't screw something up?"
22,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56863096-jeremy,4,"I enjoyed this book from a certain perspective, that being her anecdotal experience and certain parts of the science. Overall this book isn't strong on the scientific aspect of addiction, but I would say she does a decent job of explaining it on a shallow level. I am not a person with an addictive predilection, and I don't have much experience with people who are hard core addicts. So some of this was new to me, but may not be new to others.I thought the overall point is a strong one, that there is never enough [insert mind altering drug here]. Your body tries to counteract a drug as soon as it hits. Over time, you need more and more of the drug to feel the same. This is a never-ending road - there will never be enough to satisfy you. On a more benign level, this is how many people are with coffee. Some people need coffee to wake up and feel normal. This is because they drink coffee - their body gets used to the caffeine and can't operate without it.There is still so much we don't know about addiction. She shared some interesting information about drug use by future parents affecting, perhaps epigenetically, their future children, perhaps causing them to be slightly more prone to addiction. There certainly seems to be a genetic component. And the earlier you start, the changes to an adolescent's brain from drug use can lead to many brain development problems, and continued addiction problems.I can't help but think about my kids as they get to the age of potential drug use - listening to people like the author's experience, and the potential never ending pit of drug addiction."
23,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6189969-ivo-temelkov,4,"Fascinating book! It explores personal stories of addiction along with solid neuroscience in a successful attempt to convey to the general public the bitter irony of drug abuse - what comes up, must come down and will never get as high again. It doesn't quite get that fifth star though because of her one-sided point of view, ignoring research in favor of her bias and some subtle unexplained contradictions. For example, Grisel claims the brain reacts to all psychoactive drugs by producing the opposite effect (3rd law), however, when one gets to the chapter for psychedelics, one reads nothing but praise for these substances. Where's the ""b process"" for them? Not explained, in fact, one walks out of this thinking there aren't any side effects to psychedelics at all. Either the 3rd law doesn't hold true for all drugs or she can't explain it for psychs. Also, it's not quite clear where she falls on cannabis legalization - on one hand, she says the drug war doesn't work, on the other hand, she advocates cation regarding legalization. I agree both can be valid but it's not quite clear.But this is just nit picking. The book is great, I recommend it to everyone who want to truly understand why drugs suck. "
24,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31365952-saige,4,"This was an incredibly unique read because the author has so much first hand experience with the drugs and addicts that she is writing about. I was interested to hear her thoughts on why certain drugs made her feel specific ways, and she did a great job of integrating her own stories with the neurochemistry of addiction. I was worried her parts would become something of a pity party, or a simple ""don't do drugs"" kind of lecture. It wasn't. Grisel had layers of nuance and emotion running through her story, and always the things she shared were relevant and intriguing. The only reason I didn't give this book five stars is that sometimes the explanations suffered from lack of a point. I would feel like she was going somewhere or building up to something, but right when the paragraph came where I was expecting the punch line, she switched topics.

Grisel grasps your hand at the beginning of each chapter to make a good impression and offer deep-cut philosophical theory, then drops it to turn to a chalkboard filled with neurocogitive stats, only to turn around, snapping to get your attention, and luring you partway back in with another personal reference."

There are some experiences I‚Äôve had that others have tried to invalidate. It is at this junction‚Äîdisbelief and relief when someone sees this‚Äîthat I meet the author. Even having someone else lost at sea can feel like safety because you know you‚Äôre no longer alone. Grisel opens herself up and in straightforward and frank tones tells us about times she hurt family, stole, and lied in order to buy or use drugs. She also tells us about looking out on choppy waters waiting for some kind of life saver. There is no life saver but there are lighthouses that are trying to find a way back to shore. This is where the science and research comes in. Along with the compassion that is difficult yet required in order for people to find a way through addiction.

Admittedly I didn‚Äôt always understand the neuroscience she was describing, I did however walk away with a better comprehension of the opponent process theory and understanding of drug and alcohol addiction. She touches both on legal (proscription drugs, alcohol, caffeine) and illegal drugs. I especially loved the last chapter and how important love and connection are even though it is easier to walk away from someone with a substance abuse problem, that will never help them.Found the science on marijuana in chapter 10 or 11 really important now considering the states in which it is a legal substance for anyone. That due to the opponent process theory, depression and other problems are increased in marijuana users is an important finding to hear from a neuroscientist."

53,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86576157-minervas-owl,4,"As a drug addict turned neuroscientist, Judith Grisel teaches the science of addiction while telling her personal redemption story. The book is intriguing from the beginning to the end. Judith introduces Richard Solomon's opponent-process theory as a unified explanation of addiction. According to this theory, our brain always adapts to a stimulus by creating an opponent process. That's why skydivers feel exhilarated after landing. In the case of drug use, the longer and more frequent the use, the stronger and long-lasting the counterbalancing effect the brain produces. Over time, this opposite effect not only makes the drug less effective, but also leads to withdrawal symptoms and craving. In the end, drug abusers no longer use to get high, but merely to escape from the agony of withdrawal.  The author's explanation of the theory is clear. I find the two graphs of the a/b process (what the drug does to the brain/brain's opponent response) especially illustrative and self-explanatory. I can understand why Judith claims they are on her shortlist of tattoo design. Nevertheless, when I found the theory was proposed in 1974, I was a bit disappointed that the book did not introduce the more recent development of the theory. Nor did the author introduce other hypotheses on addiction, such as incentive sensitization, which claims repeated exposure to drugs leads to wanting independent of liking. Each subsequent chapter then introduces the chemistry and physiology of an individual category of substance: cannabinoids, opiates, alcohol, tranquilizers, stimulants, psychedelics, and others. Judith's vivid description of her own drug use experience makes her scientific reports convincing and mesmerizing. She also makes good use of analogy and comparison. For example, she mentions alcohol acts like a sledgehammer, affecting so many functions of the brain, while cocaine acts like a laser, stimulating with the fewest side effects. It's much harder to pin down the neurological effects of alcohol than cocaine, she says, because the molecule of alcohol is much smaller and structurally simpler, and ""there are many more places to park a skateboard than an airplane."" Notwithstanding, sometimes, empirical facts such as stereotypy are laid out unexplained, and scientific discoveries scattered and unorganized. Half of my interest in this book stemmed from a sinful wish to know how ""interesting"" various drugs are; my thirst was quenched. Sometimes Judith almost talks about drugs with nostalgia, such as how she used to spend hours stoned on the beach, searching for shells and listening to waves, enjoying every sense of hers enriched by weed. But the more important lesson I learned from the book is why addiction is bad. The drug experience, no matter it's euphoria or tranquility, always dies out over time, driving one into a search in vain of lost joy. Moreover, addiction strips you of choice, making you the worst enemy of yourself. I've never tried drugs, but the lesson is relevant. The threat lies in not only chemicals but also the internet, smartphone, food, game, and others. Drug addiction, as the extreme case of obsession, makes me reevaluate the consequences of being hooked."

55,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67837453-travis-lupick,3,"This is not a review but is based on an interview I had with the author. It was originally published in the Georgia Straight newspaper.Judith Grisel enjoyed using drugs. Cannabis, especially.‚ÄúIn many ways my relationship with the drug was among the purest and most wonderful relationships of my life,‚Äù she writes in Never Enough: The Neuroscience and Experience of Addiction (Doubleday, February 2019). ‚ÄúFrom the first time I got high until long after I‚Äôd smoked my last bowl, I loved the drug like a best friend.‚ÄùThe behavioral neuroscientist and professor of psychology at Pennsylvania‚Äôs Bucknell University also once had an intense love-hate relationship with cocaine, and pretty much any mind-altering substance within reach.It‚Äôs been three decades since she stopped using drugs, save for her daily use of the coffee bean. But Grisel concedes she sometimes misses them, and still sees potential benefits in the occasional use of certain substances; psychedelics, primarily, which she notes new research suggests may help some people with mental-health issues such as PTSD.And so, Grisel told the Straight, in that regard, it‚Äôs a sad story she tells in Never Enough. It turns out that mind-altering drugs simply aren‚Äôt good for you, cannabis included.‚ÄúUsing drugs to change the way we think, feel, and behave, is ancient and universal,‚Äù Grisel says in a telephone interview. ‚ÄúI do think that, not only is it natural, but that there are some benefits. I might have not survived my childhood without all that weed, now that I think about it. So I‚Äôm not against it. But I do think that addiction takes all the fun out of it, and that there are consequences for people, their families, and society.‚ÄùGrisel sought an education and then a career in neuroscience because of her addiction to drugs. The book recounts how she entered the field with the goal of finding a ‚Äúcure‚Äù.‚ÄúI thought that if I could find the cellular switch that flipped somewhere between my third and my fourth drinks, or each time a promising bag was within my sight, and then find a way to keep this switch in the ‚Äòoff‚Äô position, I might be able to refrain from‚Ä¶spending all my tips on very temporary thrills, or making blacked-out road trips to Dallas,‚Äù she writes.Nearly three decades into her search, Grisel writes that she‚Äôs learned the problem is not so much the drugs, per se, but rather the human brain‚Äôs powerful ability to respond to the altered chemistry that drugs produce.‚ÄúThere will never be enough drug, because the brain‚Äôs capacity to learn and adapt is basically infinite,‚Äù reads Never Enough. ‚ÄúWhat was once a normal state punctuated by periods of high inexorably transforms to a state of desperation that is only temporarily subdued.‚ÄùWhile a cure for addiction remains elusive, there‚Äôs never been a more urgent need to pursue the question.Opioids alone killed nearly 4,000 people across Canada in 2017, up from roughly 3,000 the previous year, according to Health Canada. In the United States, 47,600 people died after taking opioids in 2017, up from 42,400 in 2016, according to the U.S. National Institute on Drug Use. It‚Äôs one of the worst health crises the continent has ever experienced, and there‚Äôs no end in sight.With a tidy writing structure that weaves personal anecdotes alongside accessible science, Never Enough describes how the brain of someone addicted to drugs changes as the time they struggle with their drug use drags on.The book focuses on neurochemistry, but Grisel emphasizes that addiction is generally the result of a combination of genetic predisposition, developmental influences, and environmental input.‚ÄúSince the beginning of when we‚Äôve kept records, people have been using drugs to change the way they feel. So what‚Äôs different? Why do we have so much addiction now?‚Äù Grisel asks. ‚ÄúIsolation. Generally, in our distant history, it [drug use] was a communal activity, with spiritual or at least cultural overtones. It was something people did together. So using alone [is what‚Äôs different].‚ÄùGrisel‚Äôs measured take on drugs means it‚Äôs not all bad news for everyone who enjoys a little help to keep the party going.‚ÄúTo the banker who uses cocaine once every four-to-six weeks, I would say, ‚ÄòGood for you‚Äô. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs so terrible,‚Äù Grisel says. ‚ÄúIf you are one of these rare individuals that really does well with moderation‚Äîand that does sound pretty moderate if you‚Äôre just doing a little coke‚Äîya, I think that is all right.‚ÄùThe problem is that for so many people, the brain‚Äôs adaptive nature makes moderation so difficult.‚ÄúLuxuries become habits, habits become compulsions, and compulsions become addictions,‚Äù Grisel says.In addition to the imperative of moderation, the other major piece of advice that Grisel offers in Never Enough is for kids to stay away from drugs. It‚Äôs not a ‚ÄúJust say no‚Äù message she‚Äôs borrowed from the DARE program. There are very real reasons to wait, she explains.‚ÄúUntil you are 25, the brain is still being organized,‚Äù Grisel says. ‚ÄúSo if you perturb it while it is still being organized‚Äîduring development‚Äîthen it alters the organizational structure. Whereas if the basic scaffolding is all laid down, once the pathways are all basically set‚Äîwhich they are sometime between 23 and 25‚Äîthen you are more-likely to be able to undo it [changes to the brain made by using drugs].‚ÄùNever Enough also includes lessons that apply to the war on drugs and which can inform North America‚Äôs response to the opioid epidemic. For example, Grisel says, it‚Äôs time for an honest assessment of criminalization.‚ÄúIf punishment worked, surely we would see diminishing numbers of addicts, and we don‚Äôt. We see more and more,‚Äù Grisel says. ‚ÄúI think it is alienating, to say to people, ‚ÄòYou are bad and you‚Äôve got to not be bad and we‚Äôre going to help you not be bad by doing bad things to you‚Äô.‚ÄùThe same sort of logical evaluation led her to support harm reduction at a time when the Ontario government and states such as Washington, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts are debating the merits of supervised-injection facilities like Vancouver‚Äôs Insite.‚ÄúI think supervised injection is a great idea, because I don‚Äôt think punishment works,‚Äù Grisel says. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it condones using. It is just trying to say, ‚ÄòHere‚Äôs a safe place‚Äô.‚ÄúWe should use every strategy we can to support people to be healthy,‚Äù Grisel continues. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like we‚Äôre going to teach people not to use by letting them die. That won‚Äôt work.‚Äù"
56,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57980946-sarah-bradley,5,"I'm always tentative to read books about neuroscience. Having studied the subject in college, usually mainstream books about neuroscience are too watered down and I feel as though I'm not really learning much. This book was the perfect balance between presenting the topic of addiction in a way that made sense to a naive reader, but was still engaging for people already familiar with the subject. I also really appreciated Grisel's own personal journey with addiction. By weaving together her narrative with the more scientific descriptions of drugs/drug use, the book was not only accessible to a wide range of readers, but was also extremely engaging. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone curious about the widespread epidemic of addiction that our world currently faces. "
57,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4952371-polly,4,"A compelling, important read offering a uniquely new perspective of addiction."
58,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58281897-david-elliott,4,"A strange book that‚Äôs not 100% convinced of its reason to exist, but is still fascinating and often moving. Grisel is ultimately pessimistic about the potential of modern neuroscience to prevent or ‚Äòcure‚Äô addiction. In her telling, drugs are an escape from alienation, and addiction an inevitable consequence of drug abuse - so the only way to get rid of addiction is to promote connection. ‚ÄúOf course biology is involved!‚Äù she writes in the final chapter. ‚ÄúBut the insistence on starting and ending within an addict‚Äôs head is not only misguided but insidious.‚Äù It‚Äôs a weird sentence to read after 200 pages of insightful, expert commentary on what goes on inside addicts‚Äô heads.And you do learn a lot! Grisel equips you with simple but powerful intellectual tools to understand the fundamental processes underlying addiction. Her introduction to the Opponent-Process model, a unifying thread in the book, is crystal clear, and was for me an a-ha moment in how it brought together tolerance and withdrawal as two sides of the same coin. Subsequent chapters examine different drug families in turn - opiates, alcohol, tranquilizers, stimulants, psychedelics. There‚Äôs enough that unites each drug family to keep you on board, and enough that‚Äôs different to keep you interested. Two chapters on risk factors (super interesting) and ‚ÄòSolving Addiction‚Äô (less so) round things off. It‚Äôs a short book, but a dense one.Grisel‚Äôs writing style is by turns aggressively pulpy (cocaine is ‚Äúthe sole porn shop in a down and out town‚Äù) and drily technical. The endless roll-call of neurotransmitters, agonists, receptors and transporters can read a little like a Wikipedia article. But colour comes by way of anecdotes from her own experience as an abuser of any drugs she could get her hands on. Grisel‚Äôs account of these times are stony-eyed and unsentimental in a way that feels typical of the recovering addict. There‚Äôs something cold and admirable about the way she mines the darkest moments of her past for examples of particular psychopharmacological mechanisms and phenomena. It‚Äôs like watching someone test a vaccine on themselves. Something I appreciated about her telling of these cautionary tales was how consistently she humanises her fellow addicts. There‚Äôs something valuable in seeing a distinguished academic refer to other addicts as her friends. She doesn‚Äôt romanticise these relationships in any way; in fact she never misses a chance to remind the reader of how quickly the addict will throw his friends under the bus if an opportunity to score presents itself. But this is always framed as a condemnation of the drug, not the person who has been made its prisoner. Many of her friends were not able to turn their life around in the same way that Grisel did and it often was the end of them. If you have a soft spot for any drug, chances are you will find disillusionment within these pages. I found the section/lament on MDMA/ecstasy particularly sobering. I‚Äôve had profound experiences with MDMA before. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not alone among MDMA users in once upon a time thinking that it was a drug that could change the world for the better. But, for all her acknowledgment of how universally positive the subjective experience of the MDMA high is, Grisel doesn‚Äôt hold back in describing the lasting neurological damage it does. No drug really comes out of this book looking particularly good. The one exception is, you may have guessed, psychedelics. Grisel is cautiously optimistic about LSD, psilocybin, DMT and the like, and she clearly leaves the door open to maybe, possibly one day trying them again herself.She‚Äôs less convincing on the few occasions when she strays out of her area of scientific expertise and into the political, legal and economic debates around the place of drugs in society and what could or should be the state‚Äôs disposition towards them. When discussing ephedra, a plant-based stimulant that can cause adverse reactions in users, she notes that the supplement industry invested heavily in a campaign to persuade the regulators that ephedra was safe and therefore should not be classified - but ‚Äúeventually, science prevailed and ephedra-containing dietary supplements were made illegal in the United States.‚Äù The casual equation ‚Äòdangerous‚Äô = ‚Äòshould be made illegal‚Äô isn‚Äôt examined. If ‚Äòscience prevailing‚Äô is the same War on Drugs that she notes a couple of chapters later was an unmitigated failure, science may have some things to answer for.But all in all Never Enough is definitely worth a read, especially as a critical counterpoint to the legalisation and harm reduction literature. One last note - this is 100% about addiction to drugs. I came to Never Enough with vague ideas about how my addiction to rolling news content and Twitter might be fuelling my anxiety. Might addiction be a valuable model for understanding other damaging behaviours? Maybe, but not here. Grisel limits herself to talking about the action of drugs on the brain. I think the book is probably stronger for it."
59,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2587406-elk,0,"Though plausible, I should mention that an elegant hypothesis is no substitute for definitive data. As time has passed we have learned that everything from the bacteria in our guts to the interactions we had in middle school partly determines our behavior. In fact, it's beginning to seem that the brain is more like a stage for a life to be acted out upon than like the director behind a curtain calling shots. _____Because we encounter an ever-variable environment as we go about our day, if our neural activity simply reflected all of this input, like the ocean in the midst of a storm, then the tossed pebble, or even a boulder, could have no perceptible impact. In neuro-parlance, the ratio of signal to noise would be too low. In order for a stimulus to be detected, let alone interpreted as meaningful, the neural signal must be greater than the background noise--or the noise must be quashed.The fundamental role of the brain is to be a contrast detector.

They proposed that any feeling, including good, bad, happy, depressed, or excited, for example, represents a disruption of the stable feeling state that we perceive as neutral.

More than ever before in our evolutionary history, we possess a keen awareness of widespread tragedy and suffering in the world. This is the painful context in which our attempts to avert and deny the burden of consciousness have grown more and more desperate and widespread._____So who‚Äôs to blame for the epidemic of addiction? The truth is no one is to blame, but we are all responsible. Though any search for for a cause (or a cure) is bound to fall short, one source of this epidemic is our unwillingness to bear our own pain, along with our failure to look upon the suffering of others with compassion... The history of every science begins with the individual and progresses to the connected collective. Botany began by cataloging specimens and now understands the health of any species depends on an ecological landscape. _____Together we nourish the epidemic of addiction by espousing false dichotomies like ""us"" versus ""them"" or ""well"" versus ""sick."" In doing so, we embrace the myth that happiness can be persued at the individual level, and therefore perpetuate a culture of isolation and alienation...Though there is still much to learn in and out of laboratory settings, we have enough cumulative data to recognize that we/our brains are shaped and constrained by much, much more than our individual biology. And of all of these influences, perhaps the most immediate and impactful, and therefore potentially helpful for realizing change, are our connections with each other. We affect each other, including each other's neurobiology, neurochemistry, and behavior, in ways that are direct and profound. As we grapple to respond to the growing population of addicts, we'd do well to recognize that disordered use comes from, thrives in, and creates alienation."

83,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86576157-minervas-owl,4,"As a drug addict turned neuroscientist, Judith Grisel teaches the science of addiction while telling her personal redemption story. The book is intriguing from the beginning to the end. Judith introduces Richard Solomon's opponent-process theory as a unified explanation of addiction. According to this theory, our brain always adapts to a stimulus by creating an opponent process. That's why skydivers feel exhilarated after landing. In the case of drug use, the longer and more frequent the use, the stronger and long-lasting the counterbalancing effect the brain produces. Over time, this opposite effect not only makes the drug less effective, but also leads to withdrawal symptoms and craving. In the end, drug abusers no longer use to get high, but merely to escape from the agony of withdrawal.  The author's explanation of the theory is clear. I find the two graphs of the a/b process (what the drug does to the brain/brain's opponent response) especially illustrative and self-explanatory. I can understand why Judith claims they are on her shortlist of tattoo design. Nevertheless, when I found the theory was proposed in 1974, I was a bit disappointed that the book did not introduce the more recent development of the theory. Nor did the author introduce other hypotheses on addiction, such as incentive sensitization, which claims repeated exposure to drugs leads to wanting independent of liking. Each subsequent chapter then introduces the chemistry and physiology of an individual category of substance: cannabinoids, opiates, alcohol, tranquilizers, stimulants, psychedelics, and others. Judith's vivid description of her own drug use experience makes her scientific reports convincing and mesmerizing. She also makes good use of analogy and comparison. For example, she mentions alcohol acts like a sledgehammer, affecting so many functions of the brain, while cocaine acts like a laser, stimulating with the fewest side effects. It's much harder to pin down the neurological effects of alcohol than cocaine, she says, because the molecule of alcohol is much smaller and structurally simpler, and ""there are many more places to park a skateboard than an airplane."" Notwithstanding, sometimes, empirical facts such as stereotypy are laid out unexplained, and scientific discoveries scattered and unorganized. Half of my interest in this book stemmed from a sinful wish to know how ""interesting"" various drugs are; my thirst was quenched. Sometimes Judith almost talks about drugs with nostalgia, such as how she used to spend hours stoned on the beach, searching for shells and listening to waves, enjoying every sense of hers enriched by weed. But the more important lesson I learned from the book is why addiction is bad. The drug experience, no matter it's euphoria or tranquility, always dies out over time, driving one into a search in vain of lost joy. Moreover, addiction strips you of choice, making you the worst enemy of yourself. I've never tried drugs, but the lesson is relevant. The threat lies in not only chemicals but also the internet, smartphone, food, game, and others. Drug addiction, as the extreme case of obsession, makes me reevaluate the consequences of being hooked."

85,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67837453-travis-lupick,3,"This is not a review but is based on an interview I had with the author. It was originally published in the Georgia Straight newspaper.Judith Grisel enjoyed using drugs. Cannabis, especially.‚ÄúIn many ways my relationship with the drug was among the purest and most wonderful relationships of my life,‚Äù she writes in Never Enough: The Neuroscience and Experience of Addiction (Doubleday, February 2019). ‚ÄúFrom the first time I got high until long after I‚Äôd smoked my last bowl, I loved the drug like a best friend.‚ÄùThe behavioral neuroscientist and professor of psychology at Pennsylvania‚Äôs Bucknell University also once had an intense love-hate relationship with cocaine, and pretty much any mind-altering substance within reach.It‚Äôs been three decades since she stopped using drugs, save for her daily use of the coffee bean. But Grisel concedes she sometimes misses them, and still sees potential benefits in the occasional use of certain substances; psychedelics, primarily, which she notes new research suggests may help some people with mental-health issues such as PTSD.And so, Grisel told the Straight, in that regard, it‚Äôs a sad story she tells in Never Enough. It turns out that mind-altering drugs simply aren‚Äôt good for you, cannabis included.‚ÄúUsing drugs to change the way we think, feel, and behave, is ancient and universal,‚Äù Grisel says in a telephone interview. ‚ÄúI do think that, not only is it natural, but that there are some benefits. I might have not survived my childhood without all that weed, now that I think about it. So I‚Äôm not against it. But I do think that addiction takes all the fun out of it, and that there are consequences for people, their families, and society.‚ÄùGrisel sought an education and then a career in neuroscience because of her addiction to drugs. The book recounts how she entered the field with the goal of finding a ‚Äúcure‚Äù.‚ÄúI thought that if I could find the cellular switch that flipped somewhere between my third and my fourth drinks, or each time a promising bag was within my sight, and then find a way to keep this switch in the ‚Äòoff‚Äô position, I might be able to refrain from‚Ä¶spending all my tips on very temporary thrills, or making blacked-out road trips to Dallas,‚Äù she writes.Nearly three decades into her search, Grisel writes that she‚Äôs learned the problem is not so much the drugs, per se, but rather the human brain‚Äôs powerful ability to respond to the altered chemistry that drugs produce.‚ÄúThere will never be enough drug, because the brain‚Äôs capacity to learn and adapt is basically infinite,‚Äù reads Never Enough. ‚ÄúWhat was once a normal state punctuated by periods of high inexorably transforms to a state of desperation that is only temporarily subdued.‚ÄùWhile a cure for addiction remains elusive, there‚Äôs never been a more urgent need to pursue the question.Opioids alone killed nearly 4,000 people across Canada in 2017, up from roughly 3,000 the previous year, according to Health Canada. In the United States, 47,600 people died after taking opioids in 2017, up from 42,400 in 2016, according to the U.S. National Institute on Drug Use. It‚Äôs one of the worst health crises the continent has ever experienced, and there‚Äôs no end in sight.With a tidy writing structure that weaves personal anecdotes alongside accessible science, Never Enough describes how the brain of someone addicted to drugs changes as the time they struggle with their drug use drags on.The book focuses on neurochemistry, but Grisel emphasizes that addiction is generally the result of a combination of genetic predisposition, developmental influences, and environmental input.‚ÄúSince the beginning of when we‚Äôve kept records, people have been using drugs to change the way they feel. So what‚Äôs different? Why do we have so much addiction now?‚Äù Grisel asks. ‚ÄúIsolation. Generally, in our distant history, it [drug use] was a communal activity, with spiritual or at least cultural overtones. It was something people did together. So using alone [is what‚Äôs different].‚ÄùGrisel‚Äôs measured take on drugs means it‚Äôs not all bad news for everyone who enjoys a little help to keep the party going.‚ÄúTo the banker who uses cocaine once every four-to-six weeks, I would say, ‚ÄòGood for you‚Äô. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs so terrible,‚Äù Grisel says. ‚ÄúIf you are one of these rare individuals that really does well with moderation‚Äîand that does sound pretty moderate if you‚Äôre just doing a little coke‚Äîya, I think that is all right.‚ÄùThe problem is that for so many people, the brain‚Äôs adaptive nature makes moderation so difficult.‚ÄúLuxuries become habits, habits become compulsions, and compulsions become addictions,‚Äù Grisel says.In addition to the imperative of moderation, the other major piece of advice that Grisel offers in Never Enough is for kids to stay away from drugs. It‚Äôs not a ‚ÄúJust say no‚Äù message she‚Äôs borrowed from the DARE program. There are very real reasons to wait, she explains.‚ÄúUntil you are 25, the brain is still being organized,‚Äù Grisel says. ‚ÄúSo if you perturb it while it is still being organized‚Äîduring development‚Äîthen it alters the organizational structure. Whereas if the basic scaffolding is all laid down, once the pathways are all basically set‚Äîwhich they are sometime between 23 and 25‚Äîthen you are more-likely to be able to undo it [changes to the brain made by using drugs].‚ÄùNever Enough also includes lessons that apply to the war on drugs and which can inform North America‚Äôs response to the opioid epidemic. For example, Grisel says, it‚Äôs time for an honest assessment of criminalization.‚ÄúIf punishment worked, surely we would see diminishing numbers of addicts, and we don‚Äôt. We see more and more,‚Äù Grisel says. ‚ÄúI think it is alienating, to say to people, ‚ÄòYou are bad and you‚Äôve got to not be bad and we‚Äôre going to help you not be bad by doing bad things to you‚Äô.‚ÄùThe same sort of logical evaluation led her to support harm reduction at a time when the Ontario government and states such as Washington, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts are debating the merits of supervised-injection facilities like Vancouver‚Äôs Insite.‚ÄúI think supervised injection is a great idea, because I don‚Äôt think punishment works,‚Äù Grisel says. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it condones using. It is just trying to say, ‚ÄòHere‚Äôs a safe place‚Äô.‚ÄúWe should use every strategy we can to support people to be healthy,‚Äù Grisel continues. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like we‚Äôre going to teach people not to use by letting them die. That won‚Äôt work.‚Äù"
86,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57980946-sarah-bradley,5,"I'm always tentative to read books about neuroscience. Having studied the subject in college, usually mainstream books about neuroscience are too watered down and I feel as though I'm not really learning much. This book was the perfect balance between presenting the topic of addiction in a way that made sense to a naive reader, but was still engaging for people already familiar with the subject. I also really appreciated Grisel's own personal journey with addiction. By weaving together her narrative with the more scientific descriptions of drugs/drug use, the book was not only accessible to a wide range of readers, but was also extremely engaging. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone curious about the widespread epidemic of addiction that our world currently faces. "
87,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4952371-polly,4,"A compelling, important read offering a uniquely new perspective of addiction."
88,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58281897-david-elliott,4,"A strange book that‚Äôs not 100% convinced of its reason to exist, but is still fascinating and often moving. Grisel is ultimately pessimistic about the potential of modern neuroscience to prevent or ‚Äòcure‚Äô addiction. In her telling, drugs are an escape from alienation, and addiction an inevitable consequence of drug abuse - so the only way to get rid of addiction is to promote connection. ‚ÄúOf course biology is involved!‚Äù she writes in the final chapter. ‚ÄúBut the insistence on starting and ending within an addict‚Äôs head is not only misguided but insidious.‚Äù It‚Äôs a weird sentence to read after 200 pages of insightful, expert commentary on what goes on inside addicts‚Äô heads.And you do learn a lot! Grisel equips you with simple but powerful intellectual tools to understand the fundamental processes underlying addiction. Her introduction to the Opponent-Process model, a unifying thread in the book, is crystal clear, and was for me an a-ha moment in how it brought together tolerance and withdrawal as two sides of the same coin. Subsequent chapters examine different drug families in turn - opiates, alcohol, tranquilizers, stimulants, psychedelics. There‚Äôs enough that unites each drug family to keep you on board, and enough that‚Äôs different to keep you interested. Two chapters on risk factors (super interesting) and ‚ÄòSolving Addiction‚Äô (less so) round things off. It‚Äôs a short book, but a dense one.Grisel‚Äôs writing style is by turns aggressively pulpy (cocaine is ‚Äúthe sole porn shop in a down and out town‚Äù) and drily technical. The endless roll-call of neurotransmitters, agonists, receptors and transporters can read a little like a Wikipedia article. But colour comes by way of anecdotes from her own experience as an abuser of any drugs she could get her hands on. Grisel‚Äôs account of these times are stony-eyed and unsentimental in a way that feels typical of the recovering addict. There‚Äôs something cold and admirable about the way she mines the darkest moments of her past for examples of particular psychopharmacological mechanisms and phenomena. It‚Äôs like watching someone test a vaccine on themselves. Something I appreciated about her telling of these cautionary tales was how consistently she humanises her fellow addicts. There‚Äôs something valuable in seeing a distinguished academic refer to other addicts as her friends. She doesn‚Äôt romanticise these relationships in any way; in fact she never misses a chance to remind the reader of how quickly the addict will throw his friends under the bus if an opportunity to score presents itself. But this is always framed as a condemnation of the drug, not the person who has been made its prisoner. Many of her friends were not able to turn their life around in the same way that Grisel did and it often was the end of them. If you have a soft spot for any drug, chances are you will find disillusionment within these pages. I found the section/lament on MDMA/ecstasy particularly sobering. I‚Äôve had profound experiences with MDMA before. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not alone among MDMA users in once upon a time thinking that it was a drug that could change the world for the better. But, for all her acknowledgment of how universally positive the subjective experience of the MDMA high is, Grisel doesn‚Äôt hold back in describing the lasting neurological damage it does. No drug really comes out of this book looking particularly good. The one exception is, you may have guessed, psychedelics. Grisel is cautiously optimistic about LSD, psilocybin, DMT and the like, and she clearly leaves the door open to maybe, possibly one day trying them again herself.She‚Äôs less convincing on the few occasions when she strays out of her area of scientific expertise and into the political, legal and economic debates around the place of drugs in society and what could or should be the state‚Äôs disposition towards them. When discussing ephedra, a plant-based stimulant that can cause adverse reactions in users, she notes that the supplement industry invested heavily in a campaign to persuade the regulators that ephedra was safe and therefore should not be classified - but ‚Äúeventually, science prevailed and ephedra-containing dietary supplements were made illegal in the United States.‚Äù The casual equation ‚Äòdangerous‚Äô = ‚Äòshould be made illegal‚Äô isn‚Äôt examined. If ‚Äòscience prevailing‚Äô is the same War on Drugs that she notes a couple of chapters later was an unmitigated failure, science may have some things to answer for.But all in all Never Enough is definitely worth a read, especially as a critical counterpoint to the legalisation and harm reduction literature. One last note - this is 100% about addiction to drugs. I came to Never Enough with vague ideas about how my addiction to rolling news content and Twitter might be fuelling my anxiety. Might addiction be a valuable model for understanding other damaging behaviours? Maybe, but not here. Grisel limits herself to talking about the action of drugs on the brain. I think the book is probably stronger for it."

As time has passed we have learned that everything from the bacteria in our guts to the interactions we had in middle school partly determines our behavior.

This is the painful context in which our attempts to avert and deny the burden of consciousness have grown more and more desperate and widespread._____So who‚Äôs to blame for the epidemic of addiction? The truth is no one is to blame, but we are all responsible. Though any search for for a cause (or a cure) is bound to fall short, one source of this epidemic is our unwillingness to bear our own pain, along with our failure to look upon the suffering of others with compassion... The history of every science begins with the individual and progresses to the connected collective. Botany began by cataloging specimens and now understands the health of any species depends on an ecological landscape. _____Together we nourish the epidemic of addiction by espousing false dichotomies like ""us"" versus ""them"" or ""well"" versus ""sick."" In doing so, we embrace the myth that happiness can be persued at the individual level, and therefore perpetuate a culture of isolation and alienation...Though there is still much to learn in and out of laboratory settings, we have enough cumulative data to recognize that we/our brains are shaped and constrained by much, much more than our individual biology. And of all of these influences, perhaps the most immediate and impactful, and therefore potentially helpful for realizing change, are our connections with each other. We affect each other, including each other's neurobiology, neurochemistry, and behavior, in ways that are direct and profound. As we grapple to respond to the growing population of addicts, we'd do well to recognize that disordered use comes from, thrives in, and creates alienation."

113,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86576157-minervas-owl,4,"As a drug addict turned neuroscientist, Judith Grisel teaches the science of addiction while telling her personal redemption story. The book is intriguing from the beginning to the end. Judith introduces Richard Solomon's opponent-process theory as a unified explanation of addiction. According to this theory, our brain always adapts to a stimulus by creating an opponent process. That's why skydivers feel exhilarated after landing. In the case of drug use, the longer and more frequent the use, the stronger and long-lasting the counterbalancing effect the brain produces. Over time, this opposite effect not only makes the drug less effective, but also leads to withdrawal symptoms and craving. In the end, drug abusers no longer use to get high, but merely to escape from the agony of withdrawal.  The author's explanation of the theory is clear. I find the two graphs of the a/b process (what the drug does to the brain/brain's opponent response) especially illustrative and self-explanatory. I can understand why Judith claims they are on her shortlist of tattoo design. Nevertheless, when I found the theory was proposed in 1974, I was a bit disappointed that the book did not introduce the more recent development of the theory. Nor did the author introduce other hypotheses on addiction, such as incentive sensitization, which claims repeated exposure to drugs leads to wanting independent of liking. Each subsequent chapter then introduces the chemistry and physiology of an individual category of substance: cannabinoids, opiates, alcohol, tranquilizers, stimulants, psychedelics, and others. Judith's vivid description of her own drug use experience makes her scientific reports convincing and mesmerizing. She also makes good use of analogy and comparison. For example, she mentions alcohol acts like a sledgehammer, affecting so many functions of the brain, while cocaine acts like a laser, stimulating with the fewest side effects. It's much harder to pin down the neurological effects of alcohol than cocaine, she says, because the molecule of alcohol is much smaller and structurally simpler, and ""there are many more places to park a skateboard than an airplane."" Notwithstanding, sometimes, empirical facts such as stereotypy are laid out unexplained, and scientific discoveries scattered and unorganized. Half of my interest in this book stemmed from a sinful wish to know how ""interesting"" various drugs are; my thirst was quenched. Sometimes Judith almost talks about drugs with nostalgia, such as how she used to spend hours stoned on the beach, searching for shells and listening to waves, enjoying every sense of hers enriched by weed. But the more important lesson I learned from the book is why addiction is bad. The drug experience, no matter it's euphoria or tranquility, always dies out over time, driving one into a search in vain of lost joy. Moreover, addiction strips you of choice, making you the worst enemy of yourself. I've never tried drugs, but the lesson is relevant. The threat lies in not only chemicals but also the internet, smartphone, food, game, and others. Drug addiction, as the extreme case of obsession, makes me reevaluate the consequences of being hooked."
114,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3142334-james-aaron,5,Nice read to pair with Mind Fixers. Well-written. Superb mix of personal experience and academic insight. 
115,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67837453-travis-lupick,3,"This is not a review but is based on an interview I had with the author. It was originally published in the Georgia Straight newspaper.Judith Grisel enjoyed using drugs. Cannabis, especially.‚ÄúIn many ways my relationship with the drug was among the purest and most wonderful relationships of my life,‚Äù she writes in Never Enough: The Neuroscience and Experience of Addiction (Doubleday, February 2019). ‚ÄúFrom the first time I got high until long after I‚Äôd smoked my last bowl, I loved the drug like a best friend.‚ÄùThe behavioral neuroscientist and professor of psychology at Pennsylvania‚Äôs Bucknell University also once had an intense love-hate relationship with cocaine, and pretty much any mind-altering substance within reach.It‚Äôs been three decades since she stopped using drugs, save for her daily use of the coffee bean. But Grisel concedes she sometimes misses them, and still sees potential benefits in the occasional use of certain substances; psychedelics, primarily, which she notes new research suggests may help some people with mental-health issues such as PTSD.And so, Grisel told the Straight, in that regard, it‚Äôs a sad story she tells in Never Enough. It turns out that mind-altering drugs simply aren‚Äôt good for you, cannabis included.‚ÄúUsing drugs to change the way we think, feel, and behave, is ancient and universal,‚Äù Grisel says in a telephone interview. ‚ÄúI do think that, not only is it natural, but that there are some benefits. I might have not survived my childhood without all that weed, now that I think about it. So I‚Äôm not against it. But I do think that addiction takes all the fun out of it, and that there are consequences for people, their families, and society.‚ÄùGrisel sought an education and then a career in neuroscience because of her addiction to drugs. The book recounts how she entered the field with the goal of finding a ‚Äúcure‚Äù.‚ÄúI thought that if I could find the cellular switch that flipped somewhere between my third and my fourth drinks, or each time a promising bag was within my sight, and then find a way to keep this switch in the ‚Äòoff‚Äô position, I might be able to refrain from‚Ä¶spending all my tips on very temporary thrills, or making blacked-out road trips to Dallas,‚Äù she writes.Nearly three decades into her search, Grisel writes that she‚Äôs learned the problem is not so much the drugs, per se, but rather the human brain‚Äôs powerful ability to respond to the altered chemistry that drugs produce.‚ÄúThere will never be enough drug, because the brain‚Äôs capacity to learn and adapt is basically infinite,‚Äù reads Never Enough. ‚ÄúWhat was once a normal state punctuated by periods of high inexorably transforms to a state of desperation that is only temporarily subdued.‚ÄùWhile a cure for addiction remains elusive, there‚Äôs never been a more urgent need to pursue the question.Opioids alone killed nearly 4,000 people across Canada in 2017, up from roughly 3,000 the previous year, according to Health Canada. In the United States, 47,600 people died after taking opioids in 2017, up from 42,400 in 2016, according to the U.S. National Institute on Drug Use. It‚Äôs one of the worst health crises the continent has ever experienced, and there‚Äôs no end in sight.With a tidy writing structure that weaves personal anecdotes alongside accessible science, Never Enough describes how the brain of someone addicted to drugs changes as the time they struggle with their drug use drags on.The book focuses on neurochemistry, but Grisel emphasizes that addiction is generally the result of a combination of genetic predisposition, developmental influences, and environmental input.‚ÄúSince the beginning of when we‚Äôve kept records, people have been using drugs to change the way they feel. So what‚Äôs different? Why do we have so much addiction now?‚Äù Grisel asks. ‚ÄúIsolation. Generally, in our distant history, it [drug use] was a communal activity, with spiritual or at least cultural overtones. It was something people did together. So using alone [is what‚Äôs different].‚ÄùGrisel‚Äôs measured take on drugs means it‚Äôs not all bad news for everyone who enjoys a little help to keep the party going.‚ÄúTo the banker who uses cocaine once every four-to-six weeks, I would say, ‚ÄòGood for you‚Äô. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs so terrible,‚Äù Grisel says. ‚ÄúIf you are one of these rare individuals that really does well with moderation‚Äîand that does sound pretty moderate if you‚Äôre just doing a little coke‚Äîya, I think that is all right.‚ÄùThe problem is that for so many people, the brain‚Äôs adaptive nature makes moderation so difficult.‚ÄúLuxuries become habits, habits become compulsions, and compulsions become addictions,‚Äù Grisel says.In addition to the imperative of moderation, the other major piece of advice that Grisel offers in Never Enough is for kids to stay away from drugs. It‚Äôs not a ‚ÄúJust say no‚Äù message she‚Äôs borrowed from the DARE program. There are very real reasons to wait, she explains.‚ÄúUntil you are 25, the brain is still being organized,‚Äù Grisel says. ‚ÄúSo if you perturb it while it is still being organized‚Äîduring development‚Äîthen it alters the organizational structure. Whereas if the basic scaffolding is all laid down, once the pathways are all basically set‚Äîwhich they are sometime between 23 and 25‚Äîthen you are more-likely to be able to undo it [changes to the brain made by using drugs].‚ÄùNever Enough also includes lessons that apply to the war on drugs and which can inform North America‚Äôs response to the opioid epidemic. For example, Grisel says, it‚Äôs time for an honest assessment of criminalization.‚ÄúIf punishment worked, surely we would see diminishing numbers of addicts, and we don‚Äôt. We see more and more,‚Äù Grisel says. ‚ÄúI think it is alienating, to say to people, ‚ÄòYou are bad and you‚Äôve got to not be bad and we‚Äôre going to help you not be bad by doing bad things to you‚Äô.‚ÄùThe same sort of logical evaluation led her to support harm reduction at a time when the Ontario government and states such as Washington, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts are debating the merits of supervised-injection facilities like Vancouver‚Äôs Insite.‚ÄúI think supervised injection is a great idea, because I don‚Äôt think punishment works,‚Äù Grisel says. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it condones using. It is just trying to say, ‚ÄòHere‚Äôs a safe place‚Äô.‚ÄúWe should use every strategy we can to support people to be healthy,‚Äù Grisel continues. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like we‚Äôre going to teach people not to use by letting them die. That won‚Äôt work.‚Äù"
116,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57980946-sarah-bradley,5,"I'm always tentative to read books about neuroscience. Having studied the subject in college, usually mainstream books about neuroscience are too watered down and I feel as though I'm not really learning much. This book was the perfect balance between presenting the topic of addiction in a way that made sense to a naive reader, but was still engaging for people already familiar with the subject. I also really appreciated Grisel's own personal journey with addiction. By weaving together her narrative with the more scientific descriptions of drugs/drug use, the book was not only accessible to a wide range of readers, but was also extremely engaging. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone curious about the widespread epidemic of addiction that our world currently faces. "
117,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4952371-polly,4,"A compelling, important read offering a uniquely new perspective of addiction."
118,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58281897-david-elliott,4,"A strange book that‚Äôs not 100% convinced of its reason to exist, but is still fascinating and often moving. Grisel is ultimately pessimistic about the potential of modern neuroscience to prevent or ‚Äòcure‚Äô addiction. In her telling, drugs are an escape from alienation, and addiction an inevitable consequence of drug abuse - so the only way to get rid of addiction is to promote connection. ‚ÄúOf course biology is involved!‚Äù she writes in the final chapter. ‚ÄúBut the insistence on starting and ending within an addict‚Äôs head is not only misguided but insidious.‚Äù It‚Äôs a weird sentence to read after 200 pages of insightful, expert commentary on what goes on inside addicts‚Äô heads.And you do learn a lot! Grisel equips you with simple but powerful intellectual tools to understand the fundamental processes underlying addiction. Her introduction to the Opponent-Process model, a unifying thread in the book, is crystal clear, and was for me an a-ha moment in how it brought together tolerance and withdrawal as two sides of the same coin. Subsequent chapters examine different drug families in turn - opiates, alcohol, tranquilizers, stimulants, psychedelics. There‚Äôs enough that unites each drug family to keep you on board, and enough that‚Äôs different to keep you interested. Two chapters on risk factors (super interesting) and ‚ÄòSolving Addiction‚Äô (less so) round things off. It‚Äôs a short book, but a dense one.Grisel‚Äôs writing style is by turns aggressively pulpy (cocaine is ‚Äúthe sole porn shop in a down and out town‚Äù) and drily technical. The endless roll-call of neurotransmitters, agonists, receptors and transporters can read a little like a Wikipedia article. But colour comes by way of anecdotes from her own experience as an abuser of any drugs she could get her hands on. Grisel‚Äôs account of these times are stony-eyed and unsentimental in a way that feels typical of the recovering addict. There‚Äôs something cold and admirable about the way she mines the darkest moments of her past for examples of particular psychopharmacological mechanisms and phenomena. It‚Äôs like watching someone test a vaccine on themselves. Something I appreciated about her telling of these cautionary tales was how consistently she humanises her fellow addicts. There‚Äôs something valuable in seeing a distinguished academic refer to other addicts as her friends. She doesn‚Äôt romanticise these relationships in any way; in fact she never misses a chance to remind the reader of how quickly the addict will throw his friends under the bus if an opportunity to score presents itself. But this is always framed as a condemnation of the drug, not the person who has been made its prisoner. Many of her friends were not able to turn their life around in the same way that Grisel did and it often was the end of them. If you have a soft spot for any drug, chances are you will find disillusionment within these pages. I found the section/lament on MDMA/ecstasy particularly sobering. I‚Äôve had profound experiences with MDMA before. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not alone among MDMA users in once upon a time thinking that it was a drug that could change the world for the better. But, for all her acknowledgment of how universally positive the subjective experience of the MDMA high is, Grisel doesn‚Äôt hold back in describing the lasting neurological damage it does. No drug really comes out of this book looking particularly good. The one exception is, you may have guessed, psychedelics. Grisel is cautiously optimistic about LSD, psilocybin, DMT and the like, and she clearly leaves the door open to maybe, possibly one day trying them again herself.She‚Äôs less convincing on the few occasions when she strays out of her area of scientific expertise and into the political, legal and economic debates around the place of drugs in society and what could or should be the state‚Äôs disposition towards them. When discussing ephedra, a plant-based stimulant that can cause adverse reactions in users, she notes that the supplement industry invested heavily in a campaign to persuade the regulators that ephedra was safe and therefore should not be classified - but ‚Äúeventually, science prevailed and ephedra-containing dietary supplements were made illegal in the United States.‚Äù The casual equation ‚Äòdangerous‚Äô = ‚Äòshould be made illegal‚Äô isn‚Äôt examined. If ‚Äòscience prevailing‚Äô is the same War on Drugs that she notes a couple of chapters later was an unmitigated failure, science may have some things to answer for.But all in all Never Enough is definitely worth a read, especially as a critical counterpoint to the legalisation and harm reduction literature. One last note - this is 100% about addiction to drugs. I came to Never Enough with vague ideas about how my addiction to rolling news content and Twitter might be fuelling my anxiety. Might addiction be a valuable model for understanding other damaging behaviours? Maybe, but not here. Grisel limits herself to talking about the action of drugs on the brain. I think the book is probably stronger for it."
119,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2587406-elk,0,"Though plausible, I should mention that an elegant hypothesis is no substitute for definitive data. As time has passed we have learned that everything from the bacteria in our guts to the interactions we had in middle school partly determines our behavior. In fact, it's beginning to seem that the brain is more like a stage for a life to be acted out upon than like the director behind a curtain calling shots. _____Because we encounter an ever-variable environment as we go about our day, if our neural activity simply reflected all of this input, like the ocean in the midst of a storm, then the tossed pebble, or even a boulder, could have no perceptible impact. In neuro-parlance, the ratio of signal to noise would be too low. In order for a stimulus to be detected, let alone interpreted as meaningful, the neural signal must be greater than the background noise--or the noise must be quashed.The fundamental role of the brain is to be a contrast detector. As experiences are distinguished from monotony, they spark neurochemical changes in specific brain circuits, informing us of all we care to know: opportunities for food, drink, or sex; danger or pain; beauty and pleasure, for example._____In their opponentprocess theory, Solomon and Corbit made the case‚Äù that feeling states are maintained around a ‚Äúset point‚Äù just as body temperature and water balance are. They proposed that any feeling, including good, bad, happy, depressed, or excited, for example, represents a disruption of the stable feeling state that we perceive as neutral. Specifically, the opponentprocess theory posits that any stimulus that alters brain functioning to affect the way we feel will illicit a response from the brain that is exactly opposite to the effect of the stimulus._____To sport would be as tedious as to work; But when they seldom come, they wished-for come, And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents. Than that which hath no foil to set it off.Henry IV, Part 1_____The very definition of an addictive drug is one that stimulates the mesolimbic pathway, but there are three general axioms in psychopharmacology that also apply to all drugs:1. All drugs act by changing the rate of what is already going on.2. All drugs have side effects.3. The brain adapts to all drugs that affect it by counteracting the drug‚Äôs effects._____Among the most astounding findings in recent neuroscience is the context-dependent nature of all neural activity. Even as our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are products of neurochemical brain activity, what gives rise to this activity is mostly not in our brains. Rather, our brains express the evolutionary, social, and cultural context we occupy... It follows that the answer to the addiction crisis is not solely in the brain, but must include the context. More than ever before in our evolutionary history, we possess a keen awareness of widespread tragedy and suffering in the world. This is the painful context in which our attempts to avert and deny the burden of consciousness have grown more and more desperate and widespread._____So who‚Äôs to blame for the epidemic of addiction? The truth is no one is to blame, but we are all responsible. Though any search for for a cause (or a cure) is bound to fall short, one source of this epidemic is our unwillingness to bear our own pain, along with our failure to look upon the suffering of others with compassion... The history of every science begins with the individual and progresses to the connected collective. Botany began by cataloging specimens and now understands the health of any species depends on an ecological landscape. _____Together we nourish the epidemic of addiction by espousing false dichotomies like ""us"" versus ""them"" or ""well"" versus ""sick.""

And of all of these influences, perhaps the most immediate and impactful, and therefore potentially helpful for realizing change, are our connections with each other.

143,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86576157-minervas-owl,4,"As a drug addict turned neuroscientist, Judith Grisel teaches the science of addiction while telling her personal redemption story. The book is intriguing from the beginning to the end. Judith introduces Richard Solomon's opponent-process theory as a unified explanation of addiction. According to this theory, our brain always adapts to a stimulus by creating an opponent process. That's why skydivers feel exhilarated after landing. In the case of drug use, the longer and more frequent the use, the stronger and long-lasting the counterbalancing effect the brain produces. Over time, this opposite effect not only makes the drug less effective, but also leads to withdrawal symptoms and craving. In the end, drug abusers no longer use to get high, but merely to escape from the agony of withdrawal.  The author's explanation of the theory is clear. I find the two graphs of the a/b process (what the drug does to the brain/brain's opponent response) especially illustrative and self-explanatory. I can understand why Judith claims they are on her shortlist of tattoo design. Nevertheless, when I found the theory was proposed in 1974, I was a bit disappointed that the book did not introduce the more recent development of the theory. Nor did the author introduce other hypotheses on addiction, such as incentive sensitization, which claims repeated exposure to drugs leads to wanting independent of liking. Each subsequent chapter then introduces the chemistry and physiology of an individual category of substance: cannabinoids, opiates, alcohol, tranquilizers, stimulants, psychedelics, and others. Judith's vivid description of her own drug use experience makes her scientific reports convincing and mesmerizing. She also makes good use of analogy and comparison. For example, she mentions alcohol acts like a sledgehammer, affecting so many functions of the brain, while cocaine acts like a laser, stimulating with the fewest side effects. It's much harder to pin down the neurological effects of alcohol than cocaine, she says, because the molecule of alcohol is much smaller and structurally simpler, and ""there are many more places to park a skateboard than an airplane."" Notwithstanding, sometimes, empirical facts such as stereotypy are laid out unexplained, and scientific discoveries scattered and unorganized. Half of my interest in this book stemmed from a sinful wish to know how ""interesting"" various drugs are; my thirst was quenched. Sometimes Judith almost talks about drugs with nostalgia, such as how she used to spend hours stoned on the beach, searching for shells and listening to waves, enjoying every sense of hers enriched by weed. But the more important lesson I learned from the book is why addiction is bad. The drug experience, no matter it's euphoria or tranquility, always dies out over time, driving one into a search in vain of lost joy. Moreover, addiction strips you of choice, making you the worst enemy of yourself. I've never tried drugs, but the lesson is relevant. The threat lies in not only chemicals but also the internet, smartphone, food, game, and others. Drug addiction, as the extreme case of obsession, makes me reevaluate the consequences of being hooked."

145,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67837453-travis-lupick,3,"This is not a review but is based on an interview I had with the author. It was originally published in the Georgia Straight newspaper.Judith Grisel enjoyed using drugs. Cannabis, especially.‚ÄúIn many ways my relationship with the drug was among the purest and most wonderful relationships of my life,‚Äù she writes in Never Enough: The Neuroscience and Experience of Addiction (Doubleday, February 2019). ‚ÄúFrom the first time I got high until long after I‚Äôd smoked my last bowl, I loved the drug like a best friend.‚ÄùThe behavioral neuroscientist and professor of psychology at Pennsylvania‚Äôs Bucknell University also once had an intense love-hate relationship with cocaine, and pretty much any mind-altering substance within reach.It‚Äôs been three decades since she stopped using drugs, save for her daily use of the coffee bean. But Grisel concedes she sometimes misses them, and still sees potential benefits in the occasional use of certain substances; psychedelics, primarily, which she notes new research suggests may help some people with mental-health issues such as PTSD.And so, Grisel told the Straight, in that regard, it‚Äôs a sad story she tells in Never Enough. It turns out that mind-altering drugs simply aren‚Äôt good for you, cannabis included.‚ÄúUsing drugs to change the way we think, feel, and behave, is ancient and universal,‚Äù Grisel says in a telephone interview. ‚ÄúI do think that, not only is it natural, but that there are some benefits. I might have not survived my childhood without all that weed, now that I think about it. So I‚Äôm not against it. But I do think that addiction takes all the fun out of it, and that there are consequences for people, their families, and society.‚ÄùGrisel sought an education and then a career in neuroscience because of her addiction to drugs. The book recounts how she entered the field with the goal of finding a ‚Äúcure‚Äù.‚ÄúI thought that if I could find the cellular switch that flipped somewhere between my third and my fourth drinks, or each time a promising bag was within my sight, and then find a way to keep this switch in the ‚Äòoff‚Äô position, I might be able to refrain from‚Ä¶spending all my tips on very temporary thrills, or making blacked-out road trips to Dallas,‚Äù she writes.Nearly three decades into her search, Grisel writes that she‚Äôs learned the problem is not so much the drugs, per se, but rather the human brain‚Äôs powerful ability to respond to the altered chemistry that drugs produce.‚ÄúThere will never be enough drug, because the brain‚Äôs capacity to learn and adapt is basically infinite,‚Äù reads Never Enough. ‚ÄúWhat was once a normal state punctuated by periods of high inexorably transforms to a state of desperation that is only temporarily subdued.‚ÄùWhile a cure for addiction remains elusive, there‚Äôs never been a more urgent need to pursue the question.Opioids alone killed nearly 4,000 people across Canada in 2017, up from roughly 3,000 the previous year, according to Health Canada. In the United States, 47,600 people died after taking opioids in 2017, up from 42,400 in 2016, according to the U.S. National Institute on Drug Use. It‚Äôs one of the worst health crises the continent has ever experienced, and there‚Äôs no end in sight.With a tidy writing structure that weaves personal anecdotes alongside accessible science, Never Enough describes how the brain of someone addicted to drugs changes as the time they struggle with their drug use drags on.The book focuses on neurochemistry, but Grisel emphasizes that addiction is generally the result of a combination of genetic predisposition, developmental influences, and environmental input.‚ÄúSince the beginning of when we‚Äôve kept records, people have been using drugs to change the way they feel. So what‚Äôs different? Why do we have so much addiction now?‚Äù Grisel asks. ‚ÄúIsolation. Generally, in our distant history, it [drug use] was a communal activity, with spiritual or at least cultural overtones. It was something people did together. So using alone [is what‚Äôs different].‚ÄùGrisel‚Äôs measured take on drugs means it‚Äôs not all bad news for everyone who enjoys a little help to keep the party going.‚ÄúTo the banker who uses cocaine once every four-to-six weeks, I would say, ‚ÄòGood for you‚Äô. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs so terrible,‚Äù Grisel says. ‚ÄúIf you are one of these rare individuals that really does well with moderation‚Äîand that does sound pretty moderate if you‚Äôre just doing a little coke‚Äîya, I think that is all right.‚ÄùThe problem is that for so many people, the brain‚Äôs adaptive nature makes moderation so difficult.‚ÄúLuxuries become habits, habits become compulsions, and compulsions become addictions,‚Äù Grisel says.In addition to the imperative of moderation, the other major piece of advice that Grisel offers in Never Enough is for kids to stay away from drugs. It‚Äôs not a ‚ÄúJust say no‚Äù message she‚Äôs borrowed from the DARE program. There are very real reasons to wait, she explains.‚ÄúUntil you are 25, the brain is still being organized,‚Äù Grisel says. ‚ÄúSo if you perturb it while it is still being organized‚Äîduring development‚Äîthen it alters the organizational structure. Whereas if the basic scaffolding is all laid down, once the pathways are all basically set‚Äîwhich they are sometime between 23 and 25‚Äîthen you are more-likely to be able to undo it [changes to the brain made by using drugs].‚ÄùNever Enough also includes lessons that apply to the war on drugs and which can inform North America‚Äôs response to the opioid epidemic. For example, Grisel says, it‚Äôs time for an honest assessment of criminalization.‚ÄúIf punishment worked, surely we would see diminishing numbers of addicts, and we don‚Äôt. We see more and more,‚Äù Grisel says. ‚ÄúI think it is alienating, to say to people, ‚ÄòYou are bad and you‚Äôve got to not be bad and we‚Äôre going to help you not be bad by doing bad things to you‚Äô.‚ÄùThe same sort of logical evaluation led her to support harm reduction at a time when the Ontario government and states such as Washington, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts are debating the merits of supervised-injection facilities like Vancouver‚Äôs Insite.‚ÄúI think supervised injection is a great idea, because I don‚Äôt think punishment works,‚Äù Grisel says. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it condones using. It is just trying to say, ‚ÄòHere‚Äôs a safe place‚Äô.‚ÄúWe should use every strategy we can to support people to be healthy,‚Äù Grisel continues. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like we‚Äôre going to teach people not to use by letting them die. That won‚Äôt work.‚Äù"
146,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57980946-sarah-bradley,5,"I'm always tentative to read books about neuroscience. Having studied the subject in college, usually mainstream books about neuroscience are too watered down and I feel as though I'm not really learning much. This book was the perfect balance between presenting the topic of addiction in a way that made sense to a naive reader, but was still engaging for people already familiar with the subject. I also really appreciated Grisel's own personal journey with addiction. By weaving together her narrative with the more scientific descriptions of drugs/drug use, the book was not only accessible to a wide range of readers, but was also extremely engaging. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone curious about the widespread epidemic of addiction that our world currently faces. "
147,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4952371-polly,4,"A compelling, important read offering a uniquely new perspective of addiction."
148,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58281897-david-elliott,4,"A strange book that‚Äôs not 100% convinced of its reason to exist, but is still fascinating and often moving. Grisel is ultimately pessimistic about the potential of modern neuroscience to prevent or ‚Äòcure‚Äô addiction. In her telling, drugs are an escape from alienation, and addiction an inevitable consequence of drug abuse - so the only way to get rid of addiction is to promote connection. ‚ÄúOf course biology is involved!‚Äù she writes in the final chapter. ‚ÄúBut the insistence on starting and ending within an addict‚Äôs head is not only misguided but insidious.‚Äù It‚Äôs a weird sentence to read after 200 pages of insightful, expert commentary on what goes on inside addicts‚Äô heads.And you do learn a lot! Grisel equips you with simple but powerful intellectual tools to understand the fundamental processes underlying addiction. Her introduction to the Opponent-Process model, a unifying thread in the book, is crystal clear, and was for me an a-ha moment in how it brought together tolerance and withdrawal as two sides of the same coin. Subsequent chapters examine different drug families in turn - opiates, alcohol, tranquilizers, stimulants, psychedelics. There‚Äôs enough that unites each drug family to keep you on board, and enough that‚Äôs different to keep you interested. Two chapters on risk factors (super interesting) and ‚ÄòSolving Addiction‚Äô (less so) round things off. It‚Äôs a short book, but a dense one.Grisel‚Äôs writing style is by turns aggressively pulpy (cocaine is ‚Äúthe sole porn shop in a down and out town‚Äù) and drily technical. The endless roll-call of neurotransmitters, agonists, receptors and transporters can read a little like a Wikipedia article. But colour comes by way of anecdotes from her own experience as an abuser of any drugs she could get her hands on. Grisel‚Äôs account of these times are stony-eyed and unsentimental in a way that feels typical of the recovering addict. There‚Äôs something cold and admirable about the way she mines the darkest moments of her past for examples of particular psychopharmacological mechanisms and phenomena. It‚Äôs like watching someone test a vaccine on themselves. Something I appreciated about her telling of these cautionary tales was how consistently she humanises her fellow addicts. There‚Äôs something valuable in seeing a distinguished academic refer to other addicts as her friends. She doesn‚Äôt romanticise these relationships in any way; in fact she never misses a chance to remind the reader of how quickly the addict will throw his friends under the bus if an opportunity to score presents itself. But this is always framed as a condemnation of the drug, not the person who has been made its prisoner. Many of her friends were not able to turn their life around in the same way that Grisel did and it often was the end of them. If you have a soft spot for any drug, chances are you will find disillusionment within these pages. I found the section/lament on MDMA/ecstasy particularly sobering. I‚Äôve had profound experiences with MDMA before. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not alone among MDMA users in once upon a time thinking that it was a drug that could change the world for the better. But, for all her acknowledgment of how universally positive the subjective experience of the MDMA high is, Grisel doesn‚Äôt hold back in describing the lasting neurological damage it does. No drug really comes out of this book looking particularly good. The one exception is, you may have guessed, psychedelics. Grisel is cautiously optimistic about LSD, psilocybin, DMT and the like, and she clearly leaves the door open to maybe, possibly one day trying them again herself.She‚Äôs less convincing on the few occasions when she strays out of her area of scientific expertise and into the political, legal and economic debates around the place of drugs in society and what could or should be the state‚Äôs disposition towards them. When discussing ephedra, a plant-based stimulant that can cause adverse reactions in users, she notes that the supplement industry invested heavily in a campaign to persuade the regulators that ephedra was safe and therefore should not be classified - but ‚Äúeventually, science prevailed and ephedra-containing dietary supplements were made illegal in the United States.‚Äù The casual equation ‚Äòdangerous‚Äô = ‚Äòshould be made illegal‚Äô isn‚Äôt examined. If ‚Äòscience prevailing‚Äô is the same War on Drugs that she notes a couple of chapters later was an unmitigated failure, science may have some things to answer for.But all in all Never Enough is definitely worth a read, especially as a critical counterpoint to the legalisation and harm reduction literature. One last note - this is 100% about addiction to drugs. I came to Never Enough with vague ideas about how my addiction to rolling news content and Twitter might be fuelling my anxiety. Might addiction be a valuable model for understanding other damaging behaviours? Maybe, but not here. Grisel limits herself to talking about the action of drugs on the brain. I think the book is probably stronger for it."
149,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2587406-elk,0,"Though plausible, I should mention that an elegant hypothesis is no substitute for definitive data. As time has passed we have learned that everything from the bacteria in our guts to the interactions we had in middle school partly determines our behavior. In fact, it's beginning to seem that the brain is more like a stage for a life to be acted out upon than like the director behind a curtain calling shots. _____Because we encounter an ever-variable environment as we go about our day, if our neural activity simply reflected all of this input, like the ocean in the midst of a storm, then the tossed pebble, or even a boulder, could have no perceptible impact. In neuro-parlance, the ratio of signal to noise would be too low. In order for a stimulus to be detected, let alone interpreted as meaningful, the neural signal must be greater than the background noise--or the noise must be quashed.The fundamental role of the brain is to be a contrast detector. As experiences are distinguished from monotony, they spark neurochemical changes in specific brain circuits, informing us of all we care to know: opportunities for food, drink, or sex; danger or pain; beauty and pleasure, for example._____In their opponentprocess theory, Solomon and Corbit made the case‚Äù that feeling states are maintained around a ‚Äúset point‚Äù just as body temperature and water balance are. They proposed that any feeling, including good, bad, happy, depressed, or excited, for example, represents a disruption of the stable feeling state that we perceive as neutral. Specifically, the opponentprocess theory posits that any stimulus that alters brain functioning to affect the way we feel will illicit a response from the brain that is exactly opposite to the effect of the stimulus._____To sport would be as tedious as to work; But when they seldom come, they wished-for come, And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents. Than that which hath no foil to set it off.Henry IV, Part 1_____The very definition of an addictive drug is one that stimulates the mesolimbic pathway, but there are three general axioms in psychopharmacology that also apply to all drugs:1. All drugs act by changing the rate of what is already going on.2. All drugs have side effects.3. The brain adapts to all drugs that affect it by counteracting the drug‚Äôs effects._____Among the most astounding findings in recent neuroscience is the context-dependent nature of all neural activity. Even as our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are products of neurochemical brain activity, what gives rise to this activity is mostly not in our brains. Rather, our brains express the evolutionary, social, and cultural context we occupy... It follows that the answer to the addiction crisis is not solely in the brain, but must include the context. More than ever before in our evolutionary history, we possess a keen awareness of widespread tragedy and suffering in the world. This is the painful context in which our attempts to avert and deny the burden of consciousness have grown more and more desperate and widespread._____So who‚Äôs to blame for the epidemic of addiction? The truth is no one is to blame, but we are all responsible. Though any search for for a cause (or a cure) is bound to fall short, one source of this epidemic is our unwillingness to bear our own pain, along with our failure to look upon the suffering of others with compassion... The history of every science begins with the individual and progresses to the connected collective. Botany began by cataloging specimens and now understands the health of any species depends on an ecological landscape. _____Together we nourish the epidemic of addiction by espousing false dichotomies like ""us"" versus ""them"" or ""well"" versus ""sick."" In doing so, we embrace the myth that happiness can be persued at the individual level, and therefore perpetuate a culture of isolation and alienation...Though there is still much to learn in and out of laboratory settings, we have enough cumulative data to recognize that we/our brains are shaped and constrained by much, much more than our individual biology. And of all of these influences, perhaps the most immediate and impactful, and therefore potentially helpful for realizing change, are our connections with each other. We affect each other, including each other's neurobiology, neurochemistry, and behavior, in ways that are direct and profound. As we grapple to respond to the growing population of addicts, we'd do well to recognize that disordered use comes from, thrives in, and creates alienation."

173,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86576157-minervas-owl,4,"As a drug addict turned neuroscientist, Judith Grisel teaches the science of addiction while telling her personal redemption story. The book is intriguing from the beginning to the end. Judith introduces Richard Solomon's opponent-process theory as a unified explanation of addiction. According to this theory, our brain always adapts to a stimulus by creating an opponent process. That's why skydivers feel exhilarated after landing. In the case of drug use, the longer and more frequent the use, the stronger and long-lasting the counterbalancing effect the brain produces. Over time, this opposite effect not only makes the drug less effective, but also leads to withdrawal symptoms and craving. In the end, drug abusers no longer use to get high, but merely to escape from the agony of withdrawal.  The author's explanation of the theory is clear. I find the two graphs of the a/b process (what the drug does to the brain/brain's opponent response) especially illustrative and self-explanatory. I can understand why Judith claims they are on her shortlist of tattoo design. Nevertheless, when I found the theory was proposed in 1974, I was a bit disappointed that the book did not introduce the more recent development of the theory. Nor did the author introduce other hypotheses on addiction, such as incentive sensitization, which claims repeated exposure to drugs leads to wanting independent of liking. Each subsequent chapter then introduces the chemistry and physiology of an individual category of substance: cannabinoids, opiates, alcohol, tranquilizers, stimulants, psychedelics, and others. Judith's vivid description of her own drug use experience makes her scientific reports convincing and mesmerizing. She also makes good use of analogy and comparison. For example, she mentions alcohol acts like a sledgehammer, affecting so many functions of the brain, while cocaine acts like a laser, stimulating with the fewest side effects. It's much harder to pin down the neurological effects of alcohol than cocaine, she says, because the molecule of alcohol is much smaller and structurally simpler, and ""there are many more places to park a skateboard than an airplane."" Notwithstanding, sometimes, empirical facts such as stereotypy are laid out unexplained, and scientific discoveries scattered and unorganized. Half of my interest in this book stemmed from a sinful wish to know how ""interesting"" various drugs are; my thirst was quenched. Sometimes Judith almost talks about drugs with nostalgia, such as how she used to spend hours stoned on the beach, searching for shells and listening to waves, enjoying every sense of hers enriched by weed. But the more important lesson I learned from the book is why addiction is bad. The drug experience, no matter it's euphoria or tranquility, always dies out over time, driving one into a search in vain of lost joy. Moreover, addiction strips you of choice, making you the worst enemy of yourself. I've never tried drugs, but the lesson is relevant. The threat lies in not only chemicals but also the internet, smartphone, food, game, and others. Drug addiction, as the extreme case of obsession, makes me reevaluate the consequences of being hooked."

175,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67837453-travis-lupick,3,"This is not a review but is based on an interview I had with the author. It was originally published in the Georgia Straight newspaper.Judith Grisel enjoyed using drugs. Cannabis, especially.‚ÄúIn many ways my relationship with the drug was among the purest and most wonderful relationships of my life,‚Äù she writes in Never Enough: The Neuroscience and Experience of Addiction (Doubleday, February 2019). ‚ÄúFrom the first time I got high until long after I‚Äôd smoked my last bowl, I loved the drug like a best friend.‚ÄùThe behavioral neuroscientist and professor of psychology at Pennsylvania‚Äôs Bucknell University also once had an intense love-hate relationship with cocaine, and pretty much any mind-altering substance within reach.It‚Äôs been three decades since she stopped using drugs, save for her daily use of the coffee bean. But Grisel concedes she sometimes misses them, and still sees potential benefits in the occasional use of certain substances; psychedelics, primarily, which she notes new research suggests may help some people with mental-health issues such as PTSD.And so, Grisel told the Straight, in that regard, it‚Äôs a sad story she tells in Never Enough. It turns out that mind-altering drugs simply aren‚Äôt good for you, cannabis included.‚ÄúUsing drugs to change the way we think, feel, and behave, is ancient and universal,‚Äù Grisel says in a telephone interview. ‚ÄúI do think that, not only is it natural, but that there are some benefits. I might have not survived my childhood without all that weed, now that I think about it. So I‚Äôm not against it. But I do think that addiction takes all the fun out of it, and that there are consequences for people, their families, and society.‚ÄùGrisel sought an education and then a career in neuroscience because of her addiction to drugs. The book recounts how she entered the field with the goal of finding a ‚Äúcure‚Äù.‚ÄúI thought that if I could find the cellular switch that flipped somewhere between my third and my fourth drinks, or each time a promising bag was within my sight, and then find a way to keep this switch in the ‚Äòoff‚Äô position, I might be able to refrain from‚Ä¶spending all my tips on very temporary thrills, or making blacked-out road trips to Dallas,‚Äù she writes.Nearly three decades into her search, Grisel writes that she‚Äôs learned the problem is not so much the drugs, per se, but rather the human brain‚Äôs powerful ability to respond to the altered chemistry that drugs produce.‚ÄúThere will never be enough drug, because the brain‚Äôs capacity to learn and adapt is basically infinite,‚Äù reads Never Enough. ‚ÄúWhat was once a normal state punctuated by periods of high inexorably transforms to a state of desperation that is only temporarily subdued.‚ÄùWhile a cure for addiction remains elusive, there‚Äôs never been a more urgent need to pursue the question.Opioids alone killed nearly 4,000 people across Canada in 2017, up from roughly 3,000 the previous year, according to Health Canada. In the United States, 47,600 people died after taking opioids in 2017, up from 42,400 in 2016, according to the U.S. National Institute on Drug Use. It‚Äôs one of the worst health crises the continent has ever experienced, and there‚Äôs no end in sight.With a tidy writing structure that weaves personal anecdotes alongside accessible science, Never Enough describes how the brain of someone addicted to drugs changes as the time they struggle with their drug use drags on.The book focuses on neurochemistry, but Grisel emphasizes that addiction is generally the result of a combination of genetic predisposition, developmental influences, and environmental input.‚ÄúSince the beginning of when we‚Äôve kept records, people have been using drugs to change the way they feel. So what‚Äôs different? Why do we have so much addiction now?‚Äù Grisel asks. ‚ÄúIsolation. Generally, in our distant history, it [drug use] was a communal activity, with spiritual or at least cultural overtones. It was something people did together. So using alone [is what‚Äôs different].‚ÄùGrisel‚Äôs measured take on drugs means it‚Äôs not all bad news for everyone who enjoys a little help to keep the party going.‚ÄúTo the banker who uses cocaine once every four-to-six weeks, I would say, ‚ÄòGood for you‚Äô. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs so terrible,‚Äù Grisel says. ‚ÄúIf you are one of these rare individuals that really does well with moderation‚Äîand that does sound pretty moderate if you‚Äôre just doing a little coke‚Äîya, I think that is all right.‚ÄùThe problem is that for so many people, the brain‚Äôs adaptive nature makes moderation so difficult.‚ÄúLuxuries become habits, habits become compulsions, and compulsions become addictions,‚Äù Grisel says.In addition to the imperative of moderation, the other major piece of advice that Grisel offers in Never Enough is for kids to stay away from drugs. It‚Äôs not a ‚ÄúJust say no‚Äù message she‚Äôs borrowed from the DARE program. There are very real reasons to wait, she explains.‚ÄúUntil you are 25, the brain is still being organized,‚Äù Grisel says. ‚ÄúSo if you perturb it while it is still being organized‚Äîduring development‚Äîthen it alters the organizational structure. Whereas if the basic scaffolding is all laid down, once the pathways are all basically set‚Äîwhich they are sometime between 23 and 25‚Äîthen you are more-likely to be able to undo it [changes to the brain made by using drugs].‚ÄùNever Enough also includes lessons that apply to the war on drugs and which can inform North America‚Äôs response to the opioid epidemic. For example, Grisel says, it‚Äôs time for an honest assessment of criminalization.‚ÄúIf punishment worked, surely we would see diminishing numbers of addicts, and we don‚Äôt. We see more and more,‚Äù Grisel says. ‚ÄúI think it is alienating, to say to people, ‚ÄòYou are bad and you‚Äôve got to not be bad and we‚Äôre going to help you not be bad by doing bad things to you‚Äô.‚ÄùThe same sort of logical evaluation led her to support harm reduction at a time when the Ontario government and states such as Washington, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts are debating the merits of supervised-injection facilities like Vancouver‚Äôs Insite.‚ÄúI think supervised injection is a great idea, because I don‚Äôt think punishment works,‚Äù Grisel says. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it condones using. It is just trying to say, ‚ÄòHere‚Äôs a safe place‚Äô.‚ÄúWe should use every strategy we can to support people to be healthy,‚Äù Grisel continues. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like we‚Äôre going to teach people not to use by letting them die. That won‚Äôt work.‚Äù"
176,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57980946-sarah-bradley,5,"I'm always tentative to read books about neuroscience. Having studied the subject in college, usually mainstream books about neuroscience are too watered down and I feel as though I'm not really learning much. This book was the perfect balance between presenting the topic of addiction in a way that made sense to a naive reader, but was still engaging for people already familiar with the subject. I also really appreciated Grisel's own personal journey with addiction. By weaving together her narrative with the more scientific descriptions of drugs/drug use, the book was not only accessible to a wide range of readers, but was also extremely engaging. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone curious about the widespread epidemic of addiction that our world currently faces. "
177,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4952371-polly,4,"A compelling, important read offering a uniquely new perspective of addiction."
178,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58281897-david-elliott,4,"A strange book that‚Äôs not 100% convinced of its reason to exist, but is still fascinating and often moving. Grisel is ultimately pessimistic about the potential of modern neuroscience to prevent or ‚Äòcure‚Äô addiction. In her telling, drugs are an escape from alienation, and addiction an inevitable consequence of drug abuse - so the only way to get rid of addiction is to promote connection. ‚ÄúOf course biology is involved!‚Äù she writes in the final chapter. ‚ÄúBut the insistence on starting and ending within an addict‚Äôs head is not only misguided but insidious.‚Äù It‚Äôs a weird sentence to read after 200 pages of insightful, expert commentary on what goes on inside addicts‚Äô heads.And you do learn a lot! Grisel equips you with simple but powerful intellectual tools to understand the fundamental processes underlying addiction. Her introduction to the Opponent-Process model, a unifying thread in the book, is crystal clear, and was for me an a-ha moment in how it brought together tolerance and withdrawal as two sides of the same coin. Subsequent chapters examine different drug families in turn - opiates, alcohol, tranquilizers, stimulants, psychedelics. There‚Äôs enough that unites each drug family to keep you on board, and enough that‚Äôs different to keep you interested. Two chapters on risk factors (super interesting) and ‚ÄòSolving Addiction‚Äô (less so) round things off. It‚Äôs a short book, but a dense one.Grisel‚Äôs writing style is by turns aggressively pulpy (cocaine is ‚Äúthe sole porn shop in a down and out town‚Äù) and drily technical. The endless roll-call of neurotransmitters, agonists, receptors and transporters can read a little like a Wikipedia article. But colour comes by way of anecdotes from her own experience as an abuser of any drugs she could get her hands on. Grisel‚Äôs account of these times are stony-eyed and unsentimental in a way that feels typical of the recovering addict. There‚Äôs something cold and admirable about the way she mines the darkest moments of her past for examples of particular psychopharmacological mechanisms and phenomena. It‚Äôs like watching someone test a vaccine on themselves. Something I appreciated about her telling of these cautionary tales was how consistently she humanises her fellow addicts. There‚Äôs something valuable in seeing a distinguished academic refer to other addicts as her friends. She doesn‚Äôt romanticise these relationships in any way; in fact she never misses a chance to remind the reader of how quickly the addict will throw his friends under the bus if an opportunity to score presents itself. But this is always framed as a condemnation of the drug, not the person who has been made its prisoner. Many of her friends were not able to turn their life around in the same way that Grisel did and it often was the end of them. If you have a soft spot for any drug, chances are you will find disillusionment within these pages. I found the section/lament on MDMA/ecstasy particularly sobering. I‚Äôve had profound experiences with MDMA before. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not alone among MDMA users in once upon a time thinking that it was a drug that could change the world for the better. But, for all her acknowledgment of how universally positive the subjective experience of the MDMA high is, Grisel doesn‚Äôt hold back in describing the lasting neurological damage it does. No drug really comes out of this book looking particularly good. The one exception is, you may have guessed, psychedelics. Grisel is cautiously optimistic about LSD, psilocybin, DMT and the like, and she clearly leaves the door open to maybe, possibly one day trying them again herself.She‚Äôs less convincing on the few occasions when she strays out of her area of scientific expertise and into the political, legal and economic debates around the place of drugs in society and what could or should be the state‚Äôs disposition towards them. When discussing ephedra, a plant-based stimulant that can cause adverse reactions in users, she notes that the supplement industry invested heavily in a campaign to persuade the regulators that ephedra was safe and therefore should not be classified - but ‚Äúeventually, science prevailed and ephedra-containing dietary supplements were made illegal in the United States.‚Äù The casual equation ‚Äòdangerous‚Äô = ‚Äòshould be made illegal‚Äô isn‚Äôt examined. If ‚Äòscience prevailing‚Äô is the same War on Drugs that she notes a couple of chapters later was an unmitigated failure, science may have some things to answer for.But all in all Never Enough is definitely worth a read, especially as a critical counterpoint to the legalisation and harm reduction literature. One last note - this is 100% about addiction to drugs. I came to Never Enough with vague ideas about how my addiction to rolling news content and Twitter might be fuelling my anxiety. Might addiction be a valuable model for understanding other damaging behaviours? Maybe, but not here. Grisel limits herself to talking about the action of drugs on the brain. I think the book is probably stronger for it."
179,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2587406-elk,0,"Though plausible, I should mention that an elegant hypothesis is no substitute for definitive data. As time has passed we have learned that everything from the bacteria in our guts to the interactions we had in middle school partly determines our behavior. In fact, it's beginning to seem that the brain is more like a stage for a life to be acted out upon than like the director behind a curtain calling shots. _____Because we encounter an ever-variable environment as we go about our day, if our neural activity simply reflected all of this input, like the ocean in the midst of a storm, then the tossed pebble, or even a boulder, could have no perceptible impact. In neuro-parlance, the ratio of signal to noise would be too low. In order for a stimulus to be detected, let alone interpreted as meaningful, the neural signal must be greater than the background noise--or the noise must be quashed.The fundamental role of the brain is to be a contrast detector. As experiences are distinguished from monotony, they spark neurochemical changes in specific brain circuits, informing us of all we care to know: opportunities for food, drink, or sex; danger or pain; beauty and pleasure, for example._____In their opponentprocess theory, Solomon and Corbit made the case‚Äù that feeling states are maintained around a ‚Äúset point‚Äù just as body temperature and water balance are. They proposed that any feeling, including good, bad, happy, depressed, or excited, for example, represents a disruption of the stable feeling state that we perceive as neutral. Specifically, the opponentprocess theory posits that any stimulus that alters brain functioning to affect the way we feel will illicit a response from the brain that is exactly opposite to the effect of the stimulus._____To sport would be as tedious as to work; But when they seldom come, they wished-for come, And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents. Than that which hath no foil to set it off.Henry IV, Part 1_____The very definition of an addictive drug is one that stimulates the mesolimbic pathway, but there are three general axioms in psychopharmacology that also apply to all drugs:1. All drugs act by changing the rate of what is already going on.2. All drugs have side effects.3. The brain adapts to all drugs that affect it by counteracting the drug‚Äôs effects._____Among the most astounding findings in recent neuroscience is the context-dependent nature of all neural activity. Even as our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are products of neurochemical brain activity, what gives rise to this activity is mostly not in our brains. Rather, our brains express the evolutionary, social, and cultural context we occupy... It follows that the answer to the addiction crisis is not solely in the brain, but must include the context. More than ever before in our evolutionary history, we possess a keen awareness of widespread tragedy and suffering in the world. This is the painful context in which our attempts to avert and deny the burden of consciousness have grown more and more desperate and widespread._____So who‚Äôs to blame for the epidemic of addiction? The truth is no one is to blame, but we are all responsible. Though any search for for a cause (or a cure) is bound to fall short, one source of this epidemic is our unwillingness to bear our own pain, along with our failure to look upon the suffering of others with compassion... The history of every science begins with the individual and progresses to the connected collective. Botany began by cataloging specimens and now understands the health of any species depends on an ecological landscape. _____Together we nourish the epidemic of addiction by espousing false dichotomies like ""us"" versus ""them"" or ""well"" versus ""sick."" In doing so, we embrace the myth that happiness can be persued at the individual level, and therefore perpetuate a culture of isolation and alienation...Though there is still much to learn in and out of laboratory settings, we have enough cumulative data to recognize that we/our brains are shaped and constrained by much, much more than our individual biology. And of all of these influences, perhaps the most immediate and impactful, and therefore potentially helpful for realizing change, are our connections with each other. We affect each other, including each other's neurobiology, neurochemistry, and behavior, in ways that are direct and profound. As we grapple to respond to the growing population of addicts, we'd do well to recognize that disordered use comes from, thrives in, and creates alienation."

203,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86576157-minervas-owl,4,"As a drug addict turned neuroscientist, Judith Grisel teaches the science of addiction while telling her personal redemption story. The book is intriguing from the beginning to the end. Judith introduces Richard Solomon's opponent-process theory as a unified explanation of addiction. According to this theory, our brain always adapts to a stimulus by creating an opponent process. That's why skydivers feel exhilarated after landing. In the case of drug use, the longer and more frequent the use, the stronger and long-lasting the counterbalancing effect the brain produces. Over time, this opposite effect not only makes the drug less effective, but also leads to withdrawal symptoms and craving. In the end, drug abusers no longer use to get high, but merely to escape from the agony of withdrawal.  The author's explanation of the theory is clear. I find the two graphs of the a/b process (what the drug does to the brain/brain's opponent response) especially illustrative and self-explanatory. I can understand why Judith claims they are on her shortlist of tattoo design. Nevertheless, when I found the theory was proposed in 1974, I was a bit disappointed that the book did not introduce the more recent development of the theory. Nor did the author introduce other hypotheses on addiction, such as incentive sensitization, which claims repeated exposure to drugs leads to wanting independent of liking. Each subsequent chapter then introduces the chemistry and physiology of an individual category of substance: cannabinoids, opiates, alcohol, tranquilizers, stimulants, psychedelics, and others. Judith's vivid description of her own drug use experience makes her scientific reports convincing and mesmerizing. She also makes good use of analogy and comparison. For example, she mentions alcohol acts like a sledgehammer, affecting so many functions of the brain, while cocaine acts like a laser, stimulating with the fewest side effects. It's much harder to pin down the neurological effects of alcohol than cocaine, she says, because the molecule of alcohol is much smaller and structurally simpler, and ""there are many more places to park a skateboard than an airplane."" Notwithstanding, sometimes, empirical facts such as stereotypy are laid out unexplained, and scientific discoveries scattered and unorganized. Half of my interest in this book stemmed from a sinful wish to know how ""interesting"" various drugs are; my thirst was quenched. Sometimes Judith almost talks about drugs with nostalgia, such as how she used to spend hours stoned on the beach, searching for shells and listening to waves, enjoying every sense of hers enriched by weed. But the more important lesson I learned from the book is why addiction is bad. The drug experience, no matter it's euphoria or tranquility, always dies out over time, driving one into a search in vain of lost joy. Moreover, addiction strips you of choice, making you the worst enemy of yourself. I've never tried drugs, but the lesson is relevant. The threat lies in not only chemicals but also the internet, smartphone, food, game, and others. Drug addiction, as the extreme case of obsession, makes me reevaluate the consequences of being hooked."

205,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67837453-travis-lupick,3,"This is not a review but is based on an interview I had with the author. It was originally published in the Georgia Straight newspaper.Judith Grisel enjoyed using drugs. Cannabis, especially.‚ÄúIn many ways my relationship with the drug was among the purest and most wonderful relationships of my life,‚Äù she writes in Never Enough: The Neuroscience and Experience of Addiction (Doubleday, February 2019). ‚ÄúFrom the first time I got high until long after I‚Äôd smoked my last bowl, I loved the drug like a best friend.‚ÄùThe behavioral neuroscientist and professor of psychology at Pennsylvania‚Äôs Bucknell University also once had an intense love-hate relationship with cocaine, and pretty much any mind-altering substance within reach.It‚Äôs been three decades since she stopped using drugs, save for her daily use of the coffee bean. But Grisel concedes she sometimes misses them, and still sees potential benefits in the occasional use of certain substances; psychedelics, primarily, which she notes new research suggests may help some people with mental-health issues such as PTSD.And so, Grisel told the Straight, in that regard, it‚Äôs a sad story she tells in Never Enough. It turns out that mind-altering drugs simply aren‚Äôt good for you, cannabis included.‚ÄúUsing drugs to change the way we think, feel, and behave, is ancient and universal,‚Äù Grisel says in a telephone interview. ‚ÄúI do think that, not only is it natural, but that there are some benefits. I might have not survived my childhood without all that weed, now that I think about it. So I‚Äôm not against it. But I do think that addiction takes all the fun out of it, and that there are consequences for people, their families, and society.‚ÄùGrisel sought an education and then a career in neuroscience because of her addiction to drugs. The book recounts how she entered the field with the goal of finding a ‚Äúcure‚Äù.‚ÄúI thought that if I could find the cellular switch that flipped somewhere between my third and my fourth drinks, or each time a promising bag was within my sight, and then find a way to keep this switch in the ‚Äòoff‚Äô position, I might be able to refrain from‚Ä¶spending all my tips on very temporary thrills, or making blacked-out road trips to Dallas,‚Äù she writes.Nearly three decades into her search, Grisel writes that she‚Äôs learned the problem is not so much the drugs, per se, but rather the human brain‚Äôs powerful ability to respond to the altered chemistry that drugs produce.‚ÄúThere will never be enough drug, because the brain‚Äôs capacity to learn and adapt is basically infinite,‚Äù reads Never Enough. ‚ÄúWhat was once a normal state punctuated by periods of high inexorably transforms to a state of desperation that is only temporarily subdued.‚ÄùWhile a cure for addiction remains elusive, there‚Äôs never been a more urgent need to pursue the question.Opioids alone killed nearly 4,000 people across Canada in 2017, up from roughly 3,000 the previous year, according to Health Canada. In the United States, 47,600 people died after taking opioids in 2017, up from 42,400 in 2016, according to the U.S. National Institute on Drug Use. It‚Äôs one of the worst health crises the continent has ever experienced, and there‚Äôs no end in sight.With a tidy writing structure that weaves personal anecdotes alongside accessible science, Never Enough describes how the brain of someone addicted to drugs changes as the time they struggle with their drug use drags on.The book focuses on neurochemistry, but Grisel emphasizes that addiction is generally the result of a combination of genetic predisposition, developmental influences, and environmental input.‚ÄúSince the beginning of when we‚Äôve kept records, people have been using drugs to change the way they feel. So what‚Äôs different? Why do we have so much addiction now?‚Äù Grisel asks. ‚ÄúIsolation. Generally, in our distant history, it [drug use] was a communal activity, with spiritual or at least cultural overtones. It was something people did together. So using alone [is what‚Äôs different].‚ÄùGrisel‚Äôs measured take on drugs means it‚Äôs not all bad news for everyone who enjoys a little help to keep the party going.‚ÄúTo the banker who uses cocaine once every four-to-six weeks, I would say, ‚ÄòGood for you‚Äô. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs so terrible,‚Äù Grisel says. ‚ÄúIf you are one of these rare individuals that really does well with moderation‚Äîand that does sound pretty moderate if you‚Äôre just doing a little coke‚Äîya, I think that is all right.‚ÄùThe problem is that for so many people, the brain‚Äôs adaptive nature makes moderation so difficult.‚ÄúLuxuries become habits, habits become compulsions, and compulsions become addictions,‚Äù Grisel says.In addition to the imperative of moderation, the other major piece of advice that Grisel offers in Never Enough is for kids to stay away from drugs. It‚Äôs not a ‚ÄúJust say no‚Äù message she‚Äôs borrowed from the DARE program. There are very real reasons to wait, she explains.‚ÄúUntil you are 25, the brain is still being organized,‚Äù Grisel says. ‚ÄúSo if you perturb it while it is still being organized‚Äîduring development‚Äîthen it alters the organizational structure. Whereas if the basic scaffolding is all laid down, once the pathways are all basically set‚Äîwhich they are sometime between 23 and 25‚Äîthen you are more-likely to be able to undo it [changes to the brain made by using drugs].‚ÄùNever Enough also includes lessons that apply to the war on drugs and which can inform North America‚Äôs response to the opioid epidemic. For example, Grisel says, it‚Äôs time for an honest assessment of criminalization.‚ÄúIf punishment worked, surely we would see diminishing numbers of addicts, and we don‚Äôt. We see more and more,‚Äù Grisel says. ‚ÄúI think it is alienating, to say to people, ‚ÄòYou are bad and you‚Äôve got to not be bad and we‚Äôre going to help you not be bad by doing bad things to you‚Äô.‚ÄùThe same sort of logical evaluation led her to support harm reduction at a time when the Ontario government and states such as Washington, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts are debating the merits of supervised-injection facilities like Vancouver‚Äôs Insite.‚ÄúI think supervised injection is a great idea, because I don‚Äôt think punishment works,‚Äù Grisel says. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it condones using. It is just trying to say, ‚ÄòHere‚Äôs a safe place‚Äô.‚ÄúWe should use every strategy we can to support people to be healthy,‚Äù Grisel continues. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like we‚Äôre going to teach people not to use by letting them die. That won‚Äôt work.‚Äù"
206,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57980946-sarah-bradley,5,"I'm always tentative to read books about neuroscience. Having studied the subject in college, usually mainstream books about neuroscience are too watered down and I feel as though I'm not really learning much. This book was the perfect balance between presenting the topic of addiction in a way that made sense to a naive reader, but was still engaging for people already familiar with the subject. I also really appreciated Grisel's own personal journey with addiction. By weaving together her narrative with the more scientific descriptions of drugs/drug use, the book was not only accessible to a wide range of readers, but was also extremely engaging. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone curious about the widespread epidemic of addiction that our world currently faces. "
207,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4952371-polly,4,"A compelling, important read offering a uniquely new perspective of addiction."
208,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58281897-david-elliott,4,"A strange book that‚Äôs not 100% convinced of its reason to exist, but is still fascinating and often moving. Grisel is ultimately pessimistic about the potential of modern neuroscience to prevent or ‚Äòcure‚Äô addiction. In her telling, drugs are an escape from alienation, and addiction an inevitable consequence of drug abuse - so the only way to get rid of addiction is to promote connection. ‚ÄúOf course biology is involved!‚Äù she writes in the final chapter. ‚ÄúBut the insistence on starting and ending within an addict‚Äôs head is not only misguided but insidious.‚Äù It‚Äôs a weird sentence to read after 200 pages of insightful, expert commentary on what goes on inside addicts‚Äô heads.And you do learn a lot! Grisel equips you with simple but powerful intellectual tools to understand the fundamental processes underlying addiction. Her introduction to the Opponent-Process model, a unifying thread in the book, is crystal clear, and was for me an a-ha moment in how it brought together tolerance and withdrawal as two sides of the same coin. Subsequent chapters examine different drug families in turn - opiates, alcohol, tranquilizers, stimulants, psychedelics. There‚Äôs enough that unites each drug family to keep you on board, and enough that‚Äôs different to keep you interested. Two chapters on risk factors (super interesting) and ‚ÄòSolving Addiction‚Äô (less so) round things off. It‚Äôs a short book, but a dense one.Grisel‚Äôs writing style is by turns aggressively pulpy (cocaine is ‚Äúthe sole porn shop in a down and out town‚Äù) and drily technical. The endless roll-call of neurotransmitters, agonists, receptors and transporters can read a little like a Wikipedia article. But colour comes by way of anecdotes from her own experience as an abuser of any drugs she could get her hands on. Grisel‚Äôs account of these times are stony-eyed and unsentimental in a way that feels typical of the recovering addict. There‚Äôs something cold and admirable about the way she mines the darkest moments of her past for examples of particular psychopharmacological mechanisms and phenomena. It‚Äôs like watching someone test a vaccine on themselves. Something I appreciated about her telling of these cautionary tales was how consistently she humanises her fellow addicts. There‚Äôs something valuable in seeing a distinguished academic refer to other addicts as her friends. She doesn‚Äôt romanticise these relationships in any way; in fact she never misses a chance to remind the reader of how quickly the addict will throw his friends under the bus if an opportunity to score presents itself. But this is always framed as a condemnation of the drug, not the person who has been made its prisoner. Many of her friends were not able to turn their life around in the same way that Grisel did and it often was the end of them. If you have a soft spot for any drug, chances are you will find disillusionment within these pages. I found the section/lament on MDMA/ecstasy particularly sobering. I‚Äôve had profound experiences with MDMA before. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not alone among MDMA users in once upon a time thinking that it was a drug that could change the world for the better. But, for all her acknowledgment of how universally positive the subjective experience of the MDMA high is, Grisel doesn‚Äôt hold back in describing the lasting neurological damage it does. No drug really comes out of this book looking particularly good. The one exception is, you may have guessed, psychedelics. Grisel is cautiously optimistic about LSD, psilocybin, DMT and the like, and she clearly leaves the door open to maybe, possibly one day trying them again herself.She‚Äôs less convincing on the few occasions when she strays out of her area of scientific expertise and into the political, legal and economic debates around the place of drugs in society and what could or should be the state‚Äôs disposition towards them. When discussing ephedra, a plant-based stimulant that can cause adverse reactions in users, she notes that the supplement industry invested heavily in a campaign to persuade the regulators that ephedra was safe and therefore should not be classified - but ‚Äúeventually, science prevailed and ephedra-containing dietary supplements were made illegal in the United States.‚Äù The casual equation ‚Äòdangerous‚Äô = ‚Äòshould be made illegal‚Äô isn‚Äôt examined. If ‚Äòscience prevailing‚Äô is the same War on Drugs that she notes a couple of chapters later was an unmitigated failure, science may have some things to answer for.But all in all Never Enough is definitely worth a read, especially as a critical counterpoint to the legalisation and harm reduction literature. One last note - this is 100% about addiction to drugs. I came to Never Enough with vague ideas about how my addiction to rolling news content and Twitter might be fuelling my anxiety. Might addiction be a valuable model for understanding other damaging behaviours? Maybe, but not here. Grisel limits herself to talking about the action of drugs on the brain. I think the book is probably stronger for it."
209,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2587406-elk,0,"Though plausible, I should mention that an elegant hypothesis is no substitute for definitive data. As time has passed we have learned that everything from the bacteria in our guts to the interactions we had in middle school partly determines our behavior. In fact, it's beginning to seem that the brain is more like a stage for a life to be acted out upon than like the director behind a curtain calling shots. _____Because we encounter an ever-variable environment as we go about our day, if our neural activity simply reflected all of this input, like the ocean in the midst of a storm, then the tossed pebble, or even a boulder, could have no perceptible impact. In neuro-parlance, the ratio of signal to noise would be too low. In order for a stimulus to be detected, let alone interpreted as meaningful, the neural signal must be greater than the background noise--or the noise must be quashed.The fundamental role of the brain is to be a contrast detector. As experiences are distinguished from monotony, they spark neurochemical changes in specific brain circuits, informing us of all we care to know: opportunities for food, drink, or sex; danger or pain; beauty and pleasure, for example._____In their opponentprocess theory, Solomon and Corbit made the case‚Äù that feeling states are maintained around a ‚Äúset point‚Äù just as body temperature and water balance are. They proposed that any feeling, including good, bad, happy, depressed, or excited, for example, represents a disruption of the stable feeling state that we perceive as neutral. Specifically, the opponentprocess theory posits that any stimulus that alters brain functioning to affect the way we feel will illicit a response from the brain that is exactly opposite to the effect of the stimulus._____To sport would be as tedious as to work; But when they seldom come, they wished-for come, And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents. Than that which hath no foil to set it off.Henry IV, Part 1_____The very definition of an addictive drug is one that stimulates the mesolimbic pathway, but there are three general axioms in psychopharmacology that also apply to all drugs:1. All drugs act by changing the rate of what is already going on.2. All drugs have side effects.3. The brain adapts to all drugs that affect it by counteracting the drug‚Äôs effects._____Among the most astounding findings in recent neuroscience is the context-dependent nature of all neural activity. Even as our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are products of neurochemical brain activity, what gives rise to this activity is mostly not in our brains. Rather, our brains express the evolutionary, social, and cultural context we occupy... It follows that the answer to the addiction crisis is not solely in the brain, but must include the context. More than ever before in our evolutionary history, we possess a keen awareness of widespread tragedy and suffering in the world. This is the painful context in which our attempts to avert and deny the burden of consciousness have grown more and more desperate and widespread._____So who‚Äôs to blame for the epidemic of addiction? The truth is no one is to blame, but we are all responsible. Though any search for for a cause (or a cure) is bound to fall short, one source of this epidemic is our unwillingness to bear our own pain, along with our failure to look upon the suffering of others with compassion... The history of every science begins with the individual and progresses to the connected collective. Botany began by cataloging specimens and now understands the health of any species depends on an ecological landscape. _____Together we nourish the epidemic of addiction by espousing false dichotomies like ""us"" versus ""them"" or ""well"" versus ""sick."" In doing so, we embrace the myth that happiness can be persued at the individual level, and therefore perpetuate a culture of isolation and alienation...Though there is still much to learn in and out of laboratory settings, we have enough cumulative data to recognize that we/our brains are shaped and constrained by much, much more than our individual biology. And of all of these influences, perhaps the most immediate and impactful, and therefore potentially helpful for realizing change, are our connections with each other. We affect each other, including each other's neurobiology, neurochemistry, and behavior, in ways that are direct and profound. As we grapple to respond to the growing population of addicts, we'd do well to recognize that disordered use comes from, thrives in, and creates alienation."
210,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/304366-ian,5,"Grisel does two things really well in this book. She gets to the marrow of what an addict's life is because she lived it before she found recovery and got her professional credentials.

233,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86576157-minervas-owl,4,"As a drug addict turned neuroscientist, Judith Grisel teaches the science of addiction while telling her personal redemption story. The book is intriguing from the beginning to the end. Judith introduces Richard Solomon's opponent-process theory as a unified explanation of addiction. According to this theory, our brain always adapts to a stimulus by creating an opponent process. That's why skydivers feel exhilarated after landing. In the case of drug use, the longer and more frequent the use, the stronger and long-lasting the counterbalancing effect the brain produces. Over time, this opposite effect not only makes the drug less effective, but also leads to withdrawal symptoms and craving. In the end, drug abusers no longer use to get high, but merely to escape from the agony of withdrawal.  The author's explanation of the theory is clear. I find the two graphs of the a/b process (what the drug does to the brain/brain's opponent response) especially illustrative and self-explanatory. I can understand why Judith claims they are on her shortlist of tattoo design. Nevertheless, when I found the theory was proposed in 1974, I was a bit disappointed that the book did not introduce the more recent development of the theory. Nor did the author introduce other hypotheses on addiction, such as incentive sensitization, which claims repeated exposure to drugs leads to wanting independent of liking. Each subsequent chapter then introduces the chemistry and physiology of an individual category of substance: cannabinoids, opiates, alcohol, tranquilizers, stimulants, psychedelics, and others. Judith's vivid description of her own drug use experience makes her scientific reports convincing and mesmerizing. She also makes good use of analogy and comparison. For example, she mentions alcohol acts like a sledgehammer, affecting so many functions of the brain, while cocaine acts like a laser, stimulating with the fewest side effects. It's much harder to pin down the neurological effects of alcohol than cocaine, she says, because the molecule of alcohol is much smaller and structurally simpler, and ""there are many more places to park a skateboard than an airplane."" Notwithstanding, sometimes, empirical facts such as stereotypy are laid out unexplained, and scientific discoveries scattered and unorganized. Half of my interest in this book stemmed from a sinful wish to know how ""interesting"" various drugs are; my thirst was quenched. Sometimes Judith almost talks about drugs with nostalgia, such as how she used to spend hours stoned on the beach, searching for shells and listening to waves, enjoying every sense of hers enriched by weed. But the more important lesson I learned from the book is why addiction is bad. The drug experience, no matter it's euphoria or tranquility, always dies out over time, driving one into a search in vain of lost joy. Moreover, addiction strips you of choice, making you the worst enemy of yourself. I've never tried drugs, but the lesson is relevant. The threat lies in not only chemicals but also the internet, smartphone, food, game, and others. Drug addiction, as the extreme case of obsession, makes me reevaluate the consequences of being hooked."

235,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67837453-travis-lupick,3,"This is not a review but is based on an interview I had with the author. It was originally published in the Georgia Straight newspaper.Judith Grisel enjoyed using drugs. Cannabis, especially.‚ÄúIn many ways my relationship with the drug was among the purest and most wonderful relationships of my life,‚Äù she writes in Never Enough: The Neuroscience and Experience of Addiction (Doubleday, February 2019). ‚ÄúFrom the first time I got high until long after I‚Äôd smoked my last bowl, I loved the drug like a best friend.‚ÄùThe behavioral neuroscientist and professor of psychology at Pennsylvania‚Äôs Bucknell University also once had an intense love-hate relationship with cocaine, and pretty much any mind-altering substance within reach.It‚Äôs been three decades since she stopped using drugs, save for her daily use of the coffee bean. But Grisel concedes she sometimes misses them, and still sees potential benefits in the occasional use of certain substances; psychedelics, primarily, which she notes new research suggests may help some people with mental-health issues such as PTSD.And so, Grisel told the Straight, in that regard, it‚Äôs a sad story she tells in Never Enough. It turns out that mind-altering drugs simply aren‚Äôt good for you, cannabis included.‚ÄúUsing drugs to change the way we think, feel, and behave, is ancient and universal,‚Äù Grisel says in a telephone interview. ‚ÄúI do think that, not only is it natural, but that there are some benefits. I might have not survived my childhood without all that weed, now that I think about it. So I‚Äôm not against it. But I do think that addiction takes all the fun out of it, and that there are consequences for people, their families, and society.‚ÄùGrisel sought an education and then a career in neuroscience because of her addiction to drugs. The book recounts how she entered the field with the goal of finding a ‚Äúcure‚Äù.‚ÄúI thought that if I could find the cellular switch that flipped somewhere between my third and my fourth drinks, or each time a promising bag was within my sight, and then find a way to keep this switch in the ‚Äòoff‚Äô position, I might be able to refrain from‚Ä¶spending all my tips on very temporary thrills, or making blacked-out road trips to Dallas,‚Äù she writes.Nearly three decades into her search, Grisel writes that she‚Äôs learned the problem is not so much the drugs, per se, but rather the human brain‚Äôs powerful ability to respond to the altered chemistry that drugs produce.‚ÄúThere will never be enough drug, because the brain‚Äôs capacity to learn and adapt is basically infinite,‚Äù reads Never Enough. ‚ÄúWhat was once a normal state punctuated by periods of high inexorably transforms to a state of desperation that is only temporarily subdued.‚ÄùWhile a cure for addiction remains elusive, there‚Äôs never been a more urgent need to pursue the question.Opioids alone killed nearly 4,000 people across Canada in 2017, up from roughly 3,000 the previous year, according to Health Canada. In the United States, 47,600 people died after taking opioids in 2017, up from 42,400 in 2016, according to the U.S. National Institute on Drug Use. It‚Äôs one of the worst health crises the continent has ever experienced, and there‚Äôs no end in sight.With a tidy writing structure that weaves personal anecdotes alongside accessible science, Never Enough describes how the brain of someone addicted to drugs changes as the time they struggle with their drug use drags on.The book focuses on neurochemistry, but Grisel emphasizes that addiction is generally the result of a combination of genetic predisposition, developmental influences, and environmental input.‚ÄúSince the beginning of when we‚Äôve kept records, people have been using drugs to change the way they feel. So what‚Äôs different? Why do we have so much addiction now?‚Äù Grisel asks. ‚ÄúIsolation. Generally, in our distant history, it [drug use] was a communal activity, with spiritual or at least cultural overtones. It was something people did together. So using alone [is what‚Äôs different].‚ÄùGrisel‚Äôs measured take on drugs means it‚Äôs not all bad news for everyone who enjoys a little help to keep the party going.‚ÄúTo the banker who uses cocaine once every four-to-six weeks, I would say, ‚ÄòGood for you‚Äô. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs so terrible,‚Äù Grisel says. ‚ÄúIf you are one of these rare individuals that really does well with moderation‚Äîand that does sound pretty moderate if you‚Äôre just doing a little coke‚Äîya, I think that is all right.‚ÄùThe problem is that for so many people, the brain‚Äôs adaptive nature makes moderation so difficult.‚ÄúLuxuries become habits, habits become compulsions, and compulsions become addictions,‚Äù Grisel says.In addition to the imperative of moderation, the other major piece of advice that Grisel offers in Never Enough is for kids to stay away from drugs. It‚Äôs not a ‚ÄúJust say no‚Äù message she‚Äôs borrowed from the DARE program. There are very real reasons to wait, she explains.‚ÄúUntil you are 25, the brain is still being organized,‚Äù Grisel says. ‚ÄúSo if you perturb it while it is still being organized‚Äîduring development‚Äîthen it alters the organizational structure. Whereas if the basic scaffolding is all laid down, once the pathways are all basically set‚Äîwhich they are sometime between 23 and 25‚Äîthen you are more-likely to be able to undo it [changes to the brain made by using drugs].‚ÄùNever Enough also includes lessons that apply to the war on drugs and which can inform North America‚Äôs response to the opioid epidemic. For example, Grisel says, it‚Äôs time for an honest assessment of criminalization.‚ÄúIf punishment worked, surely we would see diminishing numbers of addicts, and we don‚Äôt. We see more and more,‚Äù Grisel says. ‚ÄúI think it is alienating, to say to people, ‚ÄòYou are bad and you‚Äôve got to not be bad and we‚Äôre going to help you not be bad by doing bad things to you‚Äô.‚ÄùThe same sort of logical evaluation led her to support harm reduction at a time when the Ontario government and states such as Washington, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts are debating the merits of supervised-injection facilities like Vancouver‚Äôs Insite.‚ÄúI think supervised injection is a great idea, because I don‚Äôt think punishment works,‚Äù Grisel says. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it condones using. It is just trying to say, ‚ÄòHere‚Äôs a safe place‚Äô.‚ÄúWe should use every strategy we can to support people to be healthy,‚Äù Grisel continues. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like we‚Äôre going to teach people not to use by letting them die. That won‚Äôt work.‚Äù"
236,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57980946-sarah-bradley,5,"I'm always tentative to read books about neuroscience. Having studied the subject in college, usually mainstream books about neuroscience are too watered down and I feel as though I'm not really learning much. This book was the perfect balance between presenting the topic of addiction in a way that made sense to a naive reader, but was still engaging for people already familiar with the subject. I also really appreciated Grisel's own personal journey with addiction. By weaving together her narrative with the more scientific descriptions of drugs/drug use, the book was not only accessible to a wide range of readers, but was also extremely engaging. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone curious about the widespread epidemic of addiction that our world currently faces. "
237,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4952371-polly,4,"A compelling, important read offering a uniquely new perspective of addiction."
238,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58281897-david-elliott,4,"A strange book that‚Äôs not 100% convinced of its reason to exist, but is still fascinating and often moving. Grisel is ultimately pessimistic about the potential of modern neuroscience to prevent or ‚Äòcure‚Äô addiction. In her telling, drugs are an escape from alienation, and addiction an inevitable consequence of drug abuse - so the only way to get rid of addiction is to promote connection. ‚ÄúOf course biology is involved!‚Äù she writes in the final chapter. ‚ÄúBut the insistence on starting and ending within an addict‚Äôs head is not only misguided but insidious.‚Äù It‚Äôs a weird sentence to read after 200 pages of insightful, expert commentary on what goes on inside addicts‚Äô heads.And you do learn a lot! Grisel equips you with simple but powerful intellectual tools to understand the fundamental processes underlying addiction. Her introduction to the Opponent-Process model, a unifying thread in the book, is crystal clear, and was for me an a-ha moment in how it brought together tolerance and withdrawal as two sides of the same coin. Subsequent chapters examine different drug families in turn - opiates, alcohol, tranquilizers, stimulants, psychedelics. There‚Äôs enough that unites each drug family to keep you on board, and enough that‚Äôs different to keep you interested. Two chapters on risk factors (super interesting) and ‚ÄòSolving Addiction‚Äô (less so) round things off. It‚Äôs a short book, but a dense one.Grisel‚Äôs writing style is by turns aggressively pulpy (cocaine is ‚Äúthe sole porn shop in a down and out town‚Äù) and drily technical. The endless roll-call of neurotransmitters, agonists, receptors and transporters can read a little like a Wikipedia article. But colour comes by way of anecdotes from her own experience as an abuser of any drugs she could get her hands on. Grisel‚Äôs account of these times are stony-eyed and unsentimental in a way that feels typical of the recovering addict. There‚Äôs something cold and admirable about the way she mines the darkest moments of her past for examples of particular psychopharmacological mechanisms and phenomena. It‚Äôs like watching someone test a vaccine on themselves. Something I appreciated about her telling of these cautionary tales was how consistently she humanises her fellow addicts. There‚Äôs something valuable in seeing a distinguished academic refer to other addicts as her friends. She doesn‚Äôt romanticise these relationships in any way; in fact she never misses a chance to remind the reader of how quickly the addict will throw his friends under the bus if an opportunity to score presents itself. But this is always framed as a condemnation of the drug, not the person who has been made its prisoner. Many of her friends were not able to turn their life around in the same way that Grisel did and it often was the end of them. If you have a soft spot for any drug, chances are you will find disillusionment within these pages. I found the section/lament on MDMA/ecstasy particularly sobering. I‚Äôve had profound experiences with MDMA before. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not alone among MDMA users in once upon a time thinking that it was a drug that could change the world for the better. But, for all her acknowledgment of how universally positive the subjective experience of the MDMA high is, Grisel doesn‚Äôt hold back in describing the lasting neurological damage it does. No drug really comes out of this book looking particularly good. The one exception is, you may have guessed, psychedelics. Grisel is cautiously optimistic about LSD, psilocybin, DMT and the like, and she clearly leaves the door open to maybe, possibly one day trying them again herself.She‚Äôs less convincing on the few occasions when she strays out of her area of scientific expertise and into the political, legal and economic debates around the place of drugs in society and what could or should be the state‚Äôs disposition towards them. When discussing ephedra, a plant-based stimulant that can cause adverse reactions in users, she notes that the supplement industry invested heavily in a campaign to persuade the regulators that ephedra was safe and therefore should not be classified - but ‚Äúeventually, science prevailed and ephedra-containing dietary supplements were made illegal in the United States.‚Äù The casual equation ‚Äòdangerous‚Äô = ‚Äòshould be made illegal‚Äô isn‚Äôt examined. If ‚Äòscience prevailing‚Äô is the same War on Drugs that she notes a couple of chapters later was an unmitigated failure, science may have some things to answer for.But all in all Never Enough is definitely worth a read, especially as a critical counterpoint to the legalisation and harm reduction literature. One last note - this is 100% about addiction to drugs. I came to Never Enough with vague ideas about how my addiction to rolling news content and Twitter might be fuelling my anxiety. Might addiction be a valuable model for understanding other damaging behaviours? Maybe, but not here. Grisel limits herself to talking about the action of drugs on the brain. I think the book is probably stronger for it."
239,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2587406-elk,0,"Though plausible, I should mention that an elegant hypothesis is no substitute for definitive data. As time has passed we have learned that everything from the bacteria in our guts to the interactions we had in middle school partly determines our behavior. In fact, it's beginning to seem that the brain is more like a stage for a life to be acted out upon than like the director behind a curtain calling shots. _____Because we encounter an ever-variable environment as we go about our day, if our neural activity simply reflected all of this input, like the ocean in the midst of a storm, then the tossed pebble, or even a boulder, could have no perceptible impact. In neuro-parlance, the ratio of signal to noise would be too low. In order for a stimulus to be detected, let alone interpreted as meaningful, the neural signal must be greater than the background noise--or the noise must be quashed.The fundamental role of the brain is to be a contrast detector. As experiences are distinguished from monotony, they spark neurochemical changes in specific brain circuits, informing us of all we care to know: opportunities for food, drink, or sex; danger or pain; beauty and pleasure, for example._____In their opponentprocess theory, Solomon and Corbit made the case‚Äù that feeling states are maintained around a ‚Äúset point‚Äù just as body temperature and water balance are. They proposed that any feeling, including good, bad, happy, depressed, or excited, for example, represents a disruption of the stable feeling state that we perceive as neutral. Specifically, the opponentprocess theory posits that any stimulus that alters brain functioning to affect the way we feel will illicit a response from the brain that is exactly opposite to the effect of the stimulus._____To sport would be as tedious as to work; But when they seldom come, they wished-for come, And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents. Than that which hath no foil to set it off.Henry IV, Part 1_____The very definition of an addictive drug is one that stimulates the mesolimbic pathway, but there are three general axioms in psychopharmacology that also apply to all drugs:1. All drugs act by changing the rate of what is already going on.2. All drugs have side effects.3. The brain adapts to all drugs that affect it by counteracting the drug‚Äôs effects._____Among the most astounding findings in recent neuroscience is the context-dependent nature of all neural activity. Even as our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are products of neurochemical brain activity, what gives rise to this activity is mostly not in our brains. Rather, our brains express the evolutionary, social, and cultural context we occupy... It follows that the answer to the addiction crisis is not solely in the brain, but must include the context. More than ever before in our evolutionary history, we possess a keen awareness of widespread tragedy and suffering in the world. This is the painful context in which our attempts to avert and deny the burden of consciousness have grown more and more desperate and widespread._____So who‚Äôs to blame for the epidemic of addiction? The truth is no one is to blame, but we are all responsible. Though any search for for a cause (or a cure) is bound to fall short, one source of this epidemic is our unwillingness to bear our own pain, along with our failure to look upon the suffering of others with compassion... The history of every science begins with the individual and progresses to the connected collective. Botany began by cataloging specimens and now understands the health of any species depends on an ecological landscape. _____Together we nourish the epidemic of addiction by espousing false dichotomies like ""us"" versus ""them"" or ""well"" versus ""sick."" In doing so, we embrace the myth that happiness can be persued at the individual level, and therefore perpetuate a culture of isolation and alienation...Though there is still much to learn in and out of laboratory settings, we have enough cumulative data to recognize that we/our brains are shaped and constrained by much, much more than our individual biology. And of all of these influences, perhaps the most immediate and impactful, and therefore potentially helpful for realizing change, are our connections with each other. We affect each other, including each other's neurobiology, neurochemistry, and behavior, in ways that are direct and profound. As we grapple to respond to the growing population of addicts, we'd do well to recognize that disordered use comes from, thrives in, and creates alienation."
240,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/304366-ian,5,"Grisel does two things really well in this book. She gets to the marrow of what an addict's life is because she lived it before she found recovery and got her professional credentials.

263,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86576157-minervas-owl,4,"As a drug addict turned neuroscientist, Judith Grisel teaches the science of addiction while telling her personal redemption story. The book is intriguing from the beginning to the end. Judith introduces Richard Solomon's opponent-process theory as a unified explanation of addiction. According to this theory, our brain always adapts to a stimulus by creating an opponent process. That's why skydivers feel exhilarated after landing. In the case of drug use, the longer and more frequent the use, the stronger and long-lasting the counterbalancing effect the brain produces. Over time, this opposite effect not only makes the drug less effective, but also leads to withdrawal symptoms and craving. In the end, drug abusers no longer use to get high, but merely to escape from the agony of withdrawal.  The author's explanation of the theory is clear. I find the two graphs of the a/b process (what the drug does to the brain/brain's opponent response) especially illustrative and self-explanatory. I can understand why Judith claims they are on her shortlist of tattoo design. Nevertheless, when I found the theory was proposed in 1974, I was a bit disappointed that the book did not introduce the more recent development of the theory. Nor did the author introduce other hypotheses on addiction, such as incentive sensitization, which claims repeated exposure to drugs leads to wanting independent of liking. Each subsequent chapter then introduces the chemistry and physiology of an individual category of substance: cannabinoids, opiates, alcohol, tranquilizers, stimulants, psychedelics, and others. Judith's vivid description of her own drug use experience makes her scientific reports convincing and mesmerizing. She also makes good use of analogy and comparison. For example, she mentions alcohol acts like a sledgehammer, affecting so many functions of the brain, while cocaine acts like a laser, stimulating with the fewest side effects. It's much harder to pin down the neurological effects of alcohol than cocaine, she says, because the molecule of alcohol is much smaller and structurally simpler, and ""there are many more places to park a skateboard than an airplane."" Notwithstanding, sometimes, empirical facts such as stereotypy are laid out unexplained, and scientific discoveries scattered and unorganized. Half of my interest in this book stemmed from a sinful wish to know how ""interesting"" various drugs are; my thirst was quenched. Sometimes Judith almost talks about drugs with nostalgia, such as how she used to spend hours stoned on the beach, searching for shells and listening to waves, enjoying every sense of hers enriched by weed. But the more important lesson I learned from the book is why addiction is bad. The drug experience, no matter it's euphoria or tranquility, always dies out over time, driving one into a search in vain of lost joy. Moreover, addiction strips you of choice, making you the worst enemy of yourself. I've never tried drugs, but the lesson is relevant. The threat lies in not only chemicals but also the internet, smartphone, food, game, and others. Drug addiction, as the extreme case of obsession, makes me reevaluate the consequences of being hooked."

265,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67837453-travis-lupick,3,"This is not a review but is based on an interview I had with the author. It was originally published in the Georgia Straight newspaper.Judith Grisel enjoyed using drugs. Cannabis, especially.‚ÄúIn many ways my relationship with the drug was among the purest and most wonderful relationships of my life,‚Äù she writes in Never Enough: The Neuroscience and Experience of Addiction (Doubleday, February 2019). ‚ÄúFrom the first time I got high until long after I‚Äôd smoked my last bowl, I loved the drug like a best friend.‚ÄùThe behavioral neuroscientist and professor of psychology at Pennsylvania‚Äôs Bucknell University also once had an intense love-hate relationship with cocaine, and pretty much any mind-altering substance within reach.It‚Äôs been three decades since she stopped using drugs, save for her daily use of the coffee bean. But Grisel concedes she sometimes misses them, and still sees potential benefits in the occasional use of certain substances; psychedelics, primarily, which she notes new research suggests may help some people with mental-health issues such as PTSD.And so, Grisel told the Straight, in that regard, it‚Äôs a sad story she tells in Never Enough. It turns out that mind-altering drugs simply aren‚Äôt good for you, cannabis included.‚ÄúUsing drugs to change the way we think, feel, and behave, is ancient and universal,‚Äù Grisel says in a telephone interview. ‚ÄúI do think that, not only is it natural, but that there are some benefits. I might have not survived my childhood without all that weed, now that I think about it. So I‚Äôm not against it. But I do think that addiction takes all the fun out of it, and that there are consequences for people, their families, and society.‚ÄùGrisel sought an education and then a career in neuroscience because of her addiction to drugs. The book recounts how she entered the field with the goal of finding a ‚Äúcure‚Äù.‚ÄúI thought that if I could find the cellular switch that flipped somewhere between my third and my fourth drinks, or each time a promising bag was within my sight, and then find a way to keep this switch in the ‚Äòoff‚Äô position, I might be able to refrain from‚Ä¶spending all my tips on very temporary thrills, or making blacked-out road trips to Dallas,‚Äù she writes.Nearly three decades into her search, Grisel writes that she‚Äôs learned the problem is not so much the drugs, per se, but rather the human brain‚Äôs powerful ability to respond to the altered chemistry that drugs produce.‚ÄúThere will never be enough drug, because the brain‚Äôs capacity to learn and adapt is basically infinite,‚Äù reads Never Enough. ‚ÄúWhat was once a normal state punctuated by periods of high inexorably transforms to a state of desperation that is only temporarily subdued.‚ÄùWhile a cure for addiction remains elusive, there‚Äôs never been a more urgent need to pursue the question.Opioids alone killed nearly 4,000 people across Canada in 2017, up from roughly 3,000 the previous year, according to Health Canada. In the United States, 47,600 people died after taking opioids in 2017, up from 42,400 in 2016, according to the U.S. National Institute on Drug Use. It‚Äôs one of the worst health crises the continent has ever experienced, and there‚Äôs no end in sight.With a tidy writing structure that weaves personal anecdotes alongside accessible science, Never Enough describes how the brain of someone addicted to drugs changes as the time they struggle with their drug use drags on.The book focuses on neurochemistry, but Grisel emphasizes that addiction is generally the result of a combination of genetic predisposition, developmental influences, and environmental input.‚ÄúSince the beginning of when we‚Äôve kept records, people have been using drugs to change the way they feel. So what‚Äôs different? Why do we have so much addiction now?‚Äù Grisel asks. ‚ÄúIsolation. Generally, in our distant history, it [drug use] was a communal activity, with spiritual or at least cultural overtones. It was something people did together. So using alone [is what‚Äôs different].‚ÄùGrisel‚Äôs measured take on drugs means it‚Äôs not all bad news for everyone who enjoys a little help to keep the party going.‚ÄúTo the banker who uses cocaine once every four-to-six weeks, I would say, ‚ÄòGood for you‚Äô. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs so terrible,‚Äù Grisel says. ‚ÄúIf you are one of these rare individuals that really does well with moderation‚Äîand that does sound pretty moderate if you‚Äôre just doing a little coke‚Äîya, I think that is all right.‚ÄùThe problem is that for so many people, the brain‚Äôs adaptive nature makes moderation so difficult.‚ÄúLuxuries become habits, habits become compulsions, and compulsions become addictions,‚Äù Grisel says.In addition to the imperative of moderation, the other major piece of advice that Grisel offers in Never Enough is for kids to stay away from drugs. It‚Äôs not a ‚ÄúJust say no‚Äù message she‚Äôs borrowed from the DARE program. There are very real reasons to wait, she explains.‚ÄúUntil you are 25, the brain is still being organized,‚Äù Grisel says. ‚ÄúSo if you perturb it while it is still being organized‚Äîduring development‚Äîthen it alters the organizational structure. Whereas if the basic scaffolding is all laid down, once the pathways are all basically set‚Äîwhich they are sometime between 23 and 25‚Äîthen you are more-likely to be able to undo it [changes to the brain made by using drugs].‚ÄùNever Enough also includes lessons that apply to the war on drugs and which can inform North America‚Äôs response to the opioid epidemic. For example, Grisel says, it‚Äôs time for an honest assessment of criminalization.‚ÄúIf punishment worked, surely we would see diminishing numbers of addicts, and we don‚Äôt. We see more and more,‚Äù Grisel says. ‚ÄúI think it is alienating, to say to people, ‚ÄòYou are bad and you‚Äôve got to not be bad and we‚Äôre going to help you not be bad by doing bad things to you‚Äô.‚ÄùThe same sort of logical evaluation led her to support harm reduction at a time when the Ontario government and states such as Washington, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts are debating the merits of supervised-injection facilities like Vancouver‚Äôs Insite.‚ÄúI think supervised injection is a great idea, because I don‚Äôt think punishment works,‚Äù Grisel says. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it condones using. It is just trying to say, ‚ÄòHere‚Äôs a safe place‚Äô.‚ÄúWe should use every strategy we can to support people to be healthy,‚Äù Grisel continues. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like we‚Äôre going to teach people not to use by letting them die. That won‚Äôt work.‚Äù"
266,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57980946-sarah-bradley,5,"I'm always tentative to read books about neuroscience. Having studied the subject in college, usually mainstream books about neuroscience are too watered down and I feel as though I'm not really learning much. This book was the perfect balance between presenting the topic of addiction in a way that made sense to a naive reader, but was still engaging for people already familiar with the subject. I also really appreciated Grisel's own personal journey with addiction. By weaving together her narrative with the more scientific descriptions of drugs/drug use, the book was not only accessible to a wide range of readers, but was also extremely engaging. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone curious about the widespread epidemic of addiction that our world currently faces. "
267,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4952371-polly,4,"A compelling, important read offering a uniquely new perspective of addiction."
268,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58281897-david-elliott,4,"A strange book that‚Äôs not 100% convinced of its reason to exist, but is still fascinating and often moving. Grisel is ultimately pessimistic about the potential of modern neuroscience to prevent or ‚Äòcure‚Äô addiction. In her telling, drugs are an escape from alienation, and addiction an inevitable consequence of drug abuse - so the only way to get rid of addiction is to promote connection. ‚ÄúOf course biology is involved!‚Äù she writes in the final chapter. ‚ÄúBut the insistence on starting and ending within an addict‚Äôs head is not only misguided but insidious.‚Äù It‚Äôs a weird sentence to read after 200 pages of insightful, expert commentary on what goes on inside addicts‚Äô heads.And you do learn a lot! Grisel equips you with simple but powerful intellectual tools to understand the fundamental processes underlying addiction. Her introduction to the Opponent-Process model, a unifying thread in the book, is crystal clear, and was for me an a-ha moment in how it brought together tolerance and withdrawal as two sides of the same coin. Subsequent chapters examine different drug families in turn - opiates, alcohol, tranquilizers, stimulants, psychedelics. There‚Äôs enough that unites each drug family to keep you on board, and enough that‚Äôs different to keep you interested. Two chapters on risk factors (super interesting) and ‚ÄòSolving Addiction‚Äô (less so) round things off. It‚Äôs a short book, but a dense one.Grisel‚Äôs writing style is by turns aggressively pulpy (cocaine is ‚Äúthe sole porn shop in a down and out town‚Äù) and drily technical. The endless roll-call of neurotransmitters, agonists, receptors and transporters can read a little like a Wikipedia article. But colour comes by way of anecdotes from her own experience as an abuser of any drugs she could get her hands on. Grisel‚Äôs account of these times are stony-eyed and unsentimental in a way that feels typical of the recovering addict. There‚Äôs something cold and admirable about the way she mines the darkest moments of her past for examples of particular psychopharmacological mechanisms and phenomena. It‚Äôs like watching someone test a vaccine on themselves. Something I appreciated about her telling of these cautionary tales was how consistently she humanises her fellow addicts. There‚Äôs something valuable in seeing a distinguished academic refer to other addicts as her friends. She doesn‚Äôt romanticise these relationships in any way; in fact she never misses a chance to remind the reader of how quickly the addict will throw his friends under the bus if an opportunity to score presents itself. But this is always framed as a condemnation of the drug, not the person who has been made its prisoner. Many of her friends were not able to turn their life around in the same way that Grisel did and it often was the end of them. If you have a soft spot for any drug, chances are you will find disillusionment within these pages. I found the section/lament on MDMA/ecstasy particularly sobering. I‚Äôve had profound experiences with MDMA before. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not alone among MDMA users in once upon a time thinking that it was a drug that could change the world for the better. But, for all her acknowledgment of how universally positive the subjective experience of the MDMA high is, Grisel doesn‚Äôt hold back in describing the lasting neurological damage it does. No drug really comes out of this book looking particularly good. The one exception is, you may have guessed, psychedelics. Grisel is cautiously optimistic about LSD, psilocybin, DMT and the like, and she clearly leaves the door open to maybe, possibly one day trying them again herself.She‚Äôs less convincing on the few occasions when she strays out of her area of scientific expertise and into the political, legal and economic debates around the place of drugs in society and what could or should be the state‚Äôs disposition towards them. When discussing ephedra, a plant-based stimulant that can cause adverse reactions in users, she notes that the supplement industry invested heavily in a campaign to persuade the regulators that ephedra was safe and therefore should not be classified - but ‚Äúeventually, science prevailed and ephedra-containing dietary supplements were made illegal in the United States.‚Äù The casual equation ‚Äòdangerous‚Äô = ‚Äòshould be made illegal‚Äô isn‚Äôt examined. If ‚Äòscience prevailing‚Äô is the same War on Drugs that she notes a couple of chapters later was an unmitigated failure, science may have some things to answer for.But all in all Never Enough is definitely worth a read, especially as a critical counterpoint to the legalisation and harm reduction literature. One last note - this is 100% about addiction to drugs. I came to Never Enough with vague ideas about how my addiction to rolling news content and Twitter might be fuelling my anxiety. Might addiction be a valuable model for understanding other damaging behaviours? Maybe, but not here. Grisel limits herself to talking about the action of drugs on the brain. I think the book is probably stronger for it."
269,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2587406-elk,0,"Though plausible, I should mention that an elegant hypothesis is no substitute for definitive data. As time has passed we have learned that everything from the bacteria in our guts to the interactions we had in middle school partly determines our behavior. In fact, it's beginning to seem that the brain is more like a stage for a life to be acted out upon than like the director behind a curtain calling shots. _____Because we encounter an ever-variable environment as we go about our day, if our neural activity simply reflected all of this input, like the ocean in the midst of a storm, then the tossed pebble, or even a boulder, could have no perceptible impact. In neuro-parlance, the ratio of signal to noise would be too low. In order for a stimulus to be detected, let alone interpreted as meaningful, the neural signal must be greater than the background noise--or the noise must be quashed.The fundamental role of the brain is to be a contrast detector. As experiences are distinguished from monotony, they spark neurochemical changes in specific brain circuits, informing us of all we care to know: opportunities for food, drink, or sex; danger or pain; beauty and pleasure, for example._____In their opponentprocess theory, Solomon and Corbit made the case‚Äù that feeling states are maintained around a ‚Äúset point‚Äù just as body temperature and water balance are. They proposed that any feeling, including good, bad, happy, depressed, or excited, for example, represents a disruption of the stable feeling state that we perceive as neutral. Specifically, the opponentprocess theory posits that any stimulus that alters brain functioning to affect the way we feel will illicit a response from the brain that is exactly opposite to the effect of the stimulus._____To sport would be as tedious as to work; But when they seldom come, they wished-for come, And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents. Than that which hath no foil to set it off.Henry IV, Part 1_____The very definition of an addictive drug is one that stimulates the mesolimbic pathway, but there are three general axioms in psychopharmacology that also apply to all drugs:1. All drugs act by changing the rate of what is already going on.2. All drugs have side effects.3. The brain adapts to all drugs that affect it by counteracting the drug‚Äôs effects._____Among the most astounding findings in recent neuroscience is the context-dependent nature of all neural activity. Even as our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are products of neurochemical brain activity, what gives rise to this activity is mostly not in our brains. Rather, our brains express the evolutionary, social, and cultural context we occupy... It follows that the answer to the addiction crisis is not solely in the brain, but must include the context. More than ever before in our evolutionary history, we possess a keen awareness of widespread tragedy and suffering in the world. This is the painful context in which our attempts to avert and deny the burden of consciousness have grown more and more desperate and widespread._____So who‚Äôs to blame for the epidemic of addiction? The truth is no one is to blame, but we are all responsible. Though any search for for a cause (or a cure) is bound to fall short, one source of this epidemic is our unwillingness to bear our own pain, along with our failure to look upon the suffering of others with compassion... The history of every science begins with the individual and progresses to the connected collective. Botany began by cataloging specimens and now understands the health of any species depends on an ecological landscape. _____Together we nourish the epidemic of addiction by espousing false dichotomies like ""us"" versus ""them"" or ""well"" versus ""sick."" In doing so, we embrace the myth that happiness can be persued at the individual level, and therefore perpetuate a culture of isolation and alienation...Though there is still much to learn in and out of laboratory settings, we have enough cumulative data to recognize that we/our brains are shaped and constrained by much, much more than our individual biology. And of all of these influences, perhaps the most immediate and impactful, and therefore potentially helpful for realizing change, are our connections with each other. We affect each other, including each other's neurobiology, neurochemistry, and behavior, in ways that are direct and profound. As we grapple to respond to the growing population of addicts, we'd do well to recognize that disordered use comes from, thrives in, and creates alienation."
270,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/304366-ian,5,"Grisel does two things really well in this book.

293,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86576157-minervas-owl,4,"As a drug addict turned neuroscientist, Judith Grisel teaches the science of addiction while telling her personal redemption story. The book is intriguing from the beginning to the end. Judith introduces Richard Solomon's opponent-process theory as a unified explanation of addiction. According to this theory, our brain always adapts to a stimulus by creating an opponent process. That's why skydivers feel exhilarated after landing. In the case of drug use, the longer and more frequent the use, the stronger and long-lasting the counterbalancing effect the brain produces. Over time, this opposite effect not only makes the drug less effective, but also leads to withdrawal symptoms and craving. In the end, drug abusers no longer use to get high, but merely to escape from the agony of withdrawal.  The author's explanation of the theory is clear. I find the two graphs of the a/b process (what the drug does to the brain/brain's opponent response) especially illustrative and self-explanatory. I can understand why Judith claims they are on her shortlist of tattoo design. Nevertheless, when I found the theory was proposed in 1974, I was a bit disappointed that the book did not introduce the more recent development of the theory. Nor did the author introduce other hypotheses on addiction, such as incentive sensitization, which claims repeated exposure to drugs leads to wanting independent of liking. Each subsequent chapter then introduces the chemistry and physiology of an individual category of substance: cannabinoids, opiates, alcohol, tranquilizers, stimulants, psychedelics, and others. Judith's vivid description of her own drug use experience makes her scientific reports convincing and mesmerizing. She also makes good use of analogy and comparison. For example, she mentions alcohol acts like a sledgehammer, affecting so many functions of the brain, while cocaine acts like a laser, stimulating with the fewest side effects. It's much harder to pin down the neurological effects of alcohol than cocaine, she says, because the molecule of alcohol is much smaller and structurally simpler, and ""there are many more places to park a skateboard than an airplane."" Notwithstanding, sometimes, empirical facts such as stereotypy are laid out unexplained, and scientific discoveries scattered and unorganized. Half of my interest in this book stemmed from a sinful wish to know how ""interesting"" various drugs are; my thirst was quenched. Sometimes Judith almost talks about drugs with nostalgia, such as how she used to spend hours stoned on the beach, searching for shells and listening to waves, enjoying every sense of hers enriched by weed. But the more important lesson I learned from the book is why addiction is bad. The drug experience, no matter it's euphoria or tranquility, always dies out over time, driving one into a search in vain of lost joy. Moreover, addiction strips you of choice, making you the worst enemy of yourself. I've never tried drugs, but the lesson is relevant. The threat lies in not only chemicals but also the internet, smartphone, food, game, and others. Drug addiction, as the extreme case of obsession, makes me reevaluate the consequences of being hooked."

295,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67837453-travis-lupick,3,"This is not a review but is based on an interview I had with the author. It was originally published in the Georgia Straight newspaper.Judith Grisel enjoyed using drugs. Cannabis, especially.‚ÄúIn many ways my relationship with the drug was among the purest and most wonderful relationships of my life,‚Äù she writes in Never Enough: The Neuroscience and Experience of Addiction (Doubleday, February 2019). ‚ÄúFrom the first time I got high until long after I‚Äôd smoked my last bowl, I loved the drug like a best friend.‚ÄùThe behavioral neuroscientist and professor of psychology at Pennsylvania‚Äôs Bucknell University also once had an intense love-hate relationship with cocaine, and pretty much any mind-altering substance within reach.It‚Äôs been three decades since she stopped using drugs, save for her daily use of the coffee bean. But Grisel concedes she sometimes misses them, and still sees potential benefits in the occasional use of certain substances; psychedelics, primarily, which she notes new research suggests may help some people with mental-health issues such as PTSD.And so, Grisel told the Straight, in that regard, it‚Äôs a sad story she tells in Never Enough. It turns out that mind-altering drugs simply aren‚Äôt good for you, cannabis included.‚ÄúUsing drugs to change the way we think, feel, and behave, is ancient and universal,‚Äù Grisel says in a telephone interview. ‚ÄúI do think that, not only is it natural, but that there are some benefits. I might have not survived my childhood without all that weed, now that I think about it. So I‚Äôm not against it. But I do think that addiction takes all the fun out of it, and that there are consequences for people, their families, and society.‚ÄùGrisel sought an education and then a career in neuroscience because of her addiction to drugs. The book recounts how she entered the field with the goal of finding a ‚Äúcure‚Äù.‚ÄúI thought that if I could find the cellular switch that flipped somewhere between my third and my fourth drinks, or each time a promising bag was within my sight, and then find a way to keep this switch in the ‚Äòoff‚Äô position, I might be able to refrain from‚Ä¶spending all my tips on very temporary thrills, or making blacked-out road trips to Dallas,‚Äù she writes.Nearly three decades into her search, Grisel writes that she‚Äôs learned the problem is not so much the drugs, per se, but rather the human brain‚Äôs powerful ability to respond to the altered chemistry that drugs produce.‚ÄúThere will never be enough drug, because the brain‚Äôs capacity to learn and adapt is basically infinite,‚Äù reads Never Enough. ‚ÄúWhat was once a normal state punctuated by periods of high inexorably transforms to a state of desperation that is only temporarily subdued.‚ÄùWhile a cure for addiction remains elusive, there‚Äôs never been a more urgent need to pursue the question.Opioids alone killed nearly 4,000 people across Canada in 2017, up from roughly 3,000 the previous year, according to Health Canada. In the United States, 47,600 people died after taking opioids in 2017, up from 42,400 in 2016, according to the U.S. National Institute on Drug Use. It‚Äôs one of the worst health crises the continent has ever experienced, and there‚Äôs no end in sight.With a tidy writing structure that weaves personal anecdotes alongside accessible science, Never Enough describes how the brain of someone addicted to drugs changes as the time they struggle with their drug use drags on.The book focuses on neurochemistry, but Grisel emphasizes that addiction is generally the result of a combination of genetic predisposition, developmental influences, and environmental input.‚ÄúSince the beginning of when we‚Äôve kept records, people have been using drugs to change the way they feel. So what‚Äôs different? Why do we have so much addiction now?‚Äù Grisel asks. ‚ÄúIsolation. Generally, in our distant history, it [drug use] was a communal activity, with spiritual or at least cultural overtones. It was something people did together. So using alone [is what‚Äôs different].‚ÄùGrisel‚Äôs measured take on drugs means it‚Äôs not all bad news for everyone who enjoys a little help to keep the party going.‚ÄúTo the banker who uses cocaine once every four-to-six weeks, I would say, ‚ÄòGood for you‚Äô. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs so terrible,‚Äù Grisel says. ‚ÄúIf you are one of these rare individuals that really does well with moderation‚Äîand that does sound pretty moderate if you‚Äôre just doing a little coke‚Äîya, I think that is all right.‚ÄùThe problem is that for so many people, the brain‚Äôs adaptive nature makes moderation so difficult.‚ÄúLuxuries become habits, habits become compulsions, and compulsions become addictions,‚Äù Grisel says.In addition to the imperative of moderation, the other major piece of advice that Grisel offers in Never Enough is for kids to stay away from drugs. It‚Äôs not a ‚ÄúJust say no‚Äù message she‚Äôs borrowed from the DARE program. There are very real reasons to wait, she explains.‚ÄúUntil you are 25, the brain is still being organized,‚Äù Grisel says. ‚ÄúSo if you perturb it while it is still being organized‚Äîduring development‚Äîthen it alters the organizational structure. Whereas if the basic scaffolding is all laid down, once the pathways are all basically set‚Äîwhich they are sometime between 23 and 25‚Äîthen you are more-likely to be able to undo it [changes to the brain made by using drugs].‚ÄùNever Enough also includes lessons that apply to the war on drugs and which can inform North America‚Äôs response to the opioid epidemic. For example, Grisel says, it‚Äôs time for an honest assessment of criminalization.‚ÄúIf punishment worked, surely we would see diminishing numbers of addicts, and we don‚Äôt. We see more and more,‚Äù Grisel says. ‚ÄúI think it is alienating, to say to people, ‚ÄòYou are bad and you‚Äôve got to not be bad and we‚Äôre going to help you not be bad by doing bad things to you‚Äô.‚ÄùThe same sort of logical evaluation led her to support harm reduction at a time when the Ontario government and states such as Washington, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts are debating the merits of supervised-injection facilities like Vancouver‚Äôs Insite.‚ÄúI think supervised injection is a great idea, because I don‚Äôt think punishment works,‚Äù Grisel says. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it condones using. It is just trying to say, ‚ÄòHere‚Äôs a safe place‚Äô.‚ÄúWe should use every strategy we can to support people to be healthy,‚Äù Grisel continues. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like we‚Äôre going to teach people not to use by letting them die. That won‚Äôt work.‚Äù"

Having studied the subject in college, usually mainstream books about neuroscience are too watered down and I feel as though I'm not really learning much. This book was the perfect balance between presenting the topic of addiction in a way that made sense to a naive reader, but was still engaging for people already familiar with the subject. I also really appreciated Grisel's own personal journey with addiction. By weaving together her narrative with the more scientific descriptions of drugs/drug use, the book was not only accessible to a wide range of readers, but was also extremely engaging. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone curious about the widespread epidemic of addiction that our world currently faces. "
297,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4952371-polly,4,"A compelling, important read offering a uniquely new perspective of addiction."
298,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58281897-david-elliott,4,"A strange book that‚Äôs not 100% convinced of its reason to exist, but is still fascinating and often moving. Grisel is ultimately pessimistic about the potential of modern neuroscience to prevent or ‚Äòcure‚Äô addiction. In her telling, drugs are an escape from alienation, and addiction an inevitable consequence of drug abuse - so the only way to get rid of addiction is to promote connection. ‚ÄúOf course biology is involved!‚Äù she writes in the final chapter. ‚ÄúBut the insistence on starting and ending within an addict‚Äôs head is not only misguided but insidious.‚Äù It‚Äôs a weird sentence to read after 200 pages of insightful, expert commentary on what goes on inside addicts‚Äô heads.And you do learn a lot! Grisel equips you with simple but powerful intellectual tools to understand the fundamental processes underlying addiction. Her introduction to the Opponent-Process model, a unifying thread in the book, is crystal clear, and was for me an a-ha moment in how it brought together tolerance and withdrawal as two sides of the same coin. Subsequent chapters examine different drug families in turn - opiates, alcohol, tranquilizers, stimulants, psychedelics. There‚Äôs enough that unites each drug family to keep you on board, and enough that‚Äôs different to keep you interested. Two chapters on risk factors (super interesting) and ‚ÄòSolving Addiction‚Äô (less so) round things off. It‚Äôs a short book, but a dense one.Grisel‚Äôs writing style is by turns aggressively pulpy (cocaine is ‚Äúthe sole porn shop in a down and out town‚Äù) and drily technical. The endless roll-call of neurotransmitters, agonists, receptors and transporters can read a little like a Wikipedia article. But colour comes by way of anecdotes from her own experience as an abuser of any drugs she could get her hands on. Grisel‚Äôs account of these times are stony-eyed and unsentimental in a way that feels typical of the recovering addict. There‚Äôs something cold and admirable about the way she mines the darkest moments of her past for examples of particular psychopharmacological mechanisms and phenomena. It‚Äôs like watching someone test a vaccine on themselves. Something I appreciated about her telling of these cautionary tales was how consistently she humanises her fellow addicts. There‚Äôs something valuable in seeing a distinguished academic refer to other addicts as her friends. She doesn‚Äôt romanticise these relationships in any way; in fact she never misses a chance to remind the reader of how quickly the addict will throw his friends under the bus if an opportunity to score presents itself. But this is always framed as a condemnation of the drug, not the person who has been made its prisoner. Many of her friends were not able to turn their life around in the same way that Grisel did and it often was the end of them. If you have a soft spot for any drug, chances are you will find disillusionment within these pages. I found the section/lament on MDMA/ecstasy particularly sobering. I‚Äôve had profound experiences with MDMA before. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not alone among MDMA users in once upon a time thinking that it was a drug that could change the world for the better. But, for all her acknowledgment of how universally positive the subjective experience of the MDMA high is, Grisel doesn‚Äôt hold back in describing the lasting neurological damage it does. No drug really comes out of this book looking particularly good. The one exception is, you may have guessed, psychedelics. Grisel is cautiously optimistic about LSD, psilocybin, DMT and the like, and she clearly leaves the door open to maybe, possibly one day trying them again herself.She‚Äôs less convincing on the few occasions when she strays out of her area of scientific expertise and into the political, legal and economic debates around the place of drugs in society and what could or should be the state‚Äôs disposition towards them. When discussing ephedra, a plant-based stimulant that can cause adverse reactions in users, she notes that the supplement industry invested heavily in a campaign to persuade the regulators that ephedra was safe and therefore should not be classified - but ‚Äúeventually, science prevailed and ephedra-containing dietary supplements were made illegal in the United States.‚Äù The casual equation ‚Äòdangerous‚Äô = ‚Äòshould be made illegal‚Äô isn‚Äôt examined. If ‚Äòscience prevailing‚Äô is the same War on Drugs that she notes a couple of chapters later was an unmitigated failure, science may have some things to answer for.But all in all Never Enough is definitely worth a read, especially as a critical counterpoint to the legalisation and harm reduction literature. One last note - this is 100% about addiction to drugs. I came to Never Enough with vague ideas about how my addiction to rolling news content and Twitter might be fuelling my anxiety. Might addiction be a valuable model for understanding other damaging behaviours? Maybe, but not here. Grisel limits herself to talking about the action of drugs on the brain. I think the book is probably stronger for it."
299,0385542844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2587406-elk,0,"Though plausible, I should mention that an elegant hypothesis is no substitute for definitive data. As time has passed we have learned that everything from the bacteria in our guts to the interactions we had in middle school partly determines our behavior. In fact, it's beginning to seem that the brain is more like a stage for a life to be acted out upon than like the director behind a curtain calling shots. _____Because we encounter an ever-variable environment as we go about our day, if our neural activity simply reflected all of this input, like the ocean in the midst of a storm, then the tossed pebble, or even a boulder, could have no perceptible impact. In neuro-parlance, the ratio of signal to noise would be too low. In order for a stimulus to be detected, let alone interpreted as meaningful, the neural signal must be greater than the background noise--or the noise must be quashed.The fundamental role of the brain is to be a contrast detector. As experiences are distinguished from monotony, they spark neurochemical changes in specific brain circuits, informing us of all we care to know: opportunities for food, drink, or sex; danger or pain; beauty and pleasure, for example._____In their opponentprocess theory, Solomon and Corbit made the case‚Äù that feeling states are maintained around a ‚Äúset point‚Äù just as body temperature and water balance are. They proposed that any feeling, including good, bad, happy, depressed, or excited, for example, represents a disruption of the stable feeling state that we perceive as neutral. Specifically, the opponentprocess theory posits that any stimulus that alters brain functioning to affect the way we feel will illicit a response from the brain that is exactly opposite to the effect of the stimulus._____To sport would be as tedious as to work; But when they seldom come, they wished-for come, And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents. Than that which hath no foil to set it off.Henry IV, Part 1_____The very definition of an addictive drug is one that stimulates the mesolimbic pathway, but there are three general axioms in psychopharmacology that also apply to all drugs:1. All drugs act by changing the rate of what is already going on.2. All drugs have side effects.3. The brain adapts to all drugs that affect it by counteracting the drug‚Äôs effects._____Among the most astounding findings in recent neuroscience is the context-dependent nature of all neural activity. Even as our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are products of neurochemical brain activity, what gives rise to this activity is mostly not in our brains. Rather, our brains express the evolutionary, social, and cultural context we occupy... It follows that the answer to the addiction crisis is not solely in the brain, but must include the context. More than ever before in our evolutionary history, we possess a keen awareness of widespread tragedy and suffering in the world. This is the painful context in which our attempts to avert and deny the burden of consciousness have grown more and more desperate and widespread._____So who‚Äôs to blame for the epidemic of addiction? The truth is no one is to blame, but we are all responsible. Though any search for for a cause (or a cure) is bound to fall short, one source of this epidemic is our unwillingness to bear our own pain, along with our failure to look upon the suffering of others with compassion... The history of every science begins with the individual and progresses to the connected collective. Botany began by cataloging specimens and now understands the health of any species depends on an ecological landscape. _____Together we nourish the epidemic of addiction by espousing false dichotomies like ""us"" versus ""them"" or ""well"" versus ""sick."" In doing so, we embrace the myth that happiness can be persued at the individual level, and therefore perpetuate a culture of isolation and alienation...Though there is still much to learn in and out of laboratory settings, we have enough cumulative data to recognize that we/our brains are shaped and constrained by much, much more than our individual biology. And of all of these influences, perhaps the most immediate and impactful, and therefore potentially helpful for realizing change, are our connections with each other. We affect each other, including each other's neurobiology, neurochemistry, and behavior, in ways that are direct and profound. As we grapple to respond to the growing population of addicts, we'd do well to recognize that disordered use comes from, thrives in, and creates alienation."
