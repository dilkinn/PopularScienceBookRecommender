0,014313342X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16471876-liz-barnsley,5,I'm not really going to review this properly I bought it and read it just for me really. There's nothing much I can say that I haven't said before about this author's writing and sometimes you just want to read a book to kick start your soul again. Suffice to say that as ever after reading a Matt Haig book my faith in many many things is restored. Yes indeed.
1,014313342X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35251024-nat-k,5,"‚ÄùThe paradox of modern life is this: we have never been more connected, and we have never been more alone.‚Äù Another gem from one of my favourite writers, which makes me realise why I love reading his books so much. Matt Haig has the innate ability to get inside your core and peel back the layers.He makes you feel. He makes you think.Whenever I start one of his books, the rest of the world falls to a blur, in slow motion. I become so engrossed in what he has to say, it‚Äôs as if time stands still. He writes of truth and hurt and feelings, and the discord so many of us feel in our oh-so-busy modern lives.Inadvertently, he has become somewhat of a modern day sage with his wise words and observations. By being so upfront with his own struggles with anxiety and depression (via his previous book ""Reasons to Stay Alive""), this book continues on the theme of the pressures we place on ourselves in the modern world, and if it is indeed worth it. We are bombarded with information overload from the time we wake up to the moment our head hit the pillow. No wonder our inner circuitry often snaps.There's a beautiful snippet ""A note from the beach"" which is funny and cheeky at the same time. Effectively the beach has written an ode to us humans, about how we shouldn't obsess about who's ""watching us"" on the beach, about how we look, as no-one's really interested. They're all too worried about how they look.""Reframe your idea of beauty. Be a rebel against marketing. Look forward to being a wise elder. Be the complex elegance of a melting candle. Be a map with 10,000 roads. Be the orange at sunset that outclasses the pink of sunrise. Be the self that dares to be true.""Penelope beautifully summed up this book by saying ‚Äú‚Ä¶his writing is like a cup of tea and a warm blanket making you feel that no matter how crazy the world can get everything is going to be ok.‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt agree more. And I really can‚Äôt say more. Just read it.https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...Matt, you have such a positive influence on so many people. I truly hope you read your reviews, because you‚Äôll see how much you mean to people, and just how many lives you‚Äôve touched üíïüåø üíö üåø üíö Just be. üåø üíö üåø üíö"
2,014313342X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23650849-alexa-petre,2,"As much as I respect and appreciate Matt Haig, I cannot give more than 2 stars to this book. First of all, it's very messy, and although he even mentions in the book that he deliberately wanted to write a messy book, it actually feels like a bunch of blog posts cluttered together in a book, without much structure and flow to it, especially since he repeats himself numerous times throughout it. I just couldn't help thinking I was reading a bunch of shallow self-help articles, full of truisms and of dramatic short sentences, that didn't go into enough detail in order to be interesting or helpful. Plus the exaggerated amount of enumerations became irritating after a while. I appreciate the intention of writing a book to help people navigate through modern times easier, but putting together a lot of statistics, quotes and general findings from different other authors (without mentioning the exact sources in the footnotes, another big flaw) just makes the book feel like a pseudo-scientific bunch of random facts. I'm really sorry Matt, this was not your best, I think."
3,014313342X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26560207-gabby,4,"‚ÄùHow can we live in a mad world without ourselves going mad?Matt Haig has such a way with worlds and he is so good at being able to explain the reasons people might feel anxiety and depression in the world we are living in today. This read couldn‚Äôt come at a more perfect time for me because the world is unimaginably horrific these days and I really needed this. I enjoyed this one even more than Reasons to Stay Alive, and I just really love his writing so much. ‚ÄùThe future isn‚Äôt real. The future is abstract. The now is all we know. One now after another now. The now is where we must live. There are billions of different versions of an older you. There is one version of the present you. Focus on that.‚Äù I love the section about time in this book because a huge part of my anxiety is never feeling like I have enough time to do all the things I want to do, and never feeling present in the moment because I‚Äôm always planning things for the future and thinking about the future. This quote really speaks to me:‚ÄúTo enjoy life, we might have to stop thinking about what we will never be able to read and watch and say and do, and start to think of how to enjoy the world within our boundaries. To live on a human scale. To focus on the few things we can do, rather than the millions of things we can‚Äôt. To not crave parallel lives. To find a smaller mathematics. To be a proud and singular one. An indivisible prime.‚ÄùI just love Matt Haig‚Äôs writing, and he makes me feel so understood and normal with my anxiety about life and the future and the world. I really needed this book right now and I‚Äôm so glad it was everything I was hoping it would be. "
4,014313342X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2240526-penelope,5,"A truly timely and important book that everyone living on this nervous planet should read. Matt's honest and personal experiences shine through on every page and his writing is like a cup of tea and a warm blanket making you feel that no matter how crazy the world can get everything is going to be ok. I loved this book and have no hesitation recommending it to absolutely everyone, no one will finish this book without learning at least one important lesson or taking away one piece of advice that will make life just that little bit better. Thanks Matt!"
5,014313342X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20658145-april-aprilius-maximus,4,This book gave me so much to contemplate! 
6,014313342X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68893494-tom-mclean,1,"I feel like I could write a Twitter bot that would generate this entire book. If you're the type of person who needs someone to tell you ""It will be okay"" a thousand different ways, then this is the book for you. I, like Matt Haig, also suffer from anxiety. But being told ""it will be okay"" only adds to my anxiety. I was hoping for a tool or an escape, but did not find it here. I'm glad Mr. Haig has found a profitable way to deal with his anxiety, by selling out his mantras. "
7,014313342X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14457130-whitney-atkinson,4,"Thanks to Penguin for a free review copy! I read Reasons to Stay Alive by Matt Haig during my 2017 relapse, and I devoured it. I absolutely love Haig‚Äôs writing style and the way he weaves anecdote into advice, and how closely our experiences relate. I especially like how in this book, he talks about how social media and technology can exacerbate anxiety, which is certainly true for me as well.I was initially fearful that this book would be a preachy ‚Äújust get off your phone‚Äù type of book, which isn‚Äôt what I was anticipating nor did I want to hear‚Äîbecause let‚Äôs be real, social media is fun and useful and literally one of my jobs. I quickly realized that despite his message of logging off, he was also all for social media in a nuanced way I think a lot of people tend to miss. I think Haig perfectly located the need to log off when the internet or the news or whatever becomes too much‚Äîor even just a clutch for boredom‚Äîbut not when it‚Äôs a source of joy or fun. To see someone who sees technology as so dualistic instead of strictly good or bad was refreshing, so it made me a lot more willing to internalize his advice. I underlined SO many lines in this book because Haig is a gorgeous writer, but also he includes a lot of quotations and makes a lot of great points of his own about technology usage, remaining unique, relinquishing stress, and other ideas to reduce stress born from technology. If you‚Äôre someone who struggles with internet usage and anxiety, this would definitely be a valuable tool to remind yourself of your worth in a technological environment that tries to remind you that you‚Äôre worthless as a marketing ploy. I loved the encouraging tone of it, and in the end, it was a great reminder to make sure I‚Äôm taking care of my mental health by not abusing my phone or Internet usage."
8,014313342X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25398561-andr-oliveira,4,"A book about depression, panic attacks and how to deal with them. Or at least get better at it.Obviously, it's about a lot more subjects but Matt Haig give us some advice on how to cope with the present lifestyle and how to accept yourself and the world we currently live."
9,014313342X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57073687-nadia,4,"This was my first encounter with the work of Matt Haig and I can see why he's become so popular. In his latest book, Matt shares his observations about today's 'nervous planet' we live on, overloaded with technology and social media connecting people all over the world, yet leaving them feeling alone. Based on his own experience, Matt offers advice on how to cope with stress and anxiety, how to value and appreciate the little things in life, but also how to accept ourselves and the fact that we are not perfect and to fail is absolutely ok.You might not agree with everything Matt Haig says or does, but I think everyone who reads this book will find something in there that will speak to them or at least make them think."
10,014313342X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76202320-henk,4,"A wholesome book on self-care in the 21st century - 4 starsYou‚Äôll be happy when people like you.You‚Äôll be happy when more people like you.You‚Äôll be happy when everybody likes you.Digital detoxing and being happy in the 21st centuryMatt Haig takes on how modern day life, with abundant choices and psychologist involved in marketing of almost any product, effects our state of mind.It is very ironic that I listened to this book through Spotify (https://open.spotify.com/album/5o0Ptd...), commuting or at the gym, while the first topic Haig takes on is our mobile phone addiction. How information, change and choice has multiplied exponentially while our physical self and brains have changed little in 50.000 years. This first section of the book, with the musings on how capitalist society makes us feel perpetually unsatisfied and looking for the thrill of the new to sell more articles, made me think of Yuval Noah Harari his style of tackling big trends.Particularly fun and illustrative was the observation that in the 16th century only around 40 books per year were published in England (fictional book club: what are we reading this year Cedric? Everything!) and how the number of internet users has gone from 16 million in 1995 (0,4% of the world population) to more than 3 billion people (51% of the world population) in June 2017. The world is changing ever faster.He challenges the reader to develop a more healthy relationship with their phones and social media, and fills his story with snappy one liners (Facebook is the place online where everybody lies to friends, Twitter is where everybody tells the truth to stranger.) that made me think about my internet habits.Mental health in relation to your surroundingsThe problem was that i was viewing my own face through the prism of insecurity.Haig is very honest about his own mental health and shares doable activities that might help anyone feeling less overwhelmed by the world: from watching the sea, the sky, walking in forests to yoga and focussing on breathing.A lot can also be gained from mindset and not comparing oneself with another person (To be liked by everybody you‚Äôd have to be the blandest person ever) but to look for what according to you intrinsically makes the world better and focussing energy on that (Life isn‚Äôt about being be pleased with what you are doing but about what you are being).I found this second part of the book interesting but less eye opening than the first part. Haig showcases the human contradictions and uncertainties in an eloquent manner, but a lot is derived from other writers or thinkers. Also his conveying of the (meta)panic about the feeling of panic was a bit too effective for my taste, in the sense that it made me a bit stressed from just listening to Haig reciting these experiences. Also the whole part of supermarkets being triggers for mental breakdown I couldn‚Äôt relate to as much. I also don‚Äôt know the set up, where quite a lot of chapters are lists, is the best: it sometimes felt a bit gimmicky to me (not to mention a cringeworthy, imagined conversation with a turtle on mindfulness).Not to say that propagating a holistic approach to mental health, taking the environment and physical health into account, is not very important. And I feel a lot of the techniques mentioned by Haig could really help in stabilizing your feeling of self as well as enable acceptance of self. It was almost therapeutic hearing Matt Haig saying that you are enough and how hard is to accept that you are not inadequate.In that sense Notes on a Nervous Planet is almost like an intimate, deep conversation with a good friend around the topics you almost never talk about in day to day life.ConclusionOverall I liked the book, and will go around recommending this to colleagues, if only for the following wholesome, thought provoking one liners:Working in an aspirational environment almost equates to the feeling of failingAim not at getting more stuff done, aim at having less things to doBe kind to yourselfReading is love in actionYou will be cool when you are deadRemember that many people feel like youYou are conditioned to want more"

strike two.number four. you visit a homeless shelter where everybody helps out with cooking, cleaning, etc. and tries very hard to keep addictive stuff (drugs, alcohol) out. you say, and i quote: ‚ÄúIt [the shelter] was like a distillation of the things that people need in life‚Äù.(still number four.) i‚Äôm sorry, you went to a homeless shelter where people who lost everything and fought addiction and managed to build something meaningful for themselves while still technically homeless, and used that as inspiration porn for your whole online detox argument?? privilege, meet class intersections. strike three, you‚Äôre out.also, did you REALLY make me read the words ‚Äúthe guilt of privilege‚Äù with my own two eyes? really??alright, i‚Äôll bring this to an end before i start beating a dead horse. that said, we have a saying where i live: to kick an open door. it means stating the obvious in such a way that it‚Äôs entirely pointless, just like kicking a door that‚Äôs already open.i feel that pretty much sums up your argument about stepping away from the internet and marketing campaigns when they make you unhappy. because, duh.and where your personal anecdotes re: anxiety and nervousness may strike a nerve with those suffering from the same sort of problems, the rest of your observations remain wholly out of touch from the rest of the world in my point of view.‚úé 1.0 stars."
12,014313342X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27645698-lauren-hartley,2,"As discussed in the book, everyone has different opinions on books and I loved Reasons to Stay Alive but this I found really boring.This book was very rambly and induced stress rather than prevent it. I found his last book actually had a story to it whereas this was just quoting other books and repeating what they said. The amount of chapters and paragraphs which. Were. All. One. Word. Sentences. Drove me insane by the end!"
13,014313342X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4811203-emily-b,4,A very accessible book written by Matt Haig.I love the way it‚Äôs formatted and compiled of lists and short chapters. The subject matter is very relevant and I found it explored issues and anxieties concerning modern life and social media that have been at the back of my mind for a while.
14,014313342X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25667717-doug,4,"3.5, rounded up.I really, REALLY liked Haig's previous 'self-help' book, Reasons to Stay Alive, even though some found it corny and simplistic. Reading this sequel, I could see why that feeling might be valid this time round. A prime reason why the previous book made an impact, is that it hewed more closely to Haig's personal history, as he shared autobiographical stories from which he gleaned his insights - here, there are far fewer such examples, so it just seems like a stream of platitudes - some of which are profound, some of which extract a feeling of .... 'well, duh'! And some of which seemed awfully repetitious (e.g., do we really need to be told the virtues of peanut butter on toast twice?). Still, anyone struggling (as I do) with a panic disorder, anxiety or the feeling like the world is far too stressful, can find much to like and take away from this quick and often entertaining read. It never hurts to hear that it isn't necessarily YOU!"
15,014313342X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74108516-littlemiss-emmxx,5,I had heard this book was a sort of follow on from Reasons To Stay Alive. I read Reasons To Stay Alive while I was on holiday in January. And loved it read it in 2 or 3 days and ended up having to start it again as I hadn't thought I would finish it so quickly. Clearly it took me a bit longer to read this but that's because I'm not on holiday this time. I couldn't wait that long to read it. I just love Matt Haigs writing. It is so honest and truthful. This will definitely be recommended as much as I have Reasons To Stay Alive.

This book reminded me of some things I believe in but sometimes forget. As a teacher, I wish I can share some of that knowledge with my students!Thanks for reminding me that humans never had so much time to spend.

Now trust me when I say I know that this book is just like Haig's others; ones that I do like, The Humans is actually one of my all-time favourites. I stopped a little over 200 pages in and I realised he would be repeating the same messages over and over again, I got the gist and was to be honest irritated. He did hit a few aspects of modern culture on the head but at some points it came off like a middle aged man complaining about youth culture, which it is essentially and there is a gap between what he thinks us youth understand about our own obsession with technology. Also if people really were stupid enough to make machines that can take over us I'll give this book 5 stars, to my understanding computers work off algorithms which people write. A computer can be smarter than a human but not smarter than humanity.I may sound ignorant, and I very much might be but I kept an open-mind and this is my opinion of this book."

'Notes on a Nervous Planet' is not so much a ‚Äúreasons to‚Äù as a ‚Äúhow to‚Äù guide, for all those readers who responded so powerfully to the last book. This book follows a similar format: short chapters, concisely written, with lots of numbered lists ‚Äì just right for an audience whose attention, Haig argues, is being stretched painfully thin by 24-hour rolling news, smartphones, work and social media. The book jumps from subject to subject, setting out problems, offering advice and sometimes just presenting lists of small good things to remember.  So here is what this amazing book is about:   The world is messing with our minds. Rates of stress and anxiety are rising. A fast, nervous planet is creating fast and nervous lives. We are more connected, yet feel more alone. And we are encouraged to worry about everything from world politics to our body mass index. - How can we stay sane on a planet that makes us mad? - How do we stay human in a technological world? - How do we feel happy when we are encouraged to be anxious? After experiencing years of anxiety and panic attacks, these questions became urgent matters of life and death for Matt Haig. And he began to look for the link between what he felt and the world around him. Notes on a Nervous Planet is a personal and vital look at how to feel happy, human and whole in the twenty-first century. This was an inspiring and thought-provoking book to read. It is truly refreshing when an author shares his or her personal journey with readers. To feel an author‚Äôs vulnerability in their writing is a beautiful thing and to reflect on your own life afterwards is where the magic happens. Matt Haig is one of those authors that takes you along on his personal journey and helps you understand the lessons he learned along the way. It was an honest and insightful account about how to live your best life possible in a modern world that is designed to make you feel anxious. It is about creating a space of peace for yourself, to unplug and live in the moment. I think we could all benefit from Matt Haig‚Äôs reminders and advice.

28,014313342X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22409011-brendan-monroe,4,"I wish this book had been available back in January 2015. When I started my last job. I was in a different country, working with colleagues from all over, and it was my first time working a desk job. The atmosphere there was absolutely toxic, the people I worked with unbelievably petty and bullying, and I thought about walking out on my lunch break on a daily basis. But I never did. Maybe all ""desk jobs"" were like this. What did I know? I stayed there just shy of four, very long, years because I thought it was important that I did. Important that I try to act as though those comments didn't bother me, important that I pretend I didn't mind the city and country I was living in, important that I deposited just a little bit more into my savings account, important that I work for long enough to have something to show off on my CV. In case there is any doubt in your mind ‚Äî no, it wasn't worth it. Nothing is ever worth doing just for the money, just as a stepping stone to hopefully land ""something better"". The number of years we all have is finite, and to waste them doing something we don't like in order to hopefully one day land something we do is always a bad deal.In the end, my blog was the one place I could vent, and vent I did, about some unruly passengers aboard a flight I had taken on a recent trip back to Ukraine from Denmark. My post somehow ended up being read by people at work, and a little less than two weeks after I had put in my 30-day notice I was summoned to the boss' office and summarily dismissed for ""pissing off the entire company"". I didn't get any reference to tack onto my CV, and as we all know savings can be burned through rather quickly. Things are better now (really, so much better), but I still lament those wasted years, years I'm sure never to get back. There had been days, particularly in that first year, where I was so so close to just walking out, that if I had just read Matt Haig's advice on page 248, I think it would have been enough to give me the courage to walk away.""If you hate your job, and can get away with walking out on your lunch break, walk out on your lunch break. And never go back.""Funny enough, I probably wouldn't have read this book unless I had quit my job. Because now I work entirely remote, I have the ability to be anywhere. And last May ""anywhere"" just happened to be the little book town of Hay-on-Wye during its annual literature festival where, you guessed it, one of the featured speakers was Mr. Matt Haig. I bought the book, he signed it, and now I've read it. Better late than never.I don't want to give the impression that ""Notes on a Nervous Planet"" is a ""perfect"" book (as if there really is such a thing). Haig himself writes on page 176, ""I am trying to write about the messiness of the world and the messiness of minds by writing a deliberately messy book.""And he has succeeded. This is a messy book, where a full page or two of text can be followed by a list on the third page, a single sentence on the fourth page, a quote on the fifth page. This is written in much the style of Haig's previous non-fiction book, Reasons to Stay Alive, and this sort of writing, with pages containing text of varied length, in varied font, and of various size, is quickly becoming Haig's signature style. Some will likely be turned off by this. It took some getting used to for me too, but the content inside is good enough that it should allow you to get past the way it's laid out.About the content. Some of it is rather obvious. Cut this book in half and the half in the middle could be called, ""Why the Internet is Bad for You"", as much of it is about how technology is making us more anxious, more prone to depression, and less satisfied with what we already have so that we want more of what isn't good for us.Yes, we all probably know that already, just as we probably know that not getting enough sleep (9 hours a night is the recommended amount) is bad for us, and racking up a ton of debt on our credit cards on things that we think will make us happy is also bad for us. If you don't know these things yet there are many, many pages reiterating those points here and you should read them now. But you should also read ""Notes on a Nervous Planet"" even if, like me, you knew those things already (I'll get to why in a minute).Yes, some of what Haig writes here is on the cornier side. He writes at various points as ""The Beach"" or as a 100+ year old giant tortoise. ""The Beach"", you'll be happy to know, doesn't ""give a fuck"" (The Beach's words) what you look like. So why don't you, like, just chill the fuck out?Many will read these sections and find them cute or funny, but whether because of the perspective it's written from or the fucks, it made me feel like Haig was writing as one of those beach bums who, when they aren't catching waves, are probably smoking a bit of reefer (and are sure to be played by Matthew McConaughey in full ""alright, alright, alright"" mode in the film version). What I'm saying is, I could have done without it. So why should you read an occasionally corny, repetitive book that has a funky style and repeats things you probably already know?Because it's good for you. So what if it's not Jaron Lanier's Ten Arguments For Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now with, I presume, the hundreds of footnotes? ""Notes on a Nervous Planet"" is necessary precisely because it reinforces the simple, irrefutable feeling so many of us have that much of what defines our modern culture is making us miserable. And while yes, most of us know that absorbing all that bad news, being addicted to our jobs to the point where we neglect our personal lives, and being insanely focused on how many likes your last Instagram post got is not healthy, it's so easy to doubt that little voice in our head that tells us those things. We need books like ""Notes on a Nervous Planet"" to remind us of these things so that we don't let ourselves off the hook and just continue imbibing the things that we know aren't good for us.And we needed it years ago."

But the flipside is that we can feel calm in a world of fear.""Such a warm and absorbing book. If you've read books on anxiety and the likes of The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck and are looking for tips, tricks and hacks on how to instantly get better, then this one isn't for you. But it is the one you should probably be reading. Matt Haig delves into thoughts, fears and curiosities that are consuming us daily and talks about them openly, seriously with just the right amount of light humor. He never talks down to the reader, never barks affirmations that we should be reciting religiously or patronizes in any way. Just tells us his own thought process, how he's been through the same debilitating anxiety most of us go through, what helped him cope and imparts advice that might help us cope as well. He mentions how reading is the most social thing we can do and how it can be a way back to ourselves and I completely see it...I've never felt more connected to an author. Last year I made a commitment to get my old reading self back and in just a few months have started to feel more like myself and more comfortable being alone with my thoughts.The first half of the book is light, witty with loads of insight into tech, consumerism and media. But it's the second-half where things picked up for me. He gets down to issues and talks about ways of dealing with all the chaos that surrounds us. How distracting and numbing ourselves is the real enemy and how just being more aware can make the world and us just a tad less nervous. This one chapter towards the end brought on all the feels and for once I got over myself and just let myself be overcome with emotions. It felt good. Reading this book felt good. You don't need psychological breakthroughs and groundbreaking worksheets to fix your life. All you need a is a well-versed wise ol' friend to talk you through that cobweb of muddled thoughts. Go read it now."

Highly recommend to anyone struggling with anxiety and mental illness- it is a read that will show you that you are not alone. Also highly recommend to those not struggling with mental illness but are simply broad-minded enough to want to understand those who do.Matt Haig writes of our nervous planet. Nervous, yes, but also ""[a] planet where we can breathe and live and fall in love and eat peanut butter on toast and say hello to dogs and dance to music and read Bonjour Tristesse and binge-watch TV dramas and notice the sunlight accentuated by hard shadow on a building and feel the wind and the rain on our tender skin and look after each other and lose ourselves in daydreams and night dreams and dissolve into the sweet mystery of ourselves.""The short, quick chapters are somehow always on point.

Following on from his bestselling ‚ÄúReasons to stay Alive‚Äù, Matt Haig here explores whether it is possible to stay sane in a mad world, offering useful suggestions for coping with our addiction to modern technology along with its attendant information overload. (The suggestion I find most useful is the one about getting upset over distressing news programs: i.e. SWITCH IT OFF! and don't feel guilty about it).Haig is never preachy and includes many examples of his own (considerable) neurotic behaviour in demonstration of the widespread occurrence of anxiety and depression amongst humans. However, I did get the feeling that the cataloguing of reasons to be worried might well have the adverse effect of making the reader even more disturbed - discovering how much more there is to worry about than they thought!"

Haig suggests that we stop worrying about everything that did happen or could happen, and live in the moment. Enjoy the day with a walk out-of-doors, get plenty of sleep and CHILL. Clearly sound advice."

Our nerves are jangled constantly. It feel like you are in a race that you can never win and standing still doesn't feel like an option. Yet in the world of 24 / 7 connections to family, friends and strangers around the world, people have never been more alone.In this modern world, can we stay sane?This is the follow up to his successful and what I consider now an¬†essential book, Reasons to Stay Alive. I that he told us of his journey back from staring into the abyss. In this, he lays out the problems of the modern world that have been caused by the internet as well as the positive benefits that it has brought. He makes it very personal, telling us of the issues that he has had with obsessions with Facebook, Twitter and the slightly unreal world of Instagram and how it has affected his mental health.Reading isn‚Äôt important because it helps to get you a job. It‚Äôs important because it gives you room to exist beyond the reality you‚Äôre given. It is how humans merge. How minds connect. Dreams. Empathy. Understanding. Escape.Like his previous book,¬†there are anecdotes, his thoughts on the world we are living in. Woven into this is his own personal story about how his depression and anxiety has ebbed and flowed, often caused by spending way too long on the internet. Listening to the echo chamber is not good for your health, especially in this political climate, and this book is full of practical suggestions on how to cope with the relentlessness of it all, when and how to engage for an affirmative experience and when to turn the computer off, set the phone aside and go and do something else.

How can we live in a mad world without ourselves going mad? 
Matt Haig`s Notes on a Nervous Planet is all about providing to us, some sensible and practical solutions to the above complicated question.""We are humans. Let's not be ashamed to look like them.""This concisely well-written book is must-read for all humans who have a brain and a mind. Libraries aren't just about books. They are one of the few public spaces we have left which don't like our wallets more than us.The importance of the reading habit is so very well described in this book. Books truly help us to remain sane and think right. So, when depression slugs over me I close my eyes and enter the bank of good days and think of sunshine and laughter and turtles. And I try to remember how possible the impossible can sometimes be.Matt Haig provides us few key and useful guidelines. It is important for all of us to understand and realize that mental and emotional illness is like any other illness, like diabetes or cancer. It need not be a shame or a secret. There is no need to feel guilty. Mental illness is not a weakness or a flaw. The pain of this illness is as and more painful than other illnesses.It's all about being in the present moment! ****Why do humans worry so much about a stranger's opinion?Allow yourself just to be as you are.√¢‚Ç¨≈ìBe a map with 10,000 roads. Be the orange at sunset that outclasses the pink of sunrise. Be the self that dares to be true.You can feel as removed from yourself as a packet of toilet roll is removed from a tree."

‚ÄúMaybe the point of life is to give up certainty and to embrace life‚Äôs beautiful uncertainty‚Äù
4.5 nervous stars!I‚Äôd heard a lot about Matt Haig‚Äôs short book on anxiety; from other reviewers on Goodreads and one of my work colleagues. I was craving something non-fiction and kept seeing it in the supermarket so decided to give it a try.I‚Äôve experienced my fair share of anxiety in the past and have developed my own coping strategies. I picked this book up not knowing quite what to expect. It‚Äôs a candid look at Matt‚Äôs own struggles but more importantly, this book encourages to consider the kind of toxic life we lead in modern day society.Everything is engineered to encourage us to be consumers. The problem with being a consumer is that insatiable desire to want more. This is a hotbed for anxiety. Matt Haig refers to various recent studies to back up his words and provides helpful hints for how to switch off in a nervous world.I feel that this is a book worth reading again at some point and I would like my partner to read it too. Whether he does or not is another thing entirely as he rarely reads but never mind.I‚Äôd say this book is for everyone. Not simply for those who are actively nervous. In fact I‚Äôd say that those who aren‚Äôt nervous could get just as much out of it as it really helps you to question the way we unthinkingly live our lives."

Most of my life, now that I think about it, but I didn't seek help until I was 19 and forced to drop out of uni because both my physical and mental health had sort of imploded. I'm much better now, two and a half years later, and back at uni, but sometimes I do still find it hard to switch-off and disconnect from the constant barrage of shit in the news and the world in general.This was an excellent book, written as a series of notes that go on to form several narratives about combatting anxiety, as well as Matt Haig's personal experiences. Most of it I already knew, but the reminders to take a step back from technology is always an important reminder. If you suffer with anxiety then this is an excellent read. And even if you don't there is much to be gained."

43,014313342X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30070506-alisha,5,"The only thing I don't like about this book is that it wasn't around when I was a teenager. Firstly, I just want to say that this book is physically stunning. Beneath the dust jacket, the hardcover is all the colours of the rainbow and it's lovely. I also think the size is great, it's compact and smaller than most of the newer books on my bookcase. I'm also lucky enough to have a signed copy. This is a comforting, reassuring read for the most part, much like The Humans, only this one, of course, is non-fiction. One of the reasons I read books on mental health (and books generally) is that they make me feel a little less alone in the world and as I get older it's becoming more important for me to realise that I'm not the only one. This book certainly succeeded in that, as Haig depicts the lowest moments of his life in a stark manner, but more importantly, each of these moments was followed by a hopeful, uplifting note. Haig is also astute in analysing all of the ways in which modern society contributes to our nervous dispositions. He uses not only well-researched evidence to support his observations, but he also quotes some of the greatest minds in literature, and history more widely, which is something I particularly enjoyed throughout. He also offers his own wisdom on becoming ""a happy mess. Or, at least, a less miserable mess. A mess who can cope."" (p. 176) I think it's useful advice and I'll probably return to it in the future. A lovely read. Wonderfully human."

From now on I'll try and be kinder to me. Beware of the phone, don't look down on a good night's sleep, my job is not the most important thing in the world and I will not put it above my mental and physical health.

47,014313342X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10301421-nigeyb,5,"Matt Haig's novel The Humans was written in response to his depression - he then wrote a more explicit non-fiction book called Reasons to Stay Alive. Notes on a Nervous Planet is the follow up to Reasons to Stay Alive and is another winner.Notes on a Nervous Planet is short, inspiring and interesting. A really worthwhile book which imparts some hard won wisdom and some fascinating research too. I respond to his fundamental hope and optimism.A lot of Matt's solutions to the rising stress and anxiety which afflicts more and more people around the world is around consciously reducing external stimulation - turning off phone alerts; but also walks in the country; going for walks without a phone or other device; exercise; yoga; understanding the nature of tech addiction, the news agenda etc; understanding how the brain works; going to bed early; limiting alcohol/drug intake; seeing friends and family; and so on. I think we all intuitively know this stuff but sometimes it's hard to implement. Notes on a Nervous Planet is a great incentive to take a step back from it all and take stock.Like Matt, I've suffered from panic attacks and anxiety and so am now more tuned in to the triggers, and those lifestyle choices that help to stay calm and grounded versus those that don't, but I never take anything for granted, and I find books like this a really helpful source of advice and inspiration. The book contains many lists, here's one example.... How to exist in the 21st century and not have a panic attack1. Keep an eye on yourself, be your own friend, be your own parent, be kind to yourself, check on what you are doing e.g. do you need that third or fourth glass of wine, that next episode of a TV series if it's after midnight2. Declutter your mind - disconnect, simplify, have a filter etc3. Listen to calm noise - waves, rain, your own breath4. Let it happen - if you do panic let it happen, don't panic about the panic (easier said than done)5. Accept feelings and accept they are just that, feelings6. Don't grab life by the throat. Life should be touched not strangled - Ray Bradbury7. It is okay to release fear - try to accept it as a feeling 8. Be aware of where you are. Are your surrouding over stimulating. Look up. 9. Stretch and exercise - running and yoga really help10. Breathe - deep and pure and smooth. It's how to get back to the centre of yourself.If that kind of deeply personal, but also universal, musing delivered in a warm and somewhat scattershot way is the kind of think you might find interesting or helpful then read this book. 5/5The blurb....The world is messing with our mindsRates of stress and anxiety are rising. A fast, nervous planet is creating fast and nervous lives. We are more connected, yet feel more alone. And we are encouraged to worry about everything from world politics to our body mass index.- How can we stay sane on a planet that makes us mad? - How do we stay human in a technological world?- How do we feel happy when we are encouraged to be anxious?After experiencing years of anxiety and panic attacks, these questions became urgent matters of life and death for Matt Haig. And he began to look for the link between what he felt and the world around him.Notes on a Nervous Planet is a personal and vital look at how to feel happy, human and whole in the 21st century."

49,014313342X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16997775-siobhan,3,"Notes on a Nervous Planet is Matt Haig's somewhat sequel to Reasons To Stay Alive, in which he looks at the pace and panic of today's world and considers it through the lens of his own mental health issues, particularly anxiety. The style is very similar to the earlier book: short chapters with lots of lists and short sentences, emphasising his own suggestions and advice.The book has plenty of interesting thoughts and things to consider, particularly around technology and around how mental health issues that cause people to act in less societally acceptable ways aren't having the stigma removed in the same way that other issues might be. The way Haig darts through his content feels pretty similar to the issues of the pace of the modern world that he highlights and questions the positivity of, whether or not this is intentional, and there's not much chance for reflection. A lot of his lists of advice and suggestions will be helpful to some people, and completely irrelevant to others even with similar issues; this is perhaps the nature of books dealing with mental health in general, as everyone is different.The experience of reading Notes on a Nervous Planet is a bit like reading a series of internet thinkpieces and Twitter threads, for better or for worse. It will undoubtedly be, like Haig's previous book on mental health, a lifeline for some people, but others may find it annoying and not actually saying anything new. If you enjoyed or needed Reasons To Stay Alive, it is worth reading this one to see what you think."

Haig has successfully distilled the source of a widespread epidemic of stress and nervousness; you may not have thought about it before(Or maybe you have) how the constant barrage of information and misinformation affects our thinking and increases nervous tension. I will put up my hand and admit that I have been seriously influenced by the information/news of the world that has appeared and made itself so personal in my social media feeds.Perhaps it is timely that I address this review today, September 11, an anniversary that will affect most people on this planet. Perhaps this is the first ‚Äúmajor event‚Äù that sent waves of nervous energy around the globe? We (Australia) woke to an atrocity that became very personal; live streaming, ‚Äúon the ground reporting‚Äù, fear and anxiety, despair and grief stared us in the eyes and we responded to a tragedy that felt personal to us. And while we had a right to know about this shocking event, did we need to be so ‚Äúinvolved‚Äù in someone else‚Äôs grief? It is a complex situation but I can‚Äôt help but feel, like Matt Haig, that we are creating/being exposed to /manipulated into being a very nervous planet; too much information or mis information is almost as bad as too little in these sorts of circumstances. Empathy is one thing‚Ä¶but we do not need to take on board someone else‚Äôs grief, fear, anger. You can listen, understand, sympathise with the problems around you but you do not need to ‚Äúexperience‚Äù the negative vibes yourself.

(The suggestion I find most useful is the one about getting upset over distressing news programs: i.e. SWITCH IT OFF! and don't feel guilty about it).Haig is never preachy and includes many examples of his own (considerable) neurotic behaviour in demonstration of the widespread occurrence of anxiety and depression amongst humans. However, I did get the feeling that the cataloguing of reasons to be worried might well have the adverse effect of making the reader even more disturbed - discovering how much more there is to worry about than they thought!"

Yet in the world of 24 / 7 connections to family, friends and strangers around the world, people have never been more alone.In this modern world, can we stay sane?This is the follow up to his successful and what I consider now an¬†essential book, Reasons to Stay Alive. I that he told us of his journey back from staring into the abyss. In this, he lays out the problems of the modern world that have been caused by the internet as well as the positive benefits that it has brought. He makes it very personal, telling us of the issues that he has had with obsessions with Facebook, Twitter and the slightly unreal world of Instagram and how it has affected his mental health.Reading isn‚Äôt important because it helps to get you a job.

Woven into this is his own personal story about how his depression and anxiety has ebbed and flowed, often caused by spending way too long on the internet. Listening to the echo chamber is not good for your health, especially in this political climate, and this book is full of practical suggestions on how to cope with the relentlessness of it all, when and how to engage for an affirmative experience and when to turn the computer off, set the phone aside and go and do something else.

How can we live in a mad world without ourselves going mad? 
Matt Haig`s Notes on a Nervous Planet is all about providing to us, some sensible and practical solutions to the above complicated question.""We are humans. Let's not be ashamed to look like them.""This concisely well-written book is must-read for all humans who have a brain and a mind. Libraries aren't just about books. They are one of the few public spaces we have left which don't like our wallets more than us.The importance of the reading habit is so very well described in this book. Books truly help us to remain sane and think right. So, when depression slugs over me I close my eyes and enter the bank of good days and think of sunshine and laughter and turtles. And I try to remember how possible the impossible can sometimes be.Matt Haig provides us few key and useful guidelines. It is important for all of us to understand and realize that mental and emotional illness is like any other illness, like diabetes or cancer. It need not be a shame or a secret. There is no need to feel guilty. Mental illness is not a weakness or a flaw. The pain of this illness is as and more painful than other illnesses.It's all about being in the present moment! ****Why do humans worry so much about a stranger's opinion?Allow yourself just to be as you are.√¢‚Ç¨≈ìBe a map with 10,000 roads. Be the orange at sunset that outclasses the pink of sunrise. Be the self that dares to be true.You can feel as removed from yourself as a packet of toilet roll is removed from a tree."

4.5 nervous stars!I‚Äôd heard a lot about Matt Haig‚Äôs short book on anxiety; from other reviewers on Goodreads and one of my work colleagues. I was craving something non-fiction and kept seeing it in the supermarket so decided to give it a try.I‚Äôve experienced my fair share of anxiety in the past and have developed my own coping strategies. I picked this book up not knowing quite what to expect. It‚Äôs a candid look at Matt‚Äôs own struggles but more importantly, this book encourages to consider the kind of toxic life we lead in modern day society.Everything is engineered to encourage us to be consumers. The problem with being a consumer is that insatiable desire to want more. This is a hotbed for anxiety. Matt Haig refers to various recent studies to back up his words and provides helpful hints for how to switch off in a nervous world.I feel that this is a book worth reading again at some point and I would like my partner to read it too. Whether he does or not is another thing entirely as he rarely reads but never mind.I‚Äôd say this book is for everyone. Not simply for those who are actively nervous. In fact I‚Äôd say that those who aren‚Äôt nervous could get just as much out of it as it really helps you to question the way we unthinkingly live our lives."

Most of my life, now that I think about it, but I didn't seek help until I was 19 and forced to drop out of uni because both my physical and mental health had sort of imploded. I'm much better now, two and a half years later, and back at uni, but sometimes I do still find it hard to switch-off and disconnect from the constant barrage of shit in the news and the world in general.This was an excellent book, written as a series of notes that go on to form several narratives about combatting anxiety, as well as Matt Haig's personal experiences. Most of it I already knew, but the reminders to take a step back from technology is always an important reminder. If you suffer with anxiety then this is an excellent read. And even if you don't there is much to be gained."

73,014313342X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30070506-alisha,5,"The only thing I don't like about this book is that it wasn't around when I was a teenager. Firstly, I just want to say that this book is physically stunning. Beneath the dust jacket, the hardcover is all the colours of the rainbow and it's lovely. I also think the size is great, it's compact and smaller than most of the newer books on my bookcase. I'm also lucky enough to have a signed copy. This is a comforting, reassuring read for the most part, much like The Humans, only this one, of course, is non-fiction. One of the reasons I read books on mental health (and books generally) is that they make me feel a little less alone in the world and as I get older it's becoming more important for me to realise that I'm not the only one. This book certainly succeeded in that, as Haig depicts the lowest moments of his life in a stark manner, but more importantly, each of these moments was followed by a hopeful, uplifting note. Haig is also astute in analysing all of the ways in which modern society contributes to our nervous dispositions. He uses not only well-researched evidence to support his observations, but he also quotes some of the greatest minds in literature, and history more widely, which is something I particularly enjoyed throughout. He also offers his own wisdom on becoming ""a happy mess. Or, at least, a less miserable mess. A mess who can cope."" (p. 176) I think it's useful advice and I'll probably return to it in the future. A lovely read. Wonderfully human."

77,014313342X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10301421-nigeyb,5,"Matt Haig's novel The Humans was written in response to his depression - he then wrote a more explicit non-fiction book called Reasons to Stay Alive. Notes on a Nervous Planet is the follow up to Reasons to Stay Alive and is another winner.Notes on a Nervous Planet is short, inspiring and interesting. A really worthwhile book which imparts some hard won wisdom and some fascinating research too. I respond to his fundamental hope and optimism.A lot of Matt's solutions to the rising stress and anxiety which afflicts more and more people around the world is around consciously reducing external stimulation - turning off phone alerts; but also walks in the country; going for walks without a phone or other device; exercise; yoga; understanding the nature of tech addiction, the news agenda etc; understanding how the brain works; going to bed early; limiting alcohol/drug intake; seeing friends and family; and so on. I think we all intuitively know this stuff but sometimes it's hard to implement. Notes on a Nervous Planet is a great incentive to take a step back from it all and take stock.Like Matt, I've suffered from panic attacks and anxiety and so am now more tuned in to the triggers, and those lifestyle choices that help to stay calm and grounded versus those that don't, but I never take anything for granted, and I find books like this a really helpful source of advice and inspiration. The book contains many lists, here's one example.... How to exist in the 21st century and not have a panic attack1. Keep an eye on yourself, be your own friend, be your own parent, be kind to yourself, check on what you are doing e.g. do you need that third or fourth glass of wine, that next episode of a TV series if it's after midnight2. Declutter your mind - disconnect, simplify, have a filter etc3. Listen to calm noise - waves, rain, your own breath4. Let it happen - if you do panic let it happen, don't panic about the panic (easier said than done)5. Accept feelings and accept they are just that, feelings6. Don't grab life by the throat. Life should be touched not strangled - Ray Bradbury7. It is okay to release fear - try to accept it as a feeling 8. Be aware of where you are. Are your surrouding over stimulating. Look up. 9. Stretch and exercise - running and yoga really help10. Breathe - deep and pure and smooth. It's how to get back to the centre of yourself.If that kind of deeply personal, but also universal, musing delivered in a warm and somewhat scattershot way is the kind of think you might find interesting or helpful then read this book. 5/5The blurb....The world is messing with our mindsRates of stress and anxiety are rising. A fast, nervous planet is creating fast and nervous lives. We are more connected, yet feel more alone. And we are encouraged to worry about everything from world politics to our body mass index.- How can we stay sane on a planet that makes us mad? - How do we stay human in a technological world?- How do we feel happy when we are encouraged to be anxious?After experiencing years of anxiety and panic attacks, these questions became urgent matters of life and death for Matt Haig. And he began to look for the link between what he felt and the world around him.Notes on a Nervous Planet is a personal and vital look at how to feel happy, human and whole in the 21st century."

79,014313342X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16997775-siobhan,3,"Notes on a Nervous Planet is Matt Haig's somewhat sequel to Reasons To Stay Alive, in which he looks at the pace and panic of today's world and considers it through the lens of his own mental health issues, particularly anxiety. The style is very similar to the earlier book: short chapters with lots of lists and short sentences, emphasising his own suggestions and advice.The book has plenty of interesting thoughts and things to consider, particularly around technology and around how mental health issues that cause people to act in less societally acceptable ways aren't having the stigma removed in the same way that other issues might be. The way Haig darts through his content feels pretty similar to the issues of the pace of the modern world that he highlights and questions the positivity of, whether or not this is intentional, and there's not much chance for reflection. A lot of his lists of advice and suggestions will be helpful to some people, and completely irrelevant to others even with similar issues; this is perhaps the nature of books dealing with mental health in general, as everyone is different.The experience of reading Notes on a Nervous Planet is a bit like reading a series of internet thinkpieces and Twitter threads, for better or for worse. It will undoubtedly be, like Haig's previous book on mental health, a lifeline for some people, but others may find it annoying and not actually saying anything new. If you enjoyed or needed Reasons To Stay Alive, it is worth reading this one to see what you think."

Haig has successfully distilled the source of a widespread epidemic of stress and nervousness; you may not have thought about it before(Or maybe you have) how the constant barrage of information and misinformation affects our thinking and increases nervous tension. I will put up my hand and admit that I have been seriously influenced by the information/news of the world that has appeared and made itself so personal in my social media feeds.Perhaps it is timely that I address this review today, September 11, an anniversary that will affect most people on this planet. Perhaps this is the first ‚Äúmajor event‚Äù that sent waves of nervous energy around the globe? We (Australia) woke to an atrocity that became very personal; live streaming, ‚Äúon the ground reporting‚Äù, fear and anxiety, despair and grief stared us in the eyes and we responded to a tragedy that felt personal to us. And while we had a right to know about this shocking event, did we need to be so ‚Äúinvolved‚Äù in someone else‚Äôs grief? It is a complex situation but I can‚Äôt help but feel, like Matt Haig, that we are creating/being exposed to /manipulated into being a very nervous planet; too much information or mis information is almost as bad as too little in these sorts of circumstances. Empathy is one thing‚Ä¶but we do not need to take on board someone else‚Äôs grief, fear, anger. You can listen, understand, sympathise with the problems around you but you do not need to ‚Äúexperience‚Äù the negative vibes yourself.

(The suggestion I find most useful is the one about getting upset over distressing news programs: i.e. SWITCH IT OFF! and don't feel guilty about it).Haig is never preachy and includes many examples of his own (considerable) neurotic behaviour in demonstration of the widespread occurrence of anxiety and depression amongst humans.

How can we live in a mad world without ourselves going mad? 
Matt Haig`s Notes on a Nervous Planet is all about providing to us, some sensible and practical solutions to the above complicated question.""We are humans. Let's not be ashamed to look like them.""This concisely well-written book is must-read for all humans who have a brain and a mind. Libraries aren't just about books. They are one of the few public spaces we have left which don't like our wallets more than us.The importance of the reading habit is so very well described in this book. Books truly help us to remain sane and think right. So, when depression slugs over me I close my eyes and enter the bank of good days and think of sunshine and laughter and turtles. And I try to remember how possible the impossible can sometimes be.Matt Haig provides us few key and useful guidelines. It is important for all of us to understand and realize that mental and emotional illness is like any other illness, like diabetes or cancer. It need not be a shame or a secret. There is no need to feel guilty. Mental illness is not a weakness or a flaw. The pain of this illness is as and more painful than other illnesses.It's all about being in the present moment! ****Why do humans worry so much about a stranger's opinion?Allow yourself just to be as you are.√¢‚Ç¨≈ìBe a map with 10,000 roads. Be the orange at sunset that outclasses the pink of sunrise. Be the self that dares to be true.You can feel as removed from yourself as a packet of toilet roll is removed from a tree."

‚ÄúMaybe the point of life is to give up certainty and to embrace life‚Äôs beautiful uncertainty‚Äù
4.5 nervous stars!I‚Äôd heard a lot about Matt Haig‚Äôs short book on anxiety; from other reviewers on Goodreads and one of my work colleagues. I was craving something non-fiction and kept seeing it in the supermarket so decided to give it a try.I‚Äôve experienced my fair share of anxiety in the past and have developed my own coping strategies. I picked this book up not knowing quite what to expect. It‚Äôs a candid look at Matt‚Äôs own struggles but more importantly, this book encourages to consider the kind of toxic life we lead in modern day society.Everything is engineered to encourage us to be consumers. The problem with being a consumer is that insatiable desire to want more. This is a hotbed for anxiety. Matt Haig refers to various recent studies to back up his words and provides helpful hints for how to switch off in a nervous world.I feel that this is a book worth reading again at some point and I would like my partner to read it too. Whether he does or not is another thing entirely as he rarely reads but never mind.I‚Äôd say this book is for everyone. Not simply for those who are actively nervous. In fact I‚Äôd say that those who aren‚Äôt nervous could get just as much out of it as it really helps you to question the way we unthinkingly live our lives."

Most of my life, now that I think about it, but I didn't seek help until I was 19 and forced to drop out of uni because both my physical and mental health had sort of imploded. I'm much better now, two and a half years later, and back at uni, but sometimes I do still find it hard to switch-off and disconnect from the constant barrage of shit in the news and the world in general.This was an excellent book, written as a series of notes that go on to form several narratives about combatting anxiety, as well as Matt Haig's personal experiences. Most of it I already knew, but the reminders to take a step back from technology is always an important reminder. If you suffer with anxiety then this is an excellent read. And even if you don't there is much to be gained."

103,014313342X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30070506-alisha,5,"The only thing I don't like about this book is that it wasn't around when I was a teenager. Firstly, I just want to say that this book is physically stunning. Beneath the dust jacket, the hardcover is all the colours of the rainbow and it's lovely. I also think the size is great, it's compact and smaller than most of the newer books on my bookcase. I'm also lucky enough to have a signed copy. This is a comforting, reassuring read for the most part, much like The Humans, only this one, of course, is non-fiction. One of the reasons I read books on mental health (and books generally) is that they make me feel a little less alone in the world and as I get older it's becoming more important for me to realise that I'm not the only one. This book certainly succeeded in that, as Haig depicts the lowest moments of his life in a stark manner, but more importantly, each of these moments was followed by a hopeful, uplifting note. Haig is also astute in analysing all of the ways in which modern society contributes to our nervous dispositions. He uses not only well-researched evidence to support his observations, but he also quotes some of the greatest minds in literature, and history more widely, which is something I particularly enjoyed throughout. He also offers his own wisdom on becoming ""a happy mess. Or, at least, a less miserable mess. A mess who can cope."" (p. 176) I think it's useful advice and I'll probably return to it in the future. A lovely read. Wonderfully human."

Beware of the phone, don't look down on a good night's sleep, my job is not the most important thing in the world and I will not put it above my mental and physical health.

107,014313342X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10301421-nigeyb,5,"Matt Haig's novel The Humans was written in response to his depression - he then wrote a more explicit non-fiction book called Reasons to Stay Alive. Notes on a Nervous Planet is the follow up to Reasons to Stay Alive and is another winner.Notes on a Nervous Planet is short, inspiring and interesting. A really worthwhile book which imparts some hard won wisdom and some fascinating research too. I respond to his fundamental hope and optimism.A lot of Matt's solutions to the rising stress and anxiety which afflicts more and more people around the world is around consciously reducing external stimulation - turning off phone alerts; but also walks in the country; going for walks without a phone or other device; exercise; yoga; understanding the nature of tech addiction, the news agenda etc; understanding how the brain works; going to bed early; limiting alcohol/drug intake; seeing friends and family; and so on. I think we all intuitively know this stuff but sometimes it's hard to implement. Notes on a Nervous Planet is a great incentive to take a step back from it all and take stock.Like Matt, I've suffered from panic attacks and anxiety and so am now more tuned in to the triggers, and those lifestyle choices that help to stay calm and grounded versus those that don't, but I never take anything for granted, and I find books like this a really helpful source of advice and inspiration. The book contains many lists, here's one example.... How to exist in the 21st century and not have a panic attack1. Keep an eye on yourself, be your own friend, be your own parent, be kind to yourself, check on what you are doing e.g. do you need that third or fourth glass of wine, that next episode of a TV series if it's after midnight2. Declutter your mind - disconnect, simplify, have a filter etc3. Listen to calm noise - waves, rain, your own breath4. Let it happen - if you do panic let it happen, don't panic about the panic (easier said than done)5. Accept feelings and accept they are just that, feelings6. Don't grab life by the throat. Life should be touched not strangled - Ray Bradbury7. It is okay to release fear - try to accept it as a feeling 8. Be aware of where you are. Are your surrouding over stimulating. Look up. 9. Stretch and exercise - running and yoga really help10. Breathe - deep and pure and smooth. It's how to get back to the centre of yourself.If that kind of deeply personal, but also universal, musing delivered in a warm and somewhat scattershot way is the kind of think you might find interesting or helpful then read this book. 5/5The blurb....The world is messing with our mindsRates of stress and anxiety are rising. A fast, nervous planet is creating fast and nervous lives. We are more connected, yet feel more alone. And we are encouraged to worry about everything from world politics to our body mass index.- How can we stay sane on a planet that makes us mad? - How do we stay human in a technological world?- How do we feel happy when we are encouraged to be anxious?After experiencing years of anxiety and panic attacks, these questions became urgent matters of life and death for Matt Haig. And he began to look for the link between what he felt and the world around him.Notes on a Nervous Planet is a personal and vital look at how to feel happy, human and whole in the 21st century."

109,014313342X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16997775-siobhan,3,"Notes on a Nervous Planet is Matt Haig's somewhat sequel to Reasons To Stay Alive, in which he looks at the pace and panic of today's world and considers it through the lens of his own mental health issues, particularly anxiety. The style is very similar to the earlier book: short chapters with lots of lists and short sentences, emphasising his own suggestions and advice.The book has plenty of interesting thoughts and things to consider, particularly around technology and around how mental health issues that cause people to act in less societally acceptable ways aren't having the stigma removed in the same way that other issues might be. The way Haig darts through his content feels pretty similar to the issues of the pace of the modern world that he highlights and questions the positivity of, whether or not this is intentional, and there's not much chance for reflection. A lot of his lists of advice and suggestions will be helpful to some people, and completely irrelevant to others even with similar issues; this is perhaps the nature of books dealing with mental health in general, as everyone is different.The experience of reading Notes on a Nervous Planet is a bit like reading a series of internet thinkpieces and Twitter threads, for better or for worse. It will undoubtedly be, like Haig's previous book on mental health, a lifeline for some people, but others may find it annoying and not actually saying anything new. If you enjoyed or needed Reasons To Stay Alive, it is worth reading this one to see what you think."

Haig has successfully distilled the source of a widespread epidemic of stress and nervousness; you may not have thought about it before(Or maybe you have) how the constant barrage of information and misinformation affects our thinking and increases nervous tension. I will put up my hand and admit that I have been seriously influenced by the information/news of the world that has appeared and made itself so personal in my social media feeds.Perhaps it is timely that I address this review today, September 11, an anniversary that will affect most people on this planet. Perhaps this is the first ‚Äúmajor event‚Äù that sent waves of nervous energy around the globe? We (Australia) woke to an atrocity that became very personal; live streaming, ‚Äúon the ground reporting‚Äù, fear and anxiety, despair and grief stared us in the eyes and we responded to a tragedy that felt personal to us. And while we had a right to know about this shocking event, did we need to be so ‚Äúinvolved‚Äù in someone else‚Äôs grief? It is a complex situation but I can‚Äôt help but feel, like Matt Haig, that we are creating/being exposed to /manipulated into being a very nervous planet; too much information or mis information is almost as bad as too little in these sorts of circumstances. Empathy is one thing‚Ä¶but we do not need to take on board someone else‚Äôs grief, fear, anger. You can listen, understand, sympathise with the problems around you but you do not need to ‚Äúexperience‚Äù the negative vibes yourself. A little distance can be good for the collective mental health of the globe.Do as Matt Haig suggests, take a moment, breathe deep, walk in the sun, walk in nature‚Ä¶switch off the phone, the laptop for a while‚Ä¶accept that technology and social media is a part of our life but not the only part. Engage with the real world more often, the benefits will be life changing. "

He makes it very personal, telling us of the issues that he has had with obsessions with Facebook, Twitter and the slightly unreal world of Instagram and how it has affected his mental health.Reading isn‚Äôt important because it helps to get you a job. It‚Äôs important because it gives you room to exist beyond the reality you‚Äôre given. It is how humans merge. How minds connect. Dreams. Empathy. Understanding.

Woven into this is his own personal story about how his depression and anxiety has ebbed and flowed, often caused by spending way too long on the internet. Listening to the echo chamber is not good for your health, especially in this political climate, and this book is full of practical suggestions on how to cope with the relentlessness of it all, when and how to engage for an affirmative experience and when to turn the computer off, set the phone aside and go and do something else. Probably essential reading for teenagers."

How can we live in a mad world without ourselves going mad? 
Matt Haig`s Notes on a Nervous Planet is all about providing to us, some sensible and practical solutions to the above complicated question.""We are humans. Let's not be ashamed to look like them.""This concisely well-written book is must-read for all humans who have a brain and a mind. Libraries aren't just about books. They are one of the few public spaces we have left which don't like our wallets more than us.The importance of the reading habit is so very well described in this book. Books truly help us to remain sane and think right. So, when depression slugs over me I close my eyes and enter the bank of good days and think of sunshine and laughter and turtles. And I try to remember how possible the impossible can sometimes be.Matt Haig provides us few key and useful guidelines. It is important for all of us to understand and realize that mental and emotional illness is like any other illness, like diabetes or cancer. It need not be a shame or a secret. There is no need to feel guilty. Mental illness is not a weakness or a flaw. The pain of this illness is as and more painful than other illnesses.It's all about being in the present moment! ****Why do humans worry so much about a stranger's opinion?Allow yourself just to be as you are.√¢‚Ç¨≈ìBe a map with 10,000 roads. Be the orange at sunset that outclasses the pink of sunrise. Be the self that dares to be true.You can feel as removed from yourself as a packet of toilet roll is removed from a tree."

‚ÄúMaybe the point of life is to give up certainty and to embrace life‚Äôs beautiful uncertainty‚Äù
4.5 nervous stars!I‚Äôd heard a lot about Matt Haig‚Äôs short book on anxiety; from other reviewers on Goodreads and one of my work colleagues. I was craving something non-fiction and kept seeing it in the supermarket so decided to give it a try.I‚Äôve experienced my fair share of anxiety in the past and have developed my own coping strategies. I picked this book up not knowing quite what to expect. It‚Äôs a candid look at Matt‚Äôs own struggles but more importantly, this book encourages to consider the kind of toxic life we lead in modern day society.Everything is engineered to encourage us to be consumers. The problem with being a consumer is that insatiable desire to want more. This is a hotbed for anxiety. Matt Haig refers to various recent studies to back up his words and provides helpful hints for how to switch off in a nervous world.I feel that this is a book worth reading again at some point and I would like my partner to read it too. Whether he does or not is another thing entirely as he rarely reads but never mind.I‚Äôd say this book is for everyone. Not simply for those who are actively nervous. In fact I‚Äôd say that those who aren‚Äôt nervous could get just as much out of it as it really helps you to question the way we unthinkingly live our lives."

Most of my life, now that I think about it, but I didn't seek help until I was 19 and forced to drop out of uni because both my physical and mental health had sort of imploded. I'm much better now, two and a half years later, and back at uni, but sometimes I do still find it hard to switch-off and disconnect from the constant barrage of shit in the news and the world in general.This was an excellent book, written as a series of notes that go on to form several narratives about combatting anxiety, as well as Matt Haig's personal experiences. Most of it I already knew, but the reminders to take a step back from technology is always an important reminder. If you suffer with anxiety then this is an excellent read. And even if you don't there is much to be gained."

Firstly, I just want to say that this book is physically stunning. Beneath the dust jacket, the hardcover is all the colours of the rainbow and it's lovely. I also think the size is great, it's compact and smaller than most of the newer books on my bookcase. I'm also lucky enough to have a signed copy. This is a comforting, reassuring read for the most part, much like The Humans, only this one, of course, is non-fiction. One of the reasons I read books on mental health (and books generally) is that they make me feel a little less alone in the world and as I get older it's becoming more important for me to realise that I'm not the only one. This book certainly succeeded in that, as Haig depicts the lowest moments of his life in a stark manner, but more importantly, each of these moments was followed by a hopeful, uplifting note. Haig is also astute in analysing all of the ways in which modern society contributes to our nervous dispositions. He uses not only well-researched evidence to support his observations, but he also quotes some of the greatest minds in literature, and history more widely, which is something I particularly enjoyed throughout. He also offers his own wisdom on becoming ""a happy mess. Or, at least, a less miserable mess. A mess who can cope."" (p. 176) I think it's useful advice and I'll probably return to it in the future. A lovely read. Wonderfully human."

And I love how eye-opening this book was for me. It's not like I didn't knew half of this was happening, it's not like it was novelty at all. It's more like I would never give it much attention if I haven't read ""Notes on a Nervous Planet"". This book made me immediately more mindful of the things I surround myself with. From now on I'll try and be kinder to me. Beware of the phone, don't look down on a good night's sleep, my job is not the most important thing in the world and I will not put it above my mental and physical health. I will remember to breath, to be outside, to enjoy nature, pet cats and read books."
137,014313342X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10301421-nigeyb,5,"Matt Haig's novel The Humans was written in response to his depression - he then wrote a more explicit non-fiction book called Reasons to Stay Alive. Notes on a Nervous Planet is the follow up to Reasons to Stay Alive and is another winner.Notes on a Nervous Planet is short, inspiring and interesting. A really worthwhile book which imparts some hard won wisdom and some fascinating research too. I respond to his fundamental hope and optimism.A lot of Matt's solutions to the rising stress and anxiety which afflicts more and more people around the world is around consciously reducing external stimulation - turning off phone alerts; but also walks in the country; going for walks without a phone or other device; exercise; yoga; understanding the nature of tech addiction, the news agenda etc; understanding how the brain works; going to bed early; limiting alcohol/drug intake; seeing friends and family; and so on. I think we all intuitively know this stuff but sometimes it's hard to implement. Notes on a Nervous Planet is a great incentive to take a step back from it all and take stock.Like Matt, I've suffered from panic attacks and anxiety and so am now more tuned in to the triggers, and those lifestyle choices that help to stay calm and grounded versus those that don't, but I never take anything for granted, and I find books like this a really helpful source of advice and inspiration. The book contains many lists, here's one example.... How to exist in the 21st century and not have a panic attack1. Keep an eye on yourself, be your own friend, be your own parent, be kind to yourself, check on what you are doing e.g. do you need that third or fourth glass of wine, that next episode of a TV series if it's after midnight2. Declutter your mind - disconnect, simplify, have a filter etc3. Listen to calm noise - waves, rain, your own breath4. Let it happen - if you do panic let it happen, don't panic about the panic (easier said than done)5. Accept feelings and accept they are just that, feelings6. Don't grab life by the throat. Life should be touched not strangled - Ray Bradbury7. It is okay to release fear - try to accept it as a feeling 8. Be aware of where you are. Are your surrouding over stimulating. Look up. 9. Stretch and exercise - running and yoga really help10. Breathe - deep and pure and smooth. It's how to get back to the centre of yourself.If that kind of deeply personal, but also universal, musing delivered in a warm and somewhat scattershot way is the kind of think you might find interesting or helpful then read this book. 5/5The blurb....The world is messing with our mindsRates of stress and anxiety are rising. A fast, nervous planet is creating fast and nervous lives. We are more connected, yet feel more alone. And we are encouraged to worry about everything from world politics to our body mass index.- How can we stay sane on a planet that makes us mad? - How do we stay human in a technological world?- How do we feel happy when we are encouraged to be anxious?After experiencing years of anxiety and panic attacks, these questions became urgent matters of life and death for Matt Haig. And he began to look for the link between what he felt and the world around him.Notes on a Nervous Planet is a personal and vital look at how to feel happy, human and whole in the 21st century."

139,014313342X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16997775-siobhan,3,"Notes on a Nervous Planet is Matt Haig's somewhat sequel to Reasons To Stay Alive, in which he looks at the pace and panic of today's world and considers it through the lens of his own mental health issues, particularly anxiety. The style is very similar to the earlier book: short chapters with lots of lists and short sentences, emphasising his own suggestions and advice.The book has plenty of interesting thoughts and things to consider, particularly around technology and around how mental health issues that cause people to act in less societally acceptable ways aren't having the stigma removed in the same way that other issues might be. The way Haig darts through his content feels pretty similar to the issues of the pace of the modern world that he highlights and questions the positivity of, whether or not this is intentional, and there's not much chance for reflection. A lot of his lists of advice and suggestions will be helpful to some people, and completely irrelevant to others even with similar issues; this is perhaps the nature of books dealing with mental health in general, as everyone is different.The experience of reading Notes on a Nervous Planet is a bit like reading a series of internet thinkpieces and Twitter threads, for better or for worse. It will undoubtedly be, like Haig's previous book on mental health, a lifeline for some people, but others may find it annoying and not actually saying anything new. If you enjoyed or needed Reasons To Stay Alive, it is worth reading this one to see what you think."

Haig has successfully distilled the source of a widespread epidemic of stress and nervousness; you may not have thought about it before(Or maybe you have) how the constant barrage of information and misinformation affects our thinking and increases nervous tension. I will put up my hand and admit that I have been seriously influenced by the information/news of the world that has appeared and made itself so personal in my social media feeds.Perhaps it is timely that I address this review today, September 11, an anniversary that will affect most people on this planet. Perhaps this is the first ‚Äúmajor event‚Äù that sent waves of nervous energy around the globe? We (Australia) woke to an atrocity that became very personal; live streaming, ‚Äúon the ground reporting‚Äù, fear and anxiety, despair and grief stared us in the eyes and we responded to a tragedy that felt personal to us. And while we had a right to know about this shocking event, did we need to be so ‚Äúinvolved‚Äù in someone else‚Äôs grief? It is a complex situation but I can‚Äôt help but feel, like Matt Haig, that we are creating/being exposed to /manipulated into being a very nervous planet; too much information or mis information is almost as bad as too little in these sorts of circumstances. Empathy is one thing‚Ä¶but we do not need to take on board someone else‚Äôs grief, fear, anger. You can listen, understand, sympathise with the problems around you but you do not need to ‚Äúexperience‚Äù the negative vibes yourself. A little distance can be good for the collective mental health of the globe.Do as Matt Haig suggests, take a moment, breathe deep, walk in the sun, walk in nature‚Ä¶switch off the phone, the laptop for a while‚Ä¶accept that technology and social media is a part of our life but not the only part. Engage with the real world more often, the benefits will be life changing. "

Most of my life, now that I think about it, but I didn't seek help until I was 19 and forced to drop out of uni because both my physical and mental health had sort of imploded. I'm much better now, two and a half years later, and back at uni, but sometimes I do still find it hard to switch-off and disconnect from the constant barrage of shit in the news and the world in general.This was an excellent book, written as a series of notes that go on to form several narratives about combatting anxiety, as well as Matt Haig's personal experiences. Most of it I already knew, but the reminders to take a step back from technology is always an important reminder. If you suffer with anxiety then this is an excellent read. And even if you don't there is much to be gained."

Firstly, I just want to say that this book is physically stunning. Beneath the dust jacket, the hardcover is all the colours of the rainbow and it's lovely. I also think the size is great, it's compact and smaller than most of the newer books on my bookcase. I'm also lucky enough to have a signed copy. This is a comforting, reassuring read for the most part, much like The Humans, only this one, of course, is non-fiction. One of the reasons I read books on mental health (and books generally) is that they make me feel a little less alone in the world and as I get older it's becoming more important for me to realise that I'm not the only one. This book certainly succeeded in that, as Haig depicts the lowest moments of his life in a stark manner, but more importantly, each of these moments was followed by a hopeful, uplifting note. Haig is also astute in analysing all of the ways in which modern society contributes to our nervous dispositions. He uses not only well-researched evidence to support his observations, but he also quotes some of the greatest minds in literature, and history more widely, which is something I particularly enjoyed throughout. He also offers his own wisdom on becoming ""a happy mess. Or, at least, a less miserable mess. A mess who can cope."" (p. 176) I think it's useful advice and I'll probably return to it in the future. A lovely read. Wonderfully human."

167,014313342X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10301421-nigeyb,5,"Matt Haig's novel The Humans was written in response to his depression - he then wrote a more explicit non-fiction book called Reasons to Stay Alive. Notes on a Nervous Planet is the follow up to Reasons to Stay Alive and is another winner.Notes on a Nervous Planet is short, inspiring and interesting. A really worthwhile book which imparts some hard won wisdom and some fascinating research too. I respond to his fundamental hope and optimism.A lot of Matt's solutions to the rising stress and anxiety which afflicts more and more people around the world is around consciously reducing external stimulation - turning off phone alerts; but also walks in the country; going for walks without a phone or other device; exercise; yoga; understanding the nature of tech addiction, the news agenda etc; understanding how the brain works; going to bed early; limiting alcohol/drug intake; seeing friends and family; and so on. I think we all intuitively know this stuff but sometimes it's hard to implement. Notes on a Nervous Planet is a great incentive to take a step back from it all and take stock.Like Matt, I've suffered from panic attacks and anxiety and so am now more tuned in to the triggers, and those lifestyle choices that help to stay calm and grounded versus those that don't, but I never take anything for granted, and I find books like this a really helpful source of advice and inspiration. The book contains many lists, here's one example.... How to exist in the 21st century and not have a panic attack1. Keep an eye on yourself, be your own friend, be your own parent, be kind to yourself, check on what you are doing e.g. do you need that third or fourth glass of wine, that next episode of a TV series if it's after midnight2. Declutter your mind - disconnect, simplify, have a filter etc3. Listen to calm noise - waves, rain, your own breath4. Let it happen - if you do panic let it happen, don't panic about the panic (easier said than done)5. Accept feelings and accept they are just that, feelings6. Don't grab life by the throat. Life should be touched not strangled - Ray Bradbury7. It is okay to release fear - try to accept it as a feeling 8. Be aware of where you are. Are your surrouding over stimulating. Look up. 9. Stretch and exercise - running and yoga really help10. Breathe - deep and pure and smooth. It's how to get back to the centre of yourself.If that kind of deeply personal, but also universal, musing delivered in a warm and somewhat scattershot way is the kind of think you might find interesting or helpful then read this book. 5/5The blurb....The world is messing with our mindsRates of stress and anxiety are rising. A fast, nervous planet is creating fast and nervous lives. We are more connected, yet feel more alone. And we are encouraged to worry about everything from world politics to our body mass index.- How can we stay sane on a planet that makes us mad? - How do we stay human in a technological world?- How do we feel happy when we are encouraged to be anxious?After experiencing years of anxiety and panic attacks, these questions became urgent matters of life and death for Matt Haig. And he began to look for the link between what he felt and the world around him.Notes on a Nervous Planet is a personal and vital look at how to feel happy, human and whole in the 21st century."

169,014313342X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16997775-siobhan,3,"Notes on a Nervous Planet is Matt Haig's somewhat sequel to Reasons To Stay Alive, in which he looks at the pace and panic of today's world and considers it through the lens of his own mental health issues, particularly anxiety. The style is very similar to the earlier book: short chapters with lots of lists and short sentences, emphasising his own suggestions and advice.The book has plenty of interesting thoughts and things to consider, particularly around technology and around how mental health issues that cause people to act in less societally acceptable ways aren't having the stigma removed in the same way that other issues might be. The way Haig darts through his content feels pretty similar to the issues of the pace of the modern world that he highlights and questions the positivity of, whether or not this is intentional, and there's not much chance for reflection. A lot of his lists of advice and suggestions will be helpful to some people, and completely irrelevant to others even with similar issues; this is perhaps the nature of books dealing with mental health in general, as everyone is different.The experience of reading Notes on a Nervous Planet is a bit like reading a series of internet thinkpieces and Twitter threads, for better or for worse. It will undoubtedly be, like Haig's previous book on mental health, a lifeline for some people, but others may find it annoying and not actually saying anything new. If you enjoyed or needed Reasons To Stay Alive, it is worth reading this one to see what you think."

I enjoyed it very much, and I was taking my own sweet time reading as I really did not want it to end.Here are some of my favorite parts:‚ÄúThere is no panacea or utopia, there is just love and kindness and trying, amid the chaos, to make things better where we can. And to keep our minds wide, wide open in a world that often wants to close them.‚Äù‚ÄúThe cure to misery was to ‚Äòdecorate one‚Äôs inner house to richly that one is content there, glad to welcome anyone who wants to come and stay, but happy all the same when one is inevitably alone‚Äò.‚Äù‚ÄúAnxiety is often a trigger for consumption.‚Äù‚ÄúDeclutter your mind.

Haig has successfully distilled the source of a widespread epidemic of stress and nervousness; you may not have thought about it before(Or maybe you have) how the constant barrage of information and misinformation affects our thinking and increases nervous tension. I will put up my hand and admit that I have been seriously influenced by the information/news of the world that has appeared and made itself so personal in my social media feeds.Perhaps it is timely that I address this review today, September 11, an anniversary that will affect most people on this planet. Perhaps this is the first ‚Äúmajor event‚Äù that sent waves of nervous energy around the globe? We (Australia) woke to an atrocity that became very personal; live streaming, ‚Äúon the ground reporting‚Äù, fear and anxiety, despair and grief stared us in the eyes and we responded to a tragedy that felt personal to us. And while we had a right to know about this shocking event, did we need to be so ‚Äúinvolved‚Äù in someone else‚Äôs grief? It is a complex situation but I can‚Äôt help but feel, like Matt Haig, that we are creating/being exposed to /manipulated into being a very nervous planet; too much information or mis information is almost as bad as too little in these sorts of circumstances. Empathy is one thing‚Ä¶but we do not need to take on board someone else‚Äôs grief, fear, anger. You can listen, understand, sympathise with the problems around you but you do not need to ‚Äúexperience‚Äù the negative vibes yourself. A little distance can be good for the collective mental health of the globe.Do as Matt Haig suggests, take a moment, breathe deep, walk in the sun, walk in nature‚Ä¶switch off the phone, the laptop for a while‚Ä¶accept that technology and social media is a part of our life but not the only part. Engage with the real world more often, the benefits will be life changing. "

Matt Haig`s Notes on a Nervous Planet is all about providing to us, some sensible and practical solutions to the above complicated question.""We are humans. Let's not be ashamed to look like them.""This concisely well-written book is must-read for all humans who have a brain and a mind. Libraries aren't just about books. They are one of the few public spaces we have left which don't like our wallets more than us.The importance of the reading habit is so very well described in this book. Books truly help us to remain sane and think right. So, when depression slugs over me I close my eyes and enter the bank of good days and think of sunshine and laughter and turtles. And I try to remember how possible the impossible can sometimes be.Matt Haig provides us few key and useful guidelines. It is important for all of us to understand and realize that mental and emotional illness is like any other illness, like diabetes or cancer. It need not be a shame or a secret. There is no need to feel guilty. Mental illness is not a weakness or a flaw. The pain of this illness is as and more painful than other illnesses.It's all about being in the present moment! ****Why do humans worry so much about a stranger's opinion?Allow yourself just to be as you are.√¢‚Ç¨≈ìBe a map with 10,000 roads.

4.5 nervous stars!I‚Äôd heard a lot about Matt Haig‚Äôs short book on anxiety; from other reviewers on Goodreads and one of my work colleagues. I was craving something non-fiction and kept seeing it in the supermarket so decided to give it a try.I‚Äôve experienced my fair share of anxiety in the past and have developed my own coping strategies. I picked this book up not knowing quite what to expect. It‚Äôs a candid look at Matt‚Äôs own struggles but more importantly, this book encourages to consider the kind of toxic life we lead in modern day society.Everything is engineered to encourage us to be consumers. The problem with being a consumer is that insatiable desire to want more. This is a hotbed for anxiety. Matt Haig refers to various recent studies to back up his words and provides helpful hints for how to switch off in a nervous world.I feel that this is a book worth reading again at some point and I would like my partner to read it too. Whether he does or not is another thing entirely as he rarely reads but never mind.I‚Äôd say this book is for everyone. Not simply for those who are actively nervous.

It's more like I would never give it much attention if I haven't read ""Notes on a Nervous Planet"". This book made me immediately more mindful of the things I surround myself with. From now on I'll try and be kinder to me. Beware of the phone, don't look down on a good night's sleep, my job is not the most important thing in the world and I will not put it above my mental and physical health. I will remember to breath, to be outside, to enjoy nature, pet cats and read books."

Notes on a Nervous Planet is the follow up to Reasons to Stay Alive and is another winner.Notes on a Nervous Planet is short, inspiring and interesting. A really worthwhile book which imparts some hard won wisdom and some fascinating research too. I respond to his fundamental hope and optimism.A lot of Matt's solutions to the rising stress and anxiety which afflicts more and more people around the world is around consciously reducing external stimulation - turning off phone alerts; but also walks in the country; going for walks without a phone or other device; exercise; yoga; understanding the nature of tech addiction, the news agenda etc; understanding how the brain works; going to bed early; limiting alcohol/drug intake; seeing friends and family; and so on. I think we all intuitively know this stuff but sometimes it's hard to implement. Notes on a Nervous Planet is a great incentive to take a step back from it all and take stock.Like Matt, I've suffered from panic attacks and anxiety and so am now more tuned in to the triggers, and those lifestyle choices that help to stay calm and grounded versus those that don't, but I never take anything for granted, and I find books like this a really helpful source of advice and inspiration. The book contains many lists, here's one example.... How to exist in the 21st century and not have a panic attack1. Keep an eye on yourself, be your own friend, be your own parent, be kind to yourself, check on what you are doing e.g. do you need that third or fourth glass of wine, that next episode of a TV series if it's after midnight2. Declutter your mind - disconnect, simplify, have a filter etc3. Listen to calm noise - waves, rain, your own breath4. Let it happen - if you do panic let it happen, don't panic about the panic (easier said than done)5. Accept feelings and accept they are just that, feelings6. Don't grab life by the throat. Life should be touched not strangled - Ray Bradbury7. It is okay to release fear - try to accept it as a feeling 8. Be aware of where you are. Are your surrouding over stimulating. Look up. 9. Stretch and exercise - running and yoga really help10. Breathe - deep and pure and smooth. It's how to get back to the centre of yourself.If that kind of deeply personal, but also universal, musing delivered in a warm and somewhat scattershot way is the kind of think you might find interesting or helpful then read this book. 5/5The blurb....The world is messing with our mindsRates of stress and anxiety are rising. A fast, nervous planet is creating fast and nervous lives. We are more connected, yet feel more alone. And we are encouraged to worry about everything from world politics to our body mass index.- How can we stay sane on a planet that makes us mad? - How do we stay human in a technological world?- How do we feel happy when we are encouraged to be anxious?After experiencing years of anxiety and panic attacks, these questions became urgent matters of life and death for Matt Haig. And he began to look for the link between what he felt and the world around him.Notes on a Nervous Planet is a personal and vital look at how to feel happy, human and whole in the 21st century."

199,014313342X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16997775-siobhan,3,"Notes on a Nervous Planet is Matt Haig's somewhat sequel to Reasons To Stay Alive, in which he looks at the pace and panic of today's world and considers it through the lens of his own mental health issues, particularly anxiety. The style is very similar to the earlier book: short chapters with lots of lists and short sentences, emphasising his own suggestions and advice.The book has plenty of interesting thoughts and things to consider, particularly around technology and around how mental health issues that cause people to act in less societally acceptable ways aren't having the stigma removed in the same way that other issues might be. The way Haig darts through his content feels pretty similar to the issues of the pace of the modern world that he highlights and questions the positivity of, whether or not this is intentional, and there's not much chance for reflection. A lot of his lists of advice and suggestions will be helpful to some people, and completely irrelevant to others even with similar issues; this is perhaps the nature of books dealing with mental health in general, as everyone is different.The experience of reading Notes on a Nervous Planet is a bit like reading a series of internet thinkpieces and Twitter threads, for better or for worse. It will undoubtedly be, like Haig's previous book on mental health, a lifeline for some people, but others may find it annoying and not actually saying anything new. If you enjoyed or needed Reasons To Stay Alive, it is worth reading this one to see what you think."

I enjoyed it very much, and I was taking my own sweet time reading as I really did not want it to end.Here are some of my favorite parts:‚ÄúThere is no panacea or utopia, there is just love and kindness and trying, amid the chaos, to make things better where we can. And to keep our minds wide, wide open in a world that often wants to close them.‚Äù‚ÄúThe cure to misery was to ‚Äòdecorate one‚Äôs inner house to richly that one is content there, glad to welcome anyone who wants to come and stay, but happy all the same when one is inevitably alone‚Äò.‚Äù‚ÄúAnxiety is often a trigger for consumption.‚Äù‚ÄúDeclutter your mind. Panic is the product of overload.‚Äù‚ÄúWhen normality becomes madness, the only way to find sanity is by daring to be different.

Haig has successfully distilled the source of a widespread epidemic of stress and nervousness; you may not have thought about it before(Or maybe you have) how the constant barrage of information and misinformation affects our thinking and increases nervous tension. I will put up my hand and admit that I have been seriously influenced by the information/news of the world that has appeared and made itself so personal in my social media feeds.Perhaps it is timely that I address this review today, September 11, an anniversary that will affect most people on this planet. Perhaps this is the first ‚Äúmajor event‚Äù that sent waves of nervous energy around the globe? We (Australia) woke to an atrocity that became very personal; live streaming, ‚Äúon the ground reporting‚Äù, fear and anxiety, despair and grief stared us in the eyes and we responded to a tragedy that felt personal to us. And while we had a right to know about this shocking event, did we need to be so ‚Äúinvolved‚Äù in someone else‚Äôs grief? It is a complex situation but I can‚Äôt help but feel, like Matt Haig, that we are creating/being exposed to /manipulated into being a very nervous planet; too much information or mis information is almost as bad as too little in these sorts of circumstances. Empathy is one thing‚Ä¶but we do not need to take on board someone else‚Äôs grief, fear, anger. You can listen, understand, sympathise with the problems around you but you do not need to ‚Äúexperience‚Äù the negative vibes yourself. A little distance can be good for the collective mental health of the globe.Do as Matt Haig suggests, take a moment, breathe deep, walk in the sun, walk in nature‚Ä¶switch off the phone, the laptop for a while‚Ä¶accept that technology and social media is a part of our life but not the only part. Engage with the real world more often, the benefits will be life changing. "

(The suggestion I find most useful is the one about getting upset over distressing news programs: i.e. SWITCH IT OFF! and don't feel guilty about it).Haig is never preachy and includes many examples of his own (considerable) neurotic behaviour in demonstration of the widespread occurrence of anxiety and depression amongst humans. However, I did get the feeling that the cataloguing of reasons to be worried might well have the adverse effect of making the reader even more disturbed - discovering how much more there is to worry about than they thought!"

Yet in the world of 24 / 7 connections to family, friends and strangers around the world, people have never been more alone.In this modern world, can we stay sane?This is the follow up to his successful and what I consider now an¬†essential book, Reasons to Stay Alive.

Matt Haig`s Notes on a Nervous Planet is all about providing to us, some sensible and practical solutions to the above complicated question.""We are humans. Let's not be ashamed to look like them.""This concisely well-written book is must-read for all humans who have a brain and a mind. Libraries aren't just about books. They are one of the few public spaces we have left which don't like our wallets more than us.The importance of the reading habit is so very well described in this book. Books truly help us to remain sane and think right. So, when depression slugs over me I close my eyes and enter the bank of good days and think of sunshine and laughter and turtles. And I try to remember how possible the impossible can sometimes be.Matt Haig provides us few key and useful guidelines. It is important for all of us to understand and realize that mental and emotional illness is like any other illness, like diabetes or cancer. It need not be a shame or a secret. There is no need to feel guilty. Mental illness is not a weakness or a flaw. The pain of this illness is as and more painful than other illnesses.It's all about being in the present moment! ****Why do humans worry so much about a stranger's opinion?Allow yourself just to be as you are.√¢‚Ç¨≈ìBe a map with 10,000 roads.

4.5 nervous stars!I‚Äôd heard a lot about Matt Haig‚Äôs short book on anxiety; from other reviewers on Goodreads and one of my work colleagues. I was craving something non-fiction and kept seeing it in the supermarket so decided to give it a try.I‚Äôve experienced my fair share of anxiety in the past and have developed my own coping strategies. I picked this book up not knowing quite what to expect. It‚Äôs a candid look at Matt‚Äôs own struggles but more importantly, this book encourages to consider the kind of toxic life we lead in modern day society.Everything is engineered to encourage us to be consumers. The problem with being a consumer is that insatiable desire to want more. This is a hotbed for anxiety. Matt Haig refers to various recent studies to back up his words and provides helpful hints for how to switch off in a nervous world.I feel that this is a book worth reading again at some point and I would like my partner to read it too. Whether he does or not is another thing entirely as he rarely reads but never mind.I‚Äôd say this book is for everyone. Not simply for those who are actively nervous. In fact I‚Äôd say that those who aren‚Äôt nervous could get just as much out of it as it really helps you to question the way we unthinkingly live our lives."

I'm much better now, two and a half years later, and back at uni, but sometimes I do still find it hard to switch-off and disconnect from the constant barrage of shit in the news and the world in general.This was an excellent book, written as a series of notes that go on to form several narratives about combatting anxiety, as well as Matt Haig's personal experiences. Most of it I already knew, but the reminders to take a step back from technology is always an important reminder. If you suffer with anxiety then this is an excellent read.

Firstly, I just want to say that this book is physically stunning. Beneath the dust jacket, the hardcover is all the colours of the rainbow and it's lovely. I also think the size is great, it's compact and smaller than most of the newer books on my bookcase. I'm also lucky enough to have a signed copy. This is a comforting, reassuring read for the most part, much like The Humans, only this one, of course, is non-fiction. One of the reasons I read books on mental health (and books generally) is that they make me feel a little less alone in the world and as I get older it's becoming more important for me to realise that I'm not the only one. This book certainly succeeded in that, as Haig depicts the lowest moments of his life in a stark manner, but more importantly, each of these moments was followed by a hopeful, uplifting note. Haig is also astute in analysing all of the ways in which modern society contributes to our nervous dispositions. He uses not only well-researched evidence to support his observations, but he also quotes some of the greatest minds in literature, and history more widely, which is something I particularly enjoyed throughout. He also offers his own wisdom on becoming ""a happy mess. Or, at least, a less miserable mess. A mess who can cope."" (p. 176) I think it's useful advice and I'll probably return to it in the future.

229,014313342X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16997775-siobhan,3,"Notes on a Nervous Planet is Matt Haig's somewhat sequel to Reasons To Stay Alive, in which he looks at the pace and panic of today's world and considers it through the lens of his own mental health issues, particularly anxiety. The style is very similar to the earlier book: short chapters with lots of lists and short sentences, emphasising his own suggestions and advice.The book has plenty of interesting thoughts and things to consider, particularly around technology and around how mental health issues that cause people to act in less societally acceptable ways aren't having the stigma removed in the same way that other issues might be. The way Haig darts through his content feels pretty similar to the issues of the pace of the modern world that he highlights and questions the positivity of, whether or not this is intentional, and there's not much chance for reflection. A lot of his lists of advice and suggestions will be helpful to some people, and completely irrelevant to others even with similar issues; this is perhaps the nature of books dealing with mental health in general, as everyone is different.The experience of reading Notes on a Nervous Planet is a bit like reading a series of internet thinkpieces and Twitter threads, for better or for worse. It will undoubtedly be, like Haig's previous book on mental health, a lifeline for some people, but others may find it annoying and not actually saying anything new.

Haig has successfully distilled the source of a widespread epidemic of stress and nervousness; you may not have thought about it before(Or maybe you have) how the constant barrage of information and misinformation affects our thinking and increases nervous tension. I will put up my hand and admit that I have been seriously influenced by the information/news of the world that has appeared and made itself so personal in my social media feeds.Perhaps it is timely that I address this review today, September 11, an anniversary that will affect most people on this planet. Perhaps this is the first ‚Äúmajor event‚Äù that sent waves of nervous energy around the globe? We (Australia) woke to an atrocity that became very personal; live streaming, ‚Äúon the ground reporting‚Äù, fear and anxiety, despair and grief stared us in the eyes and we responded to a tragedy that felt personal to us. And while we had a right to know about this shocking event, did we need to be so ‚Äúinvolved‚Äù in someone else‚Äôs grief? It is a complex situation but I can‚Äôt help but feel, like Matt Haig, that we are creating/being exposed to /manipulated into being a very nervous planet; too much information or mis information is almost as bad as too little in these sorts of circumstances. Empathy is one thing‚Ä¶but we do not need to take on board someone else‚Äôs grief, fear, anger. You can listen, understand, sympathise with the problems around you but you do not need to ‚Äúexperience‚Äù the negative vibes yourself. A little distance can be good for the collective mental health of the globe.Do as Matt Haig suggests, take a moment, breathe deep, walk in the sun, walk in nature‚Ä¶switch off the phone, the laptop for a while‚Ä¶accept that technology and social media is a part of our life but not the only part. Engage with the real world more often, the benefits will be life changing. "

(The suggestion I find most useful is the one about getting upset over distressing news programs: i.e. SWITCH IT OFF! and don't feel guilty about it).Haig is never preachy and includes many examples of his own (considerable) neurotic behaviour in demonstration of the widespread occurrence of anxiety and depression amongst humans. However, I did get the feeling that the cataloguing of reasons to be worried might well have the adverse effect of making the reader even more disturbed - discovering how much more there is to worry about than they thought!"

Yet in the world of 24 / 7 connections to family, friends and strangers around the world, people have never been more alone.In this modern world, can we stay sane?This is the follow up to his successful and what I consider now an¬†essential book, Reasons to Stay Alive.

How can we live in a mad world without ourselves going mad? 
Matt Haig`s Notes on a Nervous Planet is all about providing to us, some sensible and practical solutions to the above complicated question.""We are humans. Let's not be ashamed to look like them.""This concisely well-written book is must-read for all humans who have a brain and a mind. Libraries aren't just about books. They are one of the few public spaces we have left which don't like our wallets more than us.The importance of the reading habit is so very well described in this book. Books truly help us to remain sane and think right. So, when depression slugs over me I close my eyes and enter the bank of good days and think of sunshine and laughter and turtles. And I try to remember how possible the impossible can sometimes be.Matt Haig provides us few key and useful guidelines. It is important for all of us to understand and realize that mental and emotional illness is like any other illness, like diabetes or cancer. It need not be a shame or a secret. There is no need to feel guilty. Mental illness is not a weakness or a flaw. The pain of this illness is as and more painful than other illnesses.It's all about being in the present moment! ****Why do humans worry so much about a stranger's opinion?Allow yourself just to be as you are.√¢‚Ç¨≈ìBe a map with 10,000 roads. Be the orange at sunset that outclasses the pink of sunrise. Be the self that dares to be true.You can feel as removed from yourself as a packet of toilet roll is removed from a tree."

4.5 nervous stars!I‚Äôd heard a lot about Matt Haig‚Äôs short book on anxiety; from other reviewers on Goodreads and one of my work colleagues. I was craving something non-fiction and kept seeing it in the supermarket so decided to give it a try.I‚Äôve experienced my fair share of anxiety in the past and have developed my own coping strategies. I picked this book up not knowing quite what to expect. It‚Äôs a candid look at Matt‚Äôs own struggles but more importantly, this book encourages to consider the kind of toxic life we lead in modern day society.Everything is engineered to encourage us to be consumers. The problem with being a consumer is that insatiable desire to want more. This is a hotbed for anxiety. Matt Haig refers to various recent studies to back up his words and provides helpful hints for how to switch off in a nervous world.I feel that this is a book worth reading again at some point and I would like my partner to read it too. Whether he does or not is another thing entirely as he rarely reads but never mind.I‚Äôd say this book is for everyone. Not simply for those who are actively nervous. In fact I‚Äôd say that those who aren‚Äôt nervous could get just as much out of it as it really helps you to question the way we unthinkingly live our lives."

Most of my life, now that I think about it, but I didn't seek help until I was 19 and forced to drop out of uni because both my physical and mental health had sort of imploded. I'm much better now, two and a half years later, and back at uni, but sometimes I do still find it hard to switch-off and disconnect from the constant barrage of shit in the news and the world in general.This was an excellent book, written as a series of notes that go on to form several narratives about combatting anxiety, as well as Matt Haig's personal experiences. Most of it I already knew, but the reminders to take a step back from technology is always an important reminder. If you suffer with anxiety then this is an excellent read.

Firstly, I just want to say that this book is physically stunning. Beneath the dust jacket, the hardcover is all the colours of the rainbow and it's lovely. I also think the size is great, it's compact and smaller than most of the newer books on my bookcase. I'm also lucky enough to have a signed copy. This is a comforting, reassuring read for the most part, much like The Humans, only this one, of course, is non-fiction. One of the reasons I read books on mental health (and books generally) is that they make me feel a little less alone in the world and as I get older it's becoming more important for me to realise that I'm not the only one. This book certainly succeeded in that, as Haig depicts the lowest moments of his life in a stark manner, but more importantly, each of these moments was followed by a hopeful, uplifting note. Haig is also astute in analysing all of the ways in which modern society contributes to our nervous dispositions. He uses not only well-researched evidence to support his observations, but he also quotes some of the greatest minds in literature, and history more widely, which is something I particularly enjoyed throughout. He also offers his own wisdom on becoming ""a happy mess. Or, at least, a less miserable mess. A mess who can cope."" (p. 176) I think it's useful advice and I'll probably return to it in the future. A lovely read. Wonderfully human."

Notes on a Nervous Planet is the follow up to Reasons to Stay Alive and is another winner.Notes on a Nervous Planet is short, inspiring and interesting. A really worthwhile book which imparts some hard won wisdom and some fascinating research too. I respond to his fundamental hope and optimism.A lot of Matt's solutions to the rising stress and anxiety which afflicts more and more people around the world is around consciously reducing external stimulation - turning off phone alerts; but also walks in the country; going for walks without a phone or other device; exercise; yoga; understanding the nature of tech addiction, the news agenda etc; understanding how the brain works; going to bed early; limiting alcohol/drug intake; seeing friends and family; and so on. I think we all intuitively know this stuff but sometimes it's hard to implement. Notes on a Nervous Planet is a great incentive to take a step back from it all and take stock.Like Matt, I've suffered from panic attacks and anxiety and so am now more tuned in to the triggers, and those lifestyle choices that help to stay calm and grounded versus those that don't, but I never take anything for granted, and I find books like this a really helpful source of advice and inspiration. The book contains many lists, here's one example.... How to exist in the 21st century and not have a panic attack1. Keep an eye on yourself, be your own friend, be your own parent, be kind to yourself, check on what you are doing e.g. do you need that third or fourth glass of wine, that next episode of a TV series if it's after midnight2. Declutter your mind - disconnect, simplify, have a filter etc3. Listen to calm noise - waves, rain, your own breath4. Let it happen - if you do panic let it happen, don't panic about the panic (easier said than done)5. Accept feelings and accept they are just that, feelings6. Don't grab life by the throat. Life should be touched not strangled - Ray Bradbury7. It is okay to release fear - try to accept it as a feeling 8. Be aware of where you are. Are your surrouding over stimulating. Look up. 9. Stretch and exercise - running and yoga really help10. Breathe - deep and pure and smooth. It's how to get back to the centre of yourself.If that kind of deeply personal, but also universal, musing delivered in a warm and somewhat scattershot way is the kind of think you might find interesting or helpful then read this book. 5/5The blurb....The world is messing with our mindsRates of stress and anxiety are rising. A fast, nervous planet is creating fast and nervous lives. We are more connected, yet feel more alone. And we are encouraged to worry about everything from world politics to our body mass index.- How can we stay sane on a planet that makes us mad? - How do we stay human in a technological world?- How do we feel happy when we are encouraged to be anxious?After experiencing years of anxiety and panic attacks, these questions became urgent matters of life and death for Matt Haig. And he began to look for the link between what he felt and the world around him.Notes on a Nervous Planet is a personal and vital look at how to feel happy, human and whole in the 21st century."

And while we had a right to know about this shocking event, did we need to be so ‚Äúinvolved‚Äù in someone else‚Äôs grief? It is a complex situation but I can‚Äôt help but feel, like Matt Haig, that we are creating/being exposed to /manipulated into being a very nervous planet; too much information or mis information is almost as bad as too little in these sorts of circumstances. Empathy is one thing‚Ä¶but we do not need to take on board someone else‚Äôs grief, fear, anger. You can listen, understand, sympathise with the problems around you but you do not need to ‚Äúexperience‚Äù the negative vibes yourself. A little distance can be good for the collective mental health of the globe.Do as Matt Haig suggests, take a moment, breathe deep, walk in the sun, walk in nature‚Ä¶switch off the phone, the laptop for a while‚Ä¶accept that technology and social media is a part of our life but not the only part. Engage with the real world more often, the benefits will be life changing. "

(The suggestion I find most useful is the one about getting upset over distressing news programs: i.e. SWITCH IT OFF! and don't feel guilty about it).Haig is never preachy and includes many examples of his own (considerable) neurotic behaviour in demonstration of the widespread occurrence of anxiety and depression amongst humans. However, I did get the feeling that the cataloguing of reasons to be worried might well have the adverse effect of making the reader even more disturbed - discovering how much more there is to worry about than they thought!"

Yet in the world of 24 / 7 connections to family, friends and strangers around the world, people have never been more alone.In this modern world, can we stay sane?This is the follow up to his successful and what I consider now an¬†essential book, Reasons to Stay Alive. I that he told us of his journey back from staring into the abyss. In this, he lays out the problems of the modern world that have been caused by the internet as well as the positive benefits that it has brought. He makes it very personal, telling us of the issues that he has had with obsessions with Facebook, Twitter and the slightly unreal world of Instagram and how it has affected his mental health.Reading isn‚Äôt important because it helps to get you a job.

Woven into this is his own personal story about how his depression and anxiety has ebbed and flowed, often caused by spending way too long on the internet. Listening to the echo chamber is not good for your health, especially in this political climate, and this book is full of practical suggestions on how to cope with the relentlessness of it all, when and how to engage for an affirmative experience and when to turn the computer off, set the phone aside and go and do something else.

How can we live in a mad world without ourselves going mad? 
Matt Haig`s Notes on a Nervous Planet is all about providing to us, some sensible and practical solutions to the above complicated question.""We are humans. Let's not be ashamed to look like them.""This concisely well-written book is must-read for all humans who have a brain and a mind. Libraries aren't just about books. They are one of the few public spaces we have left which don't like our wallets more than us.The importance of the reading habit is so very well described in this book. Books truly help us to remain sane and think right. So, when depression slugs over me I close my eyes and enter the bank of good days and think of sunshine and laughter and turtles. And I try to remember how possible the impossible can sometimes be.Matt Haig provides us few key and useful guidelines. It is important for all of us to understand and realize that mental and emotional illness is like any other illness, like diabetes or cancer. It need not be a shame or a secret. There is no need to feel guilty. Mental illness is not a weakness or a flaw. The pain of this illness is as and more painful than other illnesses.It's all about being in the present moment! ****Why do humans worry so much about a stranger's opinion?Allow yourself just to be as you are.√¢‚Ç¨≈ìBe a map with 10,000 roads. Be the orange at sunset that outclasses the pink of sunrise. Be the self that dares to be true.You can feel as removed from yourself as a packet of toilet roll is removed from a tree."

4.5 nervous stars!I‚Äôd heard a lot about Matt Haig‚Äôs short book on anxiety; from other reviewers on Goodreads and one of my work colleagues. I was craving something non-fiction and kept seeing it in the supermarket so decided to give it a try.I‚Äôve experienced my fair share of anxiety in the past and have developed my own coping strategies. I picked this book up not knowing quite what to expect. It‚Äôs a candid look at Matt‚Äôs own struggles but more importantly, this book encourages to consider the kind of toxic life we lead in modern day society.Everything is engineered to encourage us to be consumers. The problem with being a consumer is that insatiable desire to want more. This is a hotbed for anxiety. Matt Haig refers to various recent studies to back up his words and provides helpful hints for how to switch off in a nervous world.I feel that this is a book worth reading again at some point and I would like my partner to read it too. Whether he does or not is another thing entirely as he rarely reads but never mind.I‚Äôd say this book is for everyone. Not simply for those who are actively nervous. In fact I‚Äôd say that those who aren‚Äôt nervous could get just as much out of it as it really helps you to question the way we unthinkingly live our lives."

Most of my life, now that I think about it, but I didn't seek help until I was 19 and forced to drop out of uni because both my physical and mental health had sort of imploded. I'm much better now, two and a half years later, and back at uni, but sometimes I do still find it hard to switch-off and disconnect from the constant barrage of shit in the news and the world in general.This was an excellent book, written as a series of notes that go on to form several narratives about combatting anxiety, as well as Matt Haig's personal experiences. Most of it I already knew, but the reminders to take a step back from technology is always an important reminder. If you suffer with anxiety then this is an excellent read.

Firstly, I just want to say that this book is physically stunning. Beneath the dust jacket, the hardcover is all the colours of the rainbow and it's lovely. I also think the size is great, it's compact and smaller than most of the newer books on my bookcase. I'm also lucky enough to have a signed copy. This is a comforting, reassuring read for the most part, much like The Humans, only this one, of course, is non-fiction. One of the reasons I read books on mental health (and books generally) is that they make me feel a little less alone in the world and as I get older it's becoming more important for me to realise that I'm not the only one. This book certainly succeeded in that, as Haig depicts the lowest moments of his life in a stark manner, but more importantly, each of these moments was followed by a hopeful, uplifting note. Haig is also astute in analysing all of the ways in which modern society contributes to our nervous dispositions. He uses not only well-researched evidence to support his observations, but he also quotes some of the greatest minds in literature, and history more widely, which is something I particularly enjoyed throughout. He also offers his own wisdom on becoming ""a happy mess. Or, at least, a less miserable mess. A mess who can cope."" (p. 176) I think it's useful advice and I'll probably return to it in the future. A lovely read. Wonderfully human."

287,014313342X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10301421-nigeyb,5,"Matt Haig's novel The Humans was written in response to his depression - he then wrote a more explicit non-fiction book called Reasons to Stay Alive. Notes on a Nervous Planet is the follow up to Reasons to Stay Alive and is another winner.Notes on a Nervous Planet is short, inspiring and interesting. A really worthwhile book which imparts some hard won wisdom and some fascinating research too. I respond to his fundamental hope and optimism.A lot of Matt's solutions to the rising stress and anxiety which afflicts more and more people around the world is around consciously reducing external stimulation - turning off phone alerts; but also walks in the country; going for walks without a phone or other device; exercise; yoga; understanding the nature of tech addiction, the news agenda etc; understanding how the brain works; going to bed early; limiting alcohol/drug intake; seeing friends and family; and so on. I think we all intuitively know this stuff but sometimes it's hard to implement. Notes on a Nervous Planet is a great incentive to take a step back from it all and take stock.Like Matt, I've suffered from panic attacks and anxiety and so am now more tuned in to the triggers, and those lifestyle choices that help to stay calm and grounded versus those that don't, but I never take anything for granted, and I find books like this a really helpful source of advice and inspiration. The book contains many lists, here's one example.... How to exist in the 21st century and not have a panic attack1. Keep an eye on yourself, be your own friend, be your own parent, be kind to yourself, check on what you are doing e.g. do you need that third or fourth glass of wine, that next episode of a TV series if it's after midnight2. Declutter your mind - disconnect, simplify, have a filter etc3. Listen to calm noise - waves, rain, your own breath4. Let it happen - if you do panic let it happen, don't panic about the panic (easier said than done)5. Accept feelings and accept they are just that, feelings6. Don't grab life by the throat. Life should be touched not strangled - Ray Bradbury7. It is okay to release fear - try to accept it as a feeling 8. Be aware of where you are. Are your surrouding over stimulating. Look up. 9. Stretch and exercise - running and yoga really help10. Breathe - deep and pure and smooth. It's how to get back to the centre of yourself.If that kind of deeply personal, but also universal, musing delivered in a warm and somewhat scattershot way is the kind of think you might find interesting or helpful then read this book. 5/5The blurb....The world is messing with our mindsRates of stress and anxiety are rising. A fast, nervous planet is creating fast and nervous lives. We are more connected, yet feel more alone. And we are encouraged to worry about everything from world politics to our body mass index.- How can we stay sane on a planet that makes us mad? - How do we stay human in a technological world?- How do we feel happy when we are encouraged to be anxious?After experiencing years of anxiety and panic attacks, these questions became urgent matters of life and death for Matt Haig. And he began to look for the link between what he felt and the world around him.Notes on a Nervous Planet is a personal and vital look at how to feel happy, human and whole in the 21st century."

289,014313342X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16997775-siobhan,3,"Notes on a Nervous Planet is Matt Haig's somewhat sequel to Reasons To Stay Alive, in which he looks at the pace and panic of today's world and considers it through the lens of his own mental health issues, particularly anxiety. The style is very similar to the earlier book: short chapters with lots of lists and short sentences, emphasising his own suggestions and advice.The book has plenty of interesting thoughts and things to consider, particularly around technology and around how mental health issues that cause people to act in less societally acceptable ways aren't having the stigma removed in the same way that other issues might be. The way Haig darts through his content feels pretty similar to the issues of the pace of the modern world that he highlights and questions the positivity of, whether or not this is intentional, and there's not much chance for reflection. A lot of his lists of advice and suggestions will be helpful to some people, and completely irrelevant to others even with similar issues; this is perhaps the nature of books dealing with mental health in general, as everyone is different.The experience of reading Notes on a Nervous Planet is a bit like reading a series of internet thinkpieces and Twitter threads, for better or for worse. It will undoubtedly be, like Haig's previous book on mental health, a lifeline for some people, but others may find it annoying and not actually saying anything new.

Haig has successfully distilled the source of a widespread epidemic of stress and nervousness; you may not have thought about it before(Or maybe you have) how the constant barrage of information and misinformation affects our thinking and increases nervous tension. I will put up my hand and admit that I have been seriously influenced by the information/news of the world that has appeared and made itself so personal in my social media feeds.Perhaps it is timely that I address this review today, September 11, an anniversary that will affect most people on this planet. Perhaps this is the first ‚Äúmajor event‚Äù that sent waves of nervous energy around the globe? We (Australia) woke to an atrocity that became very personal; live streaming, ‚Äúon the ground reporting‚Äù, fear and anxiety, despair and grief stared us in the eyes and we responded to a tragedy that felt personal to us. And while we had a right to know about this shocking event, did we need to be so ‚Äúinvolved‚Äù in someone else‚Äôs grief? It is a complex situation but I can‚Äôt help but feel, like Matt Haig, that we are creating/being exposed to /manipulated into being a very nervous planet; too much information or mis information is almost as bad as too little in these sorts of circumstances.
