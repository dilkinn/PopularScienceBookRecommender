0,0805098887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4086118-michael,5,"A wonderful tour of how animals think and feel and plea to afford them respect as beings worthy of better stewardship of their fate by the planet’s masters. You are in reliable hands with a respected ecologist and conservationist as long as you factor in that animal behavior and brain science are outside his field of expertise. The societies of elephants, wolves, killer whales get the lion’s share of focus, enhanced by the author’s long forays with field scientists who have monitoring their societies for decades. There are many forays into discoveries from study of chimps, bonobos, birds, and even reptiles and insects to enhance his themes. For elephants we spend time in a park in Kenya , for wolves it is in Yellowstone National Park, and for killer whales the locus is Washington State. Another section, “Whines and Pet Peeves” cuts across species as it takes laboratory scientist and philosophers to task for sophistry and reticence to accede to the obvious that a number of animals possess minds and depths of feelings comparable in richness and validity to the precious cargo of vaunted humanity, top dogs of the earth. Over a dozen essay-chapters for each of the three featured species on various topics makes for a nice level of depth and a delightful spectrum of examples of the amazing ways these animals are geniuses in their own lives and sensitive beings in their own ways. It was a great catch-up for me as I haven’t read much on animal behavior studies since syntheses by Jane Goodall on chimps, John Lilly on dolphins, and Barry Lopez on wolves some decades ago (recent exceptions being De Waal on primate empathy and Sapolsky on baboon societies). In example after example, we are shown how acts of individuals from these species bear resemblance in multiple ways to human behaviors associated with the full range of emotions: love, empathy, joy, envy, jealousy, pride, shame, pity, grief, and likely awe and magnanimity. One can never know what their true feelings are like since they can’t speak, but close analogy to the human forms is a simpler, even scientific, supposition compared to the alternative that they emerged in exalted form in humans and limited forms only in our “higher” primate cousins. Besides, these emotions as well as exalted cognitive feats of humans are often beyond characterization by language and mean different things to different people (e.g. is love more a state of freedom or dependence?). Just as with human families or tribes, elephant, wolf, and killer whale counterparts can be flexible in composition between strictly biological members or outsiders adopted into them. For the people watching them over the years, the animals’ individual personalities shine through no less than what we experience with our own pets. And their personalities seem obviously critical to their success or challenges in the social roles they assume. Yes, we get a special amplification of social memory and abstract communication with human language, but is this capability a difference in degree or a qualitative leap above particularly brainy animals? Though animals may have a pretty extensive range of communication calls and signals and primitive levels of syntax and generativity when taught symbolic modes of communicating with humans, what stands out is their ability to “read” each others’ intentions and feelings without words. And touch is a persistent and universal mode of sharing emotions and social cohesion among the three species (as well as dolphins and primates). Of course nobody really knows what is conveyed in the rich sonar and aural productions of Cetaceans, the howling of wolves, the recently discovered complex vocalizations of elephants in the low frequency range below human hearing, and the repertoire of gestures being uncovered among gorillas and other apes. A case of a female Yellowstone wolf with a bullying, despotic personality being exiled from the pack by her own sistersThe careers of particular animals conveyed by Safina come off as characters in a history or story. For example, one wolf, Number Six, seems in every way “The Prefect Wolf.” She successfully manages the largest packs ever known and with such harmony fights are rare. She is such a hunter that she singlehandedly killed two elk in one day. When an intruder is cornered in defeat, she dispenses mercy by letting him go instead of meting out a fatal attack common to others in the same situation. And we learn of one elephant matriarch who has been the leader of the herd for decades, maintaining lifelong bonds with her children. She uses essential knowledge of their world for navigating long foraging treks to known sources of water and food at particular times of the year, and the skills of marshalling her family to successfully address dangers to young or infirm members in the face of predators. Similar stories and observations apply to examples of the female leaders of a wolf pack and a killer whale pod, but longevity of killer whales puts them more in line with the elephants for their memory as a cultural repository and survival benefit for the family.   A female killer whale in Peuget Sound playing with her three-year daughter. Children are rare in this salmon eating species in decline, and this one was killed accidentally by naval practice gunnery or demolitionThe efforts to get to know these species in their natural state in the wild are confounded by stresses and losses due to impacts of mankind. More and more what gets observed by their long-term monitors is angle both on pathology and resilient adaptation to changes in their environment, food sources, and unnecessary deaths of key family leaders. The social devastation to family structure and survival is covered in examples from each species in the aftermath a losses of the matriarch. In the case of elephant and wolf examples, the parks in Kenya and Yellowstone are too small to protect species whose range goes outside park and, for elephants, do not a sufficient barrier to poaching. The continuing decline of killer whales in the Pacific Northwest reflects loss of their salmon prey, pollution such as lead, boating or fishing accidents, or adverse impacts of naval operations such as from sonar blasts or demolition (as many as ten species specialize in different food prey, such as seals among their Arctic cousins). As we can see clearly from Safina’s narrative the loss of key family members can mean death to a whole family from the disruption of missing leadership, cultural knowledge, and the emotional center for adults and infants alike. He emphasizes how we need to be aware of these consequences and hopefully get more serious about halting the continuing decline in each species’ populations still going after reductions of 90% or more in their numbers and ranges over the last couple of hundred years.Safina’s writing is accessible to general readers and jargon free. For example, he refrains from even using words like ecological niche or altruism. I applaud his deflating claims of neuroscience of accounting for unique capabilities of humans, although at one point he countenances with objection claims that over-aggressiveness, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and autism are caused by deficiencies in neural systems using serotonin as a transmitter to account for. Usually he is honest and humble on areas of speculation. I appreciated a lot his pondering of the special consciousness elephants seem to have about death and the meaning of incredible restraint among killer whales in never attacking humans. But I had the most pleasure with his handling of the discovery that wolves and dogs are the same species and theories that wolves domesticated themselves in adapting to cooperation with humans, in the process selecting for genes that promote more social, less aggressive juvenile psychology at maturity (technically termed “neoteny”, though not used by him ). Here’s some of his line of thinking as an example of his accessible discourse:It’s been said that no two species are more alike than wolves and humans. If you watch wolves not just in all their beauty and adaptability but in all their brutality, it’s hard to escape that conclusion. … Living as we do in family packs, fending off the human wolves among us, we can easily recognize in real wolves their social dilemmas and status quests. No wonder Native Americans saw wolves as a sibling spirit.Consider the similarities between male wolves and men. They’re quite striking. Males of very few species directly enhance the survival of females or young year-round. …Helping procure food year-round, bringing food to babies, helping raise young to full maturity over several years, and defending females and offspring against all individuals who threaten their safety is a very rare package to find in a male. Human males and wolf males—that’s about it. And of the two, the more dependably faithful isn’t us. Male wolves more reliably stick with the program, helping raise young and actually helping females survive.Chimpanzees seem much closer to us, but male chimps don’t help feed babies or bring food back to the home site. Wolves and humans can understand each other better. That’s one reason why we invited wolves, instead of chimpanzees , into our lives. Wolves and dogs and us; it’s not surprising that we found one another. We deserve one another. We were made for one another.…A wolf knows who to protect and who to attack and how to defend to the death. That obsession for distinguishing friend from foe is one we share. It’s why we since deep antiquity we have viewed wolves as everything from guards to gods.To watch wild wolves is to recognize a kindred creature by turns riveting, horrifying, and admirable. It’s also to see how many of our dogs’ tendencies and talents were fully formed in the wild, and remain intact in our homes.In dogs, we’ve bred the people we wish we could be: loyal, hardworking, watchful, fiercely protective, intuitive, sensitive, affectionate, helpful to those in need. No matter how they originated, their feelings are real to them. Your dog genuinely loves you, as you, in your domesticated state, activating the deep, old parts of your brain, love your dog.Though Safina does take humans to task for arrogance and blundering in his Biblical dominion over animals, he does find hopefulness in the progress of our self-domestication toward a more pro-social biology. He doesn’t delve into the debate over the cultural versus biological bases of human murder and war. I close with some inspiring thoughts of his about underpinnings of peace in our nature: Aren’t we, by fits and starts, even through the darkness of unspeakable human horrors, always searching for peace, always seeking more perfect ways of taming ourselves? Self-domestication does indeed seem part of the human program. The process of becoming more civil is called civilization.…What is certain: our view of ourselves as post-evolutionary, purely cultural creatures, standing outside selection pressures and in control of our fate is wrong. We tend to think that humans evolved, then stopped evolving and started culture. Far from it. The onset of agriculture and the flowering cultures of civilization were themselves enormous changes in the human environment, massively altering selective pressures. Pressures to maintain a hunter’s size and strength relaxed, while pressure to behave cooperatively, expand social skills, and suppress violent urges intensified. "
1,0805098887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie,4,"Review to come. Do I love it....or do I like it a lot? I do definitely want everyone to read this book. When I think about the book, I automatically say, ""I liked that A LOT"", so four stars. When I chose to read this book I thought I was going to get something like The Genius of Dogs: How Dogs Are Smarter than You Think which I gave four stars, but rather than concentrating solely on dogs the focus would cover many animals. Carl Safina's book is wider in scope and completely different in focus. Hare's book is very good, but Safina's is better, in my view! Hare's book draws conclusions by looking at particular experiments, stipulating how they were carried out and analyzing their results. It is a book about the latest scientific studies on dogs’ cognitive abilities. Some of the conclusions drawn in reference to dog behavior are briefly referred to in Safina's book. Safina's book is less about scientific experiments. Safina's book is based on studies of animals in the wild and the resultant conclusions that can be drawn. At first, statements made had me asking, “Where is your proof?!” By the end I was totally in sync with what the author was stating. There are lengthy sections devoted to the study of elephants, wolves and killer whales, alternately known as orcas (Orcinus orca). They belong to the dolphin family, are toothed and are its largest member. Take one guess what their name implies, yet they do not hurt human beings! I found that revealed about the whales and the elephants utterly fascinating. That about the wolves I found a bit long-winded. We follow the fission of a wolf pack. There are shorter sections on other, widely varied animals (some examples being chimpanzees, bonobos, hyenas, falcons, dogs and bats), the point being to show their emotional and intellectual capacity. We are an animal too and we share a common bond. The author vividly exemplifies how we are similar and how we differ. What is striking are the cognitive and emotional similarities while our outward appearances so differ. The author goes a step further and proposes ideas that are controversial - on self-domestication, anthropomorphism, empathy, intelligence and understanding. It is here the book gets MOST interesting! Great for lively discussions. I like that he steps back and questions where the facts and evidence seem to point while at the same time stressing what remains unknown. After reading this book, one look at animals, even insects, fish and turtles with a new perspective. It is much more difficult to be cruel to a thinking and emotional creature. Authors should NOT read their own books! The author does that here. Yes, I could understand what was said, but often he reads too fast. Way too fast. HE is at home with the ideas presented and to him they are not new. Speaking for myself, I had to stop and consider what exactly self-domestication implies and what are its consequences. There are concepts that must be thought about to fully absorb their significance. There is one section concerning some of the author’s pet peeves, an example being the mirror mark test, also known as the mirror self-recognition test (MSR). He was so very angry he simply couldn’t hold himself back; listening became a difficult task. It was hard to keep up with him! I was also disappointed when different animal calls were spoken. In an audiobook it would have been perfect to let us hear them! The author is a famed conservationist, a marine biologist and has a PhD in ecology from Rutgers University. Reading this book was fascinating due to its depth of information and the wisdom I found in the lines. Here is one quote: If the world can no longer afford the luxury of natural beauty, then it will be overcome by its ugliness. …..In an entirely man-made world there can be no room for man either.He dares to ask uncomfortable questions about human behavior. He shows us the nonsensicality of assumptions we have relied on in the past. He shows us that man must begin to work with nature in a moral and ethical manner"
2,0805098887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1545826-cissa,5,"Humans are human- and we are also animals, with our physical lives on a continuum with other animals.Safina is persuasive enough to convince anyone but the most rigid that ""mere animals"" share much with us, in terms of intelligence, emotions, sense of humor, and individuality- not to mention social groups and ties.I thought it an excellent point that , regarding many of the ""tests"" for animal intelligence, etc.- most humans would not pass them. Dogs are stupid because they can be fooled? What about humans victimized by con artists? And, OK, my cat is not going to write a symphony... but then, neither am I!This book is beautifully written, and brings many of the other denizens of our world alive.Highly recommended, both for people interested in the other animals that share our planet, and for sf authors interested in writing persuasive aliens.I received this book in exchange for writing a fair review, from LibraryThing."
3,0805098887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15865277-linda,5,"I took a long time to read Beyond Words, not because I didn't like it but because I had to let each piece sink in. We learn so much about animal brains but also much about the human brain. The first section will make you fall in love with elephants, so it was hard to read because every time I read the news, more elephants had been slain for their ivory. Just two days ago I read where six elephants were killed with cyanide, CYANIDE!, for their tusks. And orcas are so smart, so loving to their families, especially their children, and grieve hardily when one dies or a baby is kidnapped for amusment park shows. The military is allowed to bomb in the Olympic Coast Marine Sanctuary. Bomb in a sanctuary! Every time it happens dead whales are found with hemorrhages all over their bodies. But this book is also filled with joy. Readers will grow to love the families that are followed here, whales, elephants, and wolves. They do think and they are intelligent. Beyond Words will make you laugh in delight but will also make you shed a few tears."
4,0805098887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44110461-esme,5,"So often when I recommend a non fiction book I like it because it reads like a novel, and not like a textbook. Although textbooks can provide you with a lot of information, often it's difficult to retain because it's just a long list of facts and data and no easy way to have substantial retention. This author goes above and beyond anything I've read from a non fiction book, this not only read like a novel, this read like a poetic work of art. Like, this guy rivals Josiah Bancroft with his use of simile and metaphor, the way he wrote sucked you into the moments he was living. He went to Africa to study with the experts to write this book, and it could not have turned out any better. If you have a love of animals, get this book. If you've ever wondered how unique humans are with their emotions, family relations, problem solving, and intelligence get this book. If you've ever sat and admired Discovery Channel, been at the zoo and stared at the animals wondering what they were thinking or feeling, get this book. If you've studied Ethology (animal behavior) Biology or Zoology and all your life you've been told it goes against science to ""anthropomorphize"" get this book and realize why this is an archaic way of thinking. If you believe in evolution, you'll know that nothing just springs out of no where, nature and biology build on itself. Yes, there are random mutations, but they are random mutation for *pre-existing genetic structure*. A mouse will never randomly mutate and have wings for example., it's not in it's background dna, it's not possible. However, sometimes humans are born with tails, because we do evolve from animals that have tails. So, where did our emotions come from, where did our intelligence come from? It was built off the backbone of evolution, we are not supremely unique in our ability to form bonds with other individuals of the same species. We are not unique in our family ties. We are not unique with our intellegence. We may have capitolized on our large brains in ways other species haven't, but to assume other animals have *none* of those qualities in any way is ludicrous. It was so taboo for the longest time for any animal behaviorist to suggest there were emotions and feelings in other animals it could be a career ending paper to put forth that maybe we aren't alone in this. This book explores what possibilities lie in the brains of other animals, and what evidence we have for intelligence in other species. Elephants are one of my favorite animals of all time, and this book opens with the author in Africa working with one of the leading experts in the field - she's been there for over 40 years and has so much experience it boggles the brain. Reading about the herds and how they are structured was so captivating and endearing I was helpless to stop reading, but I wanted to take it slow and absorb every word. If you've never had any of the above interests, pick this book up anyway and find a new passion in life.http://weatherwaxreport.blog"
5,0805098887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19072481-s-baqer-al-meshqab,4,"Carl Safina, an author, professor and ecologist, presents us with his newest work ""Beyond Words: What Animals Think and Feel (2015)"", shedding some light on the mysteries of animal actions and behaviors within their own societies, and their interactions to the human world as well. The book will take the readers in a journey to the forests, valleys and oceans, where they can literally live among the elephants, wolves, dogs, birds, chimpanzees, bats, dolphins and whales. The author, and so does the evidence, portray these animals not like any other animals, but as individuals. Through a collection of observations by him and his fellow researchers, Safina touches the capability of animals to feel, to sympathize, to grieve, to help and seek help, or even to punish. How elephants feel the loss of a beloved, and even cover the corpse of a family member with dirt and tree branches, how the alpha wolf travels to the coyotes den, mascaraing them because they injured her pride, or how female dolphins play some seduction tricks on males to rescue a trapped friend who is not interested in mating with the hungry males, are some of many examples to the existence of conciseness within animal minds. Safina also highlights astonishing acts of intelligence that may not cross our minds; things we might have thought only us are capable of doing. What is really interesting is that those scientists, when explaining how an animal does something, they refer to them with names; Ella, Treisa, Grace, or even numbers like 06, or 755. These names obtain, through the chain of events of their lives, certain personalities. This is the message the author wants to deliver: there is no ""wolves do this"" and ""elephants do that""; each animal is an individual. Some Show toughness, shyness, or laziness, while others are simply playful and joyful. THEY ARE DIFFERENT. "
6,0805098887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3060391-zawn-v,1,"Dreadful. Contains lines like, ""One time my friend..."" followed by a claim that this one anecdote tells us something about an entire species. Very light on science, heavy on speculation. If this were marketed as a book of observations about animals, it might get a higher rating. But we were promised an explanation of what animals think and feel, not what the author thinks and feels about animals. "
7,0805098887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5712161-gregory-k,2,"I think a person's reaction to this book will probably be based on on the style of writing they prefer. When I read non-fiction I am hoping for a concise and professional approach. That doesn't mean that there can't be some humor and some reflection, so long as it doesn't overpower the purpose of the book. The author of this book though seems overly concerned with trying to embed his personality into the pages. There are constant off-the-wall reflections and comments, numerous one and two word sentences, and long circular reflections. It felt almost as if I was reading a YouTube video. We could remove most of that extra stuff, keep the animal stories and important information, and reduce the book by 50%.That is not to say this was not a good book. For those who prefer a much more conversational approach this book may have even been pleasant to read. And for anyone interested in animal societies and animal ways of being this book is certainly worth the effort it may take to push through it. Otherwise it may be a better idea to watch a PBS Nature special on Netflix."
8,0805098887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7976144-kim-overstreet,4,"Carl Safina prompts readers to consider animal behavior and thought, not by comparing it with human behavior, but by viewing it as unique. He encourages marrying science and logic to draw conclusions about animal thoughts and feelings. For example, we may think it good science to very detachedly document the way a dog bounds and jumps up to greet us when we return home. We can also use logic and apply what we know about this dog and our experiences with feeling to say the dog is happy. Major sections include visits with scientists observing elephants, wolves, and killer whales roaming freely in the wild. Dogs, parrots, ravens, tigers, humans, monkeys, and many other species get brief mentions. Content is mostly anecdotal, relaying Safina's own adventures or those of the long-time observers he visits in the field. Reading this book is like sitting down with a friend or relative (albeit a smart and well-traveled one!) and listening to him philosophize as he recounts experiences in the field with some of the world's leading researchers on the behavior of free roaming animals. Safina is entertaining and is not above using some punny humor, particularly in chapter titles. Some of the experiences are hard to read; nature can be cruel. Others are funny. Most all are fascinating. Generally, I read fiction at a rapid pace and assign myself a set number of daily nonfiction pages, like I would with medication or a homework assignment. Beyond Words was highly readable, and I found myself actually wanting to surpass my mandatory quota. I finished the book in three sittings, though I did find the prose a bit verbose at times. (Maybe I would have finished in two, with a bit more editing!) I would have loved to enclose a few quotations from the text to make my points, but could not since I read an advance reader's edition prior to the book's release date. Recommended for those interested in animal behavior."
9,0805098887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3498889-cheryl,5,"Yes I've read lots on the general subject before. And yes this is a long book. But I'm glad I'm making time for it because: 1. it's almost like four books in one, with elephants, wolves, and killer whales, plus an intermission to explore the validity of concepts like 'theory of mind' & 'mirror neurons' &etc.; 2. each section has anecdotes + science + pleas to our humanity; 3. it's beautifully written, with a style or 'voice' I've not noticed in other books, and 4. it's newer than almost anything else I've read and therefore gives me new understandings and new shocks at what ppl are *still* doing to harm animals and ecosystems (and, of course, ultimately, ourselves).I'm ranking it with my other two very favorite books (for laypeople) on the (broad) subject, Some We Love, Some We Hate, Some We Eat: Why It's So Hard to Think Straight About Animals and Are We Smart Enough to Know How Smart Animals Are?. I have given other related titles five stars & recommendations, but if you read these three you'll gain the most understanding & satisfaction, imo.One thing I do disagree with the author about. I'm not looking for something that distinguishes humans from other animals because I feel that we're somehow 'transcendent' and I want science to back up my faith in that. No, I want to know what about us made us screw up so badly. An easy interpretation of the data could be that patriarchy is more aggressive, rapacious, and short-sighted than matriarchy, so that could be part of our problem. Written language might also have something to do with it, I'm afraid....Heartbreaking book. Dense with concepts and information. A read to be savored. Let it make an impact on you.""I'm not suggesting that humans and elephants have all the same emotions. Self-loathing seems uniquely human.""""I've seen an orangutan string and wear a bead necklace that no one taught her to make.""Bonobo is pronounced buh-NO-bo.

No, they have learned that carcasses get poisoned in their absence.Wolves are again fair game in Wyoming. No license, no limit, no season.""By moving out of nature and onto farms, we became in a very real sense just another farm animal."" Regarding the experiments about whether an animal can recognize itself in a mirror... deeply flawed... ""When a bird, say, attacks the mirror, it does so precisely because it believes the reflection is another individual--not itself.... It demonstrates self-concept. It doesn't 'fail' the mirror test.... It just doesn't understand reflection.""A better definition of species is offered here. ""When free-living animals freely interbreed, they're the same species."" According to that definition, there may be about a dozen species of killer whales.Peter Tyack reminds us, ""'There are hundreds of tests for human intelligence alone, but we still have trouble even defining human intelligence.'"" ""Who was more 'intelligent,' Pablo Picasso or Henry Ford?""And now I get to look through the bibliography. Some books will appeal, even though I know that I shouldn't even bother with older books because so much of what we thought we knew is wrong, and so much new stuff is being learned. But I'll look anyway. And I'll continue to work towards a more vegan diet, and I'll continue to vote for leaders who vote green, and I'll continue to try to get everyone I know off bottled water and disposable tissues & napkins. (Etc.)"
10,0805098887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9113276-patricia,5,"This book was mindblowing in analyzing the communication, empathy, playfulness, grieving, hierarchy, and interaction of elephants, wolves, lions, dogs, crows, parrots, bower birds, killer whales and dolphins with one another and people. Safina explored the growing pressure on African elephants for their tusks and the difficulty of changing the culture of the Maasai tribes and the economic rewards they receive from poaching. The elephants have learned to fear the scent of a Maasai. The stories and insights on elephant communication, feelings, grief, memories and love were endearing. The elephants are nearing extinction. Asia has to stop their lust for ivory. When I read a Chinese woman thought ivory was picked up off the ground I nearly screamed!Safina explored the near extinction of wolves in the U.S. They were brought back to Yellowstone National Park to control the elk population. The wolves brought increased tourism and economic gain for the Park and state of Montana. Yet a few farmers complaints brought open season hunting and poaching back and a few more sport hunters thought they had more elk to shoot in the fall. The most mindblowing of all the stories and research on animals was the killer whale and dolphins. Unbelievable how they have saved countless lives of people and dogs. Our capturing and holding them in captivity in zoos and marine parks is atrocious. Like elephants, they need to live with their families. Japan needs to stop overfishing and the U.S. and Canadian Navy must stop underwater bombing and sonar. Humans, as a species, are destroying the planet and the animal kingdom.

11,0805098887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1655437-ac,5,"Safina, who has a degree from Rutgers in Ecology, and is a MacArthur winner, has written a beautiful and deeply moving book about the natural lives of animals, focusing on the profound intelligence and inner life of elephants, wolves, whales, birds, and with asides on insects and lower orders -- in an attempt to show how all of us -- man and beast...even plant -- is simply part of an integral space, of animate life on earth, stressing the horrible loss of beauty and understanding that man's genocide of natural habitats is producing in our time. I (knowing very little about animal behavioral psychology) found this book to be accessible, utterly eye-opening, and persuasive.Safina argues that animals -- even down to the lowest levels -- are ""whos"", and not ""its""; that they have personality, subjectivity, consciousness of both themselves and others, empathy, emotion, deep stores of love, jealously creativity, curiosity, immense intelligence, communication skills, and..., indeed, to allow a pun, immense humanity. Far more that we. That animals are not simply some step in a teleological ladder, whose pinnacle is man, but that each is an end it itself, living a meaningful and aware life, with talents and skills appropriate to what it is. An elephant or whale or bird can be mediocre or brilliant AS WHAT IT IS..., as what it is to be an elephant or whale or bird..., and cannot be measured by what a man can do. A man, after all, could not survive a lifetime in an ocean -- or in flight.Safina does not have a degree in animal behavior or in neurosciences, and so is writing anecdotally and as a long-time, albeit intelligent observer, but not as an academic expert in his subject. He deplores the still current popularity of Behaviorism.The book is mared by jokes and asides, some snark, and wearing his environmentalism on his sleeve -- and it is written for the non-specialist. Hence, one may deduct a star or more if one likes.But for the layman like myself, it was a marvelous introduction to an astoundingly profound moving problem: what do animals think and feel, and how do we know."
12,0805098887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8783847-ginger-bensman,5,"What Animals Think and Feel by Carl Safina is a book brimming with amazing research and stories about the lives, abilities, the complex behaviors, and cultures of some of earth’s most fascinating animals (notably—elephants, wolves, dogs, and cetaceans, though remarkable references to turtles and birds and others are here too). Safina is a gifted, even lyrical, writer, and he approaches the discussion about each of these marvelous creatures with respect, awe, and much humility. Of course, in the process of exploring the lives, and worlds, and context, of these beings who inhabit the earth along with us, the book says as much or more about us as human animals. One can only conclude that as a species, humans are the most oblivious, egotistical, small-minded, selfish, destructive, and often cruel creatures on God’s green earth. (When will we learn that not everything is because of us, or for us, or about us?) Thankfully, there are those animal scientists, individual women and men, who are capable of seeing beyond the blinders of human exceptionalism, who are able to appreciate the life, and grace, and wonder around us. Will those few be enough to save life on earth? I’d like to believe it’s possible."
13,0805098887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10172812-cass,3,"Actual Rating: 3.5/5 StarsAs an animal person myself, this was greatly enjoyable. It was amazing to see how animals that we consider ""wild"" and ""untamed"" are so much more than that. Humans love to consider themselves special and the most intelligent species in this planet, but what if we're measuring intelligence of other species using the wrong scale? That was one of the authors arguments that I found extremely compelling, as well as the argument that why does the scientific world deprive itself from applying human characteristics to animals, such as jealousy or being able to plan ahead of time.The writing was very conversational and I think that worked really well with this book since the topic is one that can cause great debate if read with someone else or in a book club. It also made the reading much easier. I'm not keen on non-fiction, so the style of writing extremely helped me from dropping the book. So if you're someone that wants to get into non-fiction, and have no idea where to start, I would recommend this book. Because who doesn't like animals?Now the issues I had were mainly the research the author used and how he presented it. At its core this book is argumentative, and like any good argument you're supposed to have done enough research on the pros and cons of both sides. However, he only presented to us research that proved his point and then deconstructed the opposing researching by showing how ""ridiculous"" it sounded, to him at least. As someone that does and studies research, I was greatly appalled by his disregard of some of it without even taking a glance at the actual study published. Furthermore, his demeaning tone for some psychological concepts and how little he knew about them while speaking like he had studied them his whole life was just not profesional in my opinion. One time to define a concept he used the Wikipedia page. Wikipedia. Unbelievable. Overall, I still enjoyed it. I mainly like the second half of the book, while the first half with the elephants was quite slow and boring. It's a solid 3.5 stars for me."
14,0805098887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/901028-jeff-bursey,4,"Clearly written, with some humour and skepticism, passion and evidence, arguments and anecdotes, revolving around how certain animals are ""who"" creatures (wolves, elephants, killer whales and dolphins generally, etc.) by someone who has spent his life studying animals in their habitat. The numerous examples of animals exhibiting what we might (mistakenly, according to Safina) call human characteristics are plentiful and varied, and they are also interrogated. Well worth reading."
15,0805098887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53960270-joan,5,"“Why do human egos seem so threatened by the thought that other animals think and feel? Is it because acknowledging the mind of another makes it harder to abuse them?”Wow, what can I say? This book is absolutely amazing. It’s actually *beyond words* haha. I wish everyone in the world would read it!!!!"
16,0805098887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1799995-john-yunker,4,"In Beyond Words: What Animals Think and Feel, Carl Safina sets out on a global journey to listen to and understand animals on their terms and not ours. By the end of this book, I can guarantee that readers will come away with a greater appreciation for the self-awareness, intelligence, and empathy of the animals we share this planet with.The bulk of the book is devoted to studying African elephants, North American wolves, and Pacific Northwest orcas (killer whales). Safina does an excellent job of describing what he sees and learns as he travels with naturalists who have dedicated their lives to understanding these species.We watch elephants caring for their young, playing, and mourning (something that happens all too often due to poachers). The elephants are named, and researchers can identify them them by sight — and we get a sense of the life histories of many of these elephants, histories that are no less complex and challenging than any human animal. We follow wolf watchers in Yellowstone, and while the wolves may be given numbers and not names, we learn their life histories in similar detail — histories that sadly include equally tragic encounters with humans.I was struck by the similarities of risks both wolves and elephants face when they venture beyond human-drawn boundaries. In Africa, so long as elephants stay within national parks, they enjoy a greater degree of security; when they wander out of the parks, they run a gantlet of dangers. So too do the wolves who step outside the boundaries of Yellowstone. Hunters have gone so far as to use radio devices to track the electronic collars placed on wolves by researchers to know when wolves have crossed outside park boundaries (you can read Beckie Elgin’s many reviews of wolf literature to grasp the full scope of the war being waged on wolves).And then we meet the orcas in the waters surrounding the San Juan Islands. While I was aware that orcas have widely divergent diets — the residents of the San Juan Islands prefer salmon, while the transients who pass through prefer seals — I did not know that are eight distinct species of orca around the world, which scientists have not yet made official. We know so little yet about these animals. We do know that there is no documented case of an orca in the wild killing a human (only examples of orcas in captivity doing so). Orcas are members of the dolphin family, and the stories of kindness that this family have exhibited towards humans over the years are remarkable — leading lost swimmers and boaters to safety, protecting humans from sharks, rescuing a drowning woman. One may argue that these actions are merely instinctual, but as the evidence mounts I’m not sure that argument holds any weight.Safina does not limit himself to a few species of animal. He digresses into stories about dogs, bonobos, ravens, tortoises, even worms. Stories that illustrate again and again that the animal world is far more intelligent and communicative that we have been led to believe (and perhaps want to believe). Darwin made the case long ago for the intelligence of non-human animals.Safina does not hesitate to take scientists to task for the great efforts they have exerted to avoid the scientific “third rail” of anthropomorphism. Safina points out that scientists often try to apply measures of intelligence that simply don’t make sense. The “mirror test” is one such measurement. (I’d like to think my cat has self awareness, even though he has yet to show any signs of recognizing himself in a mirror.)As an aside, a hundred years ago scientists argued that vivisection on live animals was perfectly reasonable because animals were “machine-like” and felt no pain. I know we’ve come a long way since then, but we still have a long ways to go.Safina writes that just because an animal can’t talk doesn’t mean it can’t communicate. And if we judge animals by the standards we set, we miss the point. Animals don’t need to measure up to our standards of intelligence — only their standards.This is an important book and one that raises tough questions about not only how society views animals but how we treat animals — all animals. I would have liked to see Safina include a “what you can do” chapter to the book with actions we all can take. It’s hard to walk away from this book and not wonder why we still eat animals. Safina does not draw this connection — and I’m clearly biased in this regard — but this is really the only conclusion we can draw. Animals evolve. Humans evolve. It’s time humans evolve to a more equitable and respectful relationship with all animals. They’ve suffered us long enough.I’ll leave you with this quote:If cruelty and destructiveness are bad, humans are by a wide margin the worst species ever to infest this planet. If compassion and creativity are good, humans are by a wide margin the finest. But we are neither simply good nor bad; we are all these things together, and imperfectly so. The question for all is: Which way is our balance trending?(Review first appeared on EcoLit Books: www.ecolitbooks.com)"
17,0805098887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90410747-ida,5,"At first I was surprised that so much of ""Beyond Words"" was just watching family lives of animals (considering the subtitle ""What Animals Think and Feel""), but in the course of reading I realised it was a perfect way to show that elephants, wolves and orcas live ""full"", socially complex lives, not that dissimilar from human lives (not to dismiss animals whose lives are much different). It also made for a compelling read: it feels really good to immerse yourself in the life of another species. Overall this book offers great insight based not only on observation and established science, but also on empathy and imagination, and I think that's what we need right now. "
18,0805098887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,4,"Another nail in the ""just so story"" that humans are special. Safina challenges the old school animal behaviorists who suggest that animals are incapable of thinking or feeling in any meaningful way. Unlike other animal activists researchers who go off the deep end, Safina's arguments, while some times anecdotal, are balanced and well thought out. In one particularly good section of the book, Safina recounted his days at university, sitting in the classroom listening to lectures on the evils of anthropomorphizing animal's actions. I too have sat in lectures along with myriad undergrads and grads who heard largely the same thing Safina did. It is bored into our brains that since we cannot speak the same language, we cannot ask animals what they think and feel, and thus it a sacrilege to anthropomorphize their actions. After all, we can only observe actions, not thoughts or feelings. We must take caution in our interpretation of these actions. Safina agrees with this but suggests that in fact the professors themselves have made assumptions. Safina claims it is just as wrong to assume they do not have emotions and feelings similar to humans. If we can only measure behaviors, then Safina cautions, just stop there. No need to come to unfounded conclusions that since humans can't observe a feeling or thought, that it does not exist. Great argument. He goes onto make some assumptions of his own. However, his arguments are largely based on a wonderfully balanced look at the shared neuroanatomy, neurochemicals, neurocircuitry, and so on, between animals and humans. He tries to understand if there might be feelings, to a lesser a degree, present in all animals, and even plants (to an even lesser degree) who share similar anatomy, chemicals, and so on. He wants to understand how all of the senses originated and how they diverged once they emerged. These are great questions. Despite some anecdotal findings, Safina never enters the realm of sloppy science seen in cases involving Koko the gorilla. Trainers speak for Koko and want the world to believe that their mashup of their own interpretation + Koko's actions = fully sentient being (philosopher even!). This kind of ""science"" is tantamount to the ""science"" of facilitated communication that ""helps"" autistic individuals speak to the world. When the facilitators are able to let the public know what the person with autism has been thinking all this time, it is shocking, much like how shocking as it was to find out a guy who was in a coma for 12 years was aware of everything, even his mother wishing (for his sake) he would just die. However, it turned out that in the case of the autistic individual, we really don't know what they are thinking or are not thinking. When given a simple test, one which they can easily pass with the facilitator present, they fail when a different facilitator is present. In the end, it amounts to a ouija board. The facilitators really believe they are receiving signals from the hands on the keyboard, just as teen girls at a slumber party feel they are getting a signal from the hands on a ouija board. Koko's trainers engage in much the same kind of facilitated communication. Safina doesn't do this as much.Also enjoyable in this book, Safina has a very self-reflective writing style. His whole goal is to try to understand if animals can think and feel like humans do. Yet, he constantly questions the validity of this quest. Such a great quality in a researcher/author/lecturer. "
19,0805098887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3163612-anna,5,"Just wonderful. Safina really delves deep into the 'who' of animals; there are so many animal anecdotes here that are just jaw-dropping (my favourite one involved a tiger stalking his human enemy for months; I'm also very unlikely to ever kill another wasp because SOME OF THEM CAN RECOGNISE YOUR FACE :|). Although he might be taking things a little bit too far sometimes (for example when arguing that wolves' fear of humans could be the outcome of a cost-benefit calculation and not say, an evolutionary repulsion to our smell) his main point is fair and important: that it's just as scientifically wrong to anthropomorphise animals as it is to do the opposite (objectify?).Safina definitely has a huge beef with animal scientists who seek the 'theory of mind' in animals, then proceed to hail it as proof of their lack of sentience when the animals invariably fail their terribly designed experiments. He spends several incisive (and highly amusing) chapters on discrediting their efforts. It makes for an entertaining read but I felt like he never really gets to the definition of the ToM that actually matters -- of it being the opposite of solipsism, so: not just of recognising that others have minds, but acknowledging that those minds have the capacity to feel that is similar to one's own (this surely takes years to develop even in humans, if it develops at all). These are all minor (and possibly entirely my own) issues in a deeply satisfying whole.A word of warning though: this book will leave you in a world of sadness. The author is a conservationist and conservationists, like climatologists, don't have much to be optimistic about. Large parts of the book are heart-breakingly sad and a proof that humanity truly is the cartoonish villain of the natural world. Though the book ends on a positive note, it's a very brief and forced-sounding positive note that is the opposite of reassuring. "
20,0805098887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92397-brittany,5,"Mind-blowing, breath-taking, stunning, amazing, outstanding, extraordinary. I'm running out of words to describe this book, and the way I feel about it. Safina is passionate, thought-provoking, persuasive, and compelling. His discussions of anthropomorphism and the evolution of the fields of behavior and the study of animal intelligence and emotions is unparalleled. This is one of those books, like Silent Spring or A Sand County Almanac and Sketches Here and There, that marks a turning point for the philosophy of science and the public attitude towards an entire field. On top of that, it's also smoothly readable and one of those books packed with such engaging anecdotes and such amazing facts that you become a font of information to all those around you. (Kind of whether they wanted you to or not.) Safina specifically focuses on dolphins, wolves, and elephants, and each section, on its own, would earn a five-star rating from me. Together, they make one of the most astonishing books I've ever read. "
21,0805098887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23695672-mimi,5,"This is quite a thought provoking book. Carl Safina studied primarily three animal groups, elephants, wolves and whales. All of these animal groups have been found to have complex social groups and communication skills. After reading that and then to read how humans have brought such misery and chaos into their lives is indeed horrifying. For instance, elephants have a matriarchal society led by older females. When these elephants are killed for their tusks, it throws the whole family into stress and despair. For instance, the older elephants know where there is water and where to go to find additional food sources in lean times. When these older elephants are gone, the younger elephants then are also put in danger of losing their lives. Reading about humans kidnapping baby elephants and whales to put them in circuses or other types of shows, is just so sad. The mothers mourn the loss of their babies just like humans do by crying, refusing to eat and generally showing despair. I personally have always thought that animals all have their own personalities and complex lives so this is not news to me. Hopefully, all humans will begin to know this and treat animals with the respect they deserve."
22,0805098887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4177031-troy-blackford,5,"A surprisingly moving and poetic exploration on the topic of individuality in animals. The author is a Doctor of Ecology, and co-chairs the Alan Alda Center for Communicating Science, and I can certainly see why Mr. Alda (who is one of the best ambassadors of science alive today) chose Dr. Safina for that role. The book teems with facts presented through narrative accounts of the author's journeys through the savanna, the ocean, and the forest as he encounters people working closely with elephants, whales, wolves, and a diverse cast of other creatures, all in an effort to understand how these beings perceive their world and themselves. I was caught off-guard by the poignancy of this book. At times, the attempted poetry in the prose doesn't always come off, but it is only through taking the number of chances that Dr. Safina does that he succeeds as often as he has in this book. A deeply important topic, handled with expert care by a knowledgeable guide. Though I have read a number of more scholarly books on this topic, none have left me feeling as profoundly moved and enlightened as this one. Highly recommended."
23,0805098887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31047238-sarah,4,"I love this. The author makes it extremely clear that we, as humanity, need to stop evaluating animals in terms of how similar they are to us, whether they have the exact same emotional abilities as us and whether they have the have the exact same stream of awareness as us because they are who they are - and that's more than enough! Humans are not the golden standard to which any kind of important being needs to be compared to - despite how special we think we are. Who an animal is, is just as important as who your next door neighbor is. In many ways their individual capacity and understanding is beyond anything we hope to attain. I love this and understand that using many first hand accounts of encounters with animals (retold by experts in the field) was to personalise the experience and go past 'hard science' which is often unfair to animals emotion and intelligence but I can see certain people discarding this book for that reason."
24,0805098887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30662508-melissa,2,"I was actually disappointed by the book, I thought with the book being as thick as it was the it would be information dense, however from what I read I really did not learn anything new, or see a different side of a topic. The section on wolves was what I found the most interesting, for some reason the first section on elephants just did not do it for me. I am not an expert on the topic whatsover and maybe the author chose the animals that he did because those are ones that we identify with more readily, and there is already a bunch of information out there, perhaps if he had chosen lesser known animals I would have found this more interesting. Therefore I would say if you are already familiar with elephants, wolves, dogs and such and studies like this don't read this book. "
25,0805098887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21880263-meredith-duran,5,"This book!!!! I gave it to three different people for the holidays. It has been a very long time since a book a) moved me to tears, b) kept me riveted to the page, AND c) forced me to cast it down so I could pace in agitation while pondering the implications of the paragraph I'd just read...all within the space of an hour. In short, while reading this book, I probably looked like I'd lost my mind. :) Anyway, if I could afford to gift a copy to every person on the planet, I would -- and I've no doubt the world would be a better place for it, too."
26,0805098887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14939057-miriam-jacobs,4,"Safina makes a thoroughly convincing argument. Less brainy than de Waal, less reflective than Lopez, both of whom write in a similar vein, I feel a little distressed that Safina often sacrifices grammar to achieve his chatty tone, a tone I find ever so slightly suspect. Am I being patronized? But still a fine and worthwhile read - worth hanging on to if not quite a classic."
27,0805098887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33008718-jammin-jenny,3,"I really liked this non-fiction story about how animals have emotions and how those emotions and thought processes are innate to their particular nature. I loved the story of Wolf 21 in Yellowstone National Park, and how he created a huge pack of wolves based on his personality and leadership. Great read for nature lovers, especially those that like non-fiction reads."
28,0805098887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/179111-zach,5,"As close as any text could ever come to making me a vegetarian. The section on elephants is the best nature writing I've ever read. For an animal kingdom illiterate like me, a profound read."
29,0805098887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17604577-elizabeth-eiler,5,"This book is a splendid ambassador for the Earth’s myriad non-human inhabitants, living for their own sometimes mysterious reasons, to be valued according to their own measures and granted rights to their lives, loves, and dreams – just like us. Highlighting the many ways that animals can only be rightly seen as “like” themselves – whilst acknowledging and celebrating the biological heritage that furnishes many of our commonalities with other species – is part of the brilliance of Beyond Words.The author ruminates and reports about his fieldwork observing elephants, wolves, cetaceans, and other creatures with a literacy and social conscience that propel the reader into an educated admiration and appreciation for these wonderful beings. His recounting of the plight of African elephants being slaughtered to extinction for the revolting ivory trade, or Yellowstone wolves being delisted as an endangered species and laid bare to hunters engenders pain and outrage. One may hope that at least some of his readers will be spurred to stand for change, acting as part of a growing counterpoint to human-centric barbarism.Carl Safina, with a PhD in ecology, is a scientist who has a healthy disagreement with many Western scientific theories and paradigms in so far as they attempt to judge the Animal Kingdom by ridiculous standards which humanity itself cannot meet. His presentation of biology is fascinating, but I found regrettable his exclusive attribution of every emotional reaction or “finer” tendency to hormone secretions, groups of neurons, and the evolutionary process of domestication.Safina treats philosophy, spirituality, and religion with a combination of indulgent pity, incredulous humor, and open dislike. Dismissed out of hand are spirits, gods, Angels, the afterlife, or an immortal soul as mere hormonally-induced delusions, irrational wishful thinking, or the adult equivalent of talking to an imaginary friend. As a metaphysician, this view obviously runs counter to my worldview – as does his assertion that philosophers rarely if ever possess any “facts” or have real-world experience of their subject matter.The insight into the complex political lives of chimpanzees, multi-layered societies of cetaceans, and hard-won alliances and family dramas of wolves is fascinating. The author refers to studies that demonstrate the intellect, teaching, and language of birds, bees, ants, and fish. The wonderful brains and other biological machinery of culture wielded by the Animal Kingdom (including humans) are explored in a detailed and fully accessible manner for non-scientists. Regrettably, spiritual dimensions to human and non-human animals are viewed as a silly fantasy. Philosophy, theism, karma, soul, telepathy, reincarnation, afterlife, deity – total bunk in the author’s view. The refusal to accept even the possibility of a metaphysical or spiritual dimension to life leaves a hollow emptiness echoing through the core of this book which is only partly ameliorated by the writer’s genuine emotion and moral concern for animals and the Earth. All in all, this was a well-crafted, artfully written, highly interesting, and educational book which I recommend to everyone interested in learning more about the non-human beings who so industriously populate our world. The biology of being is presented in beautiful, literate, and respectful prose. It’s a marvelous reference guide illustrating our most insightful glimpse yet (although we’ve barely scratched the surface) into how other animals live, love, work, communicate, reason, and preserve history. Quotes: “If you look at side-by-side drawings of humans, elephants, and dolphin brains, the similarities overwhelm the differences. We are essentially the same, molded by long experience into different outer shapes for coping with different outer surroundings, and wired inside for special talents and abilities. But beneath the skin, kin.” (Carl Safina, Beyond Words: What Animals Think and Feel, p. 324)“For a while, everywhere in the near and medium distance, black fins continue urgently scribbling their stories on the slate of the sea. I read them as intently as I can, knowing that the sea will soon erase what they have written, and that we don’t have a backup on file.” (Carl Safina, Beyond Words: What Animals Think and Feel, p. 409)

30,0805098887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/934662-wendy-feltham,5,"This is an important book about the emotions and intelligence of animals, and why it is so essential to protect habitat so the world's most precious animals can survive. Beyond Words is divided into four parts. The first, and my favorite, is about the elephants of Amboseli National Park in Kenya. The wisdom of the herd's matriarch, the joy of the babies' play, and the empathy of each individual is described by researchers who have observed these elephants for years. One of the staff can recognize 900 individual elephants by sight, and knows the diverse personalities of many. The second section is about the wolves of Yellowstone, and their remarkable social structures, again as told by researchers who have witnessed amazing feats. The third part is a compilation of theories and observations about various animals, including birds, apes, hyenas, squirrels (who like being tickled), and others. The final section describes the complex lives of killer whales in the Salish Sea, in my part of the world, as described by researcher Ken Balcomb. Carl Safina builds his readers' understanding of the beauty and complexity of the societies of elephants, wolves and killer whales, and then provides the devastating truth about the effects of their shrinking habitat-- the poachers who killed 10,000 African elephants in ten years, the sport hunters who killed even the wolves with research collars, and the U.S. Navy who use sonar in our Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary that has killed killer whales. I do think Beyond Words would have benefited from heavier editing, especially eliminating so many stories about the author's own dogs (I'm a cat person, and there is no mention of cats). But overall I deeply appreciate the new awareness of animals' emotions I got from this book, both for my own pet cats who have completely different personalities and emotional needs, and wild animals I encounter here on the Olympic Peninsula. And I reflect back on animals I have met and observed here and in different parts of the world, and having read this book, wish I could see them again."
31,0805098887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75157-carol,5,"Wonderful! Vindication for all animal lovers who have known that creatures think and feel emotion. Moving, educational and surprising. To learn that animals have complex societies, friendships, plan strategies, use tools and learn expands on what I have always known to be true. Fabulous!This book is at once profoundly moving and painful to read. The scientific evidence that there are beings in our world with emotional lives as deep and urgent as our own is now impossible to ignore. The visible and tangible evidence that this is true has always been there; many of us, in our denatured state, just haven't wanted or been able to take it in. The author provides a high-level tour of what we've learned in recent decades about animal cognition, social structure, and culture (focusing in the main on elephants, wolves and orcas). (Dolphins have names. So do many parrots. Just think about that.) That we share so much with these creatures, and that they exist in potential, and sometimes, actual communion with us is humbling. What we, as a species, have done to these beautiful beings is too painful to contemplate at length.Those of us who own pets, KNOW they think and feel emotion. We see it every day. It seems the scientists are just now catching up with us!!"

Sorrow for the confined environment longing for the lost familiar habitat? I might have imagined all the emotions of the elephant, but I bet the author of this book, Carl Safina, would agree with my understanding. I enjoyed listening to this book, narrated by the author himself, about animals that we are lucky to get to know a little, the African elephants, the Yellowstone wolves, the killer whales, and many other animals, large or small. We humans often think we are special, we are intelligent, and we should rule the world. And we are all of these, but we have also been cruel, been stupid, and been a terrible ruler for the planet and all the living beings on it. I wish we could be less assertive of our various privileges, and more willing to coexist with the many magnificent and marvelous beings who have equal rights to prosper alongside us. This might well be a pipe dream, but read this book, it is packed with interesting facts, well-researched studies, and heartwarming or wrenching stories of real animals, who also belonged to families and had loved ones. "
33,0805098887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61286801-ashes,2,"Over 500 pages of anecdotal ramblings and recycled content. Even if some observations are interesting in themselves, Safina just has to include his own interpretation of them, arguing for ridiculous or obvious things. I won't even go into details; the number of eyerolls and facepalms I experienced throughout the book is dreadful.Worst of all, he keeps comparing every living thing to his dogs. At least once every few pages. Good grief. I like dogs, I do, but if I never have to read another mention of Safina's dogs again it'll be too soon.The chapter on elephants is somewhat boring, but digestible. The chapters on wolves and killer whales are decent, but, sadly, not free of these rambling and sometimes ridiculous interpretations. The third chapter... I can't even tell what's it about; just random stuff, I assume.Very repetitive, often contradictory, and not well written. Safina should just stick to the facts & observations, and this would make the book so much more readable and shorter.Do yourself a favor and read something else, with actual scientific content."

I love his willingness to throw science at a problem science has actively avoided for way too long. And I love the way he tells a story. This one, in three loose parts- the elephants, the wolves, and the whales, brought my heart into my throat a number of times. Humanity's monumental hubris is a theme of which I never tire. That the lives of animals are as rich and important as our own has always struck me as far more sensible a belief than the other way 'round. There was much to confirm my bias here.But always, always with Safina, it comes down to the way he wields the words. "

From killing wolves for sport to gunning down elephants for ivory, humans upset the balance of nature in innumerable ways beyond just destroying family structures. And then there are the whales.

This book focuses on elephants, wolves, killer whales or orcas, and other animals. I am a vegan so I readily accept that animals are sentient beings who should not be harmed by humans. But this book offers evidence about the well structured family life and the individual personality of these animals and others. I was unaware of the effect of naval and commercial sonar and bomb testing as well as overfishing in damaging or destroying ocean habitats of fish and cetaceans. It seems to me that at 7 billion the human population is too large. I argue for two generations of severe birth control with the goal of reducing the human population to less than one billion by the year 2100."

I kept waiting for the science to arrive, instead I was inundated with story after story of animal watching. After reaching this gem on page 204:‘Some animals are into music. My friend Darrel says that his tortoise “loves Mexican music” and starts running around when he hears it.’I knew there was no hope and more or less skimmed through the rest. Towards the end it didn’t surprise me to find an entire chapter devoted to recounting Youtube clips of animals. Save yourself a lot of time and watch some nature documentaries. Good grief, Safina may be an animal lover, but a writer or a scientist he is not."

Those questions and many others are pondered and answered in Carl Safina’s book “What Animals Think and Feel”. Safina, who hosts PBS’s “Saving the Ocean”, spent time studying elephants in Kenya’s Amboseli National Park and killer whales in the Pacific Northwest. The book is filled with stories of animals experiencing human emotions such as joy, grief, jealousy anger and love. It is a fascinating read. Highly recommended. I spoke with Carl Safina and that conversation can be heard here: http://dougmilesmedia.com/?p=1599"
39,0805098887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2143803-carl,5,"It's a fairly recent book and contains a lot of up to date research in a very readable style. It mostly presents current behavioral knowledge about elephants, wolves, orcas and dolphins. I'm not a vegetarian btw, my interest derives from a long-archived major in Marine Biology. It's so well written and up to date, I'd recommend it to anyone. Tremendously interesting read."

45,0805098887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5933158-wendy,4,"I would have given this 3.5 stars, but decided to give more instead of less because the book is really beautifully written. I came away from this book with an incredible sense of sadness. I have long known that humanity is destroying not only itself but every other living being and thing - we are a storm of destruction. This book confirms that. Safina takes us on a journey to meet individuals of other species, and for me, it is an emotional journey learning about the plight of elephants, of wolves, and of killer whales. He intersperses the stories of individuals with facts about species, their peril, and with studies of animal behavior (of many different types of animals) to perhaps encourage readers, humans, to take seriously who we are destroying.Although he makes some comments here and there - particularly and rightly about hunters -- it is hard to understand why he doesn't take more of a political stance against, say, fishing of any kind which is killing millions of fish (how are there still millions left?!) and destroying the food source for certain pods of killer whales. He could take the animal ag industry to task for the hunting of wolves, but barely addresses the perils of ranching, nor does he mention much about trophy hunting as opposed to poaching. Nor does he mention the circus and zoo industries which have caused problems for elephants. This I find problematic because it is difficult to come to know individual animals (which we do through his writing) and the species they represent and to not understand how we can help save who's left. There is a little blurb in the back of the book - if you feel compelled, donate money here -- which is okay and every bit helps, but the problems are larger than throwing money at an organization (ie, don't eat fish! that would be a great place to start helping killer whales). But other than that, this is a book about devastating issues without much solution, and it is hard to come away from it feeling hopeful rather than hopeless.Further, Safina offers evidence of animal cognition based on study after study without admitting that laboratories are such false places to actually study someone, and that such captivity and studies counteract part of the point he is making in his book: that animals think and feel, and by extension, should not be harmed gratuitously, and I would argue that animal behavior studies anywhere but in natural habiats are gratuitous and cruel. He makes several comments about fish cognition, but does not quite make it to ""so we should not eat them."" Safina himself has clealry drawn a line about what is accepatble cruelty and exploitation (eating animals) and what is not (not killing big, smart, wild animals) without linking the fact that the fate of one is essentially the fate of all, and that species is irrelevant. If we can see that fishes, wolves, elephants, killer whales, baboons, and certain birds exhibit consciousness, why do we contiually need scientific ""proof"" that each species does? and anyway, this proof is not helping a whole lot in saving these animals. So the title is a bit misleading as well. Of course we can't know what *any*one thinks or feels, but we can guess. Safina does agood job of showing personality -- not just instinct -- is at work within all three species he covers - especially the silliness of elephants playing. I find the writing beautiful for the most part, evocative, a little humorous at times, and find that this book, despite its flaws, deepens my understanding of other animals and drives home the real, terrible crisis our planet is in. I would recommend it."
46,0805098887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61819330-jakub-opr-al,5,"Carl Safina wrote a magnificent book indeed. In Beyond words, he watches and truly listens, what animals are doing and after that he considers and evaluates their behavior. Beautifully written, one of the best that I have ever read. Safina learns how to observe these animals with the best people you could learn from. I mean, be a companion of Cynthia Moss, Rick McIntyre and others just for a while? That must be a dream. As you can read in Psychology Today review, it is really an excellent summary of recent research. Genuinely amazing insight into what animals do and how they probably feel. Yes, I wrote “probably”. As Safina points out, do not believe everything scientists say about animal world. If there is one thing you should take of all this, do not judge animal behavior based only on superficial observations. It is much deeper than you would think. Worth the attention are also scientifically grounded sections of the book. For example, NY Times share quote about an example of the chemical and neurological bases of emotions: “Oxytocin drives bonding,” Safina reminds readers, “and it makes elephants and many other species act social or sexual. Block the hormone; many mammals and birds lose interest in socializing, pairing, nesting and contact.” And you could find plenty more scientific evidence.The book offers deeper understanding of our (human) place on this planet. Do you agree, that all life is one as Safina says in the end? It is up to you, but this book brings some good stuff for the support of this statement. And once again, it is beatifully written!""Can we ever get over how strangely wonderful, how wonderfully beatiful? … The trunk is an elephant’s Swiss Army knife. Rounded on the outer edge, flattened on the inner, a great mine-sweeping, water hosing, mud-flinging, dust-deviling, air-testing, food-gathering, friend-greeting, infant rescuing, baby-reassuring caterpillar of a nose."""
47,0805098887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6857911-ryan,4,"The message of this book: biologists, for purposes of scientific rigor, are supposed to treat animals' thoughts, emotions, and mental states as black boxes, but when you actually spend time with animals, it's impossible *not* to understand them as thinking, feeling beings who live rich, complex lives. This book focuses primarily on elephants, wolves, and orca whales, but includes plenty of anecdotes about other species. As it turns out (though not surprisingly when you think about it), social animals have much more of a theory of mind -- the ability to observe others and relate to what they're thinking -- than we usually give them credit for. Some random takeaways:* Dogs stay in a sort of arrested puppyhood, treating their human masters as ""alphas"". Wolves show us how dogs might act if they ""grew up"" and formed their own social hierarchies without us. As with humans, shakeups in the normal order of things can sometimes put bad leaders in charge, a situation which the other wolves will eventually recognize and deal with* Examples of the gentleness that Orcas have been known to display towards humans in the wild, despite their normal ferocity as predators, and despite our in no way being worthy of it as a species. * Giant tortoises react with a familiar peevishness when caught trying to steal food.* The octopus that got out of its tank at an aquarium, pulled up a drain cover from the floor, and followed the pipe out to the ocean.* The young dolphin that saw an aquarium visitor smoking a cigar, went and got a mouthful of milk from its mother, and tried to imitate the plume of smoke with it."
48,0805098887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15639925-t-nu-vahtra,5,"""humans are not the measure of all things"" I haven't read a nature book for a long while, but the world does not go around humans only and sometimes it is good to get reminded of that. Animals are working in their own world and we should not focus so much on comparing them to us but aiming to understand them in their ""own role"". By having studied natural sciences to some degree myself also I found it a bit surprising that the situation with accepting self-awareness of animals is such a huge taboo/problem. The book has 3 main parts: first about elephants, then about wolves of Yellowstone and finally about killer whales (read ""Free Willy""). Definitely quite a few interesting new facts in this book (for example that elephants have 5 pairs of teeth during their lifetime, last pair appears around at age 30 and the most inevitable death of old elephants happens after their last set of teeth is gone and they are no longer able to feed themselves (like bee's wings wear out after use and eventually end its life after flight becomes impossible). I envy the people who have the opportunity and time to observe animals like described here.“Whenever elephants met men, elephants fared badly. Syria's final elephants were exterminated by twenty-five hundred years ago. Elephants were gone from much of China literally before the year 1 and much of Africa by the year 1000. Meanwhile, in India and southern Asia, elephants became the mounts of kings; tanks against forts, prisoners' executioners, and pincushions of arrows, driven mad in battle; elephants became logging trucks and bulldozers, and, as with other slaves, their forced labor requires beatings and abuse. Since Roman times, humans have reduced Africa's elephant population by perhaps 99 percent. African elephants are gone from 90 percent of the lands they roamed as recently as 1800, when, despite earlier losses, an estimated twenty-six million elephants still trod the continent. Now they number perhaps four hundred thousand. (The diminishment of Asian elephants over historic times is far worse.) The planet's menagerie has become like shards of broken glass; we're grinding the shards smaller and smaller.” “We look at the world through our own eyes, naturally. But by looking from the inside out, we see an inside-out world. This book takes the perspective of the world outside us—a world in which humans are not the measure of all things, a human race among other races. ...In our estrangement from nature we have severed our sense of the community of life and lost touch with the experience of other animals. ...understanding the human animal becomes easier in context, seeing our human thread woven into the living web among the strands of so many others.” “People have told me that a wolf looks right through you. But you know what I realize? That's because a wolf isn't interested in you. It's always hard for humans to accept that we're not the most important thing anyone's ever seen.”  “Parental care, satisfaction, friendship, compassion, and grief didn’t just suddenly appear with the emergence of modern humans. All began their journey in pre-human beings. Our brain’s provenance is inseparable from other species’ brains in the long cauldron of living time. And thus, so is our mind.” “A humpback whale off San Francisco got tangled in dozens of crab traps connected by about a mile of rope, with weights every sixty feet; the whole apparatus ran to well over a thousand pounds. Rope was wrapped at least four times around the whale’s tail, back, mouth, and left front flipper, cutting into the giant’s flesh. Though nearly fifty feet long and weighing about fifty tons, the whale was being pulled down and was having trouble breathing when divers got into the water to see whether they could help. The first diver was so aghast at the extent of the entanglement, he didn’t think they’d be able to free the whale. Further, he feared that the whale’s thrashing could entangle the divers, too. But instead of struggling to break away as soon as possible, the whale remained passive through an entire hour while the divers worked. “When I was cutting the line going through the mouth,” James Moskito said, “its eye was there winking at me, watching me. It was an epic moment of my life.” When the whale realized it was free, it did not swim away. Instead it swam to the closest diver, nuzzled him, then swam to the next one. “It stopped about a foot away from me, pushed me around a little bit and had some fun,” “The main characteristic of an alpha male wolf,” Rick says, “is a quiet confidence, quiet self-assurance. You know what you want to do; you know what’s best for the pack. You’re very comfortable with that. You have a calming effect. Point is, alpha males are surprisingly nonaggressive, because they don’t need to be.”  "
49,0805098887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62793003-cody-mccoy,5,"Superb!!! Zafina’s clear and witty writing makes a subject I love even more fun to read about. He dug up hundreds of FASCINATING stories of animal minds, grounding anecdotes by keepers and animal observers in relevant scientific studies. Through lengthy time spent and interviews with primary field observers, Zafina uncovers beautiful, poignant, earth-shattering stories of how animals live rich and complex inner lives.The only false note at all in the book, for me, came about when he disdainfully makes fun of the experiments and terminology scientists use to study animal cognition. Mirror neurons and theory of mind take a hit, and he is pretty cruel to the scientists he interviews. Mind you, I agree with the substance of many of his critiques — eg, (1) is the mirror test REALLY capable of disproving self awareness if animals do not “pass?”, (2) we need to observe animals in nature and interpret their actions with a fair mind, not apply a rigorous framework that most humans would fail to uncover theory of mind— but the dismissive manner in which he writes was off-putting to me. I can imagine him tearing apart terminology reviewers forced me to include. He tells scientists to go outside for once. Many of us do that all the time. His style comes off as petty when the ideas easily stand on their own. But again, I agree with much of the substance of his critiques.More importantly, his deep and substantive reporting into elephants, wolves, and whales was OUTSTANDING. As a long - time animal cognition enthusiast, I never know if I will learn new things from books like this. Well, I sure did!! A few examples of his clever turns-of-phrase [context in brackets]— El-infant [baby elephant]— Newly erstwhile elk [after a wolf kill]— “Well, that seal should’ve acted immediately” eulogizes Ken.

On human kind.I wrote a long review on this elsewhere but the gist is that Safina offers two easy to understand arguments:(1) A compelling argument challenging our aversion to anthropomorphism in observation (i.e. Safina wants us to know it is okay to anthropomorphize about animal emotions within reason because not doing so leads to ridiculous, half-baked conclusions).(2) An argument against anthropocentrismAlong the way there are some fascinating, heartwarming and at other times alarming facts about non-human families and the challenges they face (spoiler alert: most of the challenges involve human violence or indifference).It addresses current animal study practices but is also very friendly to novices down for a long, but fast-moving read."

What's also beyond words is how humans disrupt, and often destroy the balance of the groups when we kill the matriarch, patriarch, or some other key member of the group; unspeakable.He closes his book by offering his heartfelt plea on behalf of those who are beyond words and a quote form the Canadian American marine biologist below.""Anyone who studies a wild animal faces the challenge of, in effect, making the case for its life on Earth.

52,0805098887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26245500-saurabh-shankar,4,An insightful book about animal behavior. I picked this one while randomly scrolling through pages when I encountered a chapter about Yellowstone wolves. It touches upon various aspects of animal psychology and also in general how little do we know about their behavior. It's filled with many anecdotes of animal encounters that makes you question the way we treat animals. Also you get close to many people who have dedicated their lives for animal conservation.Overall this ones a light and an interesting read.
53,0805098887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/349903-claudia,5,"I ""read"" this as an audio book narrated by the author. The main downside was the length..a staggering 16 hours of listening. The author, however, was an excellent narrator.The book is exhilarating and heartbreaking. The amazing intelligence and abilities of elephants, wolves, dogs and orcas are described by scientists who have observed these species for years. The idea that these animals are inferior to homo sapiens is pretty thoroughly debunked, in my opinion.The heartbreaking part, of course, is that we are contributing directly and indirectly to their extinction."

My emotional favorite is the section on elephants, but I learned the most from the section on killer whales.Safina is long-winded at times, but overall, I'm pleased that I read this book. I feel like I gained a lot from it. I listened to the audiobook, which is narrated by Safina himself, as I read along in the book, and I think doing that helps keep the momentum going."

The author, Carl Safina, struggles to separate subjectivity from objectivity. At times she does not even allow readers to even form their own subjective viewpoint on a case study before stating her own opinion on the matter through using words such as 'fascinating' and 'phenomenal' without new paragraphing. I would recommend Heinreich's books such as Mind of the Raven over this book, despite the fact that they have a lower overall rating and are lesser known."

An astonishing example is the fact that some alpha-wolves even socialize to get other wolves “liking” them and avoiding to attack them. Also different apes behave differently in their “hierarchy”. I like the book because it gives a perspective not only to animals but also to ourselves: we are just a small part in the world. "
