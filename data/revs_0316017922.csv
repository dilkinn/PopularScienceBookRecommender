0,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1429598-rebecca,5,"Gladwell argues that success is tightly married to opportunity and time on task. He states that it takes approximately 10,000 hours to master something and that gives me comfort. It helps me feel better about my many failures at initial attempts to master things (like glazing pottery, algebra, Salsa dancing, skiing and sewing... to name a few). I kept thinking, ""I've just got to put in more hours if I want to do better."" While I can see a different way of spinning the data provided to support Gladwell's argument, I didn't care. In a rare moment, I found myself not wanting to argue. : ) Instead, I found myself reflecting on things that have felt like lucky opportunities in my own life. This reflection was very humbling. Moreover, I felt the text tugging at the need for greater equity. What could all the people with limited opportunities do if given greater opportunities? Think Darfur. How many people who might have come up with the cure for pancreatic cancer been forced to spend their time standing in lines waiting for clean water or food? My own personal experience as a teacher of refugees reflects Gladwell's primary thesis. Many of my refugee students are pre-literate. They have not been given the opportunity to gain a formal education. As a result, there are many well-intended, but misinformed people who place these students in special education courses or deem their I.Q. low, diminishing their opportunities even more. The students I teach are hungry for skills and spend hours outside of class practicing. They make huge gains despite earlier opportunities denied them. While many will not go on to big colleges out of high school, I feel like given enough opportunity and time they could make it there. Sadly, many have families who depend on them to work to help financially support the family. (Yet, another limited opportunity to spend time focused on developing skills.) In the past week, I have shared Gladwell's thesis with my students. We have applied the 10,000 hours to master a task to reading and writing. I remind students that if we don't get our 10,000 hours this year together, they must continue on their own. I remind them that it IS possible to move forward if they are focused and keep adding hours of work to their reading and writing. We even write on the board how many hours left before we are masters. ""2 hours down, only 9,998 left to go.""Friday, I had a student from Somalia smile and ask, ""So it's not true that white people are smarter than black Africans? They just get more chances to read?"" Imagine my pleasure when I could respond, ""YES! That's correct. You are just as smart as any white kid in this school. It's just that some of them have been reading for years and you are just getting started."" Thank you for your work Galdwell, it is salient in today's political conversation surrounding education (especially for our most vulnerable students who have been given the fewest opportunities). "
1,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83582-bill-kerwin,2,"When I think about Malcolm Gladwell, the first phrase that comes to mind is ""less than meets the eye."" At first glance, his work seems thoroughly researched, even visionary at times. Beginning with a few maverick, counter-intuitive insights, he often ends with an affirmation of consensus, but it is a consensus that has been broadened by investigation and enriched by nuance.On second look, however, I'm no longer sure any of this is true. What first appeared to be new insights are nothing but familiar landmarks, previously unrecognizable because of the adoption of a deliberately mannered perspective; even the once apparent breadth and nuance now seem triumphs of language over logic, the apparent inevitability of his arguments an illusion conjured by the spell of his limpid prose.Take one small example from ""Outliers."" With a flurry of standardized test statistics, Gladwell makes the case that the traditional summer vacation--however rewarding it may be for the middle class--is just not working for the poor. (I'll concede the point, for the sake of argument, but any high school teacher will tell you how suspect conclusions drawn from such statistics can be.) He then presents a sustained anecdote about a successful all-year-round secondary school in a poor neighborhood. His conclusion? We should go to school year round. Sounds reasonable, right? But what about a more obvious solution: as a society we could decide to work together so that summer can be a learning experience for the poor by instituting a myriad of basketball camps, music camps, art camps, chess camps, traditional summer camps, etc., held at schools, community centers, and city parks, and staffed by college students, artists and teachers from the neighborhood. Gladwell often reminds me of the last panel of a Dilbert cartoon: two panels of plain-speaking criticism, followed by one panel of resignation. And no real insight, no real hope for the future."
2,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,5,"I know, you don’t think you have the time and there are other and more important books to read at the moment, but be warned, you do need to read this book.There are a number of ways I can tell a book will be good; one of those ways is if Graham has recommended it to me (how am I going to cope without our lunches together, mate?). And there is basically one way for me to I know that I’ve really enjoyed a book, and that is if I keep telling people about it over and over again. Well, not since Predictably Irrational  (also recommended to me by Graham) have I gone on and on about a book to people. First to Ruth over lunch, then to mum on the phone, and then the kids after they had just gotten out of bed in the early hours of the afternoon – my poor children, I’ve told them virtually the entire book.Now it is your turn.As a culture we tend to believe that people who are successful (people like Mozart, Bill Gates, The Beatles) all are ‘self-made-men’ and have risen to the summit of achievement on the basis of some incredibly special power they have and that we do not. It is a comforting thought, in some ways. If we have not done as well we are hardly to blame, because we just didn’t have that certain something. We don’t have the thing that sets them people apart from the crowd. And in this cult of celebrity we even get a chance to live vicariously in the reflection of their glory. Perhaps we can never all be Lady Di, (at least, not in public) but we can all attempt suicide with a pate knife and get into colonic irrigation. John Safran talks somewhere about a guy he knows saying to him that the only reason John made it and he didn’t was because John was Jewish. John then talks about how much hard work he had to put in to becoming successful, none of which relied on the mythical leg up he would have gotten from some secret Jewish conspiracy. This book isn’t about Lady Di, but it is about a series of biographies of people who have become incredibly successful. The biographies are generally told twice. The first time in a way that confirms all our prejudices about self made men and then in a way that makes sense of the success in ways we may find much more uncomfortable. I really struggled with this book – I loved every minute of it, but I still felt remarkably challenged by it. It was very hard not to think of my own life while reading this book. And this did not make me feel comfortable.I guess we are all fairly predictable, and one of the things that makes us especially predictable is that we generally like to have our prejudices confirmed. We buy books that tell us over and over again what we already know and believe. The Left Behind series is just one such example, as are most self help books. And I’m as guilty of this as anyone else. But there is a much better sensation we can get from a book, although this is much more rare. It is when the person you are reading starts telling you the deeper reasons why your beliefs are valid and not just based on prejudice. I have always believed talent is another (although, less apparent and all too vague) word for hard work. I’ve also believed that we are products of a range of different variables too complex to know in any real detail. This book confirms those prejudices.First he talks about ice hockey and a fascinating fact about the birthdays of the best players. They are all born at around the same time of the year. It is as if there is a cut off date for when you will be a professional ice hockey player – and, in fact, there is. The short version is that if you are born on the wrong side of the date they use to group kids into age levels you are likely to be a year younger than the other kids you are playing ice hockey with and therefore a year smaller than them too. That is going to make them look like they are better players than you are – and they will be too. A year at 10 is a huge difference, a huge advantage. And then we compound that advantage, by giving the older kids more practice, more experience in games and then more experience and more practice until there is no way the kid who happened to be born on the wrong side of the cut off date has any chance of catching up.The point he makes strongly here and repeatedly in the first part of the book is that there are other factors to success that are more than just ‘natural ability’. In fact, he does not believe in ‘natural ability’ – only in effort and time. Essentially he shows that if you put in 10,000 hours on any task you will be highly proficient at that task. Innate ability does not exist and ability is actually a function of effort expended. This is both liberating and incredibly challenging. Liberating because success is related to the effort you put in (and I think you should believe that is true even if it isn’t – it is the myth of Sisyphus, the only way we can really cope with the world is to believe our efforts have meaning). Challenging, because ultimately we are responsible for our own success as we are directly responsible for how much effort we are prepared to put in.The second great theme of this book is that where you come from matters. The culture that we are from has a remarkable impact on the rest of our lives. For example, if you are from a working class background you are much less likely to approach life with an attitude of ‘entitlement’. When people in authority speak to you, you are probably less likely to question them. In fact, you might believe you should defer to them. You are probably more likely to believe rules exist for a reason and that rules can’t be changed and can’t be moved. People from the middle class are much more likely to see rules as things that can be shaped or changed or ignored to make their life more easy or rewarding. Having come from the working class, even a particularly radical end of it, I can still see aspects of this deference in my own character and this was perhaps the most challenging part of the book for me.The other challenging bit was the part about the Hatfields and McCoys. As a Northern Irish boy, even if I’m not as obsessed with ‘honour’ as I might have been, this does make sense of things I have wondered about for a long time. The solution might be a little too neat, but the Irish, particularly the Northern Irish, are far too likely to feuds that are intractable and recognising that that might have cultural roots beyond the excuse of religion is utterly fascinating to me.The lessons of this book can be put into a brief sentence: success depends on a series of cultural and other factors that are mostly beyond your control – however, the thing that is totally within your control about success is how much effort you put in. And the more effort you put in the more likely you will be successful. They are directly proportional and we should all praise work as the key thing that really makes us human.I loved this book. I noticed that Ginnie points to a pilot who disputes some of what Gladwell says about culture and plane crashes, but this is a minor point. His bigger point about culture and plane crashes still stands and is remarkable. If you have kids, read this book – it will give you hints on how to bring them up with perhaps a modest sense of entitlement – it could make all of the difference. Ginnie also has a link to an article with a photo of the man himself – I was saying to the kids yesterday that I would give a couple of toes to look nearly as cool as he does, but I think it would take more than just toes.Look, what can I say? Read this book, it is life altering. Well, maybe not life altering, but a delight nonetheless."
3,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/146932-allie,4,"Didn't exactly read this book - Joe and I listened to it in the car on the way home from visiting family for Christmas. I really enjoyed it, and was very fascinated by certain parts of it, especially the sections about the Beatles, computer programmers and Korean co-pilots.But my enjoyment of the book was marred by the glaring absence of any well-known female ""outliers."" By chapter four or so, I noticed it and mentioned it to Joe, and then it just kept getting worse to the point that it was comical and distracting. Man after man after high-achieving man was featured. Any time a woman was mentioned, it seemed she was a wife or mother helping to boost a high achiever to success - or, in one case toward the end of the book, a somewhat slow female math student that a male professor had videotaped trying to figure out a math problem. By the time we got to that vignette, it was so ridiculous that Joe and I both started laughing, and Joe joked that ""the only woman in the book is dumb - but persistent.""When we got home, I Googled ""Gladwell Outliers sexist"" or something like that and found that several female bloggers and columnists also were ticked off about it and had taken Gladwell to task for it. Gladwell doesn't strike me as a raging sexist, so my guess is that he is so used to being a male in this world and constantly hearing about and identifying with male high achievers that maybe he didn't even realize what he was doing. I noticed that he gave a pretty weak response when questioned in an interview about his omission of women - he claimed that he had not omitted women because he mentioned his grandmother's story at the end of the book, in the epilogue, I think. Um, okay."
4,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116154-steve,2,"Occasionally insightful, but Gladwell's science is pretty junky. His reasons for success change by the page. And he cherry-picks examples to exactly fit the scheme under consideration. Plus, he's obsessed with callbacks and summary statements that only showcase the faulty connections between ideas."
5,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34364-david,3,"Malcolm Gladwell's new book reads like a series of cocktail-party anecdotes. Whether the book is a mere fluff piece or something more is open to debate. At its heart, it has two themes: (1) That success depends not just on talent but opportunity, and (2) that success (and failure) also depend on the cultural legacies we inherit from our forebears. Boiled down, here are his essential ideas:OPPORTUNITY1. Luck matters. Hockey players who happened to be born between January and March were disproportionately represented in professional hockey leagues. From an early age, these players were the oldest in their age bracket, and therefore bigger and more coordinated. Coaches selected them for better training and playing opportunities, and overtime, success bred success. Likewise, students who happened to be older for their class scored higher on math and science tests than their younger classmates, and were more likely to be picked for ""gifted"" and other advanced programs. 2. Even smart people need 10,000 hours of practice before they master a skill. Those that can get those 10,000 hours during childhood are a step ahead. Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and The Beatles all had unique opportunities to have lots and lots of practice in their specialties at an early age before becoming successful.3. After 120, increases in IQ are less important than creativity and ""practical intelligence"" -- knowing what to say to whom, knowing when to say it, and knowing how to say it for maximum effect. A lifelong study of geniuses showed they were no more successful than the average population. Nobel laureates are just as likely to come from City College of NY, Augsburg College, or Gettysburg College as they are from Harvard.LEGACY4. Rural Americans in backcountry states -- Kentucky, Tennessee, North & South Carolina -- inherited a ""culture of honor"" from their Scotch-Irish forefathers. These herdsmen warriors brought with them a willingness to fight in response to the smallest slight. This led to a pattern of bloody and violent feuds between families across the Appalachian states. (Think Hatfields vs. McCoys.)5. Korean Airlines had an unusually high rate of plane crashes because of the Korean culture's extreme deference to superiors. Junior pilots were reluctant to directly contradict their Captain on a flight, even in the face of grave error. This explains, for instance, the Korean Air Flight 801 crash in Guam in 1997. When the airline hired a specialist from Delta to retrain the pilots to speak more transparently, their safety record went up dramatically.6. Asians are good at math and science because their ancestors planted rice paddies. Rice farming was more labor intensive than Western agriculture. Asians have inherited this stick-with-it-ness that allows them to excel in math and science, where perseverance is mandatory.7. Unlike rice paddies, wheat or corn fields need to be left fallow every few years. Early American educators adopted this principle toward schooling - that students must not be exhausted. Hence, the long summer vacation, a distinctly American legacy. But this legacy is counterproductive, because kids tend to forget things over the summer. Kids who go to schools with shorter summer breaks tend to have higher test scores."
6,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18778-eric,3,"I can save you the trouble of reading the book: smart people don't automatically become successful, they do so because they got lucky. This rule applies to everyone including the likes of Bill Gates and Robert Oppenheimer. That's it. That's what the whole book is about. Gladwell looks at case after case of this: Canadian hockey players, Korean airline pilots, poor kids in the Bronx, Jewish lawyers, etc... Even with all this evidence it feels like he's pulling in examples that fit his theory and ignoring others. Thus while we look at many examples of geniuses who got lucky we do not look at Einstein which seems strange as he's the best known genius of the 20th century. While the book can be summarized in one sentence, the individual chapters are interesting such as the chapter that discusses a plane crash that happened in New York because the pilots were too subservient to make it clear to the air traffic controllers that they were almost out of gas. In short, the parts of this book were more interesting then the whole. "
7,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1846268-adam,5,"People are criticizing this book because it is not a journal article. Well guess what: we're not all sociologists. I have read plenty of journal articles in my own field (law). I'm in no position to read journal articles in fields outside my own. Having a well-written piece of mass-market writing is just the thing I need to access this information.Another criticism of the book is that Gladwell is the ""master of the anecdote."" Well, it seems to me that ALL SOCIAL SCIENCE is in some sense anecdotal. Every survey (even a methodologically perfect one) is necessarily un-abstract and anecdotal: it is based on survey research from particular people, and there's no way to derive abstract rules governing society from that like math. This notion of how Gladwell is all anecdotal bothers me. So what? If a good anecdote gets you to look at a situation in a new way or makes a powerful point, that's excellent! Any writer worth his or her salt LOVES a good anecdote to grab the attention of the reader."
8,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1557419-henry-mishkoff,2,"Well, it's official: Malcolm Gladwell has run out of things to say.His prose is still lively and entertaining, and he maintains his famous I-look-at-things-differently-than-anyone-else attitude, but ""Outliers"" has so little meat that it would have more appropriately been published as a magazine article.I think that the main value of reading Gladwell is that he plants a seed in your brain that encourages you to seek unconventional explanations for familiar phenomena. That's a very healthy thing, and I'm not trying to disparage its significance. But if you're looking for a book that provides meaningful insights, ""Outliers"" isn't it."
9,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1766263-jonathan,3,"Here's what I wrote earlier. I have to admit to the more I think and talk about the book, the less I think of it. It all seems too superficial.A pretty interesting book, albeit with not quite as many ""knock me over with a feather"" moments as Blink. It starts off with a bang, as he discusses amateur hockey teams and how it was noticed that virtually all the players on an Under-18 hockey team came from the first three months of the year. Turns out the age cutoff is January 1 in Canada, so the older players (those born early in the year) advanced further due to their slight maturity advantage which continued to multiply, as they got better training, put on better teams etc.This subject hits close to home, as I am a soccer coach and heavily involved in my daughter's soccer league. My oldest has a birthday at the worst possible time, just a few weeks before the cutoff date, while the younger one has a birthday the month after the cutoff date. So far, it hasn't seemed to slow the older one's progress, but it is something I will certainly keep an eye on. Gladwell's suggestion is to have multiple cutoff dates, so other ages can play against others of the same age. Doesn't seem likely though.He also explores how the timing of your interests can really change things. Something as simple as how available computer time was to early pioneers like Bill Gates and Bill Joy. Certainly, in the late 60s and early 70s, the amount of keyboard time these guys had pales in comparison to what would be available just a few years before that. He also talks about a major law firm in New York that benefited from getting the kinds of financial cases the other law firms wouldn't deal with, only to explode in popularity as the money days of the 80s and 90s struck.I thought the book felt like it suffered from data mining, in that there didn't seem to be enough exploration of other equally successful groups that may not have had the same advantages. But still a fascinating look at what kinds of thing influence success, whether we think about them or not."
10,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4485143-david,1,"Malcolm Gladwell writes very interesting and entertaining books. J.R.R. Tolkein writes very interesting and entertaining books as well. However, after reading Tolkein, I did not venture out into the world in search of hobbits, dwarves and elves to be my new friends, or worry about being attacked by trolls. Tolkein's books, while entertaining, have little connection to reality. Unfortunately, the same can be said about Gladwell. ""Outliers"" is a series of well-written and interesting essays along the lines of New Yorker or Vanity Fair  articles. However, their connection with reality is highly, highly dubious.This book is a big disappointment after ""The Tipping Point"" and ""Blink"", both interesting books that don't have the reader arguing with the author the entire way through. One main problem is that there isn't really an identifiable thesis in the book. It seems like Gladwell wants to say that the myth of the ""self-made"" person is not true, since every successful person has had help and lucky breaks along the way. Well, duh! But then he goes on to say that successful people spend 10,000 hours on their chosen area of success. Do they get any credit for that? Does working on something for 10,000 hours when you could be goofing off make you a bit ""self-made""? In my book it certainly does.Take Bill Gates. Yes, he came from a rich family, had some breaks and some unique opportunities. But what about his former classmates who are now meth addicts or bitter failures who had similar opportunities, but didn't sieze them? Or those who simply were too lazy to put in 10,000 hours in front of the computer? Is Gates ""lucky"" that he had the drive to do that? So either the main thesis falls apart -- that if you are privileged and lucky you will be successful, or it becomes something completely prosaic, such as ""Gates worked hard, but he had some unique breaks"". Again, duh! That's life. Every person can identify positives and negatives in their own lives. It is the choice to overcome the negatives and to capitalize on the positives that makes the difference. If Gates hadn't found the computer lab Gladwell discusses, would he have just given up, or would he have kept on looking? I think that he would have kept looking until he found a similar opportunity.The science is also incredibly flimsy. He asserts - ""Successful hockey players are almost all born in January - March"". Well, wouldn't that apply to all athletes? Wouldn't somebody before Gladwell have figured that out? Where is the data from the NBA, NHL, NFL and MLB? It really is an example of inductive reasoning, not good science. Gladwell is made aware of a pattern with *certain* hockey teams in Canada, and then assumes that this small sample proves that if you are born in April or after, you won't become a good athlete. Maybe so, but Gladwell needs more data to prove his point.Another assertion is: ""Asians are good at math because their ancestors were rice farmers - They come from a patient, hard-working culture"". But perhaps there are other reasons that could explain the same thing: religious traditions, government, how education is structured. Hey, maybe Asians have a high tolerance for their own body odor and can spend more hours in the field than Europeans! I'm not seriously arguing that, but it is an example of Gladwell making a connection between two things that is far from proven.The book is best read as a series of colorful essays on some interesting topics. However, as a guide or explanation of success, it is an example of truly sloppy science and shoddy reasoning. True, successful people don't get there on their own. But everyone can review their lives and identify lucky breaks as well as unfair disadvantages. In the end, Gladwell doesn't explain success at all in a convincing fashion, and risks leaving the reader with the impression that fatalism is the only attitude to have towards their own success. Nothing could be further from the truth."
11,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4426615-jason,3,"I skimmed this book instead of reading it. I didn’t entirely love it.Although the author makes some interesting points, I find some of the correlations he tries to draw a little silly. Like the Italian community in Pennsylvania where people are healthier and live longer because they have a sense of “community” or the fact that Southerners react more violently to certain situations than Northerners because they derive from a “culture of honor.” Sounds like extrapolated horseshit to me, especially considering the sample size. And when the author is making sense, I feel like he isn’t telling us anything we don’t already know. Like the fact that success breeds success, opportunity is key, practice pays off, etc. One of the few things I do find interesting, however, are differences noted in the way children are raised and the fact that some degree of entitlement being taught to them early can actually be beneficial as they mature into adulthood, mostly because they’d be able to use this sense of entitlement to demand higher salaries and better job positions.Regardless, this was my first experience skimming. I'm not sure I’ll do it again anytime soon."
12,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49415231-amir-tesla,3,"Recommend to: If you like exploring phenomenon beyond their appearance and if you enjoy story-telling writings about factual subjects, here: successWhat this book is about: Here, the famous columnist, Malcolm Gladwell deeply investigates the topic of success and people or nations with far beyond average achievements whom he calls ""outliers"" to figure out what has contributed to their accomplishments.ProsThe way Gladwell observes and concludes is so enticing and far different from what you might think about why a phenomenon has happened. For example, see how these arguments might sound: 1. Chinese are good at math because of their way of sowing and reaping rice in the fields. 2. The flight number X crashed, because the co-pilot was Colombian. And any other Colombian in his place might have led to the very same outcome. Strange? Yes, is seems so, and Malcolm nicely shows how these seemingly unrelated events are tightly bound.So from the point of the way he see's things differently and actually tries to find real reasons behind events you'll find the book amusing and thought provoking.ConsThere are two major problems I have with this book. First, he nicely let’s say detects the roots from which success is grown and these roots he argues, are all mainly what we can have no part on cultivating or choosing. Things like the date of birth (which opens up opportunities for practice in cases he studies etc.), or cultural background. But it would have been much nicer had he provided vivid guidelines on now that we can't choose the roots, how we can provide the opportunities and the environment caused by the roots.The other problem with some of his observations is that they can be potentially badly flawed or be results of what scientists say clustering. Namely, you look at a particular area with particular trends and specifications and you extend the qualities to the whole group in other areas. Or in situations I think, despite his keen observation and uncovering an aspect of an event, fails to see other dimensions as well. For example, in one part he says “Because of the limitation of lands in china, farmers had to be smarter and work smarter on their lands to increase production in contrast with their counterparts in America who used advanced machinery to increase the harvest and productivity. Now my argument: Haven't the Americans been smart to build such advanced machineries? :| All in all  the book was often engaging and thought provoking and if you want to read it, have it read skeptically, for the book if not absorbed well because of the amount of emphasis he seemingly puts on chance (things we have no will to choose on our own like parents, birthday, cultural background, etc.) might end up discouraging. The book's message though I think is noble, really noble, which tries to tell that communities and societies are responsible for provisioning an environment in which members can fulfill their potentials. Oh by the way, the famous 10000 hours rule for mastery is the result of the Swedish psychologist Anders Ericsson studies and was merely popularized, by Malcolm Gladwell."
13,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1805180-seak,4,"Outliers. Or as it should be called, ""Outliers don't exist."" I not only couldn't put it down, but my wife feels like she's read it now too. It starts with a story about a town whose inhabitants only ever die from old age (i.e., not from cancer or ANY OTHER problem) and quickly goes into a story about hockey players in Canada.For some reason the best hockey players are born in January through March and rarely any time after. The reason - it's all because of the date of the cut-off for playing hockey in the junior leagues (I use that meaning ""for little guys first playing"" not because it is in any way accurate as to the actual name). Because the cut-off date for kids joining the hockey league is January 1, those born right after have to wait about a year to join. What happens when one kids plays against another who is a year older? They get slaughtered (in only a sports sense ... I hope). That year makes a difference to the little guys (and girls) and so they get to play on the advanced team, they get to be an all-star and therefore, they get more and more playing time. What starts out as an arbitrary date, turns into something real since those who get more playing time actually become better and end up making up the majority of the professionals. This strikes a particular cord with me, being a December birthday. Luckily I've never had the desire to become a professional hockey player ... or lived in Canada (not a Canada slight, I love you guys eh!).Anyway, this book is filled with stories like this, making the point that when it seems like someone is a unique and even a prodigy, it usually is because of way more factors than just they worked hard and they are smart.From Mozart to Bill Gates and even geniuses who never made a mark on society. To airplane copilots who rather than speak up about a problem, lead the plane directly into a mountain. To the fact that there really isn't a magical type of person who becomes great, but someone who can put in the right amount of practice to do so (10,000 hours to be exact). But then again, you have to be blessed with the ability to have those hours of practice rather than being forced to survival.His main point is that societies and culture and even timing (like birth) make up a lot of who people are and why they become ""outliers."" That an outlier doesn't really exist because it's a person who is a product of their surroundings. A good portion of the richest people throughout history were born within 9 years of each other, just in time to take advantage of the industrial revolution. This is an extremely eye-opening book that comes highly recommended. I couldn't stop thinking about it or talking about it and I already have another of his books, Blink, ready in the queue. The only criticism I can make is that as with most arguments, those that aren't as advantageous to his claims are left in the background a bit.

14,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13298726-michael-perkins,2,"The term I've coined for books such as these is ""the illusion of erudition."" We love the anecdotes, many a form of comfirmation bias---the author telling us what we want to hear (cha-ching)---and we feel oh so much wiser once the wheels of the plane touch down on the runway at our destination because of having read a book such as this on our flight.====================================The famous, or infamous concept of the 10,000 ""rule"" in this book is not real. In a 2012 paper in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, the lead author of the original study about the practice time of elite violinists, K. Anders Ericsson, ascribed the phrase’s popularity to a chapter title in Outliers, which, Ericsson wrote, “misconstrued” the conclusions of the violin study. Ericsson himself never used the number 10,000 or the term ""rule."" Gladwell made that up. Ericsson extended his study to sports. Author David Espstein reports on the results (next four paragraphs)....In fact, in absolutely every single study of sports expertise, there is a tremendous range of hours of practice logged by athletes who reach the same level, and very rarely do elite performers log 10,000 hours of sport-specific practice prior to reaching the top competitive plane, often competing in a number of other sports— and acquiring a range of other athletic skills— before zeroing in on one. Studies of athletes have tended to find that the top competitors require far less than 10,000 hours of deliberate practice to reach elite status. According to the scientific literature, the average sport-specific practice hours to reach the international levels in basketball, field hockey, and wrestling are closer to 2,000, 4,000, and 6,000, respectively. In a sample of Australian women competing in netball (sort of like basketball but without dribbling or backboards), arguably the best player in the world at the time, Vicki Wilson, had compiled only 600 hours of practice when she made the national team. A study of athletes on Australia’s senior national teams found that 28 percent of them started their sport at an average age of seventeen, having previously tried on average three other sports, and and debuted at the international level just four years later.Even in this age of hyperspecialization in sports, some rare individuals become world-class athletes, and even world champions, in sports from running to rowing with less than a year or two of training. As with studies of chess players, in all sports and skills, the only real rule is that there is a tremendous natural range.======The down side to the Gladwell ""rule"" is that you see many unhappy kids out there being ground through the requisite ""hours"" by parents hoping their children will get scholarships or maybe go pro. I've coached enough youth sports to know there needs to be some base talent to build on for a young person to excel. I've also seen many 12-year olds who were stars at that age, but who faded by age 16, no matter how many hours they put in.At the gym one day, I ran into a varsity high school football coach, whose team had just won the California state championship. I asked him about ""the 10,000 rule.""He said: ""it's ruined many kids' lives.""70% of kids quit sports by age 13, many of them because “it’s not fun anymore.”==============More falsehood called out by The Sports Gene....""In Outliers, Malcolm Gladwell makes a point about height in basketball by comparing it to IQ. There is a threshold, he writes, above which more does not really matter. Above an IQ of 120—which already eliminates most of humanity—he argues, one is already smart enough to consider the most difficult intellectual problems, and more IQ does not translate into real-world success. In basketball, he adds, “it’s probably better to be six two than six one . . . But past a certain point, height stops mattering so much.” But the “threshold hypothesis” of IQ is not supported by the work of scientists who specialize in that field, nor is the threshold hypothesis of NBA height supported by player data.""Does Gladwell do any real research or fact-checking? Apparently not. He can't be trusted. I guess he has some readers think they're geniuses if they have an IQ of 120.================It struck me that Gladwell is like a prosperity Gospel preacher who tells people what they want to hear. And uses anecdotes that supposedly prove his points.I saw a couple of minutes of the most famous such preacher in the U.S. right now, Joel Osteen, who holds forth in a retrofitted basketball stadium in Houston. He began with: ""God is faithful. That promotion you've been waiting for: it's just around the corner. That lifetime soulmate you've always been looking for is on the way to you right now. The bonus money you need to take a vacation: you'll get that check by Christmas.""Then he'll use some story, usually from the Old Testament, to illustrate. And throw in a couple of contemporary anecdotes. ""I met a man.....""What if these good things don't come true? The dark side is that you get blamed. Somehow you've incurred God's displeasure.So you got cut from the team? It must be because you only put in 9,500 hours of practice instead of 10,0000.---------The backstory on Gladwell...https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...========="

Maybe...but, outliers may not be outliers after all...after reading the entire book, I was slapped by that at the very end. Gladwell looks closely at success, and those who seem to have waltzed into incredible success...Canadian hockey players, who just happened to have been born in the right month of the year; Bill Gates, who just happened to go to a school where the PTA moms bought a new-fangled computer system. Mozart, who didn't hit his stride until ten years after he began composing...the Beatles! Their sound was born of the 10,000 hours of performing in Hamburg -- more than other groups could amass in years of playing.Success is timing, and hard work...10,000 hours of practice required. It's luck -- having the right family, having the right opportunities -- Gladwell's description: ""a combination of ability, opportunity, and utterly arbitrary advantage...beneficiaries or some kind of unusual opportunity.""Gladwell's storytelling is so easy to fall into. We go with him anywhere...to a small town in Italy, to his own Jamaican family, and everywhere in between. I know Gladwell has an essay in TELLING TRUE STORIES, about narrative journalism, and I enjoyed reading this, more aware of the craft he practices...nonfiction storytelling.When Bill Gates admits he was very lucky, Gladwell hammers home that point. But to me, the 100,000 hour rule is what I'll take with me. Do you want to be the best? Put in the effort! Talent and opportunity can help, but success is hard work. "

All of them fairly superficial with nothing original or innovative. I think his books are very pop culture and should be read in the time frame (say within a year) that they are published. Too long after that and they become stale, not prolific or prescient. Gladwell is a very good and interesting writer, but I don't think his books have much depth or staying power.Almost 3.5 StarsRead on kindle."
20,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/575806-kressel-housman,5,"This has got to be Malcolm Gladwell’s best book yet, and coming from a fan like me, that’s saying something! As the subtitle states, this is a book of success stories, and true to his usual style, Gladwell draws on a diverse and interesting set of examples and presents a unique thesis on the ingredients it takes to make a person a success. The first half of the equation is much like Carol Dweck’s thesis in 
Mindset: The New Psychology of Success
. Hard work matters much more than raw talent. In the chapter called “10,000 Hours” he cites a study of music students which shows that the number of hours spent practicing is the key determinant in mastery. I found that very encouraging. If you want to succeed, spend your time practicing.But it’s the second half of the equation that makes his thesis unique, even though this part is somewhat discouraging. True, successful people have to put in many hours to master their craft, but they can only do that when the circumstances of their lives allow it. Now sometimes seemingly adverse circumstances can turn out to be an incredible advantage (Woo hoo! A whole chapter on the history of Jewish immigrants to America), but a genius in non-nurturing circumstances won’t make it no matter how talented he is (hence the depressing chapter on Chris Langsam, the man with the highest IQ in America.) As with The Tipping Point, I read this book to help me advance my career, but the main lesson it taught me was about parenting. Whatever opportunities I may have had or not had, used or not used, made me what I am today. And in many ways, I do feel I haven’t lived up to my potential, so I have to remedy the situation by putting in my 10,000 hours of practice, by becoming as efficient as a Chinese rice farmer (another particularly inspiring chapter). But the area in which I can make the biggest difference is for my kids. My job as a parent is to create practice opportunities for my kids to exercise their talents and interests. And if they become the people they can be, then all of us will be success stories. "

If your methodology is to only examine the winners (and bypass the structure of the lottery system), then you can surely come up with some highly entertaining (and biased) results!--If used with good intentions, the whole point of study designs/methodologies and statistics is to analyze the chaotic noise of the real world without getting distracted by human heuristics/biases; see Ben Goldacre:-I Think You'll Find it's a Bit More Complicated Than That-Bad Science: Quacks, Hacks, and Big Pharma Flacks...In fact, Goldacre has a couple words on Gladwell: On my left shoulder there is an angel. She says it's risky to extrapolate from rarefied laboratory conditions to the real world. She says that publication bias in this field [psychology] is extensive, so whenever researches get negative findings, they're probably left unpublished in a desk drawer. And she says it's uncommon to see a genuinely systematic review of the literature on these topics, so you rarely get to see all the conflicting research in one place. My angel has read the books of Malcolm Gladwell, and she finds them to be silly and overstated.2) A First-World, Middle-Class Fantasy:--“Socialism never took root in America because the poor see themselves not as an exploited proletariat but as temporarily embarrassed millionaires.” -Ronald Wright--It is astounding how much is unsaid, all the assumptions that is the social infrastructure of the reality we experience. The key assumption here is an apolitical (i.e. somehow without politics, i.e. power relations) market, composed of competitive automatons each trying to maximize their personal gains/utility, culminating in a meritocracy. --On this edifice, we see the heaps of First-World glossy-covered self-help (i.e. 4-hour Work Week), pop-psy, pop-econ (i.e Freakonomics), and business books to make readers feel more professional or self-accomplished. --Of course this system (capitalism, state capitalism, neoliberalism, whatever you want to call it) has to work for some, as the social mobilization of wage labor generates tremendous surpluses to extract from. The question is to what degree competition and meritocracy exist (not to mention the perverse consequences that often results, let alone alternatives). --Gladwell's case studies feature some highly political figures (Gates/Skadden/Oppenheimer); we have firmly stepped outside of cute marketing gimmicks and quirky sports/entertainment stats...--The main objection to this critique involves limiting the scope of analysis to where meritocracy is more plausible. This usually starts with a nationalist stance, by assuming the US/First World. Next, there's the assumption of a certain class, thus skimming off the un-deserving peoples. --However, the system of capitalism is global; that was the whole point of colonialism, and now transnational corporations and institutions (World Trade Organization, World Bank, IMF) function the same way (backed by the US military). Many poor countries are perfectly embedded into global capitalism, open for business with transnational corporations extracting their oil, minerals, forests, cash crops, labor, etc. Global capitalism as a whole faces crises in jobless growth and structural unemployment filling up slums in the age of inequality, ravaged environments in the age of the Anthropocene/climate catastrophes, and tens of millions of preventable deaths each year. --Curiously, the US (in particular the post-WWII middle class) is more and more experiencing the spatial (global) and temporal (boom/bust cycles, where post-WWII boom has ended) natures of contemporary capitalism as well, as outsourcing and automation have for the past 40+ years led to the Rust Belt deindustrialization, opioid crisis, precarious work, etc. --Without a clear understanding of the profit-seeking spatial/temporal logic and disruptions of global capitalism (which are indeed abstract), those disillusioned with the status quo are susceptible to symptomatic explanations of scapegoating the vulnerable and visibly-""different"".

I never considered some of the ""causes"" as a way of success.""Outliers are those who have been given opportunities – and who have had strength and presence of mind to seize them.""This sentence somehow sums up everything he is discussing in the book. But you won't become enlightened by merely reading this one sentence.

While this is a well-researched and easily readable book that makes some interesting points, most of its contents are pure common sense. In a world so highly populated with such strong inequities, of course there will be a lot of luck and chance involved with how someone turns out, aside from those that result from innate ability. You already knew that, right? So, shouldn't specific ideas and remedies be offered in such a heavily lauded book? If Outliers had contained, along with it's excellent sociological perspective, some specific solutions, and had it also delved into some of the psychological aspects of success, it could have been a great book. But it did neither, and frankly, it isn't a great book.I'm not saying that Outliers didn't change my paradigm a little bit. It did. I now find myself taking environment and outside forces more into account when accessing others and their circumstances.

26,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5229326-emma-deplores-goodreads-censorship,2,"This is one of those books that give popular nonfiction a bad name. Which is unfortunate, because what could be better than books that both educate and entertain? But Outliers embodies everything that people who sneer at the genre are talking about: its conclusions are both obvious and simplistic, its writing persuasive but glib. It’s easy to see why Gladwell is a popular author: he’s a good storyteller, his writing accessible and entertaining. But this book is so riddled with oversimplified conclusions and strange contradictions that it should be read for entertainment, perhaps for gaining a little bit of knowledge on a few very specific subjects, but not to be taken too seriously.Gladwell wants to examine why some people are wildly successful, and his basic thesis is pretty obvious: the most successful people benefit from advantages beyond their own talent. The first half of the book sticks mostly to this point, examining the advantages wildly successful people have had: much of it boils down to opportunities to hone their skills, though timing is also important. People who come of age in a favorable economy do better in their careers (no surprise there), while for skills where children are sorted into the gifted and the not at a young age, then given different levels of training, being born shortly after the cutoff date (and thus several months older than most of the competitors) confers a major advantage. The discussion of the effect of cutoff dates on hockey players (who are sorted at age 9 or 10) and on academics (with “gifted” classes often beginning in elementary school) is perhaps the best portion of the book, though Gladwell neglects to consider the psychological impacts of being classified gifted or not at a young age; it seems to me that even if kids aren’t separated out young, knowing you’re ahead of or behind your peers would affect your confidence.The book takes an abrupt turn in the second half, to talk about cultural legacies: for instance, feuds used to be common in Appalachia due to an “honor culture,” while planes piloted by people from cultures with a high level of deference for authority used to crash more often, until people finally figured this out and started training flight crews to speak up when they saw danger. Interesting stuff, but only sort of related to the first half. Gladwell talks a lot about his theory that Asians are better at math because their ancestors farmed rice paddies, which is really hard work, and gave birth to a culture that values hard work. There may be something to this, but I suspect it’s a lot more complicated than that; check out Little Soldiers for an in-depth comparison between the Chinese and American school systems. The most startling thing about all this, though, is that Gladwell never asks why, if Asian cultures are so much better at hard work, and hard work is what leads to great success, why are all of his “outliers” Americans or Brits and not Chinese or Japanese? Why wasn’t the Internet invented in China, if Chinese rice-paddy culture is so perfect for math skills?And the book is this way throughout, its analysis incomplete (and its outliers all white men). Gladwell coins the idea of the “10,000-hour rule” here – the notion that to become great at something, you have to practice for this magical number of hours. (He actually refers to this number as “magic” multiple times, despite the fact that the authors of the key study he relied on disagree with his analysis, pointing out that 10,000 hours was the average amount of practice put in by the best students at an elite music school, not a magic threshold between average and world-class. Gladwell, not the scientists, coined the idea of a 10,000-hour rule.) He talks at length about a study of violinists showing an apparently direct, linear correlation between hours practiced and skill, but that’s only one very specific talent (and those best violin students were merely expected to succeed, not yet embarked on their careers). Anyone who’s ever attended school knows that some people are just better at certain skills than others of similar backgrounds, even if nobody practices beyond their homework. And even Gladwell doesn’t quite seem to take his idea, that the number of hours practiced is all that matters, seriously. Within the same chapter he says, of the Beatles, “Lennon and McCartney had a musical gift of the sort that comes along once in a generation.” Wait, what? I thought this was a chapter about how it’s all about hours of practice, in a book that’s all about how the world is full of people whose talents are never realized because they didn’t get that lucky break. Huh.There’s plenty of other intellectual shortcuts too. Gladwell says a couple of times that hockey players born in the latter half of the year “might as well not show up for tryouts at all” when they make up 30% of the teams – too low, obviously, but this hardly spells doom for the most talented. He conflates families who teach their kids how to work with the system and navigate institutions (as opposed to poorer families, which tend to impart the idea that the world happens to you and authority is always an antagonist) with families who hyper-schedule their kids, and then suggests that a hyper-scheduled childhood leads to success, despite the fact that this is a very recent phenomenon and generations of successful people have managed to do without it. (Current research even suggests that unstructured time is crucial for developing creativity and independence.) It’s clear why he makes this mistake, since hyper-scheduling is so common in today's middle- and upper-class families that, at least in the study he examines, it occurred in all the families who taught their kids effective self-advocacy. But these are two totally different parenting choices. He even refers a couple of times to the importance of having books in the home for children to read “if they’re bored,” a sad assumption from an author – that reading is a last-resort activity (of course, the schools and families he praises leave no time for it anyway).I could go on, but plenty of others have reviewed this book already. Yes, the book has some interesting ideas and yes, it’s easy to read, but Gladwell is an intellectual lightweight. I wouldn’t recommend this one . . . unless, of course, you’re bored."

I never wanted to introduce the two of them, but I sort of feel obligated to after reading Outliers. In this, his third book, Gladwell stretches his sociological study of all things common sense to its ultimate breaking point. The cover touts the book as an answer to the long-standing question that thousands have tried to answer before him: why is it that some people succeed at their chosen field while others toil for years without ever rising above mediocrity? The answer is an obvious one: people succeed through a fortuitous convergence of different factors. It is not enough to merely be smart, or from a rich family, or have unique opportunities to embrace your field- be it music, writing, business, or whatever. All of these things form a good base layer for success, but in no way guarantee success (though anyone looking for such a guarantee may buy it from my website, along with some other steals: bridgeinbrooklyn.com). An outlier must also come of age in an appropriate time period to best take advantage of changing business situations (getting in at the beginning of the industrial revolution or the construction of Silicon Valley). In other words- success is determined by a large and complex system of variables that might benefit a determined individual. It all comes down to each person seizing any opportunity that might come their way and capitalizing upon it. Like I said, common sense. Still, just because it’s not ground-breakingly revelatory doesn’t mean that this book is without merit. Any reader familiar with Gladwell will expect the diverse examples that he draws from- ranging from Canadian hockey to enterprising Jewish immigrants and software programmers. Most interesting to me, though, were his examples of those people who should have become outliers but, for some reason or another, failed. His recounting of the world’s smartest man (IQ 192) who was unable to even graduate college due to an inability to adjust from his standard adversarial approach to hierarchical systems reminded me of dozens of people I have known who, despite phenomenal intelligence and creativity, flounder in the so-called real world and end up in dissatisfying and meaningless jobs. I do enjoy when authors of self-help or finance books admit that most of the problems that we deal with in our daily existence are created by us- Radiohead said it best when they sang “You do it to yourself, it’s true, and that’s why it really hurts.”Overall, though, this book seems scattered and more than a little unhinged. Much of the demographic analysis seems cherry-picked to support Gladwell’s theory of successful determiners and some of the examples seem to bear no relation to his main point but were included to pad out the length of the book. Still, I’m a little bittersweet about having finished it. I’ve been listening to Gladwell’s books, the above and his two previous, The Tipping Point and Blink, in their audiobook incarnations narrated by the author and his voice is just so calm and soothing, I wish I could make him read all of my books out loud to me. Hell, I’d settle for simply attending a lecture in order for a chance to hear his voice live. This alone is enough to guarantee that I will read his next attempt."

33,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3000932-sara-alaee,5,"In only 3 words I can sum up my feeling towards this book: IT IS AWESOME! The whole point of the book is that outliers are not outliers in ways we might sense they are - which is through intelligence, self-determination or even hard work. Rather, a series of major, somewhat uncontrollable factors have been playing roles in their success. (For those of you who don’t know who/what an outlier is, here is a concise definition from Oxford dictionary: “A person or thing differing from all other members of a particular group or set”). What Gladwell suggests is that in arguing about success we have been far too focused on “individuals” – on characteristics, habits and personalities of those have risen to the summit of achievement, while in order to understand the real causes, we have to look around them – at their culture, ethnicity, family, birth date and generation. In one chapter, he outlines the relation between being born in the first 3 month of the year and becoming a professional hockey player... In another, he mentions the surprising number of professional Jewish lawyers, all born in Brooklyn or Bronx in the mid-1930s and to parents who worked for the clothing industry... Wait!… Did you know that there is a magic year to be born if you want to become a software entrepreneur? … Did you know that the reason why Asians are so good at math is because of their rice padding tradition?... What about this one? : Did you know that Bill Gates, Joe Flom at Skadden, Oppenheimer, and Chris Langan (“the smartest” man in the world) had all two things in common: 10,000 hours of work before hitting their strides and living in the atmosphere of luck… So many patterns, right?! Let’s not spoil any more. Go on READ this book. You’ll be even more amazed! It makes you understand how much a social work success is and how a society can control who and how many people to succeed. “Outliers are not outliers at all. They are the products of history and community, of opportunity and legacy. Their success is not exceptional or mysterious. It is grounded in a web of advantages and inheritance, some deserved, some not, some earned, some just plain lucky – but all critical to making them who they are. “ "
34,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66366804-usman-hickmath,4,"What Bill Gates, Steve Jobs and Eric Schmidt have in common? Why do they standout from all the other IT startups of 70s and 80s? Why people from particular part of the world are good in Maths? How an average kid, who don’t perform better in sports than a naturally talented kid, performs well with age when given a chance? Why pilots coming from certain background have a better safety record?Gladwell has answered all these questions and many more with analysis and references to support. Cases he has picked up to explain the concept of Outliers are very interesting: but size of the samples taken into consideration and the extent of analysis carried out to arrive at the conclusions could have been larger.All in all it is an exciting, fast-paced read with lots of references for further reading."
35,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/101537773-valerie-gu,3,"In this book, the author doesn't explain how to reach success. He doesn't state that success is one's own ability. Instead, he focuses on the effects the society and environment have on a person. He explains that in order to understand success, it is important to look not at the characteristics of the individual, but at the social and cultural factors that enable success. For example, Gladwell mentions professional hockey players in Canada. in Canada, children who are born just before the cut-off date are naturally stronger and older than the other kids in a youth league. He says that they all have great talent, but what truly made them outliers was not work or skill, but the accidents on their birthday. "
36,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27572-miriam,5,"A completely fascinating account of why some people succeed and some don't--from when a person is born to the number of hours they go to school to circumstance. This will be of interest to anyone who is thinking about when to start their kids in school, people interested in education policy, ok, everybody. But I'm DEFINITELY sending one to my dad who was an elementary school principal and now is a mentor to principals. The stuff about how schools in the US are run and how just changing how vacations are handled could change how the lowest achievers achieve is told simply and compellingly."
37,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1-otis-chandler,4,"A great book and worth the read, but like many Gladwellian books, it can be summed up easily. The basic point is that there is no such thing as a true outlier. Success, it seems, is due primarily to hard work and circumstance - brains play little part. Gladwell went through several (fascinating) examples proving his thesis - people such as Bill Gates, Joe Flom at Skadden, Oppenheimer, some failed genius named Chris Langan. All of them had two things in common: they spent over 10,000 hours doing what they did, and they had fortunate circumstances that let them get ahead of everyone else. Bill Gates was smart, but so were lots of other geeks. He had the advantage of being 16 when the computing age came about, and being possibly the only 16 year old in the country with access to a computer - and he spent all his time on it. By the time he hit college he had well over 10,000 hours of computer time and was arguably one of the foremost experts in the country. One of my favorite bits was the music study on page 39 that compared musicians, and ""couldn't find any 'naturals'"" - the skill of each musician at comparable amounts of practice was equal. It's kind of validating to hear this, as many of us have this feeling that there are naturally smarter people out there than us. But apparently this isn't true - and I think my personal experience agrees with this. The harder you work, the better you can do.One other big takeaway was how circumstance can change things. The hockey league study and elementary school studies were fascinating and relevant. Basically kids that are in the older third of their class (or hockey league) have a natural advantage when they're really little. They are the kids who make all-star, and get extra coaching, and because of that they practice more and thus do become better by the time they are older. I was held back in pre-school so I was one of the oldest in my class, and I definitely think it helped me. Hmmm now can I plan my kids to be born to be the oldest? "
38,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96756984-yesenia-juarez,5,"Quite interesting, I especially loved the epilogue and the brief family history he shared with us. My first Gladwell read and definitely won’t be the last!"
39,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/934080-ruth,5,"I'd heard about this book, so when it came in the library the other day, I cracked it open to see what it was like. I couldn't put it down. I checked it out, jumping the line (librarian's priviledge!), and proceeded to devour it. It reminded me very much of ""Freakonomics"", as Gladwell analyzed what made rich and successful people rich and successful. He dismissed the idea of an ""overnight success"", showing that anyone could become expert at anything, from piano to computer programming, if they just spend 10,000 hours doing it. He dismissed the idea of ""genius"", showing that once people had a functional IQ of at least 120, it wasn't about how intelligent people were so much as what they did with that intelligence. He highlights the importance of cultural and socio-economic biases; for instance, he shows that, while Asians are not inherently more intelligent than any other ethnic group, they DO have a much more rigorous cultural work ethic, and a completely different approach to mathematics, and both traits help them excel in comparison to other cultural groups. (In fact, Gladwell blames many of the failures of American education system on the existence of summer vacation, saying that many other countries have 40-60 more educational days in their school year...)Fascinating stuff, and very thought-provoking..."
40,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/236411-steve,3,"The basic idea is that people who succeed spectacularly well (way above sample averages) often don’t look so remarkable once you take their inherent advantages into account. How effective a book like this is inevitably comes down to the examples. Fortunately, Gladwell has a talent for picking them. He had me with the very first one: why is it so many Canadian hockey stars are born in Jan-Feb and so few in Nov-Dec?There were times when I wanted to quibble about the rigor of his investigative methods, including the mistake of inferring causation from correlation, but I won’t count off too much for that. What I view as a bigger problem, though, was a tendency to overstate his case. He seemed to suggest that these hard-to-see-but-fun-to-uncover factors are almost always the main drivers of preeminence. I feel some people are outstanding independent of “the village” it supposedly takes or the benefits of some systematic leg up. In fact, I suspect someone could write another book about people who overachieve despite all the influences conspiring against them. And the anecdotal evidence collected there, just like Gladwell’s, would neither prove nor disprove a more general truth. Part of me just wants to believe in exceptions – those who simply want it more or have a unique talent or insight. They could be outliers beyond what the model of causal forces would predict."
41,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5953660-malia,3,"This was my first book by Malcolm Gladwell, whom I had heard about again and again before reading it and was curious to see how his work lived up to expectations. Outliers is definitely interesting, but after about half the book, I felt as if things were getting repetitive. He makes his point that people at the top of their fields had to have had talent as well as certain critical opportunities along the way, but that luck plays a not insignificant role in their success. This ""revelation"" was interesting, though by no means surprising or revolutionary to me, and so, after a while, it felt as if he was just regurgitating his point again and again using different examples. I did like that he chose a wide variety of areas to analyze from tech to sports and everything in between and his writing style is easy to get into, but all in all, I was a little disappointed. After hearing so much about the author and his brilliance, I guess my expectations were maybe too high. That being said, I'm willing to give him another chance and may try one of his other books. Any recommendations would be welcome!Find more reviews and bookish fun at http://www.princessandpen.com"
42,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/289556-jackie-the-librarian,4,"More pop science from Gladwell. The premise is people need more than talent to succeed, they need opportunity. Everything from when you were born, your ethnic background, and your economic status can affect your chances to succeed in life.Gladwell gives us one anecdotal example after another, and it's interesting, but hard to put into use. So, all the big Silicon Valley computer heads were born within a certain range of years. What do I DO with that?On the other hand, the fact that even with access to a computer, or soccer talent, it still takes years of practice, around ten at least, to become a ""genius"" in a chosen field is good knowledge. It takes hard work. Like the saying goes, How do you get to Carnegie Hall? Practice, practice, practice!If you like Gladwell's other books, you'll like this one, too, but it's not essential reading by any means."
43,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4776032-cher,2,"2.5 stars - It was alright, an average book.Interesting premise with well illustrated examples - will make you think about successful people in a different way. Also made me feel as though I have been utterly cheated by being born in the last week of the year. The author at times uses weak ""evidence""/arguments though, and over-explains his ideas. -------------------------------------------Favorite Quote: It's not how much money we make that ultimately makes us happy between nine and five. It's whether or not our work fulfills us.First Sentence: Roseto Valfortore lies one hundred miles southeast of Rome in the Apennine foothills of the Italian province of Foggia."
44,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1919073-lauren,1,"Pop-sociological drivel. I actually felt dumber after reading this. Gladwell makes a structural argument to explain success, (which is an argument I'm sympathetic to), but rehashes and manipulates other people's research in order to fit his theory. His cultural explanations (Why are Jews such good lawyers? Why are Asians so good at math?) are also borderline racist. Ick.Read Annette Lareau's Unequal Childhoods, Bourdieu's Distinction and Weber's The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism instead."
45,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7494963-anne-bogel,4,"This was a re-read for me: I wanted to revisit this book that changed the lens through which I view people's success stories. Gladwell has a knack for helping his readers perceive familiar information in entirely new ways, and in Outliers he busts the myth of the self-made man, pointing out that real-life success stories are a lot more interesting than that. Its worth mentioning that Gladwell writes fantastic prose. An enlightening read. "
46,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9779623-shaun,4,"Often when we see an extraordinarily successful person, we attribute their grand accomplishments to their natural ability and talent. IE...he's just a genius.But what if success is less about innate talent and more about pure dumb luck? What if our success is as much a function of chance as it is our uniqueness?Many of the examples cited in Gladwell's book perfectly illustrate the role that external forces play with respect to our achievements. For example, he cites examples from sports in which age cut-offs are used to group athletes as a means to make his point. Clearly, at certain ages some older boys may have a physical advantage over their teammates, especially around the ages of typical puberty. I have three sons who all play baseball, and I've seen this at work. My oldest son was always a little better and bigger than his peers, even though he was not the oldest kid. Then many of his peers started to go through puberty, when he did not. He went from being the largest kid...to the smallest. He started moving down in the line-up, got less playing time, got to pitch less. He just couldn't compete with some of these boys who now had full-beards. Ironically, at 17, though still behind the curve in some respects, he is again the tallest boy. While some of his teammates peaked at 12, he still hasn't. Unfortunately, in some respects the damage may already be done. For many years, he was denied opportunity, not based on raw ability or talent or even potential, but based on his size at a specific time...or lack of it, thanks to his genetics. He's a late bloomer, now 6 foot 3 and still growing, however, he has missed opportunities throughout his development due to falling behind the curve.Along the same line, my 3rd son and 4th child has had only a fraction of the opportunity to play a sport as his two older brothers have had. I mean, I had four kids in five years. By the time number four came along we were pretty busy, and as a result, our youngest has had a lot less opportunity to excel in a sport than his brothers, purely because he was the youngest. There is simply less time and money. Also less enthusiasm and support from us. I often wonder if he would be a better ball player if he had been born first and had had the opportunities his older brothers have had? The point is that when we pick winners and losers, it has the potential to become a self-fulfilling prophecy. So, whether or not talent is nurtured is often influenced by many factors outside an individual's control.I agree. This is true in education as well, and really in many areas of achievement.Research I've read in other books has also shown that a teacher's attitude about a student's ability, can in fact impact how they ultimately perform. In that sense, ability and talent is often ignored because where a child is in development can impact our perceptions about innate ability and talent.Gladwell further explores the role of opportunity by referencing Bill Gates, who, thanks to dumb luck, had unique opportunities that ultimately may have given him an edge that had he been denied could have changed everything. Clearly, Gladwell isn't trying to deny that people like Gates are extremely smart, talented, or even destined for some sort of success. Instead he is pointing out that innate ability and potential are only a part of it. The world is constantly shaping us in ways that we can't take credit for.I wished Gladwell would've talked more about the ability to see and capitalize on opportunity as being a factor. If that is true...it's more than just dumb luck or opportunity. It's our ability to see the opportunity which again might reflect an innate ability that some of us have and that others may lack. All in all, an interesting read about the outliers among us and some of the forces that help to create and shape them."
47,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/762235-marcus,4,"This book is excellent. It's fascinating, insightful, sometimes even shocking and always entertaining. If you don't read it, you're really missing out on some great research and writing.Why four stars? In my less-than-humble opinion this book, or rather this author, has the same problem as other books I've read by smart, insightful authors, I agree with their research methods and findings and even most of their conclusions, then they step into the realm of political or economic policy and I go nuts.In this case it didn't happen until the interview after the epilogue in the audio version of the book. Gladwell, who by the way, is an excellent narrator (it makes me slightly sick that he is so good at everything he does) is explaining his premise--that success is not entirely the result of an individual's grit and brilliance, but is also heavily influenced by their ancestors and environment. Fine. I have read the book and it's a position that I understand and respect. Then he says something along the lines of:""the idea if that if you make it to the top of your profession you deserve a salary of $20 million a year because you're the one responsible for getting to the top, why shouldn't you be richly rewarded? ... and I think that idea is completely false, it's completely false and it's dangerous.""This is part of his ""bedrock philosophy as a human being."" Again, I agree with him on the point that people who end up at the top of their careers were likely helped by environmental factors similar to those that helped Bill Gates, Rockefeller etc. But to say that we, the people who weren't in their position and didn't make it to where they are, have some right to say what amount of money they should or shouldn't earn or possibly even a right to some of their money is ridiculous! Sure, they had help along the way, but their success is still fundamentally their success. Bill Gates could have had all the same luck but still never made anything of his life. Instead he, and not anyone else, recognized an opportunity and took advantage of his position for his, and all our benefit. Limiting his salary doesn't mean that there is less money to go around for everyone else. If you boil it down, what Gladwell is basically saying is the same thing you hear on an elementary school playground ""NO FAIR!"" Nothing in life is fair. Everyone knows it. You make the best of what you have and try to be happy for, and learn from, those who have more.It is disappointing to me that Gladwell uses such a well written and otherwise brilliant book as a thinly veiled justification for income redistribution."
48,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9653496-hanne,4,"Over the past week, I’ve started half a dozen sentences with “I’m reading this book by Malcolm Gladwell and …”. That’s immediately a big thumbs up for me because it implies that this book gave me everything I want from a non-fiction book: to teach me something new and interesting, but also to give me something to think and talk about.With Blink and The Tipping Point, Michael Gladwell already wrote a few books I really enjoyed reading, and this one definitely strikes gold once again. Outliers starts off with the famous ‘10.000 hours rule’, which says that no-one ever got really expert at anything without putting in the time and effort, and studies have put the bar at circa 10.000 hours. Innate ability and talent only explain so much, what really counts is the hours and the dedication. Never has any book managed to make me want to practice my hobbies more.And it only gets better. A lot of chapters start with a big ‘success story’, like the Beatles or Bill Gates. It first tells us the shallow story we all know, and then it throws that version of the story straight to the bin, and shares some insights about what really happened. Because those shallow success stories are a lot of nonsense it seems...
“We are so caught in the myths of the best and the brightest and the self-made that we think outliers spring naturally from the earth. (…) But that’s the wrong lesson. Everything we learned in Outliers says that success follows a predictable course. It is not the brightest who succeed. Nor is success simply the sum of the decisions and efforts we make on our own behalf. It is, rather, a gift. Outliers are those who have been given opportunities – and who have had the strength and presence of mind to seize them.”
Above all, in typical Gladwell style this book is really smoothly written and a joy to read. You’ll learn new things, you’ll get some more encouragement to keep practicing at whatever it is you want to achieve professionally or hobby-wise. And it might give you some conversation topics too. Come to think of it - why are the majority of professional hockey players born between January and March? "
49,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935491-tanja-berg,4,"I was a little worried that this book would be more based on anecdotes than anything else. To a large degree it is, but Malcolm does include statistics as well, more than I thought would be the case. Every single thing in this book confirms my view on success. Super-human qualities are not required and there isn't really any great big mystery.What is needed for success is this:- Luck / chance, such as being born early in the year if you want to be an ice hockey player.- The right background, be it culture, socio-economic status and so on.- Hard work, at least 10000 hours in your field of choice if you want to excel.This book has certainly given me a lot to think about, even though all of it played into my pre-conceived ideas. "
50,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73449257-renee-amberg,1,"A bit disappointed in this one. It wasn't what I was expecting. Instead, it was a lot of repetition on the fact that outliers have a lucky opportunity presented to them. Not much else to be honest. I was hoping for more well known outliers like Einstein or people who have made an impact on the world, however the author mentioned a lot of people who just have high IQ's but have not succeeded in anything very notable. It was boring and irrelevant to me, unfortunately. "
51,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15896137-olivia,0,"I so value the perspective this books gives on what contributes to success, and it is one that I think so many other people could benefit from.This book succeeds (heehee) in its aim to de-mystify the notion that the greatest successes are by those who merely were so talented/hard working that, well, of course success came to them. This shows you that to view success like that is to look at it through a narrow lens- one that needs to be expanded. Success happens with talent and hard work, yes, but it is also where *THAT MEETS OPPORTUNITY*. You cannot talk about success, and not discuss how success is heavily influenced by the opportunities a person is given throughout their life (and beyond that). It was very insightful to learn of the various things we wouldn't normally think of or associate with success. I never would have thought about cases like with the pilots, or truly think about the nature (and cost) of the summer break in US education. Or how language and number systems influence math and the ability to understand/learn it.The only main critique I can think of is that it would have been nice if when he talks about the how much potential would be fulfilled if opportunities were widespread, if he provided some concrete steps or ideas. And, also, while he did discuss race in particular to his family's experience (his mother is a writer from Jamaica), I think the role of race and a person's ability to succeed could have been explored more (even beyond what he covered with Asian children/adults and success).I have been on a bit of a 'self help' book spree (which, by the way, google lists this as one, and so does Goodreads, but it is more of a research based analysis), and SEVERAL books I read have mentioned Malcolm Gladwell. I completely understand why if all of his writings are similar in giving a unique, and important perspective."
52,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/102301031-itai-makate,5,"Eye opening read that delves into the reasons why some individuals attain super excellence in their fields. As humans we like to believe in the ""one man beats all the olds from rags to riches"" stories. Turns out it's much more subtler than that! when one digs deeper into the lives of such ""outliers"". The writer sites many famed individuals from Gates, Jobs, Carnaige, Oppenheimer, Mozart, Beatles and countless others showing how it was rather a combination of their birthdays, effort (10000 hours horning their craft), their social background and most importantly a string of opportunities that they were presented with that placed them in a unique position to attain their exceptional success. The second part of the books deals with the effect of culture in determining the success levels of people generally speaking. For example why Asians are good at math compared to their counterparts. Turns out it had something to do with rice paddies, hard work ethic and very short summer breaks.Very insightful read that serves as a guide to everyone including governments, organisations, companies and individuals. There are lessons from there that can serve mankind to do better."
53,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2585926-stela,3,"I must say I liked The Tipping Point more. Maybe because the main theory of this book, that there are many factors which influence a person or an event, such as a cultural, geographical, linguistic etc. environment, is not a new one - a 20-century Romanian philosopher, Lucian Blaga, had named it the stylistic matrix of a nation and considered it the principal distinction between people from different regions of the Earth. Personal talent is added to this subconscious matrix in order to create the great personalities of a specific culture.However, the book is very interesting and, as always, the writer gathers many facts to illustrate his theory. I especially liked the story of his own family with the analysis of the opportunities that led to success. It was also interesting to read about the causes of plane accidents, and, as a teacher, to share the same belief that, in class, sometimes a few months difference in the age of the students can explain their failure or success.What I liked best (and I never thought about it till now) was the idea that when an IQ is very high, there is a point where the the difference between the scores does not matter anymore: a 150 is not less intelligent than 190 IQ, they are pretty much the same - geniuses (I think the reverse is also true, and there aren't many differences between the dumb :)).Overall, a good book, and I'm looking forward to reading Blink. "
54,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3063324-jayesh-naithani,4,"In Outliers, Malcolm Gladwell presents his case that personal success is not exclusively a matter of individual merit, but instead a result of special opportunities and other advantages. And how well one does is influenced to a great extent by where they were born, cultural behaviors, family history, and circumstances of their upbringing.The chapter on “The Ethnic Theory of Plane Crashes” is fascinating. Here Gladwell systematically presents the correlation between a country’s plane crashes and it’s culture’s measurements on individualism, the tolerance of ambiguity, and attitudes towards hierarchy - known as the power distance index, or PDI. These paradigms are better known as Hofstedes dimensions. Countries with high PDI will usually have higher plane crash incidents. The United States has a low PDI ranking, and also has a very low rate of plane crashes.Despite reading Gladwell’s logical explanation of why certain folks enjoy more success than others in terms of generation, class, culture, and circumstances - the book may still leave you with the feeling that it often requires a particularly special individual to combine their exceptional talent with tremendous effort to make the most of their opportunities - and enjoy a level of success that only a few amongst us achieve."
55,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38966916-evie-frost,1,"The book ""Outliers: A Story of Success"" by Malcolm Gladwell was about how to become successful and tells other peoples' stories of success. It also tells you your odds of becoming successful and goes over some unfortunate stories of peoples' failed success. My favorite part about this book was learning why Asians are good at math. My least favorite part was that he really dragged on. He had few counter-arguments and his book was more persuasive than factual. He only told us one side of the story and dragged on for about 50 pages saying the exact thing over and over again. He also made it look like you had to be a certain way or be raised a certain way in order to achieve success. We all know many people who are successful that go against what he is saying and I think that it is unprofessional to say that you have no chance at success just because you were born too late in the year or weren't raised as a Jew.I would only recommend this book to people who like books that drag on and have no counter-arguments. I would also recommend this book to Jewish-Asians born between January and March because they will feel very confident with their future. "
56,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23106940-mia,4,"While Gladwell does occasionally go off on tangents, and while there are some examples which seem superfluous or out-of-the-blue, this is a breeze to read, and Gladwell's enthusiasm and passion really bleeds through the pages. It's nice to read a nonfiction book with as much heart as this one had. Plus, the underlying theme is an important one. Away with our underdog tales, our teary stories of triumph over adversity with the only boon being the protagonist's big brain and ambition! Away with our starry-eyed idolisation of geniuses! Let's all raise a toast to all the factors, deserved or not, seen or unseen, that made- and continue to make- us who we are."

It is, without doubt, the finest achievement that humankind has ever achieved. The main point of this book is about success.Success,everyone want to be succeed,but what can we do to achieve this dream?This book can tell you what you want,you can find your bosom friend forever,the story will inspire you when you are in the bottom,it can encourage you when you are fighting for your dream and give you more energy.So,read it,you deserve it."

Is this merely a way to tear down the myths and expose the complex web of factors leading to individual successes? What's the lesson? What are we to take-away? Is it that it's ok if we don't all have success from working hard -- I can easily look at my background, like the Termite failures, and see a whole number of factors contributing to where I am today -- but to what end? Gladwell hints slightly at what's needed in the chapter where he talks about the students at KIPP, saying that instead of maths classes and a schedule on par with a young lawyer trying to make partner, what they need is society that provides opportunities for all. He even seems a little cynical about the kinds of opportunities provided by KIPP:
Marita just needed a chance. And look at the chance she was given! Someone brought a little bit of the rice paddy to the South Bronx and explained to her the miracle of meaningful work.
Much like the historical details in White Trash -- it's clear that we don't live in the land of equal opportunity for all. That's never what was intended. The real question remains: how do we create greater equality? What's the right kind of equality? More thoughts to come later."

But what really makes a successful person?Malcolm Gladwell takes us on a journey through various times and people's lives to unearth a theory that is both humbling and insightful. It's not the brightest people who succeed – if you're successful, the results of your efforts are not just of your own making, but ultimately a product of the world in which you grew up:""These are stories about people who were given a special opportunity to work really hard and seized it, and who happened to come of age at the time when extraordinary efforts was rewarded by the rest of society.""He also puts forward that it takes 10.000 hours to master a skill and that the time invested in something is what makes up the difference between the good and the best. It's as plausible as it is motivating. You can succeed in things you think you're bad at – just just got to put work in. While this was an entertaining read that I felt like I learned from and was given things to ponder on, it did make me wonder what the intended take-home message was. In a way, Gladwell is saying that whether we succeed or not is determined by factors that are out of our hands. I'm left with a new perspective, but one that I can't call helpful for certain."
60,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5015851-ms-pegasus,5,"OUTLIERS explores the idea of meritocracy with Gladwell's typical focus on aberrational patterns. He begins with an observation about the distribution of birthday months for a professional Canadian hockey team. There is a consistent skewing toward the earliest months in the year. Although he does not explore the probabilities in detail, this fact is especially astonishing since births by month are not evenly distributed, but in fact skewed toward the months in the second half of the year (https://blog.rjmetrics.com/2009/09/14... is one of many websites that cites this distribution). His explanation is persuasive, if not news to parents harboring hopes that their son will be the next Wayne Gretzky (incidentally, a Canadian born in January). Gladwell notes how a few months' advantage of maturity and physical development can reap life-long cumulative advantages: More confidence, more playing time, better coaching, more competitive opportunities, more encouragement.He then shifts his attention to a new thread. One connecting Bill Gates, Bill Joy (co-founder of Sun Microsystems), and The Beatles. This exploration leads him to the “10,000 Hour Rule,” a catchy phrase that has made its way into popular parlance. I was particularly impressed by his mention of Bobby Fischer in this context. Anyone who has read the biography ENDGAME by Frank Brady will find supporting material for Gladwell's ideas.Numerous critics have jumped on this generalization, arguing that it is an oversimplification when taken literally. Gladwell responds to these critics, emphasizing the spirit of his claim (http://www.businessinsider.com/malcol...). In case after case Gladwell poses a prediction based on intuitive ideas about how the world works. In case after case he demonstrates that intuitive ideas are unreliable. The alternative explanations he poses are persuasive, but more important, unexpected.The diversity of his examples make this an entertaining book. The second part of the book shifts gears into an area he calls “Cultural Legacies,” bundles of attitudes subconsciously reinforced through family histories. “Cultural legacies are powerful forces. They have deep roots and long lives. They persist, generation after generation, virtually intact, even as the economic and social and demographic conditions that spawned them have vanished, and they play such a role in directing attitudes and behavior that we cannot make sense of our world without them.” (p.175) The exploration takes Gladwell from Harlan County, Kentucky to South Korea. Between 1988 and 1998 the loss rate for United Airlines was .27/million departures. During the same period the loss rate for Korean Air was 4.79/million departures. (Imagine trying to get “Rainman” aboard a KAL flight!) Gladwell hastens to add that since 1999, KAL's record is spotless, the result of an astonishing turnaround in cockpit training. At its heart was confrontation of a cultural legacy problem — the hierarchical relationship and behaviors between the captain and his subordinates in the flight crew. This was, in fact, my favorite part of the book, and the factor that boosts my rating from 4 to 5 stars. His transcriptions of cockpit recordings are riveting, as each accident scenario unfolds. Readers who have occasion to deal with non-native English speakers, particularly in the software industry, will find ample food for thought.Gladwell's curiosity takes him to many other topics. He looks at the trait of persistence. He questions the role of language in the early mastery of number sense. He examines the effects of summer vacation on academic performance. His restless mind and energetic research stir up contradictions that force the reader to revisit intuitive explanations that are so tempting to grasp. His curiosity is infectious."
61,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/128745-malbadeen,4,"Love him or hate him - whatever. The more I read of his stuff the more I am fascinated by what he does. I think it is so interesting how we can make up a theory and pretty much ascribe all happenings around us as proof that that theory is correct. I do it all the time. My whole family does it, it's how we converse. I think more people do it than are willing to admit and if you read Gladwell with that in mind it is easier to not get so worked up about that fact that he is espousing ideas rather than writing doctoral dissertations that are intended to change the way the world functions. Personally I find myself arguing with/disagreeing with his stuff during a good portion of what he writes but I like arguing so find it mostly enjoyable. In this book Gladwell is attempting to support his belief that successful people are not ""self-made"" but rather the fortunate product of suitable circumstances. A slight variation on ""nature vs. nurture"" nothing new here. I mostly agree with the idea as it fits nicely with my more politically liberal sensibilities but there were several instances when I felt like his words were actually making the counter argument. Specifically in an extended portion about early Jewish immigrants. He seemed to be saying, ""lucky them, they happened to have the right skills at the right time"" while glossing over their relentless attempts to find their own niche.I also found the hairs on my neck raising when he talked about schools. I feel uncomfortable anytime people start suggesting that the solution to closing the achievement gap for the economically disadvantaged and advantaged is to take kids from their families for longer amounts of time. It is troublesome because it doesn't address the larger issue of social inequities on a larger scale and it starts with the presupposition that academic achievement is the pinnacle to which we should all strive to attain and it de-values the role families play in the upbringing of their children. All that being said, I realize this is one book, with one main point and not every conversation can/should end up with a march to the white house demanding social equity for all. But still....maybe just the tiniest nod to the larger issue would have been nice.I was also more than a little aware of the fact that while he attempted to be gracious to groups other than middle and upper class he would throw in statements like, ""....there aren't books lying around her house that she can read if she gets bored. There's *PROBABLY* just a television."" when talking about ""poor"" households and yet there were no ""probablies"" when he spoke about high income households. It was all definite statements of ""positive"" experiences. oh Malcolm. tsk. tsk.(if you've stayed with this ""review"" this long, you should send me your address so I can send you a dollar for your fortitude).So all in all I'd have to say: I disagreed with him a ton but I enjoyed the disagreements and, as always found his writing to be catchy and clever and all that good stuff.*******oh wait, oh wait! note to editors: proof of what a great service you do can be found in the Acknowledgments at the end of this book. I can only assume there is no editorial input for this part as Gladwell used the phrase ""as always"" 4 times on one 1/2 a page! Egads, bring in the editors!!! **********"

“Outliers aren’t outliers…. they are [what they are] not because of some exceptional or heroic individual action on their part but because of whole series of circumstances, environments and cultural legacies.”
 – Malcolm Gladwell in an interview.What is Gladwell essentially saying? He sums up the circumstantial, environmental and cultural reasons for being an outlier in the following ideas:1. Luck has its role to play2. Hard work and enough practice - 10000 hours – makes you good at almost anything 3. IQ doesn’t guarantee success. There exists a concept of IQ threshold. Psychological testing has its limitations4. Being born at the right place, right time helps5. Middle and higher class families typically provide better, nurturing home environments6. Disadvantaged groups have access to fewer opportunities7. If kids put more effort they could fetch better grades 8. Language affects how we organize information9. Culture can shape personality10. Racial discrimination has handicaps associated with it (epilogue)Everything listed above (published in 2008) has either been out there in scientific and pop literature for decades, is scientifically tenuous (10000 hours) or is something that Captain Obvious would state. Gladwell has nothing new to offer, let alone adding an argument to enrich the nature-nurture debate. He ends up trying to convolute it with poorly supported assertions.Part 1 broadly discusses about individuals, who indeed were exceptions. It was still pertinent to the title. In part 2, though, when he discusses the performance of Asians in mathematics or school kids taking California Assessment Battery – he is talking about averages and not outliers per se. Different cultures prepare you for different things - cultural anthropologists established that in the 50s. Rather than comparing westerners and Asians on math performance, he should have addressed the existence of outliers within the oriental culture. That would have made more sense. He lost track in my opinion.He makes sure that not one sentence is spared on confidence, motivation, temperament, personality dimensions, emotional regulation, self-esteem, self-efficacy, interests or learning/ perceptual styles! How did these factors play out in the lives of Gates, Joy or Jobs? Why are 80% of NBA players black? And why is not each one of them a LeBron, a Kobe or a Jordan? He skipped judgment and decision making too. Decisions such as how and where to put effort into could be a critical success factor. I spent 220 minutes on this book. I could have used that time elsewhere. I could have slept or perhaps worked to accumulate those 10000hrs in one of my crafts. Gladwell is not a psychologist; I should have known better. Drivel should have been expected. The only outlier that doesn’t deserve to be one is this book itself. He should write a book on how “Outliers”, a below average text, managed to get a 4+ rating on Goodreads. I gave a star only because of the chapter on ice hockey and the 50 page babble dedicated to pilot communication – which, like so many in this book, was a feeble argument to make for a correlation between cultural legacy and outliers."
63,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1291915-lauren,4,"There were some sections of this book that had me turning the pages so quickly starved for more information, and others that were a little dry. Gladwell has excellent observational skills, and I like his writing style. I enjoyed this book, much like I did with his others. I was particularly happy to see him open with stories about hockey players - as watching hockey is one of my favorite pastimes. However, I went to the NHL page and looked at the birthdays of several of my favorite Canadian players, and they did not seem to follow the same trend as noted in the book. The majority of players I saw were actually born in the summer or in the fall of the year, rather than early in the year. I am not sure what this means for Gladwell's observation, or if the Canadian leagues changed their age limits... I particularly liked the chapters in the middle/end referring to culture and authority figures, etc. in regards to the airline industry. Many times throughout, I found myself thinking ""huh, wow, that is interesting!"" "
64,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38544962-guy-austin,4,"I really did enjoy this. My daughter, a Junior in college, handed me this book. She has never done that before so I had to read it, Right? I probably would not have otherwise. I was very surprised how much I enjoyed it. It is well written and entertaining and at the same time informative and educational. Gladwell seems to have a way with drawing out unseen and seen ideas of successful people road to success. He helps his readers perceive familiar information in entirely new ways, a myth-buster if that is a word. In this he tackles the self-made man, pointing out that success stories are a lot more involved than the outside perception. Are the gifted truly gifted? An enlightening read. "
65,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58095391-michelle-scott,4,"As Americans, we tend to think of highly successful individuals, such as Bill Gates, as somehow making their fortunes because of their own innate skills and talents. In fact, we hold the ideal of the self-made man/woman in such high regard that we ignore the facts. In this book, Malcolm Gladwell examines the stories of several very successful people and comes up with some interesting conclusions. It isn't a spring of talent that gushes inside of these outliers, but a combination of hours of drudgery combined with some amazing good luck.The book is well-written and the examples are fascinating. What's lacking is the idea that any of these observations can be learning experiences for the rest of us."

67,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30327585-michael-broch,5,"Reading this book so soon after Atlas Shrugged was a lucky break, and gave voice to much I disagreed or was uncomfortable with concerning Ayn Rand’s philosophy—chiefly that selfishness is virtue. One of the best facets of Atlas Shrugged is its celebration of hard work, the individual human spirit, and achievement. Where it fails is its narrow view of an ideal society based on the value of hard work as purely “us” vs “them”, where those of ability are deified as “ self made men” and damn the rest as lazy, spoiled, or complacent. Malcolm Gladwell, with poignant examples and rational assessments, makes a tremendous case for a broader picture, one in which individual grit and tenacity are indeed a large part of success, but they are only one part. We ignore sociological, cultural, and empathetic factors which contribute to success at our own peril, and the peril of others. I am thankful for its calm and objective study of success to juxtapose with the often angry and callous portrayal of success and virtue which Ayn Rand paints in her opus."
68,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/106503484-connor-steckly,4,"Gladwell uses several independent, short historical stories to explain the underlying theme of success being attributed to the conditions and circumstances of the individual. Although all of his stories were very distinct from one another, the context provided to dig down to why someone became successful is remarkable and ties together very nicely. I absolutely recommend reading this book! "
69,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3633211-vikas,5,"Like the subtitle says it's the story of success and provides a wonderful study of successful people and hitting ground running by proving again and again that to be successful along with the person the support area and time period is as important to make sure that the person is successful. Mr. Gladwell takes example from different fields, Sports, Music, IT etc. and prove again and again that their success owed itself to lot of fortunate co-incidents and opportunities which they could utilize. In other words along with the talent these people were there at the right place on the right time and today these guys are Billionaires and superstars. Loved this wonderful book do read it and enjoy.People who don't read generally ask me my reasons for reading. Simply put I just love reading and so to that end I have made it my motto to just Keep on Reading. I love to read everything except for Self Help books but even those once in a while. I read almost all the genre but YA, Fantasy, Biographies are the most. My favorite series is of course Harry Potter but then there are many more books that I just adore. I have bookcases filled with books which are waiting to be read so can't stay and spend more time in this review, so remember I loved reading this and love reading more, you should also read what you love and then just Keep on Reading."
70,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73241274-alokita,3,"caution: a stream of consciousness review I would have been in more awe of this book had I read it at an earlier point in life. It would have been both inspiring and revealing, something that the Times says it is on the front cover. So I would urge people to read this as early as possible to gain the utmost out of this book.However, for me, there were no new revelations lets alone those revelations being inspiring. The beginning and the conclusion were obvious to anyone who had gone beyond the surface level worship of success stories. The entire book is based on the now known simple fact that there is nothing like a divine and unexpected success. It takes not only the effort of the individual but also his surrounding to cross the finish line before his/her participants.I did, however, find the process of anecdotal argumentation interesting and refreshing. There were a lot of interesting stories of how people have achieved what they have. It does a commendable work of shedding light on the less focused aspect of success, luck. There is a tendency to visualise success as made up of either only hard work or luck. Most success stories depend on a fruitful combination of both. In the case studies mentioned in the book, the luck aspect is defined as the cultural legacy of our family and society in combination with the conducive yet transformative eras.There were a lot of interconnections to be made that would contribute to the enjoyment of the book for me. The chapter on Rice Paddies and Maths had a personal connection to my own maths related issues while the chapter that talked about the feuds in the southern American regions in the first half of the nineteenth century helped me make retrospective sense of the subplot of the Grangerfords and Shepherdsons in The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain. The following points decreased its enjoyment factor for me:1. The book employs a very traditional sense of success in the book which is an economic and productive success. this creates a myopic view of success in life. Although the introductory chapter is an exception by talking about health success, the rest of the book measures success in terms of wealth and fame only. It would have been better to include inventors and discoverers too in the list. 2. This leads to an obvious gender gap visible in the success stories being mentioned that becomes even more prominent due to its very absence. I would have liked the book to address this issue like many others have done. 3. The research at some places seems either too obvious or too simplistic, making me lose confidence in the book. It also sounds instructional rather than inspiring at other places. To give this a positive spin, there are many areas that can be explored further by other people.In short, the book demystifies the success myth as being coincidental and situates it in hard work and cultural legacy of the individuals."
71,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793473-clif-hostetler,5,"This book shows that the stories about self made rugged individualists who are so widely admired are not stories of singularly talented people who took advantage of opportunities. But rather they are stories of talented people who took advantage of singular opportunities. Furthermore, the ability and disposition to work hard is not so much a personal trait as it is a cultural legacy. The author tells numerous true stories of what appears to be shining examples of disadvantaged people who ended up being outstanding success stories. But then the author goes back through the same story and takes a look at where that person came from and shows that they benefited from a combination of a cultural background and set of unique opportunities and timing that allowed them to succeed. The point of the book is not to explain away success stories. But rather it is to learn from these stories, and use this information to help everyone be more productive and successful. The author shows several instances where proactive steps were able to ameliorate the effect of negative cultural legacies.I found this book to be one of the most interesting non-fiction books that I've ever listened to. Some critics of this book have pointed out that the author, Malcolm Gladwell, didn't adhere to strict protocols in his interpretation of data. My response is that this book is for popular consumption, not the academic community. I'm confident that plenty of proper research and analysis will be performed prior to the implementation of major improvements to schools based on Gladwell's recommendations.The following is a copy of the review of this book review taken from the Jaunary 6, 2011 PageADay Book Lover's Calendar:THAT SWEET SMELLMalcolm Gladwell makes sense of yet another aspect of our world in this pleasantly readable account of success and the qualities that lead to it. The question he poses is, Why do the Bill Gateses and Mozarts of the world succeed so brilliantly, while others of the same intelligence and talent end up leading lives of quiet desperation? Using his method of combining the latest academic studies with the most relevant and irresistible stories, Gladwell makes his case that the “outliers” beneft from advantages and opportunities that pass others up. A stimulating read, to say the least.OUTLIERS: THE STORY OF SUCCESS, by Malcolm Gladwell (Little, Brown, 2008)"

And it’s entertaining.I wish I had read this years ago when my children were toddlers. I might have changed some things in how I raised them, not a lot of things, but some decisions might have been different. For example, I might have had them do more academic work in the summers, and felt less guilty about it. But aside from parenting, wow, this is fascinating stuff. The author is a good story teller. He takes an occurrence and analyzes and explains it in an insightful and entertaining way. Most of what he said made sense to me, and I believed him. But I wonder if other experts would have different views. I wonder if there are studies and statistics out there that might say yes this is true in these cases, but it doesn’t apply in all cases. I would have liked seeing arguments on both sides of some of the issues, for example affirmative action at the University of Michigan Law school. He made a statement but he didn’t provide much support for it. On the other hand, too many statistics and opposing views might have made this too dry, less entertaining.It’s a short book.Some of the content:It takes 10,000 hours of practice to become successful at something. It’s not being a genius, it’s practice.Luck is huge element toward success: when one is born, the influence of parents, and one’s culture.The best hockey players are born Jan to March. Geniuses born to poor parents do not do well because their parents don’t show them how to present themselves to the world and how to interact with others. In other words, geniuses need some “emotional IQ” to succeed, but the author doesn’t use that term. S. Korean airlines had more crashes than any other airline because of culture. Copilots were afraid to tell pilots about dangerous plane conditions, because it might sound disrespectful.NARRATOR:The author narrated this book.

73,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/957634-daniel-clausen,4,"It would be easy to fetishize individual greatness and success, but to do so would be a lie. Gladwell takes this simple point and broadens and deepens it with fantastic story-telling. It would be easy to give this book a five-star rating -- but I hesitate to do so. One of the reasons I hesitate is because I've been been duped before. When I was first learning about international affairs, I loved the work of Thomas Friedman. I thought he had a fantastic gift for story-telling and was a very astute observer of international trends. I still do think Friedman is an excellent journalist and popular nonfiction writer; however, as I read more deeply in International Relations, I learned that Thomas Friedman was actually popularizing research that had already been in circulation for a long time that was much richer and more fantastic than he admitted (especially in the International Relations subfield of complex interdependence and other IPE literature). On top of that, Friedman had the nerve to suggest that hedge fund managers were the most insightful observers of international affairs -- an insult that discards the very richness of the literary well that he draws from. For this reason, I have my suspicions about Gladwell's work. Surely, it's better for journalists to be aware of academic work than not to be aware of it. And it is certainly a virtue for work-a-day journalists to read broadly and think through problems like philosophers. But, I worry that like Friedman much of Gladwell's work may just be a popular nonfiction take of even deeper works on the same subject field. In addition, I also worry about the ""value-added"" of his work -- in other words, whether his work contributes something really new to the debate or whether he is just communicating several loosely connected points that were already available in the research. Like Friedman's work, I worry that what I'm reading -- though an entertaining and coherent story -- may be somewhat ""old hat"". Since I'm not a specialist on human development and learning, I can't make this judgment. But what I can say is that the book was a fantastic read (and a pretty quick one too!). "

I recommend it to absolutely everyone. It follows patterns of the human experience backed up by research, it provides data and context. I've seen it shelved as ""self-help"" multiple times, but in fact it's not really ""self-helpey"" at all. It takes examples of great success and great failure and examines it with cold-headed, hard-science, no-nonsense approach. There are absolutely 0 ""steps to success"" chapters, no instructions, no mantras, nothing of the kind. Having said that, the book was very liberating, inspiring and empowering to read. It makes me want to work and learn for 16 hours every day :) It also gave insights into some events in my own life and lives of my family members. Still don't believe it's awesome? Okay. I'll just say it focuses on all of the following:- world cultures - airplane pilots- Beatles- mathematicians and programmers- geniuses- middle-schoolersthe list goes on and on. This book is fire.

He effectively puts the kibosh on a myth that has particular resonance for Americans--that we make ourselves, that given the will and the work, anybody can be anything. But he doesn't leave it at that. If advantages are a product of culture, he proposes, then we can begin to give those advantages to more by changing the culture. His impassioned plea for a longer school year and a shorter summer vacation was eye-opening. The 'summer slump' well known to educators hits the kids from disadvantaged backgrounds the hardest. I have long felt that real learning is a result of slowing down and letting children discover how things work rather than ""teaching"" them the bullet points we have set as requirements for matriculation. When Gladwell quoted a teacher at a school with a longer academic year who said, ""It seems counterintuitive but we do things at a slower pace and as a result we get through a lot more,"" I stopped reading. And cheered. "

It's all about what made him successful beyond his own will and talent; some of the factors leading to success were bit unexpected such as a cultural legacy. Those ideas may bring some disappointment to the believers of heroic actions and dramatic rise in people's paths, but they make sense, a lot. This was one of the books which made me take a deep breath, walk around, jump several times, and go back to reading. (I really did, just saying this to express how I feel). The researches, studies, and cases included must been written and discussed for a long time; however, they might have been bit alien to the readers of nonscientific ground. Malcolm Gladwell made it sound so simple and meaningful. There was always a sort of feeling that I was product of my family's meticulous work of crafting my environment to study well and grow up healthy. Those are called the opportunities missed greatly in some others' lives. The successful people had their opportunities too, which can almost be called as sheer luck. There're many other explanations for these people; the stories are just great. It's a really good work of gathering lots of data and information and making a good use of them through insight and a skill of storyteller. "

In other words: pop psychology.This felt like even more pop psychology than Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking, which I somewhat enjoyed. But the same errors lay in this book, tenfold. Too much story-telling and not enough evidence. Switching from one scenario to the next without linking things together. Harping on the same point over and over again, without actually expounding upon it. Another review I saw pointed out that he ""infers causation from correlation"" and I totally see that here. It's like Gladwell once again took a topic that should have only been a magazine/journal article, and swelled it into a book.Not impressed. I might still read The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference some day, but that will probably be the last of Gladwell for me."
78,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1757741-kevin,5,"I picked up this book on a whim not knowing anything about it and was captivated by the subject and writing. Malcolm Gladwell explains in an academic yet simple way how seemingly ""self-made"" superstars in business, sports and life are actually the result of hard work, incredible opportunities, culture and timing. From Mozart to the Beatles to Bill Gates to hockey superstars he builds a case for this very theory. Surprisingly fun and a fast read, this book prompts much thought and discussion involving the secrets to success. Outliers is a book that you read out loud to anyone who is nearby (and will listen) and causes you to bring up these examples in conversation. I am not sure I have read a book recently that covers such a thought provoking ideas while reads so smoothly. Gladwell uses such relevant examples that you have a very easy time ""getting it"". I highly recommend this book and have already secured my copies of his other two similar books, Blink and Tipping Point. I highly enjoyed this!"
79,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,5," I know Gladwell gets a lot of hate these days. I guess he has fallen out of fashion. Anyway, I enjoyed this book that I read a decade or so ago. I don't know if his reputation will be recuperated but this book was interesting enough for me and the writing style wasn't bad. It kept my interest. He is accessible and shows interesting points in what makes for successful outliers. Decent nonfiction. I don't understand the hate."

83,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2729963-duffy-pratt,3,"Gladwell's basic argument is that people can't pull themselves up by their own bootstraps, and that everyone who is successful had some help, and some luck, along the way. Despite Rush Limbaugh's outrage earlier this year when Obama said pretty much the same thing, I don't think that this is a very challenging or distrubing idea. If that was all there was to it, I wouldn't have liked this book at all. But I did like it, mostly because I found quite a bit of fun in the details.What goes into success? First a person is given both a chance and an advantage. Gladwell points to selection bias when we choose kids for advancement amongst those in their age group. This almost always tends to give an advantage to the oldest children within the age group, because the selection process tends to confound maturity with talent. Seventy percent of Canadian professional hockey players are born in the first half of the year. Why? Because when the kids are young, the best kids born in a year are selected for a better league, with more practice time and better coaching. So they start off better because they are older, but quickly become much better because they are given time, attention and praise. The same results apply almost everywhere, and the effects can be seen in things like who goes to college, to even who is more likely to commit suicide. All of this because of some arbitrary line that we draw about age.This is a very interesting idea, but the basic idea behind it is quite simple and old. It's essentially a variation of Virginia Woolf's idea about Shakespeare's sister - equally talented as the bard, but never given a chance because of a basically irrelevant distinction.Next point is that it takes 10,000 hours to become an expert at anything. This is both an extremely powerful rule of thumb, and just plain wrong. Let's start with why its wrong. How long does it take to become an expert at slot machines? There's no answer because there's no such thing. Now how about tic-tac-toe. I haven't played for 10,000 hours, but I can pretty much guarantee that I will bring anyone to at least a tie in that game, no matter how much more experience they have. Some things defy expertise, and some other things are easy to master. But even in the middle ground, I don't think it's so obvious. Until very recently, the longbow was a superior weapon to a rifle/musket in almost every respect. It had a longer range, a better ability to pierce armor, a superior rate of fire. It was cheaper to construct and maintain. But it had a crippling disadvantage. It did actually take 10,000 hours to master the longbow. It took strength, co-ordination, and lots of practice. By contrast, it was possible to train infantry to shoot a rifle in a very short period of time. Thus, the rifle became the weapon of choice for armies because it was easier to master, not because it was better in other ways.The rule of thumb is powerful, however, because it gives an idea of how much practice and commitment is likely to be involved in learning any fulfilling job or hobby. The examples Gladwell gives are classical musician, composer, chess master, and then he asserts that each of his other success stories have also put in their 10,000. There are two caveats here. Even if it might take 10,000 hours to get good at something, that doesn't mean that putting in the hours means that you will get good. I was probably well on my way to my 10,000 in basketball by the time I graduated high school, and I was never going to be any better than an OK high school player. Other factors were involved (I was slow, but I couldn't jump.) The other thing, and its one that Gladwell doesn't mention. My acting teacher used to define talent as ""the ability to become involved."" In this context, what that means is that if you can devote 10,000 hours of practice and serious concentration to something, that fact alone shows a level of passion and commitment that other people lack. Gladwell makes quite a bit out of Bill Gate's extraordinary opportunities to be around computers before they were widely available. He doesn't make anywhere near as much of what Gates called his ""addiction"" to that computer time. The next element of success is a certain threshold level of ability. Here, Gladwell focuses on IQ, and makes the point that after a certain threshold, IQ tests predict nothing about a person's success. People with the highest IQs are no more likely to win Nobel prizes than others with a fairly high IQ. The same thing goes for SAT and law school entrance scores. Thus, for example, law school affirmative action students get lower scores on the LSAT, and tend to get slightly worse grades in school, but they do just as well as their contemporaries after they get out of school.Sprinkle on top of this a whole lot of luck, or fortuitous timing. The example that Gladwell uses is that about 15 of the 100 richest people in history were all born in the 1830s in the United States. Similarly, the most successful New York Jewish lawyers all tended to be born in the early 1930s. And if you wanted to get really rich in Silicon Valley, you probably needed to be born about 1955. He gives some pretty good arguments for why these things happened, but he also appears here, as well as with some of his other examples, to be cherry-picking the absolute best fits.I'd like to see what Gladwell has to make of the following: Mozart, Beethoven, Haydn, and Schubert were all from a very narrow geographical area, all Austrians, four of the greatest composers of all time. They all lived at very nearly the same time in Vienna. How does something like that happen? Out of all of history, how does so much greatness concentrate itself in both such a narrow area and timeframe? Another similar example: Jerome Kern, Irving Berlin, George Gershwin, Richard Rodgers are four of the towering giants of American songwriting: all of them are from New York City, born within 17 years of each other, and they were all Jewish. Again, how does something like this happen?This leads us to Gladwell's last point: cultural background matters. Gladwell tells a fascinating story of how Korean Air Lines had a rash of crashes. Basically, the reason for the crashes came because the flight crew were uniformly too deferential to the Captain. Planes are safer when an underling can say something like ""There's a mountain right in front of us."" or ""We're running dangerously low on fuel and need to land now."" But my guess is that there are strong cultural reasons that would explain the Vienna musicians, and the New York songwriters. I just don't know what they are.Gladwell also tries to connect the idea that Asian's being good at math with their rice farming. Apparently rice farming takes both a lot of work compared to other farming, and it also takes more thought and planning. This leads to a culture that strongly endorses the work ethic, which in turn leads to better math students. He also claims that these cultures have an advantage because their language more directly models the form of numbers than English and western languages. For example, where we say eleven, the Chinese say ten-one. And twenty-one is two-ten-one.There may be a point here, but I think its a shallow one. This is supposed to be a book about outliers and success stories. Here is an internet ranking of the greatest mathematicians of all time:http://fabpedigree.com/james/mathmen.... Five of the hundred are from China or Japan. None from the other rice growing areas of the world. This is nothing in comparison to the number of French and Germans on the list. Math isn't the kind of field where there would be a strong cultural bias. If the Chinese had been making great discoveries in math, there's no reason to think they wouldn't get credit for it. So, even though Gladwell might have explained why Asian kids get better scores on standardized math tests, that has little to do with the subject he actually said he was going to talk about. The greater question, for me at least, is if Asians are so good at math, why has there been so little development of mathematical knowledge coming out of Asia. In other words, if they are so good at math, why aren't they better mathematicians? I liked this book. I thought it was well written and fun to read. The examples were interesting, but too obviously cherry picked. Much of what's said here is driven home better in Taleb's Fooled by Randomness. But there were some surprising examples and studies that I had not heard before, and Gladwell has a style that makes things both simple and engaging. I would have liked it better if the central idea were a bit more startling, so as it is, it left me feeling that it's just a little slight."
84,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/217489-naeem,5,"Recent class discussions have allowed me to amend my previous rave by including a few criticisms. These I discuss at the end of the review. I have been calling people off the streets to have them listen to the CD version. The book brings out the fascist in me because I wish I could have everyone on the planet read it. Now, today. Why?First, Gladwell takes on the most pernicious, Mobey Dick of a myth: that genius belongs to and emerges from the individual; that such geniuses and self-made men as Carnegies, Mellons, Rockefellers, Mozarts, Beatles, Gates, and Jobs of this world show us that we can in fact ""pull ourselves up by our bootstraps."" You cannot take on such a myth by marshaling facts against it -- mostly you cannot feel facts. Gladwell shows us that such outliers are not outliers at all. What he shows us is how they are embedded within communities, within circumstances, within structures and cultures, within luck that provides them with extraordinary opportunity. He does not mean that they were not skilled or talented. Nor does he mean that they did not work extremely hard. They were and they did. But their skill and hard work were merely necessary, not sufficient conditions for their success. Without the historical circumstance, without the support of their community, without simple, plain, brute luck, their hard work and talent (like yours and mine) gets them no where. So boom! take that you beast of a myth. Second, hundreds and thousands of us make such arguments all day long, 'till we are blue faced, 'till we are weak-kneed and tired. What makes this book so powerful is the WAY Gladwell does it. He does with precise attention to historical context. And he does it with the skills of a fiction writer -- a good fiction writer, not Khaled Hosseini or Ann Patchett. He tells story after story, with the pace and drama of a detective novelist. He refers to social science of all types. But such references are but mere nails that pin down the edges of his sails so that they can capture the narrative energy and convince us that his argument is as moving as the summer breeze.Third, he moves from the cultural embeddedness of individuals in the first part of the book to the affect of culture and inter-generational legacies on individuals in the second part. And here is where the big pay-off is to be found. What does he show? I will tell you. But first let me share the frustration of someone who has been in the classroom for the last 22 years. What can social theory really teach us? Only one thing, I submit, of real importance. Namely that there are these forces, seemingly beyond our control, which make us their puppets, even as we proclaim our freedom, individuality, and self-determination. What forces? The sub-conscious, says Freud. The material effects that result from how a society reproduces itself, say the Scots of the Enlightenment and Marx. Society's compunctions, say Durkheim, Weber, and Giddens. Culture's secret instantiations within our bones and blood, say the anthropologists. The invisible straps of hundreds of past years, say the historians. In a word, structure. Structure is the only thing we teach, the only thing worth teaching. And, damn it, it is also the one thing we cannot seem to get across.Why cannot we get it across? Not because we don't work hard enough or don't have enough creativity. Mostly, because we underestimate the size of the the greatest myth of modernity, of westernization, of capitalism -- (a myth that both Adam Smith and Fredrich Hayek cop to as a deception, even if they call it necessary) the myth of the self-made man; the myth that there is an easy correlation between effort and reward. This myth makes a mockery of structure and and spits bile at teachers and therapists. We can't get structure across because there is a part of us that clings desperately to the myth. We want to believe.Gladwell's is a full out attack on our desire to cling to the myth. Here is what this book gets across: ""structure."" He is a sneaky one this Gladwell fellow. He does it with two brilliantly meshed techniques: a narrative flow that disarms you like only good fiction can, and with a clean, clear, deep understanding of the pervasive presence of ""structure.""I am dancing with joy at the prospect of trying out this book. Naturally, they will resist but that resistance will be oh so tortured. Malcolm Gladwell's fine, fine book will bring intense pressure to bare on our self-deceptions. Not to worry, all this academic stuff I am talking about makes no appearance on the stage of his manuscript. And yet, it is all there. All there. Not there and there, at once. Amendments and Criticisms:Recent class discussions allow me to add the following: Some have suggested that Gladwell's goal is a world where the opportunity to be successful is available to more people and perhaps to everyone. We waste tremendous talent and skill when only a few are given the chance to be successful. If so, he would seem to endorse the equation that correlates effort with reward, rather than to obliterate this equation. This means that Gladwell's purpose is, at best, liberal rather than radical and, at worse, he wants to reform meritocracy and thereby to sustain it. Further, Gladwell implies that the violation of his grandmother by a white man (his grandfather) is the ""gift"" that partly explains both his and his mother's outlier success. Perhaps Gladwell means to use the word ""gift"" ironically, or it could be that he means it. Hard to tell. Either way, his language usage retains a certain ambiguity, an ambiguity that reflects his reformist attitude towards meritocracy. I find myself agreeing with these criticisms. They expose Gladwell to greater searing scrutiny than I had originally managed. Yet, it can be the case that (1) books are smarter than their authors, and (2) books contain deep tensions within their themes. On the one hand, yes, Gladwell seems the liberal reformist. On the other hand, I remain impressed with how far Gladwell's ideas go towards obliterating the myth of meritocracy. Even if he is a reformist, I find his book quite radical.I think the book is smarter than him because it transcends his liberalism. It undermines the core of liberalism and of meritocracy by showing that results are not due to effort. Results are due to many thing -- cultural legacy, fortunate circumstances, systematic skewing of systems towards some people and away from others, and, of course, structure. Rewards are due to many things but not merely the result of effort. If we accept that society lies to us about the nature of effort (by no means an easy thing even after you read this book -- hard to undo a life long lie and and a lie we want to believe), this knowledge can lead us, as my colleague Sean would say, towards creating a ""beloved community."" We take care of each other because we are alive and proximate to each other, and this is enough for each of us to deserve intimate membership in beloved community.The entry cost of this beloved community? Giving up the notion that anything is or is not deserved. "

Gladwell here argues that success is tightly correlated with not only intelligence and hard work, but also opportunity, timing, and luck. He talks about why Asians are good at maths, the hidden lucky factors which made Bill Gates, Mozart, Steve Jobs, and other successful people who they are, the 10,000 hour rule, how background and social status affect the personality and success of people, and how The Beatles are not successful purely because of talent but rather because they had opportunities to practice for many hours in Germany, even though I was not fully convinced with that, since there are many bands and artists who made a name for themselves just as much as the Beatles if not more who didn’t have the same kind of opportunity, or did they? As a person who has grown up in Iraq, I have always felt that one of the most unfortunate aspects of life here is the lack of opportunities for people especially the young to explore, widen their horizons, and discover the kind of intelligence they have which will all contribute to their identity, self-actualization, and how they can put their efforts to make Iraq and the rest of the world a better place.I have thought about how corrupt the school system here is. Imagine Bill Gates, Mozart, Steve Jobs, and members from the Beatles being put from a young age at the same kind of environment that people here is Iraq are forced to put up with. Imagine forcing them to memorize tons of useless information and measure their success, self worth, identity, and future career based on how much they can memorize. Really unfortunate and a waste of potential!"

In one sentence the book can be summarized as - No man, woman or Canadian hockey player is an island. Extraordinary success is the result of an often-unlikely series of opportunities, lucky breaks, and occurrences that combine to create the precise conditions that allow such achievement."
89,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/308912-tucker,4,"Unlike most books on success, Gladwell isn't telling us how to become successful. He's describing who actually does attain success. Academic prowess is one important element. The route to success begins as early as ""birthday cut-offs"" for children entering kindergarten or joining sports teams. The older children are perceived as more talented, and their talent is praised and cultivated until, by the time they finish high school, they really have become more successful. At that point, the important difference is no longer their age, but the opportunities they received and the effort they put in. It is also helpful to be raised by parents who have the money and the interest to nurture their children's thinking skills after school and during vacations. Finally, it helps to grow up in a culture that values hard work and to have the opportunity to practice in one's area of interest. World-class musicians and computer programmers, for example, each put in about 10,000 hours of serious practice time before their gifts and their career trajectories become clear. These factors prove to have a far greater impact on an individual's test scores and academic success than his or her IQ.Another element of success is so-called ""practical intelligence,"" or knowing how to speak up and ask for what you want and need. Good communication skills with one's peers and superiors can help prevent accidents. It is useful to be raised by parents who engaged in meaningful work fueled by labor and innovation and to appreciate the reward that comes with that.And of course there is luck--having the good fortune to be 20 years old, with the business skills of an adult and the flexible mind of a young person, when a seismic technological shift such as the birth of railroads, petroleum, or computers occurs.After finishing the book, I was left with an aftertaste of the ""duh-factor"": of course hard work and luck influence one's chances at success. It didn't produce as much of a mental revolution in me as did his other book,  The Tipping Point. But Gladwell assembled some great anecdotes and mined them well."
90,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5015851-ms-pegasus,5,"OUTLIERS explores the idea of meritocracy with Gladwell's typical focus on aberrational patterns. He begins with an observation about the distribution of birthday months for a professional Canadian hockey team. There is a consistent skewing toward the earliest months in the year. Although he does not explore the probabilities in detail, this fact is especially astonishing since births by month are not evenly distributed, but in fact skewed toward the months in the second half of the year (https://blog.rjmetrics.com/2009/09/14... is one of many websites that cites this distribution). His explanation is persuasive, if not news to parents harboring hopes that their son will be the next Wayne Gretzky (incidentally, a Canadian born in January). Gladwell notes how a few months' advantage of maturity and physical development can reap life-long cumulative advantages: More confidence, more playing time, better coaching, more competitive opportunities, more encouragement.He then shifts his attention to a new thread. One connecting Bill Gates, Bill Joy (co-founder of Sun Microsystems), and The Beatles. This exploration leads him to the “10,000 Hour Rule,” a catchy phrase that has made its way into popular parlance. I was particularly impressed by his mention of Bobby Fischer in this context. Anyone who has read the biography ENDGAME by Frank Brady will find supporting material for Gladwell's ideas.Numerous critics have jumped on this generalization, arguing that it is an oversimplification when taken literally. Gladwell responds to these critics, emphasizing the spirit of his claim (http://www.businessinsider.com/malcol...). In case after case Gladwell poses a prediction based on intuitive ideas about how the world works. In case after case he demonstrates that intuitive ideas are unreliable. The alternative explanations he poses are persuasive, but more important, unexpected.The diversity of his examples make this an entertaining book. The second part of the book shifts gears into an area he calls “Cultural Legacies,” bundles of attitudes subconsciously reinforced through family histories. “Cultural legacies are powerful forces. They have deep roots and long lives. They persist, generation after generation, virtually intact, even as the economic and social and demographic conditions that spawned them have vanished, and they play such a role in directing attitudes and behavior that we cannot make sense of our world without them.” (p.175) The exploration takes Gladwell from Harlan County, Kentucky to South Korea. Between 1988 and 1998 the loss rate for United Airlines was .27/million departures. During the same period the loss rate for Korean Air was 4.79/million departures. (Imagine trying to get “Rainman” aboard a KAL flight!) Gladwell hastens to add that since 1999, KAL's record is spotless, the result of an astonishing turnaround in cockpit training. At its heart was confrontation of a cultural legacy problem — the hierarchical relationship and behaviors between the captain and his subordinates in the flight crew. This was, in fact, my favorite part of the book, and the factor that boosts my rating from 4 to 5 stars. His transcriptions of cockpit recordings are riveting, as each accident scenario unfolds. Readers who have occasion to deal with non-native English speakers, particularly in the software industry, will find ample food for thought.Gladwell's curiosity takes him to many other topics. He looks at the trait of persistence. He questions the role of language in the early mastery of number sense. He examines the effects of summer vacation on academic performance. His restless mind and energetic research stir up contradictions that force the reader to revisit intuitive explanations that are so tempting to grasp. His curiosity is infectious."
91,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/128745-malbadeen,4,"Love him or hate him - whatever. The more I read of his stuff the more I am fascinated by what he does. I think it is so interesting how we can make up a theory and pretty much ascribe all happenings around us as proof that that theory is correct. I do it all the time. My whole family does it, it's how we converse. I think more people do it than are willing to admit and if you read Gladwell with that in mind it is easier to not get so worked up about that fact that he is espousing ideas rather than writing doctoral dissertations that are intended to change the way the world functions. Personally I find myself arguing with/disagreeing with his stuff during a good portion of what he writes but I like arguing so find it mostly enjoyable. In this book Gladwell is attempting to support his belief that successful people are not ""self-made"" but rather the fortunate product of suitable circumstances. A slight variation on ""nature vs. nurture"" nothing new here. I mostly agree with the idea as it fits nicely with my more politically liberal sensibilities but there were several instances when I felt like his words were actually making the counter argument. Specifically in an extended portion about early Jewish immigrants. He seemed to be saying, ""lucky them, they happened to have the right skills at the right time"" while glossing over their relentless attempts to find their own niche.I also found the hairs on my neck raising when he talked about schools. I feel uncomfortable anytime people start suggesting that the solution to closing the achievement gap for the economically disadvantaged and advantaged is to take kids from their families for longer amounts of time. It is troublesome because it doesn't address the larger issue of social inequities on a larger scale and it starts with the presupposition that academic achievement is the pinnacle to which we should all strive to attain and it de-values the role families play in the upbringing of their children. All that being said, I realize this is one book, with one main point and not every conversation can/should end up with a march to the white house demanding social equity for all. But still....maybe just the tiniest nod to the larger issue would have been nice.I was also more than a little aware of the fact that while he attempted to be gracious to groups other than middle and upper class he would throw in statements like, ""....there aren't books lying around her house that she can read if she gets bored. There's *PROBABLY* just a television."" when talking about ""poor"" households and yet there were no ""probablies"" when he spoke about high income households. It was all definite statements of ""positive"" experiences. oh Malcolm. tsk. tsk.(if you've stayed with this ""review"" this long, you should send me your address so I can send you a dollar for your fortitude).So all in all I'd have to say: I disagreed with him a ton but I enjoyed the disagreements and, as always found his writing to be catchy and clever and all that good stuff.*******oh wait, oh wait! note to editors: proof of what a great service you do can be found in the Acknowledgments at the end of this book. I can only assume there is no editorial input for this part as Gladwell used the phrase ""as always"" 4 times on one 1/2 a page! Egads, bring in the editors!!! **********"

“Outliers aren’t outliers…. they are [what they are] not because of some exceptional or heroic individual action on their part but because of whole series of circumstances, environments and cultural legacies.”
 – Malcolm Gladwell in an interview.What is Gladwell essentially saying? He sums up the circumstantial, environmental and cultural reasons for being an outlier in the following ideas:1. Luck has its role to play2. Hard work and enough practice - 10000 hours – makes you good at almost anything 3. IQ doesn’t guarantee success. There exists a concept of IQ threshold. Psychological testing has its limitations4. Being born at the right place, right time helps5. Middle and higher class families typically provide better, nurturing home environments6. Disadvantaged groups have access to fewer opportunities7. If kids put more effort they could fetch better grades 8. Language affects how we organize information9. Culture can shape personality10. Racial discrimination has handicaps associated with it (epilogue)Everything listed above (published in 2008) has either been out there in scientific and pop literature for decades, is scientifically tenuous (10000 hours) or is something that Captain Obvious would state. Gladwell has nothing new to offer, let alone adding an argument to enrich the nature-nurture debate. He ends up trying to convolute it with poorly supported assertions.Part 1 broadly discusses about individuals, who indeed were exceptions. It was still pertinent to the title. In part 2, though, when he discusses the performance of Asians in mathematics or school kids taking California Assessment Battery – he is talking about averages and not outliers per se. Different cultures prepare you for different things - cultural anthropologists established that in the 50s. Rather than comparing westerners and Asians on math performance, he should have addressed the existence of outliers within the oriental culture. That would have made more sense. He lost track in my opinion.He makes sure that not one sentence is spared on confidence, motivation, temperament, personality dimensions, emotional regulation, self-esteem, self-efficacy, interests or learning/ perceptual styles! How did these factors play out in the lives of Gates, Joy or Jobs? Why are 80% of NBA players black? And why is not each one of them a LeBron, a Kobe or a Jordan? He skipped judgment and decision making too. Decisions such as how and where to put effort into could be a critical success factor. I spent 220 minutes on this book. I could have used that time elsewhere. I could have slept or perhaps worked to accumulate those 10000hrs in one of my crafts. Gladwell is not a psychologist; I should have known better. Drivel should have been expected. The only outlier that doesn’t deserve to be one is this book itself. He should write a book on how “Outliers”, a below average text, managed to get a 4+ rating on Goodreads. I gave a star only because of the chapter on ice hockey and the 50 page babble dedicated to pilot communication – which, like so many in this book, was a feeble argument to make for a correlation between cultural legacy and outliers."
93,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1291915-lauren,4,"There were some sections of this book that had me turning the pages so quickly starved for more information, and others that were a little dry. Gladwell has excellent observational skills, and I like his writing style. I enjoyed this book, much like I did with his others. I was particularly happy to see him open with stories about hockey players - as watching hockey is one of my favorite pastimes. However, I went to the NHL page and looked at the birthdays of several of my favorite Canadian players, and they did not seem to follow the same trend as noted in the book. The majority of players I saw were actually born in the summer or in the fall of the year, rather than early in the year. I am not sure what this means for Gladwell's observation, or if the Canadian leagues changed their age limits... I particularly liked the chapters in the middle/end referring to culture and authority figures, etc. in regards to the airline industry. Many times throughout, I found myself thinking ""huh, wow, that is interesting!"" "
94,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38544962-guy-austin,4,"I really did enjoy this. My daughter, a Junior in college, handed me this book. She has never done that before so I had to read it, Right? I probably would not have otherwise. I was very surprised how much I enjoyed it. It is well written and entertaining and at the same time informative and educational. Gladwell seems to have a way with drawing out unseen and seen ideas of successful people road to success. He helps his readers perceive familiar information in entirely new ways, a myth-buster if that is a word. In this he tackles the self-made man, pointing out that success stories are a lot more involved than the outside perception. Are the gifted truly gifted? An enlightening read. "
95,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58095391-michelle-scott,4,"As Americans, we tend to think of highly successful individuals, such as Bill Gates, as somehow making their fortunes because of their own innate skills and talents. In fact, we hold the ideal of the self-made man/woman in such high regard that we ignore the facts. In this book, Malcolm Gladwell examines the stories of several very successful people and comes up with some interesting conclusions. It isn't a spring of talent that gushes inside of these outliers, but a combination of hours of drudgery combined with some amazing good luck.The book is well-written and the examples are fascinating. What's lacking is the idea that any of these observations can be learning experiences for the rest of us."

97,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30327585-michael-broch,5,"Reading this book so soon after Atlas Shrugged was a lucky break, and gave voice to much I disagreed or was uncomfortable with concerning Ayn Rand’s philosophy—chiefly that selfishness is virtue. One of the best facets of Atlas Shrugged is its celebration of hard work, the individual human spirit, and achievement. Where it fails is its narrow view of an ideal society based on the value of hard work as purely “us” vs “them”, where those of ability are deified as “ self made men” and damn the rest as lazy, spoiled, or complacent. Malcolm Gladwell, with poignant examples and rational assessments, makes a tremendous case for a broader picture, one in which individual grit and tenacity are indeed a large part of success, but they are only one part. We ignore sociological, cultural, and empathetic factors which contribute to success at our own peril, and the peril of others. I am thankful for its calm and objective study of success to juxtapose with the often angry and callous portrayal of success and virtue which Ayn Rand paints in her opus."
98,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/106503484-connor-steckly,4,"Gladwell uses several independent, short historical stories to explain the underlying theme of success being attributed to the conditions and circumstances of the individual. Although all of his stories were very distinct from one another, the context provided to dig down to why someone became successful is remarkable and ties together very nicely. I absolutely recommend reading this book! "
99,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3633211-vikas,5,"Like the subtitle says it's the story of success and provides a wonderful study of successful people and hitting ground running by proving again and again that to be successful along with the person the support area and time period is as important to make sure that the person is successful. Mr. Gladwell takes example from different fields, Sports, Music, IT etc. and prove again and again that their success owed itself to lot of fortunate co-incidents and opportunities which they could utilize. In other words along with the talent these people were there at the right place on the right time and today these guys are Billionaires and superstars. Loved this wonderful book do read it and enjoy.People who don't read generally ask me my reasons for reading. Simply put I just love reading and so to that end I have made it my motto to just Keep on Reading. I love to read everything except for Self Help books but even those once in a while. I read almost all the genre but YA, Fantasy, Biographies are the most. My favorite series is of course Harry Potter but then there are many more books that I just adore. I have bookcases filled with books which are waiting to be read so can't stay and spend more time in this review, so remember I loved reading this and love reading more, you should also read what you love and then just Keep on Reading."

It would have been both inspiring and revealing, something that the Times says it is on the front cover. So I would urge people to read this as early as possible to gain the utmost out of this book.However, for me, there were no new revelations lets alone those revelations being inspiring. The beginning and the conclusion were obvious to anyone who had gone beyond the surface level worship of success stories. The entire book is based on the now known simple fact that there is nothing like a divine and unexpected success. It takes not only the effort of the individual but also his surrounding to cross the finish line before his/her participants.I did, however, find the process of anecdotal argumentation interesting and refreshing. There were a lot of interesting stories of how people have achieved what they have. It does a commendable work of shedding light on the less focused aspect of success, luck. There is a tendency to visualise success as made up of either only hard work or luck. Most success stories depend on a fruitful combination of both. In the case studies mentioned in the book, the luck aspect is defined as the cultural legacy of our family and society in combination with the conducive yet transformative eras.There were a lot of interconnections to be made that would contribute to the enjoyment of the book for me. The chapter on Rice Paddies and Maths had a personal connection to my own maths related issues while the chapter that talked about the feuds in the southern American regions in the first half of the nineteenth century helped me make retrospective sense of the subplot of the Grangerfords and Shepherdsons in The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain. The following points decreased its enjoyment factor for me:1. The book employs a very traditional sense of success in the book which is an economic and productive success. this creates a myopic view of success in life. Although the introductory chapter is an exception by talking about health success, the rest of the book measures success in terms of wealth and fame only. It would have been better to include inventors and discoverers too in the list. 2. This leads to an obvious gender gap visible in the success stories being mentioned that becomes even more prominent due to its very absence. I would have liked the book to address this issue like many others have done. 3. The research at some places seems either too obvious or too simplistic, making me lose confidence in the book. It also sounds instructional rather than inspiring at other places. To give this a positive spin, there are many areas that can be explored further by other people.In short, the book demystifies the success myth as being coincidental and situates it in hard work and cultural legacy of the individuals."
101,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793473-clif-hostetler,5,"This book shows that the stories about self made rugged individualists who are so widely admired are not stories of singularly talented people who took advantage of opportunities. But rather they are stories of talented people who took advantage of singular opportunities. Furthermore, the ability and disposition to work hard is not so much a personal trait as it is a cultural legacy. The author tells numerous true stories of what appears to be shining examples of disadvantaged people who ended up being outstanding success stories. But then the author goes back through the same story and takes a look at where that person came from and shows that they benefited from a combination of a cultural background and set of unique opportunities and timing that allowed them to succeed. The point of the book is not to explain away success stories. But rather it is to learn from these stories, and use this information to help everyone be more productive and successful. The author shows several instances where proactive steps were able to ameliorate the effect of negative cultural legacies.I found this book to be one of the most interesting non-fiction books that I've ever listened to. Some critics of this book have pointed out that the author, Malcolm Gladwell, didn't adhere to strict protocols in his interpretation of data. My response is that this book is for popular consumption, not the academic community. I'm confident that plenty of proper research and analysis will be performed prior to the implementation of major improvements to schools based on Gladwell's recommendations.The following is a copy of the review of this book review taken from the Jaunary 6, 2011 PageADay Book Lover's Calendar:THAT SWEET SMELLMalcolm Gladwell makes sense of yet another aspect of our world in this pleasantly readable account of success and the qualities that lead to it. The question he poses is, Why do the Bill Gateses and Mozarts of the world succeed so brilliantly, while others of the same intelligence and talent end up leading lives of quiet desperation? Using his method of combining the latest academic studies with the most relevant and irresistible stories, Gladwell makes his case that the “outliers” beneft from advantages and opportunities that pass others up. A stimulating read, to say the least.OUTLIERS: THE STORY OF SUCCESS, by Malcolm Gladwell (Little, Brown, 2008)"

And it’s entertaining.I wish I had read this years ago when my children were toddlers. I might have changed some things in how I raised them, not a lot of things, but some decisions might have been different. For example, I might have had them do more academic work in the summers, and felt less guilty about it. But aside from parenting, wow, this is fascinating stuff. The author is a good story teller. He takes an occurrence and analyzes and explains it in an insightful and entertaining way. Most of what he said made sense to me, and I believed him. But I wonder if other experts would have different views. I wonder if there are studies and statistics out there that might say yes this is true in these cases, but it doesn’t apply in all cases. I would have liked seeing arguments on both sides of some of the issues, for example affirmative action at the University of Michigan Law school. He made a statement but he didn’t provide much support for it. On the other hand, too many statistics and opposing views might have made this too dry, less entertaining.It’s a short book.Some of the content:It takes 10,000 hours of practice to become successful at something. It’s not being a genius, it’s practice.Luck is huge element toward success: when one is born, the influence of parents, and one’s culture.The best hockey players are born Jan to March. Geniuses born to poor parents do not do well because their parents don’t show them how to present themselves to the world and how to interact with others. In other words, geniuses need some “emotional IQ” to succeed, but the author doesn’t use that term. S. Korean airlines had more crashes than any other airline because of culture. Copilots were afraid to tell pilots about dangerous plane conditions, because it might sound disrespectful.NARRATOR:The author narrated this book.

103,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/957634-daniel-clausen,4,"It would be easy to fetishize individual greatness and success, but to do so would be a lie. Gladwell takes this simple point and broadens and deepens it with fantastic story-telling. It would be easy to give this book a five-star rating -- but I hesitate to do so. One of the reasons I hesitate is because I've been been duped before. When I was first learning about international affairs, I loved the work of Thomas Friedman. I thought he had a fantastic gift for story-telling and was a very astute observer of international trends. I still do think Friedman is an excellent journalist and popular nonfiction writer; however, as I read more deeply in International Relations, I learned that Thomas Friedman was actually popularizing research that had already been in circulation for a long time that was much richer and more fantastic than he admitted (especially in the International Relations subfield of complex interdependence and other IPE literature). On top of that, Friedman had the nerve to suggest that hedge fund managers were the most insightful observers of international affairs -- an insult that discards the very richness of the literary well that he draws from. For this reason, I have my suspicions about Gladwell's work. Surely, it's better for journalists to be aware of academic work than not to be aware of it. And it is certainly a virtue for work-a-day journalists to read broadly and think through problems like philosophers. But, I worry that like Friedman much of Gladwell's work may just be a popular nonfiction take of even deeper works on the same subject field. In addition, I also worry about the ""value-added"" of his work -- in other words, whether his work contributes something really new to the debate or whether he is just communicating several loosely connected points that were already available in the research. Like Friedman's work, I worry that what I'm reading -- though an entertaining and coherent story -- may be somewhat ""old hat"". Since I'm not a specialist on human development and learning, I can't make this judgment. But what I can say is that the book was a fantastic read (and a pretty quick one too!). "
104,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52500467-whatireallyread,5,"How I felt while reading ""Outliers"":How I feel after finishing ""Outliers"":Honestly, guys, this book is beyond awesome. I recommend it to absolutely everyone. It follows patterns of the human experience backed up by research, it provides data and context. I've seen it shelved as ""self-help"" multiple times, but in fact it's not really ""self-helpey"" at all. It takes examples of great success and great failure and examines it with cold-headed, hard-science, no-nonsense approach. There are absolutely 0 ""steps to success"" chapters, no instructions, no mantras, nothing of the kind. Having said that, the book was very liberating, inspiring and empowering to read. It makes me want to work and learn for 16 hours every day :) It also gave insights into some events in my own life and lives of my family members. Still don't believe it's awesome? Okay. I'll just say it focuses on all of the following:- world cultures - airplane pilots- Beatles- mathematicians and programmers- geniuses- middle-schoolersthe list goes on and on. This book is fire. This book is a ninja. Read this book.P.S. I definitely want to read more about the impact of cultural heritage and language on our everyday life. Any recs?"
105,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/757602-lars-guthrie,5,"Gladwell just gets better for me, going from a general topic of general interest--when a cultural trend takes hold ('The Tipping Point')--to a general topic with a more specific focus that factors into my work with children--the way the brain makes a value judgement ('Blink')--to a specific topic that specifically affects my work--how one's personal history and culture can determine success ('Outliers'). He effectively puts the kibosh on a myth that has particular resonance for Americans--that we make ourselves, that given the will and the work, anybody can be anything. But he doesn't leave it at that. If advantages are a product of culture, he proposes, then we can begin to give those advantages to more by changing the culture. His impassioned plea for a longer school year and a shorter summer vacation was eye-opening. The 'summer slump' well known to educators hits the kids from disadvantaged backgrounds the hardest. I have long felt that real learning is a result of slowing down and letting children discover how things work rather than ""teaching"" them the bullet points we have set as requirements for matriculation. When Gladwell quoted a teacher at a school with a longer academic year who said, ""It seems counterintuitive but we do things at a slower pace and as a result we get through a lot more,"" I stopped reading. And cheered. "
106,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2940271-undrakh,5,"This is not a story of how one hard-working and intelligent man reached to the top all by himself. It's all about what made him successful beyond his own will and talent; some of the factors leading to success were bit unexpected such as a cultural legacy. Those ideas may bring some disappointment to the believers of heroic actions and dramatic rise in people's paths, but they make sense, a lot. This was one of the books which made me take a deep breath, walk around, jump several times, and go back to reading. (I really did, just saying this to express how I feel). The researches, studies, and cases included must been written and discussed for a long time; however, they might have been bit alien to the readers of nonscientific ground. Malcolm Gladwell made it sound so simple and meaningful. There was always a sort of feeling that I was product of my family's meticulous work of crafting my environment to study well and grow up healthy. Those are called the opportunities missed greatly in some others' lives. The successful people had their opportunities too, which can almost be called as sheer luck. There're many other explanations for these people; the stories are just great. It's a really good work of gathering lots of data and information and making a good use of them through insight and a skill of storyteller. "

In other words: pop psychology.This felt like even more pop psychology than Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking, which I somewhat enjoyed. But the same errors lay in this book, tenfold. Too much story-telling and not enough evidence. Switching from one scenario to the next without linking things together. Harping on the same point over and over again, without actually expounding upon it. Another review I saw pointed out that he ""infers causation from correlation"" and I totally see that here. It's like Gladwell once again took a topic that should have only been a magazine/journal article, and swelled it into a book.Not impressed. I might still read The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference some day, but that will probably be the last of Gladwell for me."
108,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1757741-kevin,5,"I picked up this book on a whim not knowing anything about it and was captivated by the subject and writing. Malcolm Gladwell explains in an academic yet simple way how seemingly ""self-made"" superstars in business, sports and life are actually the result of hard work, incredible opportunities, culture and timing. From Mozart to the Beatles to Bill Gates to hockey superstars he builds a case for this very theory. Surprisingly fun and a fast read, this book prompts much thought and discussion involving the secrets to success. Outliers is a book that you read out loud to anyone who is nearby (and will listen) and causes you to bring up these examples in conversation. I am not sure I have read a book recently that covers such a thought provoking ideas while reads so smoothly. Gladwell uses such relevant examples that you have a very easy time ""getting it"". I highly recommend this book and have already secured my copies of his other two similar books, Blink and Tipping Point. I highly enjoyed this!"

Anyway, I enjoyed this book that I read a decade or so ago. I don't know if his reputation will be recuperated but this book was interesting enough for me and the writing style wasn't bad. It kept my interest. He is accessible and shows interesting points in what makes for successful outliers. Decent nonfiction. I don't understand the hate."

113,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2729963-duffy-pratt,3,"Gladwell's basic argument is that people can't pull themselves up by their own bootstraps, and that everyone who is successful had some help, and some luck, along the way. Despite Rush Limbaugh's outrage earlier this year when Obama said pretty much the same thing, I don't think that this is a very challenging or distrubing idea. If that was all there was to it, I wouldn't have liked this book at all. But I did like it, mostly because I found quite a bit of fun in the details.What goes into success? First a person is given both a chance and an advantage. Gladwell points to selection bias when we choose kids for advancement amongst those in their age group. This almost always tends to give an advantage to the oldest children within the age group, because the selection process tends to confound maturity with talent. Seventy percent of Canadian professional hockey players are born in the first half of the year. Why? Because when the kids are young, the best kids born in a year are selected for a better league, with more practice time and better coaching. So they start off better because they are older, but quickly become much better because they are given time, attention and praise. The same results apply almost everywhere, and the effects can be seen in things like who goes to college, to even who is more likely to commit suicide. All of this because of some arbitrary line that we draw about age.This is a very interesting idea, but the basic idea behind it is quite simple and old. It's essentially a variation of Virginia Woolf's idea about Shakespeare's sister - equally talented as the bard, but never given a chance because of a basically irrelevant distinction.Next point is that it takes 10,000 hours to become an expert at anything. This is both an extremely powerful rule of thumb, and just plain wrong. Let's start with why its wrong. How long does it take to become an expert at slot machines? There's no answer because there's no such thing. Now how about tic-tac-toe. I haven't played for 10,000 hours, but I can pretty much guarantee that I will bring anyone to at least a tie in that game, no matter how much more experience they have. Some things defy expertise, and some other things are easy to master. But even in the middle ground, I don't think it's so obvious. Until very recently, the longbow was a superior weapon to a rifle/musket in almost every respect. It had a longer range, a better ability to pierce armor, a superior rate of fire. It was cheaper to construct and maintain. But it had a crippling disadvantage. It did actually take 10,000 hours to master the longbow. It took strength, co-ordination, and lots of practice. By contrast, it was possible to train infantry to shoot a rifle in a very short period of time. Thus, the rifle became the weapon of choice for armies because it was easier to master, not because it was better in other ways.The rule of thumb is powerful, however, because it gives an idea of how much practice and commitment is likely to be involved in learning any fulfilling job or hobby. The examples Gladwell gives are classical musician, composer, chess master, and then he asserts that each of his other success stories have also put in their 10,000. There are two caveats here. Even if it might take 10,000 hours to get good at something, that doesn't mean that putting in the hours means that you will get good. I was probably well on my way to my 10,000 in basketball by the time I graduated high school, and I was never going to be any better than an OK high school player. Other factors were involved (I was slow, but I couldn't jump.) The other thing, and its one that Gladwell doesn't mention. My acting teacher used to define talent as ""the ability to become involved."" In this context, what that means is that if you can devote 10,000 hours of practice and serious concentration to something, that fact alone shows a level of passion and commitment that other people lack. Gladwell makes quite a bit out of Bill Gate's extraordinary opportunities to be around computers before they were widely available. He doesn't make anywhere near as much of what Gates called his ""addiction"" to that computer time. The next element of success is a certain threshold level of ability. Here, Gladwell focuses on IQ, and makes the point that after a certain threshold, IQ tests predict nothing about a person's success. People with the highest IQs are no more likely to win Nobel prizes than others with a fairly high IQ. The same thing goes for SAT and law school entrance scores. Thus, for example, law school affirmative action students get lower scores on the LSAT, and tend to get slightly worse grades in school, but they do just as well as their contemporaries after they get out of school.Sprinkle on top of this a whole lot of luck, or fortuitous timing. The example that Gladwell uses is that about 15 of the 100 richest people in history were all born in the 1830s in the United States. Similarly, the most successful New York Jewish lawyers all tended to be born in the early 1930s. And if you wanted to get really rich in Silicon Valley, you probably needed to be born about 1955. He gives some pretty good arguments for why these things happened, but he also appears here, as well as with some of his other examples, to be cherry-picking the absolute best fits.I'd like to see what Gladwell has to make of the following: Mozart, Beethoven, Haydn, and Schubert were all from a very narrow geographical area, all Austrians, four of the greatest composers of all time. They all lived at very nearly the same time in Vienna. How does something like that happen? Out of all of history, how does so much greatness concentrate itself in both such a narrow area and timeframe? Another similar example: Jerome Kern, Irving Berlin, George Gershwin, Richard Rodgers are four of the towering giants of American songwriting: all of them are from New York City, born within 17 years of each other, and they were all Jewish. Again, how does something like this happen?This leads us to Gladwell's last point: cultural background matters. Gladwell tells a fascinating story of how Korean Air Lines had a rash of crashes. Basically, the reason for the crashes came because the flight crew were uniformly too deferential to the Captain. Planes are safer when an underling can say something like ""There's a mountain right in front of us."" or ""We're running dangerously low on fuel and need to land now."" But my guess is that there are strong cultural reasons that would explain the Vienna musicians, and the New York songwriters. I just don't know what they are.Gladwell also tries to connect the idea that Asian's being good at math with their rice farming. Apparently rice farming takes both a lot of work compared to other farming, and it also takes more thought and planning. This leads to a culture that strongly endorses the work ethic, which in turn leads to better math students. He also claims that these cultures have an advantage because their language more directly models the form of numbers than English and western languages. For example, where we say eleven, the Chinese say ten-one. And twenty-one is two-ten-one.There may be a point here, but I think its a shallow one. This is supposed to be a book about outliers and success stories. Here is an internet ranking of the greatest mathematicians of all time:http://fabpedigree.com/james/mathmen.... Five of the hundred are from China or Japan. None from the other rice growing areas of the world. This is nothing in comparison to the number of French and Germans on the list. Math isn't the kind of field where there would be a strong cultural bias. If the Chinese had been making great discoveries in math, there's no reason to think they wouldn't get credit for it. So, even though Gladwell might have explained why Asian kids get better scores on standardized math tests, that has little to do with the subject he actually said he was going to talk about. The greater question, for me at least, is if Asians are so good at math, why has there been so little development of mathematical knowledge coming out of Asia. In other words, if they are so good at math, why aren't they better mathematicians? I liked this book. I thought it was well written and fun to read. The examples were interesting, but too obviously cherry picked. Much of what's said here is driven home better in Taleb's Fooled by Randomness. But there were some surprising examples and studies that I had not heard before, and Gladwell has a style that makes things both simple and engaging. I would have liked it better if the central idea were a bit more startling, so as it is, it left me feeling that it's just a little slight."
114,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/217489-naeem,5,"Recent class discussions have allowed me to amend my previous rave by including a few criticisms. These I discuss at the end of the review. I have been calling people off the streets to have them listen to the CD version. The book brings out the fascist in me because I wish I could have everyone on the planet read it. Now, today. Why?First, Gladwell takes on the most pernicious, Mobey Dick of a myth: that genius belongs to and emerges from the individual; that such geniuses and self-made men as Carnegies, Mellons, Rockefellers, Mozarts, Beatles, Gates, and Jobs of this world show us that we can in fact ""pull ourselves up by our bootstraps."" You cannot take on such a myth by marshaling facts against it -- mostly you cannot feel facts. Gladwell shows us that such outliers are not outliers at all. What he shows us is how they are embedded within communities, within circumstances, within structures and cultures, within luck that provides them with extraordinary opportunity. He does not mean that they were not skilled or talented. Nor does he mean that they did not work extremely hard. They were and they did. But their skill and hard work were merely necessary, not sufficient conditions for their success. Without the historical circumstance, without the support of their community, without simple, plain, brute luck, their hard work and talent (like yours and mine) gets them no where. So boom! take that you beast of a myth. Second, hundreds and thousands of us make such arguments all day long, 'till we are blue faced, 'till we are weak-kneed and tired. What makes this book so powerful is the WAY Gladwell does it. He does with precise attention to historical context. And he does it with the skills of a fiction writer -- a good fiction writer, not Khaled Hosseini or Ann Patchett. He tells story after story, with the pace and drama of a detective novelist. He refers to social science of all types. But such references are but mere nails that pin down the edges of his sails so that they can capture the narrative energy and convince us that his argument is as moving as the summer breeze.Third, he moves from the cultural embeddedness of individuals in the first part of the book to the affect of culture and inter-generational legacies on individuals in the second part. And here is where the big pay-off is to be found. What does he show? I will tell you. But first let me share the frustration of someone who has been in the classroom for the last 22 years. What can social theory really teach us? Only one thing, I submit, of real importance. Namely that there are these forces, seemingly beyond our control, which make us their puppets, even as we proclaim our freedom, individuality, and self-determination. What forces? The sub-conscious, says Freud. The material effects that result from how a society reproduces itself, say the Scots of the Enlightenment and Marx. Society's compunctions, say Durkheim, Weber, and Giddens. Culture's secret instantiations within our bones and blood, say the anthropologists. The invisible straps of hundreds of past years, say the historians. In a word, structure. Structure is the only thing we teach, the only thing worth teaching. And, damn it, it is also the one thing we cannot seem to get across.Why cannot we get it across? Not because we don't work hard enough or don't have enough creativity. Mostly, because we underestimate the size of the the greatest myth of modernity, of westernization, of capitalism -- (a myth that both Adam Smith and Fredrich Hayek cop to as a deception, even if they call it necessary) the myth of the self-made man; the myth that there is an easy correlation between effort and reward. This myth makes a mockery of structure and and spits bile at teachers and therapists. We can't get structure across because there is a part of us that clings desperately to the myth. We want to believe.Gladwell's is a full out attack on our desire to cling to the myth. Here is what this book gets across: ""structure."" He is a sneaky one this Gladwell fellow. He does it with two brilliantly meshed techniques: a narrative flow that disarms you like only good fiction can, and with a clean, clear, deep understanding of the pervasive presence of ""structure.""I am dancing with joy at the prospect of trying out this book. Naturally, they will resist but that resistance will be oh so tortured. Malcolm Gladwell's fine, fine book will bring intense pressure to bare on our self-deceptions. Not to worry, all this academic stuff I am talking about makes no appearance on the stage of his manuscript. And yet, it is all there. All there. Not there and there, at once. Amendments and Criticisms:Recent class discussions allow me to add the following: Some have suggested that Gladwell's goal is a world where the opportunity to be successful is available to more people and perhaps to everyone. We waste tremendous talent and skill when only a few are given the chance to be successful. If so, he would seem to endorse the equation that correlates effort with reward, rather than to obliterate this equation. This means that Gladwell's purpose is, at best, liberal rather than radical and, at worse, he wants to reform meritocracy and thereby to sustain it. Further, Gladwell implies that the violation of his grandmother by a white man (his grandfather) is the ""gift"" that partly explains both his and his mother's outlier success. Perhaps Gladwell means to use the word ""gift"" ironically, or it could be that he means it. Hard to tell. Either way, his language usage retains a certain ambiguity, an ambiguity that reflects his reformist attitude towards meritocracy. I find myself agreeing with these criticisms. They expose Gladwell to greater searing scrutiny than I had originally managed. Yet, it can be the case that (1) books are smarter than their authors, and (2) books contain deep tensions within their themes. On the one hand, yes, Gladwell seems the liberal reformist. On the other hand, I remain impressed with how far Gladwell's ideas go towards obliterating the myth of meritocracy. Even if he is a reformist, I find his book quite radical.I think the book is smarter than him because it transcends his liberalism. It undermines the core of liberalism and of meritocracy by showing that results are not due to effort. Results are due to many thing -- cultural legacy, fortunate circumstances, systematic skewing of systems towards some people and away from others, and, of course, structure. Rewards are due to many things but not merely the result of effort. If we accept that society lies to us about the nature of effort (by no means an easy thing even after you read this book -- hard to undo a life long lie and and a lie we want to believe), this knowledge can lead us, as my colleague Sean would say, towards creating a ""beloved community."" We take care of each other because we are alive and proximate to each other, and this is enough for each of us to deserve intimate membership in beloved community.The entry cost of this beloved community? Giving up the notion that anything is or is not deserved. "

Gladwell here argues that success is tightly correlated with not only intelligence and hard work, but also opportunity, timing, and luck. He talks about why Asians are good at maths, the hidden lucky factors which made Bill Gates, Mozart, Steve Jobs, and other successful people who they are, the 10,000 hour rule, how background and social status affect the personality and success of people, and how The Beatles are not successful purely because of talent but rather because they had opportunities to practice for many hours in Germany, even though I was not fully convinced with that, since there are many bands and artists who made a name for themselves just as much as the Beatles if not more who didn’t have the same kind of opportunity, or did they? As a person who has grown up in Iraq, I have always felt that one of the most unfortunate aspects of life here is the lack of opportunities for people especially the young to explore, widen their horizons, and discover the kind of intelligence they have which will all contribute to their identity, self-actualization, and how they can put their efforts to make Iraq and the rest of the world a better place.I have thought about how corrupt the school system here is. Imagine Bill Gates, Mozart, Steve Jobs, and members from the Beatles being put from a young age at the same kind of environment that people here is Iraq are forced to put up with. Imagine forcing them to memorize tons of useless information and measure their success, self worth, identity, and future career based on how much they can memorize. Really unfortunate and a waste of potential!"

This book brings forward the idea that success does not just rely on an individual's efforts but also the opportunities provided to them by society. Withstanding years and years of work, put in by the ancestors, to place their children in a position where they can become ""outliers""."
117,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28781546-ana,3,"So this is where the the ""10,000-Hour Rule"" thing comes from. Interesting..."
118,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39637934-randomdots,5,"Read Gladwell for the first time and now I know why he is so highly rated. In one sentence the book can be summarized as - No man, woman or Canadian hockey player is an island. Extraordinary success is the result of an often-unlikely series of opportunities, lucky breaks, and occurrences that combine to create the precise conditions that allow such achievement."
119,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/308912-tucker,4,"Unlike most books on success, Gladwell isn't telling us how to become successful. He's describing who actually does attain success. Academic prowess is one important element. The route to success begins as early as ""birthday cut-offs"" for children entering kindergarten or joining sports teams. The older children are perceived as more talented, and their talent is praised and cultivated until, by the time they finish high school, they really have become more successful. At that point, the important difference is no longer their age, but the opportunities they received and the effort they put in. It is also helpful to be raised by parents who have the money and the interest to nurture their children's thinking skills after school and during vacations. Finally, it helps to grow up in a culture that values hard work and to have the opportunity to practice in one's area of interest. World-class musicians and computer programmers, for example, each put in about 10,000 hours of serious practice time before their gifts and their career trajectories become clear. These factors prove to have a far greater impact on an individual's test scores and academic success than his or her IQ.Another element of success is so-called ""practical intelligence,"" or knowing how to speak up and ask for what you want and need. Good communication skills with one's peers and superiors can help prevent accidents. It is useful to be raised by parents who engaged in meaningful work fueled by labor and innovation and to appreciate the reward that comes with that.And of course there is luck--having the good fortune to be 20 years old, with the business skills of an adult and the flexible mind of a young person, when a seismic technological shift such as the birth of railroads, petroleum, or computers occurs.After finishing the book, I was left with an aftertaste of the ""duh-factor"": of course hard work and luck influence one's chances at success. It didn't produce as much of a mental revolution in me as did his other book,  The Tipping Point. But Gladwell assembled some great anecdotes and mined them well."
120,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5015851-ms-pegasus,5,"OUTLIERS explores the idea of meritocracy with Gladwell's typical focus on aberrational patterns. He begins with an observation about the distribution of birthday months for a professional Canadian hockey team. There is a consistent skewing toward the earliest months in the year. Although he does not explore the probabilities in detail, this fact is especially astonishing since births by month are not evenly distributed, but in fact skewed toward the months in the second half of the year (https://blog.rjmetrics.com/2009/09/14... is one of many websites that cites this distribution). His explanation is persuasive, if not news to parents harboring hopes that their son will be the next Wayne Gretzky (incidentally, a Canadian born in January). Gladwell notes how a few months' advantage of maturity and physical development can reap life-long cumulative advantages: More confidence, more playing time, better coaching, more competitive opportunities, more encouragement.He then shifts his attention to a new thread. One connecting Bill Gates, Bill Joy (co-founder of Sun Microsystems), and The Beatles. This exploration leads him to the “10,000 Hour Rule,” a catchy phrase that has made its way into popular parlance. I was particularly impressed by his mention of Bobby Fischer in this context. Anyone who has read the biography ENDGAME by Frank Brady will find supporting material for Gladwell's ideas.Numerous critics have jumped on this generalization, arguing that it is an oversimplification when taken literally. Gladwell responds to these critics, emphasizing the spirit of his claim (http://www.businessinsider.com/malcol...). In case after case Gladwell poses a prediction based on intuitive ideas about how the world works. In case after case he demonstrates that intuitive ideas are unreliable. The alternative explanations he poses are persuasive, but more important, unexpected.The diversity of his examples make this an entertaining book. The second part of the book shifts gears into an area he calls “Cultural Legacies,” bundles of attitudes subconsciously reinforced through family histories. “Cultural legacies are powerful forces. They have deep roots and long lives. They persist, generation after generation, virtually intact, even as the economic and social and demographic conditions that spawned them have vanished, and they play such a role in directing attitudes and behavior that we cannot make sense of our world without them.” (p.175) The exploration takes Gladwell from Harlan County, Kentucky to South Korea. Between 1988 and 1998 the loss rate for United Airlines was .27/million departures. During the same period the loss rate for Korean Air was 4.79/million departures. (Imagine trying to get “Rainman” aboard a KAL flight!) Gladwell hastens to add that since 1999, KAL's record is spotless, the result of an astonishing turnaround in cockpit training. At its heart was confrontation of a cultural legacy problem — the hierarchical relationship and behaviors between the captain and his subordinates in the flight crew. This was, in fact, my favorite part of the book, and the factor that boosts my rating from 4 to 5 stars. His transcriptions of cockpit recordings are riveting, as each accident scenario unfolds. Readers who have occasion to deal with non-native English speakers, particularly in the software industry, will find ample food for thought.Gladwell's curiosity takes him to many other topics. He looks at the trait of persistence. He questions the role of language in the early mastery of number sense. He examines the effects of summer vacation on academic performance. His restless mind and energetic research stir up contradictions that force the reader to revisit intuitive explanations that are so tempting to grasp. His curiosity is infectious."
121,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/128745-malbadeen,4,"Love him or hate him - whatever. The more I read of his stuff the more I am fascinated by what he does. I think it is so interesting how we can make up a theory and pretty much ascribe all happenings around us as proof that that theory is correct. I do it all the time. My whole family does it, it's how we converse. I think more people do it than are willing to admit and if you read Gladwell with that in mind it is easier to not get so worked up about that fact that he is espousing ideas rather than writing doctoral dissertations that are intended to change the way the world functions. Personally I find myself arguing with/disagreeing with his stuff during a good portion of what he writes but I like arguing so find it mostly enjoyable. In this book Gladwell is attempting to support his belief that successful people are not ""self-made"" but rather the fortunate product of suitable circumstances. A slight variation on ""nature vs. nurture"" nothing new here. I mostly agree with the idea as it fits nicely with my more politically liberal sensibilities but there were several instances when I felt like his words were actually making the counter argument. Specifically in an extended portion about early Jewish immigrants. He seemed to be saying, ""lucky them, they happened to have the right skills at the right time"" while glossing over their relentless attempts to find their own niche.I also found the hairs on my neck raising when he talked about schools. I feel uncomfortable anytime people start suggesting that the solution to closing the achievement gap for the economically disadvantaged and advantaged is to take kids from their families for longer amounts of time. It is troublesome because it doesn't address the larger issue of social inequities on a larger scale and it starts with the presupposition that academic achievement is the pinnacle to which we should all strive to attain and it de-values the role families play in the upbringing of their children. All that being said, I realize this is one book, with one main point and not every conversation can/should end up with a march to the white house demanding social equity for all. But still....maybe just the tiniest nod to the larger issue would have been nice.I was also more than a little aware of the fact that while he attempted to be gracious to groups other than middle and upper class he would throw in statements like, ""....there aren't books lying around her house that she can read if she gets bored. There's *PROBABLY* just a television."" when talking about ""poor"" households and yet there were no ""probablies"" when he spoke about high income households. It was all definite statements of ""positive"" experiences. oh Malcolm. tsk. tsk.(if you've stayed with this ""review"" this long, you should send me your address so I can send you a dollar for your fortitude).So all in all I'd have to say: I disagreed with him a ton but I enjoyed the disagreements and, as always found his writing to be catchy and clever and all that good stuff.*******oh wait, oh wait! note to editors: proof of what a great service you do can be found in the Acknowledgments at the end of this book. I can only assume there is no editorial input for this part as Gladwell used the phrase ""as always"" 4 times on one 1/2 a page! Egads, bring in the editors!!! **********"

“Outliers aren’t outliers…. they are [what they are] not because of some exceptional or heroic individual action on their part but because of whole series of circumstances, environments and cultural legacies.”
 – Malcolm Gladwell in an interview.What is Gladwell essentially saying? He sums up the circumstantial, environmental and cultural reasons for being an outlier in the following ideas:1. Luck has its role to play2. Hard work and enough practice - 10000 hours – makes you good at almost anything 3. IQ doesn’t guarantee success. There exists a concept of IQ threshold. Psychological testing has its limitations4. Being born at the right place, right time helps5. Middle and higher class families typically provide better, nurturing home environments6. Disadvantaged groups have access to fewer opportunities7. If kids put more effort they could fetch better grades 8. Language affects how we organize information9. Culture can shape personality10. Racial discrimination has handicaps associated with it (epilogue)Everything listed above (published in 2008) has either been out there in scientific and pop literature for decades, is scientifically tenuous (10000 hours) or is something that Captain Obvious would state. Gladwell has nothing new to offer, let alone adding an argument to enrich the nature-nurture debate. He ends up trying to convolute it with poorly supported assertions.Part 1 broadly discusses about individuals, who indeed were exceptions. It was still pertinent to the title. In part 2, though, when he discusses the performance of Asians in mathematics or school kids taking California Assessment Battery – he is talking about averages and not outliers per se. Different cultures prepare you for different things - cultural anthropologists established that in the 50s. Rather than comparing westerners and Asians on math performance, he should have addressed the existence of outliers within the oriental culture. That would have made more sense. He lost track in my opinion.He makes sure that not one sentence is spared on confidence, motivation, temperament, personality dimensions, emotional regulation, self-esteem, self-efficacy, interests or learning/ perceptual styles! How did these factors play out in the lives of Gates, Joy or Jobs? Why are 80% of NBA players black? And why is not each one of them a LeBron, a Kobe or a Jordan? He skipped judgment and decision making too. Decisions such as how and where to put effort into could be a critical success factor. I spent 220 minutes on this book. I could have used that time elsewhere. I could have slept or perhaps worked to accumulate those 10000hrs in one of my crafts. Gladwell is not a psychologist; I should have known better. Drivel should have been expected. The only outlier that doesn’t deserve to be one is this book itself. He should write a book on how “Outliers”, a below average text, managed to get a 4+ rating on Goodreads. I gave a star only because of the chapter on ice hockey and the 50 page babble dedicated to pilot communication – which, like so many in this book, was a feeble argument to make for a correlation between cultural legacy and outliers."
123,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1291915-lauren,4,"There were some sections of this book that had me turning the pages so quickly starved for more information, and others that were a little dry. Gladwell has excellent observational skills, and I like his writing style. I enjoyed this book, much like I did with his others. I was particularly happy to see him open with stories about hockey players - as watching hockey is one of my favorite pastimes. However, I went to the NHL page and looked at the birthdays of several of my favorite Canadian players, and they did not seem to follow the same trend as noted in the book. The majority of players I saw were actually born in the summer or in the fall of the year, rather than early in the year. I am not sure what this means for Gladwell's observation, or if the Canadian leagues changed their age limits... I particularly liked the chapters in the middle/end referring to culture and authority figures, etc. in regards to the airline industry. Many times throughout, I found myself thinking ""huh, wow, that is interesting!"" "

She has never done that before so I had to read it, Right? I probably would not have otherwise. I was very surprised how much I enjoyed it. It is well written and entertaining and at the same time informative and educational. Gladwell seems to have a way with drawing out unseen and seen ideas of successful people road to success. He helps his readers perceive familiar information in entirely new ways, a myth-buster if that is a word. In this he tackles the self-made man, pointing out that success stories are a lot more involved than the outside perception. Are the gifted truly gifted? An enlightening read. "
125,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58095391-michelle-scott,4,"As Americans, we tend to think of highly successful individuals, such as Bill Gates, as somehow making their fortunes because of their own innate skills and talents. In fact, we hold the ideal of the self-made man/woman in such high regard that we ignore the facts. In this book, Malcolm Gladwell examines the stories of several very successful people and comes up with some interesting conclusions. It isn't a spring of talent that gushes inside of these outliers, but a combination of hours of drudgery combined with some amazing good luck.The book is well-written and the examples are fascinating. What's lacking is the idea that any of these observations can be learning experiences for the rest of us."

One of the best facets of Atlas Shrugged is its celebration of hard work, the individual human spirit, and achievement. Where it fails is its narrow view of an ideal society based on the value of hard work as purely “us” vs “them”, where those of ability are deified as “ self made men” and damn the rest as lazy, spoiled, or complacent. Malcolm Gladwell, with poignant examples and rational assessments, makes a tremendous case for a broader picture, one in which individual grit and tenacity are indeed a large part of success, but they are only one part. We ignore sociological, cultural, and empathetic factors which contribute to success at our own peril, and the peril of others. I am thankful for its calm and objective study of success to juxtapose with the often angry and callous portrayal of success and virtue which Ayn Rand paints in her opus."
128,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/106503484-connor-steckly,4,"Gladwell uses several independent, short historical stories to explain the underlying theme of success being attributed to the conditions and circumstances of the individual. Although all of his stories were very distinct from one another, the context provided to dig down to why someone became successful is remarkable and ties together very nicely. I absolutely recommend reading this book! "
129,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3633211-vikas,5,"Like the subtitle says it's the story of success and provides a wonderful study of successful people and hitting ground running by proving again and again that to be successful along with the person the support area and time period is as important to make sure that the person is successful. Mr. Gladwell takes example from different fields, Sports, Music, IT etc. and prove again and again that their success owed itself to lot of fortunate co-incidents and opportunities which they could utilize. In other words along with the talent these people were there at the right place on the right time and today these guys are Billionaires and superstars. Loved this wonderful book do read it and enjoy.People who don't read generally ask me my reasons for reading. Simply put I just love reading and so to that end I have made it my motto to just Keep on Reading. I love to read everything except for Self Help books but even those once in a while. I read almost all the genre but YA, Fantasy, Biographies are the most. My favorite series is of course Harry Potter but then there are many more books that I just adore. I have bookcases filled with books which are waiting to be read so can't stay and spend more time in this review, so remember I loved reading this and love reading more, you should also read what you love and then just Keep on Reading."

It would have been both inspiring and revealing, something that the Times says it is on the front cover. So I would urge people to read this as early as possible to gain the utmost out of this book.However, for me, there were no new revelations lets alone those revelations being inspiring. The beginning and the conclusion were obvious to anyone who had gone beyond the surface level worship of success stories. The entire book is based on the now known simple fact that there is nothing like a divine and unexpected success. It takes not only the effort of the individual but also his surrounding to cross the finish line before his/her participants.I did, however, find the process of anecdotal argumentation interesting and refreshing. There were a lot of interesting stories of how people have achieved what they have. It does a commendable work of shedding light on the less focused aspect of success, luck. There is a tendency to visualise success as made up of either only hard work or luck. Most success stories depend on a fruitful combination of both. In the case studies mentioned in the book, the luck aspect is defined as the cultural legacy of our family and society in combination with the conducive yet transformative eras.There were a lot of interconnections to be made that would contribute to the enjoyment of the book for me. The chapter on Rice Paddies and Maths had a personal connection to my own maths related issues while the chapter that talked about the feuds in the southern American regions in the first half of the nineteenth century helped me make retrospective sense of the subplot of the Grangerfords and Shepherdsons in The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain. The following points decreased its enjoyment factor for me:1. The book employs a very traditional sense of success in the book which is an economic and productive success. this creates a myopic view of success in life. Although the introductory chapter is an exception by talking about health success, the rest of the book measures success in terms of wealth and fame only. It would have been better to include inventors and discoverers too in the list. 2. This leads to an obvious gender gap visible in the success stories being mentioned that becomes even more prominent due to its very absence. I would have liked the book to address this issue like many others have done. 3. The research at some places seems either too obvious or too simplistic, making me lose confidence in the book. It also sounds instructional rather than inspiring at other places. To give this a positive spin, there are many areas that can be explored further by other people.In short, the book demystifies the success myth as being coincidental and situates it in hard work and cultural legacy of the individuals."
131,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793473-clif-hostetler,5,"This book shows that the stories about self made rugged individualists who are so widely admired are not stories of singularly talented people who took advantage of opportunities. But rather they are stories of talented people who took advantage of singular opportunities. Furthermore, the ability and disposition to work hard is not so much a personal trait as it is a cultural legacy. The author tells numerous true stories of what appears to be shining examples of disadvantaged people who ended up being outstanding success stories. But then the author goes back through the same story and takes a look at where that person came from and shows that they benefited from a combination of a cultural background and set of unique opportunities and timing that allowed them to succeed. The point of the book is not to explain away success stories. But rather it is to learn from these stories, and use this information to help everyone be more productive and successful. The author shows several instances where proactive steps were able to ameliorate the effect of negative cultural legacies.I found this book to be one of the most interesting non-fiction books that I've ever listened to. Some critics of this book have pointed out that the author, Malcolm Gladwell, didn't adhere to strict protocols in his interpretation of data. My response is that this book is for popular consumption, not the academic community. I'm confident that plenty of proper research and analysis will be performed prior to the implementation of major improvements to schools based on Gladwell's recommendations.The following is a copy of the review of this book review taken from the Jaunary 6, 2011 PageADay Book Lover's Calendar:THAT SWEET SMELLMalcolm Gladwell makes sense of yet another aspect of our world in this pleasantly readable account of success and the qualities that lead to it. The question he poses is, Why do the Bill Gateses and Mozarts of the world succeed so brilliantly, while others of the same intelligence and talent end up leading lives of quiet desperation? Using his method of combining the latest academic studies with the most relevant and irresistible stories, Gladwell makes his case that the “outliers” beneft from advantages and opportunities that pass others up. A stimulating read, to say the least.OUTLIERS: THE STORY OF SUCCESS, by Malcolm Gladwell (Little, Brown, 2008)"

And it’s entertaining.I wish I had read this years ago when my children were toddlers. I might have changed some things in how I raised them, not a lot of things, but some decisions might have been different. For example, I might have had them do more academic work in the summers, and felt less guilty about it. But aside from parenting, wow, this is fascinating stuff. The author is a good story teller. He takes an occurrence and analyzes and explains it in an insightful and entertaining way. Most of what he said made sense to me, and I believed him. But I wonder if other experts would have different views. I wonder if there are studies and statistics out there that might say yes this is true in these cases, but it doesn’t apply in all cases. I would have liked seeing arguments on both sides of some of the issues, for example affirmative action at the University of Michigan Law school. He made a statement but he didn’t provide much support for it. On the other hand, too many statistics and opposing views might have made this too dry, less entertaining.It’s a short book.Some of the content:It takes 10,000 hours of practice to become successful at something. It’s not being a genius, it’s practice.Luck is huge element toward success: when one is born, the influence of parents, and one’s culture.The best hockey players are born Jan to March. Geniuses born to poor parents do not do well because their parents don’t show them how to present themselves to the world and how to interact with others. In other words, geniuses need some “emotional IQ” to succeed, but the author doesn’t use that term. S. Korean airlines had more crashes than any other airline because of culture. Copilots were afraid to tell pilots about dangerous plane conditions, because it might sound disrespectful.NARRATOR:The author narrated this book.

Gladwell takes this simple point and broadens and deepens it with fantastic story-telling. It would be easy to give this book a five-star rating -- but I hesitate to do so. One of the reasons I hesitate is because I've been been duped before. When I was first learning about international affairs, I loved the work of Thomas Friedman. I thought he had a fantastic gift for story-telling and was a very astute observer of international trends. I still do think Friedman is an excellent journalist and popular nonfiction writer; however, as I read more deeply in International Relations, I learned that Thomas Friedman was actually popularizing research that had already been in circulation for a long time that was much richer and more fantastic than he admitted (especially in the International Relations subfield of complex interdependence and other IPE literature). On top of that, Friedman had the nerve to suggest that hedge fund managers were the most insightful observers of international affairs -- an insult that discards the very richness of the literary well that he draws from. For this reason, I have my suspicions about Gladwell's work. Surely, it's better for journalists to be aware of academic work than not to be aware of it. And it is certainly a virtue for work-a-day journalists to read broadly and think through problems like philosophers. But, I worry that like Friedman much of Gladwell's work may just be a popular nonfiction take of even deeper works on the same subject field. In addition, I also worry about the ""value-added"" of his work -- in other words, whether his work contributes something really new to the debate or whether he is just communicating several loosely connected points that were already available in the research. Like Friedman's work, I worry that what I'm reading -- though an entertaining and coherent story -- may be somewhat ""old hat"". Since I'm not a specialist on human development and learning, I can't make this judgment. But what I can say is that the book was a fantastic read (and a pretty quick one too!). "
134,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52500467-whatireallyread,5,"How I felt while reading ""Outliers"":How I feel after finishing ""Outliers"":Honestly, guys, this book is beyond awesome. I recommend it to absolutely everyone. It follows patterns of the human experience backed up by research, it provides data and context. I've seen it shelved as ""self-help"" multiple times, but in fact it's not really ""self-helpey"" at all. It takes examples of great success and great failure and examines it with cold-headed, hard-science, no-nonsense approach. There are absolutely 0 ""steps to success"" chapters, no instructions, no mantras, nothing of the kind. Having said that, the book was very liberating, inspiring and empowering to read. It makes me want to work and learn for 16 hours every day :) It also gave insights into some events in my own life and lives of my family members. Still don't believe it's awesome? Okay. I'll just say it focuses on all of the following:- world cultures - airplane pilots- Beatles- mathematicians and programmers- geniuses- middle-schoolersthe list goes on and on. This book is fire. This book is a ninja. Read this book.P.S. I definitely want to read more about the impact of cultural heritage and language on our everyday life. Any recs?"
135,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/757602-lars-guthrie,5,"Gladwell just gets better for me, going from a general topic of general interest--when a cultural trend takes hold ('The Tipping Point')--to a general topic with a more specific focus that factors into my work with children--the way the brain makes a value judgement ('Blink')--to a specific topic that specifically affects my work--how one's personal history and culture can determine success ('Outliers'). He effectively puts the kibosh on a myth that has particular resonance for Americans--that we make ourselves, that given the will and the work, anybody can be anything. But he doesn't leave it at that. If advantages are a product of culture, he proposes, then we can begin to give those advantages to more by changing the culture. His impassioned plea for a longer school year and a shorter summer vacation was eye-opening. The 'summer slump' well known to educators hits the kids from disadvantaged backgrounds the hardest. I have long felt that real learning is a result of slowing down and letting children discover how things work rather than ""teaching"" them the bullet points we have set as requirements for matriculation. When Gladwell quoted a teacher at a school with a longer academic year who said, ""It seems counterintuitive but we do things at a slower pace and as a result we get through a lot more,"" I stopped reading. And cheered. "
136,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2940271-undrakh,5,"This is not a story of how one hard-working and intelligent man reached to the top all by himself. It's all about what made him successful beyond his own will and talent; some of the factors leading to success were bit unexpected such as a cultural legacy. Those ideas may bring some disappointment to the believers of heroic actions and dramatic rise in people's paths, but they make sense, a lot. This was one of the books which made me take a deep breath, walk around, jump several times, and go back to reading. (I really did, just saying this to express how I feel). The researches, studies, and cases included must been written and discussed for a long time; however, they might have been bit alien to the readers of nonscientific ground. Malcolm Gladwell made it sound so simple and meaningful. There was always a sort of feeling that I was product of my family's meticulous work of crafting my environment to study well and grow up healthy. Those are called the opportunities missed greatly in some others' lives. The successful people had their opportunities too, which can almost be called as sheer luck. There're many other explanations for these people; the stories are just great. It's a really good work of gathering lots of data and information and making a good use of them through insight and a skill of storyteller. "
137,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25032671-kris,2,"Widespread assumptions, anecdotal evidence, emotional appeal. In other words: pop psychology.This felt like even more pop psychology than Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking, which I somewhat enjoyed. But the same errors lay in this book, tenfold. Too much story-telling and not enough evidence. Switching from one scenario to the next without linking things together. Harping on the same point over and over again, without actually expounding upon it. Another review I saw pointed out that he ""infers causation from correlation"" and I totally see that here. It's like Gladwell once again took a topic that should have only been a magazine/journal article, and swelled it into a book.Not impressed. I might still read The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference some day, but that will probably be the last of Gladwell for me."
138,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1757741-kevin,5,"I picked up this book on a whim not knowing anything about it and was captivated by the subject and writing. Malcolm Gladwell explains in an academic yet simple way how seemingly ""self-made"" superstars in business, sports and life are actually the result of hard work, incredible opportunities, culture and timing. From Mozart to the Beatles to Bill Gates to hockey superstars he builds a case for this very theory. Surprisingly fun and a fast read, this book prompts much thought and discussion involving the secrets to success. Outliers is a book that you read out loud to anyone who is nearby (and will listen) and causes you to bring up these examples in conversation. I am not sure I have read a book recently that covers such a thought provoking ideas while reads so smoothly. Gladwell uses such relevant examples that you have a very easy time ""getting it"". I highly recommend this book and have already secured my copies of his other two similar books, Blink and Tipping Point. I highly enjoyed this!"
139,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,5," I know Gladwell gets a lot of hate these days. I guess he has fallen out of fashion. Anyway, I enjoyed this book that I read a decade or so ago. I don't know if his reputation will be recuperated but this book was interesting enough for me and the writing style wasn't bad. It kept my interest. He is accessible and shows interesting points in what makes for successful outliers. Decent nonfiction. I don't understand the hate."

142,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34203976-sundus,4,"What a thought provoking, inspiring and entertaining book !!! My first read of Gladwell and I believe he is an excellent writer. Thoroughly enjoyed it from the beginning to end. Recommended to all"
143,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2729963-duffy-pratt,3,"Gladwell's basic argument is that people can't pull themselves up by their own bootstraps, and that everyone who is successful had some help, and some luck, along the way. Despite Rush Limbaugh's outrage earlier this year when Obama said pretty much the same thing, I don't think that this is a very challenging or distrubing idea. If that was all there was to it, I wouldn't have liked this book at all. But I did like it, mostly because I found quite a bit of fun in the details.What goes into success? First a person is given both a chance and an advantage. Gladwell points to selection bias when we choose kids for advancement amongst those in their age group. This almost always tends to give an advantage to the oldest children within the age group, because the selection process tends to confound maturity with talent. Seventy percent of Canadian professional hockey players are born in the first half of the year. Why? Because when the kids are young, the best kids born in a year are selected for a better league, with more practice time and better coaching. So they start off better because they are older, but quickly become much better because they are given time, attention and praise. The same results apply almost everywhere, and the effects can be seen in things like who goes to college, to even who is more likely to commit suicide. All of this because of some arbitrary line that we draw about age.This is a very interesting idea, but the basic idea behind it is quite simple and old. It's essentially a variation of Virginia Woolf's idea about Shakespeare's sister - equally talented as the bard, but never given a chance because of a basically irrelevant distinction.Next point is that it takes 10,000 hours to become an expert at anything. This is both an extremely powerful rule of thumb, and just plain wrong. Let's start with why its wrong. How long does it take to become an expert at slot machines? There's no answer because there's no such thing. Now how about tic-tac-toe. I haven't played for 10,000 hours, but I can pretty much guarantee that I will bring anyone to at least a tie in that game, no matter how much more experience they have. Some things defy expertise, and some other things are easy to master. But even in the middle ground, I don't think it's so obvious. Until very recently, the longbow was a superior weapon to a rifle/musket in almost every respect. It had a longer range, a better ability to pierce armor, a superior rate of fire. It was cheaper to construct and maintain. But it had a crippling disadvantage. It did actually take 10,000 hours to master the longbow. It took strength, co-ordination, and lots of practice. By contrast, it was possible to train infantry to shoot a rifle in a very short period of time. Thus, the rifle became the weapon of choice for armies because it was easier to master, not because it was better in other ways.The rule of thumb is powerful, however, because it gives an idea of how much practice and commitment is likely to be involved in learning any fulfilling job or hobby. The examples Gladwell gives are classical musician, composer, chess master, and then he asserts that each of his other success stories have also put in their 10,000. There are two caveats here. Even if it might take 10,000 hours to get good at something, that doesn't mean that putting in the hours means that you will get good. I was probably well on my way to my 10,000 in basketball by the time I graduated high school, and I was never going to be any better than an OK high school player. Other factors were involved (I was slow, but I couldn't jump.) The other thing, and its one that Gladwell doesn't mention. My acting teacher used to define talent as ""the ability to become involved."" In this context, what that means is that if you can devote 10,000 hours of practice and serious concentration to something, that fact alone shows a level of passion and commitment that other people lack. Gladwell makes quite a bit out of Bill Gate's extraordinary opportunities to be around computers before they were widely available. He doesn't make anywhere near as much of what Gates called his ""addiction"" to that computer time. The next element of success is a certain threshold level of ability. Here, Gladwell focuses on IQ, and makes the point that after a certain threshold, IQ tests predict nothing about a person's success. People with the highest IQs are no more likely to win Nobel prizes than others with a fairly high IQ. The same thing goes for SAT and law school entrance scores. Thus, for example, law school affirmative action students get lower scores on the LSAT, and tend to get slightly worse grades in school, but they do just as well as their contemporaries after they get out of school.Sprinkle on top of this a whole lot of luck, or fortuitous timing. The example that Gladwell uses is that about 15 of the 100 richest people in history were all born in the 1830s in the United States. Similarly, the most successful New York Jewish lawyers all tended to be born in the early 1930s. And if you wanted to get really rich in Silicon Valley, you probably needed to be born about 1955. He gives some pretty good arguments for why these things happened, but he also appears here, as well as with some of his other examples, to be cherry-picking the absolute best fits.I'd like to see what Gladwell has to make of the following: Mozart, Beethoven, Haydn, and Schubert were all from a very narrow geographical area, all Austrians, four of the greatest composers of all time. They all lived at very nearly the same time in Vienna. How does something like that happen? Out of all of history, how does so much greatness concentrate itself in both such a narrow area and timeframe? Another similar example: Jerome Kern, Irving Berlin, George Gershwin, Richard Rodgers are four of the towering giants of American songwriting: all of them are from New York City, born within 17 years of each other, and they were all Jewish. Again, how does something like this happen?This leads us to Gladwell's last point: cultural background matters. Gladwell tells a fascinating story of how Korean Air Lines had a rash of crashes. Basically, the reason for the crashes came because the flight crew were uniformly too deferential to the Captain. Planes are safer when an underling can say something like ""There's a mountain right in front of us."" or ""We're running dangerously low on fuel and need to land now."" But my guess is that there are strong cultural reasons that would explain the Vienna musicians, and the New York songwriters. I just don't know what they are.Gladwell also tries to connect the idea that Asian's being good at math with their rice farming. Apparently rice farming takes both a lot of work compared to other farming, and it also takes more thought and planning. This leads to a culture that strongly endorses the work ethic, which in turn leads to better math students. He also claims that these cultures have an advantage because their language more directly models the form of numbers than English and western languages. For example, where we say eleven, the Chinese say ten-one. And twenty-one is two-ten-one.There may be a point here, but I think its a shallow one. This is supposed to be a book about outliers and success stories. Here is an internet ranking of the greatest mathematicians of all time:http://fabpedigree.com/james/mathmen.... Five of the hundred are from China or Japan. None from the other rice growing areas of the world. This is nothing in comparison to the number of French and Germans on the list. Math isn't the kind of field where there would be a strong cultural bias. If the Chinese had been making great discoveries in math, there's no reason to think they wouldn't get credit for it. So, even though Gladwell might have explained why Asian kids get better scores on standardized math tests, that has little to do with the subject he actually said he was going to talk about. The greater question, for me at least, is if Asians are so good at math, why has there been so little development of mathematical knowledge coming out of Asia. In other words, if they are so good at math, why aren't they better mathematicians? I liked this book. I thought it was well written and fun to read. The examples were interesting, but too obviously cherry picked. Much of what's said here is driven home better in Taleb's Fooled by Randomness. But there were some surprising examples and studies that I had not heard before, and Gladwell has a style that makes things both simple and engaging. I would have liked it better if the central idea were a bit more startling, so as it is, it left me feeling that it's just a little slight."
144,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/217489-naeem,5,"Recent class discussions have allowed me to amend my previous rave by including a few criticisms. These I discuss at the end of the review. I have been calling people off the streets to have them listen to the CD version. The book brings out the fascist in me because I wish I could have everyone on the planet read it. Now, today. Why?First, Gladwell takes on the most pernicious, Mobey Dick of a myth: that genius belongs to and emerges from the individual; that such geniuses and self-made men as Carnegies, Mellons, Rockefellers, Mozarts, Beatles, Gates, and Jobs of this world show us that we can in fact ""pull ourselves up by our bootstraps."" You cannot take on such a myth by marshaling facts against it -- mostly you cannot feel facts. Gladwell shows us that such outliers are not outliers at all. What he shows us is how they are embedded within communities, within circumstances, within structures and cultures, within luck that provides them with extraordinary opportunity. He does not mean that they were not skilled or talented. Nor does he mean that they did not work extremely hard. They were and they did. But their skill and hard work were merely necessary, not sufficient conditions for their success. Without the historical circumstance, without the support of their community, without simple, plain, brute luck, their hard work and talent (like yours and mine) gets them no where. So boom! take that you beast of a myth. Second, hundreds and thousands of us make such arguments all day long, 'till we are blue faced, 'till we are weak-kneed and tired. What makes this book so powerful is the WAY Gladwell does it. He does with precise attention to historical context. And he does it with the skills of a fiction writer -- a good fiction writer, not Khaled Hosseini or Ann Patchett. He tells story after story, with the pace and drama of a detective novelist. He refers to social science of all types. But such references are but mere nails that pin down the edges of his sails so that they can capture the narrative energy and convince us that his argument is as moving as the summer breeze.Third, he moves from the cultural embeddedness of individuals in the first part of the book to the affect of culture and inter-generational legacies on individuals in the second part. And here is where the big pay-off is to be found. What does he show? I will tell you. But first let me share the frustration of someone who has been in the classroom for the last 22 years. What can social theory really teach us? Only one thing, I submit, of real importance. Namely that there are these forces, seemingly beyond our control, which make us their puppets, even as we proclaim our freedom, individuality, and self-determination. What forces? The sub-conscious, says Freud. The material effects that result from how a society reproduces itself, say the Scots of the Enlightenment and Marx. Society's compunctions, say Durkheim, Weber, and Giddens. Culture's secret instantiations within our bones and blood, say the anthropologists. The invisible straps of hundreds of past years, say the historians. In a word, structure. Structure is the only thing we teach, the only thing worth teaching. And, damn it, it is also the one thing we cannot seem to get across.Why cannot we get it across? Not because we don't work hard enough or don't have enough creativity. Mostly, because we underestimate the size of the the greatest myth of modernity, of westernization, of capitalism -- (a myth that both Adam Smith and Fredrich Hayek cop to as a deception, even if they call it necessary) the myth of the self-made man; the myth that there is an easy correlation between effort and reward. This myth makes a mockery of structure and and spits bile at teachers and therapists. We can't get structure across because there is a part of us that clings desperately to the myth. We want to believe.Gladwell's is a full out attack on our desire to cling to the myth. Here is what this book gets across: ""structure."" He is a sneaky one this Gladwell fellow. He does it with two brilliantly meshed techniques: a narrative flow that disarms you like only good fiction can, and with a clean, clear, deep understanding of the pervasive presence of ""structure.""I am dancing with joy at the prospect of trying out this book. Naturally, they will resist but that resistance will be oh so tortured. Malcolm Gladwell's fine, fine book will bring intense pressure to bare on our self-deceptions. Not to worry, all this academic stuff I am talking about makes no appearance on the stage of his manuscript. And yet, it is all there. All there. Not there and there, at once. Amendments and Criticisms:Recent class discussions allow me to add the following: Some have suggested that Gladwell's goal is a world where the opportunity to be successful is available to more people and perhaps to everyone. We waste tremendous talent and skill when only a few are given the chance to be successful. If so, he would seem to endorse the equation that correlates effort with reward, rather than to obliterate this equation. This means that Gladwell's purpose is, at best, liberal rather than radical and, at worse, he wants to reform meritocracy and thereby to sustain it. Further, Gladwell implies that the violation of his grandmother by a white man (his grandfather) is the ""gift"" that partly explains both his and his mother's outlier success. Perhaps Gladwell means to use the word ""gift"" ironically, or it could be that he means it. Hard to tell. Either way, his language usage retains a certain ambiguity, an ambiguity that reflects his reformist attitude towards meritocracy. I find myself agreeing with these criticisms. They expose Gladwell to greater searing scrutiny than I had originally managed. Yet, it can be the case that (1) books are smarter than their authors, and (2) books contain deep tensions within their themes. On the one hand, yes, Gladwell seems the liberal reformist. On the other hand, I remain impressed with how far Gladwell's ideas go towards obliterating the myth of meritocracy. Even if he is a reformist, I find his book quite radical.I think the book is smarter than him because it transcends his liberalism. It undermines the core of liberalism and of meritocracy by showing that results are not due to effort. Results are due to many thing -- cultural legacy, fortunate circumstances, systematic skewing of systems towards some people and away from others, and, of course, structure. Rewards are due to many things but not merely the result of effort. If we accept that society lies to us about the nature of effort (by no means an easy thing even after you read this book -- hard to undo a life long lie and and a lie we want to believe), this knowledge can lead us, as my colleague Sean would say, towards creating a ""beloved community."" We take care of each other because we are alive and proximate to each other, and this is enough for each of us to deserve intimate membership in beloved community.The entry cost of this beloved community? Giving up the notion that anything is or is not deserved. "

Gladwell here argues that success is tightly correlated with not only intelligence and hard work, but also opportunity, timing, and luck. He talks about why Asians are good at maths, the hidden lucky factors which made Bill Gates, Mozart, Steve Jobs, and other successful people who they are, the 10,000 hour rule, how background and social status affect the personality and success of people, and how The Beatles are not successful purely because of talent but rather because they had opportunities to practice for many hours in Germany, even though I was not fully convinced with that, since there are many bands and artists who made a name for themselves just as much as the Beatles if not more who didn’t have the same kind of opportunity, or did they? As a person who has grown up in Iraq, I have always felt that one of the most unfortunate aspects of life here is the lack of opportunities for people especially the young to explore, widen their horizons, and discover the kind of intelligence they have which will all contribute to their identity, self-actualization, and how they can put their efforts to make Iraq and the rest of the world a better place.I have thought about how corrupt the school system here is. Imagine Bill Gates, Mozart, Steve Jobs, and members from the Beatles being put from a young age at the same kind of environment that people here is Iraq are forced to put up with. Imagine forcing them to memorize tons of useless information and measure their success, self worth, identity, and future career based on how much they can memorize. Really unfortunate and a waste of potential!"

In one sentence the book can be summarized as - No man, woman or Canadian hockey player is an island. Extraordinary success is the result of an often-unlikely series of opportunities, lucky breaks, and occurrences that combine to create the precise conditions that allow such achievement."
149,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/308912-tucker,4,"Unlike most books on success, Gladwell isn't telling us how to become successful. He's describing who actually does attain success. Academic prowess is one important element. The route to success begins as early as ""birthday cut-offs"" for children entering kindergarten or joining sports teams. The older children are perceived as more talented, and their talent is praised and cultivated until, by the time they finish high school, they really have become more successful. At that point, the important difference is no longer their age, but the opportunities they received and the effort they put in. It is also helpful to be raised by parents who have the money and the interest to nurture their children's thinking skills after school and during vacations. Finally, it helps to grow up in a culture that values hard work and to have the opportunity to practice in one's area of interest. World-class musicians and computer programmers, for example, each put in about 10,000 hours of serious practice time before their gifts and their career trajectories become clear. These factors prove to have a far greater impact on an individual's test scores and academic success than his or her IQ.Another element of success is so-called ""practical intelligence,"" or knowing how to speak up and ask for what you want and need. Good communication skills with one's peers and superiors can help prevent accidents. It is useful to be raised by parents who engaged in meaningful work fueled by labor and innovation and to appreciate the reward that comes with that.And of course there is luck--having the good fortune to be 20 years old, with the business skills of an adult and the flexible mind of a young person, when a seismic technological shift such as the birth of railroads, petroleum, or computers occurs.After finishing the book, I was left with an aftertaste of the ""duh-factor"": of course hard work and luck influence one's chances at success. It didn't produce as much of a mental revolution in me as did his other book,  The Tipping Point. But Gladwell assembled some great anecdotes and mined them well."
150,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5015851-ms-pegasus,5,"OUTLIERS explores the idea of meritocracy with Gladwell's typical focus on aberrational patterns. He begins with an observation about the distribution of birthday months for a professional Canadian hockey team. There is a consistent skewing toward the earliest months in the year. Although he does not explore the probabilities in detail, this fact is especially astonishing since births by month are not evenly distributed, but in fact skewed toward the months in the second half of the year (https://blog.rjmetrics.com/2009/09/14... is one of many websites that cites this distribution). His explanation is persuasive, if not news to parents harboring hopes that their son will be the next Wayne Gretzky (incidentally, a Canadian born in January). Gladwell notes how a few months' advantage of maturity and physical development can reap life-long cumulative advantages: More confidence, more playing time, better coaching, more competitive opportunities, more encouragement.He then shifts his attention to a new thread. One connecting Bill Gates, Bill Joy (co-founder of Sun Microsystems), and The Beatles. This exploration leads him to the “10,000 Hour Rule,” a catchy phrase that has made its way into popular parlance. I was particularly impressed by his mention of Bobby Fischer in this context. Anyone who has read the biography ENDGAME by Frank Brady will find supporting material for Gladwell's ideas.Numerous critics have jumped on this generalization, arguing that it is an oversimplification when taken literally. Gladwell responds to these critics, emphasizing the spirit of his claim (http://www.businessinsider.com/malcol...). In case after case Gladwell poses a prediction based on intuitive ideas about how the world works. In case after case he demonstrates that intuitive ideas are unreliable. The alternative explanations he poses are persuasive, but more important, unexpected.The diversity of his examples make this an entertaining book. The second part of the book shifts gears into an area he calls “Cultural Legacies,” bundles of attitudes subconsciously reinforced through family histories. “Cultural legacies are powerful forces. They have deep roots and long lives. They persist, generation after generation, virtually intact, even as the economic and social and demographic conditions that spawned them have vanished, and they play such a role in directing attitudes and behavior that we cannot make sense of our world without them.” (p.175) The exploration takes Gladwell from Harlan County, Kentucky to South Korea. Between 1988 and 1998 the loss rate for United Airlines was .27/million departures. During the same period the loss rate for Korean Air was 4.79/million departures. (Imagine trying to get “Rainman” aboard a KAL flight!) Gladwell hastens to add that since 1999, KAL's record is spotless, the result of an astonishing turnaround in cockpit training. At its heart was confrontation of a cultural legacy problem — the hierarchical relationship and behaviors between the captain and his subordinates in the flight crew. This was, in fact, my favorite part of the book, and the factor that boosts my rating from 4 to 5 stars. His transcriptions of cockpit recordings are riveting, as each accident scenario unfolds. Readers who have occasion to deal with non-native English speakers, particularly in the software industry, will find ample food for thought.Gladwell's curiosity takes him to many other topics. He looks at the trait of persistence. He questions the role of language in the early mastery of number sense. He examines the effects of summer vacation on academic performance. His restless mind and energetic research stir up contradictions that force the reader to revisit intuitive explanations that are so tempting to grasp. His curiosity is infectious."
151,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/128745-malbadeen,4,"Love him or hate him - whatever. The more I read of his stuff the more I am fascinated by what he does. I think it is so interesting how we can make up a theory and pretty much ascribe all happenings around us as proof that that theory is correct. I do it all the time. My whole family does it, it's how we converse. I think more people do it than are willing to admit and if you read Gladwell with that in mind it is easier to not get so worked up about that fact that he is espousing ideas rather than writing doctoral dissertations that are intended to change the way the world functions. Personally I find myself arguing with/disagreeing with his stuff during a good portion of what he writes but I like arguing so find it mostly enjoyable. In this book Gladwell is attempting to support his belief that successful people are not ""self-made"" but rather the fortunate product of suitable circumstances. A slight variation on ""nature vs. nurture"" nothing new here. I mostly agree with the idea as it fits nicely with my more politically liberal sensibilities but there were several instances when I felt like his words were actually making the counter argument. Specifically in an extended portion about early Jewish immigrants. He seemed to be saying, ""lucky them, they happened to have the right skills at the right time"" while glossing over their relentless attempts to find their own niche.I also found the hairs on my neck raising when he talked about schools. I feel uncomfortable anytime people start suggesting that the solution to closing the achievement gap for the economically disadvantaged and advantaged is to take kids from their families for longer amounts of time. It is troublesome because it doesn't address the larger issue of social inequities on a larger scale and it starts with the presupposition that academic achievement is the pinnacle to which we should all strive to attain and it de-values the role families play in the upbringing of their children. All that being said, I realize this is one book, with one main point and not every conversation can/should end up with a march to the white house demanding social equity for all. But still....maybe just the tiniest nod to the larger issue would have been nice.I was also more than a little aware of the fact that while he attempted to be gracious to groups other than middle and upper class he would throw in statements like, ""....there aren't books lying around her house that she can read if she gets bored. There's *PROBABLY* just a television."" when talking about ""poor"" households and yet there were no ""probablies"" when he spoke about high income households. It was all definite statements of ""positive"" experiences. oh Malcolm. tsk. tsk.(if you've stayed with this ""review"" this long, you should send me your address so I can send you a dollar for your fortitude).So all in all I'd have to say: I disagreed with him a ton but I enjoyed the disagreements and, as always found his writing to be catchy and clever and all that good stuff.*******oh wait, oh wait! note to editors: proof of what a great service you do can be found in the Acknowledgments at the end of this book. I can only assume there is no editorial input for this part as Gladwell used the phrase ""as always"" 4 times on one 1/2 a page! Egads, bring in the editors!!! **********"

“Outliers aren’t outliers…. they are [what they are] not because of some exceptional or heroic individual action on their part but because of whole series of circumstances, environments and cultural legacies.”
 – Malcolm Gladwell in an interview.What is Gladwell essentially saying? He sums up the circumstantial, environmental and cultural reasons for being an outlier in the following ideas:1. Luck has its role to play2. Hard work and enough practice - 10000 hours – makes you good at almost anything 3. IQ doesn’t guarantee success. There exists a concept of IQ threshold. Psychological testing has its limitations4. Being born at the right place, right time helps5. Middle and higher class families typically provide better, nurturing home environments6. Disadvantaged groups have access to fewer opportunities7. If kids put more effort they could fetch better grades 8. Language affects how we organize information9. Culture can shape personality10. Racial discrimination has handicaps associated with it (epilogue)Everything listed above (published in 2008) has either been out there in scientific and pop literature for decades, is scientifically tenuous (10000 hours) or is something that Captain Obvious would state. Gladwell has nothing new to offer, let alone adding an argument to enrich the nature-nurture debate. He ends up trying to convolute it with poorly supported assertions.Part 1 broadly discusses about individuals, who indeed were exceptions. It was still pertinent to the title. In part 2, though, when he discusses the performance of Asians in mathematics or school kids taking California Assessment Battery – he is talking about averages and not outliers per se. Different cultures prepare you for different things - cultural anthropologists established that in the 50s. Rather than comparing westerners and Asians on math performance, he should have addressed the existence of outliers within the oriental culture. That would have made more sense. He lost track in my opinion.He makes sure that not one sentence is spared on confidence, motivation, temperament, personality dimensions, emotional regulation, self-esteem, self-efficacy, interests or learning/ perceptual styles! How did these factors play out in the lives of Gates, Joy or Jobs? Why are 80% of NBA players black? And why is not each one of them a LeBron, a Kobe or a Jordan? He skipped judgment and decision making too. Decisions such as how and where to put effort into could be a critical success factor. I spent 220 minutes on this book. I could have used that time elsewhere. I could have slept or perhaps worked to accumulate those 10000hrs in one of my crafts. Gladwell is not a psychologist; I should have known better. Drivel should have been expected. The only outlier that doesn’t deserve to be one is this book itself. He should write a book on how “Outliers”, a below average text, managed to get a 4+ rating on Goodreads. I gave a star only because of the chapter on ice hockey and the 50 page babble dedicated to pilot communication – which, like so many in this book, was a feeble argument to make for a correlation between cultural legacy and outliers."
153,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1291915-lauren,4,"There were some sections of this book that had me turning the pages so quickly starved for more information, and others that were a little dry. Gladwell has excellent observational skills, and I like his writing style. I enjoyed this book, much like I did with his others. I was particularly happy to see him open with stories about hockey players - as watching hockey is one of my favorite pastimes. However, I went to the NHL page and looked at the birthdays of several of my favorite Canadian players, and they did not seem to follow the same trend as noted in the book. The majority of players I saw were actually born in the summer or in the fall of the year, rather than early in the year. I am not sure what this means for Gladwell's observation, or if the Canadian leagues changed their age limits... I particularly liked the chapters in the middle/end referring to culture and authority figures, etc. in regards to the airline industry. Many times throughout, I found myself thinking ""huh, wow, that is interesting!"" "
154,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38544962-guy-austin,4,"I really did enjoy this. My daughter, a Junior in college, handed me this book. She has never done that before so I had to read it, Right? I probably would not have otherwise. I was very surprised how much I enjoyed it. It is well written and entertaining and at the same time informative and educational. Gladwell seems to have a way with drawing out unseen and seen ideas of successful people road to success. He helps his readers perceive familiar information in entirely new ways, a myth-buster if that is a word. In this he tackles the self-made man, pointing out that success stories are a lot more involved than the outside perception. Are the gifted truly gifted? An enlightening read. "
155,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58095391-michelle-scott,4,"As Americans, we tend to think of highly successful individuals, such as Bill Gates, as somehow making their fortunes because of their own innate skills and talents. In fact, we hold the ideal of the self-made man/woman in such high regard that we ignore the facts. In this book, Malcolm Gladwell examines the stories of several very successful people and comes up with some interesting conclusions. It isn't a spring of talent that gushes inside of these outliers, but a combination of hours of drudgery combined with some amazing good luck.The book is well-written and the examples are fascinating. What's lacking is the idea that any of these observations can be learning experiences for the rest of us."
156,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1355037-angela,1,"Being born in the right place at the right time with the right talent and the right opportunities is the formula for success.Not since ""Who Moved the Cheese?"" have I hated a book so much."
157,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30327585-michael-broch,5,"Reading this book so soon after Atlas Shrugged was a lucky break, and gave voice to much I disagreed or was uncomfortable with concerning Ayn Rand’s philosophy—chiefly that selfishness is virtue. One of the best facets of Atlas Shrugged is its celebration of hard work, the individual human spirit, and achievement. Where it fails is its narrow view of an ideal society based on the value of hard work as purely “us” vs “them”, where those of ability are deified as “ self made men” and damn the rest as lazy, spoiled, or complacent. Malcolm Gladwell, with poignant examples and rational assessments, makes a tremendous case for a broader picture, one in which individual grit and tenacity are indeed a large part of success, but they are only one part. We ignore sociological, cultural, and empathetic factors which contribute to success at our own peril, and the peril of others. I am thankful for its calm and objective study of success to juxtapose with the often angry and callous portrayal of success and virtue which Ayn Rand paints in her opus."
158,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/106503484-connor-steckly,4,"Gladwell uses several independent, short historical stories to explain the underlying theme of success being attributed to the conditions and circumstances of the individual. Although all of his stories were very distinct from one another, the context provided to dig down to why someone became successful is remarkable and ties together very nicely. I absolutely recommend reading this book! "
159,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3633211-vikas,5,"Like the subtitle says it's the story of success and provides a wonderful study of successful people and hitting ground running by proving again and again that to be successful along with the person the support area and time period is as important to make sure that the person is successful. Mr. Gladwell takes example from different fields, Sports, Music, IT etc. and prove again and again that their success owed itself to lot of fortunate co-incidents and opportunities which they could utilize. In other words along with the talent these people were there at the right place on the right time and today these guys are Billionaires and superstars. Loved this wonderful book do read it and enjoy.People who don't read generally ask me my reasons for reading. Simply put I just love reading and so to that end I have made it my motto to just Keep on Reading. I love to read everything except for Self Help books but even those once in a while. I read almost all the genre but YA, Fantasy, Biographies are the most. My favorite series is of course Harry Potter but then there are many more books that I just adore. I have bookcases filled with books which are waiting to be read so can't stay and spend more time in this review, so remember I loved reading this and love reading more, you should also read what you love and then just Keep on Reading."
160,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73241274-alokita,3,"caution: a stream of consciousness review I would have been in more awe of this book had I read it at an earlier point in life. It would have been both inspiring and revealing, something that the Times says it is on the front cover. So I would urge people to read this as early as possible to gain the utmost out of this book.However, for me, there were no new revelations lets alone those revelations being inspiring. The beginning and the conclusion were obvious to anyone who had gone beyond the surface level worship of success stories. The entire book is based on the now known simple fact that there is nothing like a divine and unexpected success. It takes not only the effort of the individual but also his surrounding to cross the finish line before his/her participants.I did, however, find the process of anecdotal argumentation interesting and refreshing. There were a lot of interesting stories of how people have achieved what they have. It does a commendable work of shedding light on the less focused aspect of success, luck. There is a tendency to visualise success as made up of either only hard work or luck. Most success stories depend on a fruitful combination of both. In the case studies mentioned in the book, the luck aspect is defined as the cultural legacy of our family and society in combination with the conducive yet transformative eras.There were a lot of interconnections to be made that would contribute to the enjoyment of the book for me. The chapter on Rice Paddies and Maths had a personal connection to my own maths related issues while the chapter that talked about the feuds in the southern American regions in the first half of the nineteenth century helped me make retrospective sense of the subplot of the Grangerfords and Shepherdsons in The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain. The following points decreased its enjoyment factor for me:1. The book employs a very traditional sense of success in the book which is an economic and productive success. this creates a myopic view of success in life. Although the introductory chapter is an exception by talking about health success, the rest of the book measures success in terms of wealth and fame only. It would have been better to include inventors and discoverers too in the list. 2. This leads to an obvious gender gap visible in the success stories being mentioned that becomes even more prominent due to its very absence. I would have liked the book to address this issue like many others have done. 3. The research at some places seems either too obvious or too simplistic, making me lose confidence in the book. It also sounds instructional rather than inspiring at other places. To give this a positive spin, there are many areas that can be explored further by other people.In short, the book demystifies the success myth as being coincidental and situates it in hard work and cultural legacy of the individuals."
161,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793473-clif-hostetler,5,"This book shows that the stories about self made rugged individualists who are so widely admired are not stories of singularly talented people who took advantage of opportunities. But rather they are stories of talented people who took advantage of singular opportunities. Furthermore, the ability and disposition to work hard is not so much a personal trait as it is a cultural legacy. The author tells numerous true stories of what appears to be shining examples of disadvantaged people who ended up being outstanding success stories. But then the author goes back through the same story and takes a look at where that person came from and shows that they benefited from a combination of a cultural background and set of unique opportunities and timing that allowed them to succeed. The point of the book is not to explain away success stories. But rather it is to learn from these stories, and use this information to help everyone be more productive and successful. The author shows several instances where proactive steps were able to ameliorate the effect of negative cultural legacies.I found this book to be one of the most interesting non-fiction books that I've ever listened to. Some critics of this book have pointed out that the author, Malcolm Gladwell, didn't adhere to strict protocols in his interpretation of data. My response is that this book is for popular consumption, not the academic community. I'm confident that plenty of proper research and analysis will be performed prior to the implementation of major improvements to schools based on Gladwell's recommendations.The following is a copy of the review of this book review taken from the Jaunary 6, 2011 PageADay Book Lover's Calendar:THAT SWEET SMELLMalcolm Gladwell makes sense of yet another aspect of our world in this pleasantly readable account of success and the qualities that lead to it. The question he poses is, Why do the Bill Gateses and Mozarts of the world succeed so brilliantly, while others of the same intelligence and talent end up leading lives of quiet desperation? Using his method of combining the latest academic studies with the most relevant and irresistible stories, Gladwell makes his case that the “outliers” beneft from advantages and opportunities that pass others up. A stimulating read, to say the least.OUTLIERS: THE STORY OF SUCCESS, by Malcolm Gladwell (Little, Brown, 2008)"
162,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3789528-jane-stewart,5,"4 ½ stars. I was amazed and surprised at what I learned about what makes people successful. And it’s entertaining.I wish I had read this years ago when my children were toddlers. I might have changed some things in how I raised them, not a lot of things, but some decisions might have been different. For example, I might have had them do more academic work in the summers, and felt less guilty about it. But aside from parenting, wow, this is fascinating stuff. The author is a good story teller. He takes an occurrence and analyzes and explains it in an insightful and entertaining way. Most of what he said made sense to me, and I believed him. But I wonder if other experts would have different views. I wonder if there are studies and statistics out there that might say yes this is true in these cases, but it doesn’t apply in all cases. I would have liked seeing arguments on both sides of some of the issues, for example affirmative action at the University of Michigan Law school. He made a statement but he didn’t provide much support for it. On the other hand, too many statistics and opposing views might have made this too dry, less entertaining.It’s a short book.Some of the content:It takes 10,000 hours of practice to become successful at something. It’s not being a genius, it’s practice.Luck is huge element toward success: when one is born, the influence of parents, and one’s culture.The best hockey players are born Jan to March. Geniuses born to poor parents do not do well because their parents don’t show them how to present themselves to the world and how to interact with others. In other words, geniuses need some “emotional IQ” to succeed, but the author doesn’t use that term. S. Korean airlines had more crashes than any other airline because of culture. Copilots were afraid to tell pilots about dangerous plane conditions, because it might sound disrespectful.NARRATOR:The author narrated this book. His manner and voice were good.DATA:Unabridged audiobook reading time: 7 hrs and 22 mins. Swearing language: none. Sexual content: none. Book copyright 2008.

163,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/957634-daniel-clausen,4,"It would be easy to fetishize individual greatness and success, but to do so would be a lie. Gladwell takes this simple point and broadens and deepens it with fantastic story-telling. It would be easy to give this book a five-star rating -- but I hesitate to do so. One of the reasons I hesitate is because I've been been duped before. When I was first learning about international affairs, I loved the work of Thomas Friedman. I thought he had a fantastic gift for story-telling and was a very astute observer of international trends. I still do think Friedman is an excellent journalist and popular nonfiction writer; however, as I read more deeply in International Relations, I learned that Thomas Friedman was actually popularizing research that had already been in circulation for a long time that was much richer and more fantastic than he admitted (especially in the International Relations subfield of complex interdependence and other IPE literature). On top of that, Friedman had the nerve to suggest that hedge fund managers were the most insightful observers of international affairs -- an insult that discards the very richness of the literary well that he draws from. For this reason, I have my suspicions about Gladwell's work. Surely, it's better for journalists to be aware of academic work than not to be aware of it. And it is certainly a virtue for work-a-day journalists to read broadly and think through problems like philosophers. But, I worry that like Friedman much of Gladwell's work may just be a popular nonfiction take of even deeper works on the same subject field. In addition, I also worry about the ""value-added"" of his work -- in other words, whether his work contributes something really new to the debate or whether he is just communicating several loosely connected points that were already available in the research. Like Friedman's work, I worry that what I'm reading -- though an entertaining and coherent story -- may be somewhat ""old hat"". Since I'm not a specialist on human development and learning, I can't make this judgment. But what I can say is that the book was a fantastic read (and a pretty quick one too!). "
164,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52500467-whatireallyread,5,"How I felt while reading ""Outliers"":How I feel after finishing ""Outliers"":Honestly, guys, this book is beyond awesome. I recommend it to absolutely everyone. It follows patterns of the human experience backed up by research, it provides data and context. I've seen it shelved as ""self-help"" multiple times, but in fact it's not really ""self-helpey"" at all. It takes examples of great success and great failure and examines it with cold-headed, hard-science, no-nonsense approach. There are absolutely 0 ""steps to success"" chapters, no instructions, no mantras, nothing of the kind. Having said that, the book was very liberating, inspiring and empowering to read. It makes me want to work and learn for 16 hours every day :) It also gave insights into some events in my own life and lives of my family members. Still don't believe it's awesome? Okay. I'll just say it focuses on all of the following:- world cultures - airplane pilots- Beatles- mathematicians and programmers- geniuses- middle-schoolersthe list goes on and on. This book is fire. This book is a ninja. Read this book.P.S. I definitely want to read more about the impact of cultural heritage and language on our everyday life. Any recs?"
165,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/757602-lars-guthrie,5,"Gladwell just gets better for me, going from a general topic of general interest--when a cultural trend takes hold ('The Tipping Point')--to a general topic with a more specific focus that factors into my work with children--the way the brain makes a value judgement ('Blink')--to a specific topic that specifically affects my work--how one's personal history and culture can determine success ('Outliers'). He effectively puts the kibosh on a myth that has particular resonance for Americans--that we make ourselves, that given the will and the work, anybody can be anything. But he doesn't leave it at that. If advantages are a product of culture, he proposes, then we can begin to give those advantages to more by changing the culture. His impassioned plea for a longer school year and a shorter summer vacation was eye-opening. The 'summer slump' well known to educators hits the kids from disadvantaged backgrounds the hardest. I have long felt that real learning is a result of slowing down and letting children discover how things work rather than ""teaching"" them the bullet points we have set as requirements for matriculation. When Gladwell quoted a teacher at a school with a longer academic year who said, ""It seems counterintuitive but we do things at a slower pace and as a result we get through a lot more,"" I stopped reading. And cheered. "
166,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2940271-undrakh,5,"This is not a story of how one hard-working and intelligent man reached to the top all by himself. It's all about what made him successful beyond his own will and talent; some of the factors leading to success were bit unexpected such as a cultural legacy. Those ideas may bring some disappointment to the believers of heroic actions and dramatic rise in people's paths, but they make sense, a lot. This was one of the books which made me take a deep breath, walk around, jump several times, and go back to reading. (I really did, just saying this to express how I feel). The researches, studies, and cases included must been written and discussed for a long time; however, they might have been bit alien to the readers of nonscientific ground. Malcolm Gladwell made it sound so simple and meaningful. There was always a sort of feeling that I was product of my family's meticulous work of crafting my environment to study well and grow up healthy. Those are called the opportunities missed greatly in some others' lives. The successful people had their opportunities too, which can almost be called as sheer luck. There're many other explanations for these people; the stories are just great. It's a really good work of gathering lots of data and information and making a good use of them through insight and a skill of storyteller. "

In other words: pop psychology.This felt like even more pop psychology than Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking, which I somewhat enjoyed. But the same errors lay in this book, tenfold. Too much story-telling and not enough evidence. Switching from one scenario to the next without linking things together. Harping on the same point over and over again, without actually expounding upon it. Another review I saw pointed out that he ""infers causation from correlation"" and I totally see that here. It's like Gladwell once again took a topic that should have only been a magazine/journal article, and swelled it into a book.Not impressed. I might still read The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference some day, but that will probably be the last of Gladwell for me."
168,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1757741-kevin,5,"I picked up this book on a whim not knowing anything about it and was captivated by the subject and writing. Malcolm Gladwell explains in an academic yet simple way how seemingly ""self-made"" superstars in business, sports and life are actually the result of hard work, incredible opportunities, culture and timing. From Mozart to the Beatles to Bill Gates to hockey superstars he builds a case for this very theory. Surprisingly fun and a fast read, this book prompts much thought and discussion involving the secrets to success. Outliers is a book that you read out loud to anyone who is nearby (and will listen) and causes you to bring up these examples in conversation. I am not sure I have read a book recently that covers such a thought provoking ideas while reads so smoothly. Gladwell uses such relevant examples that you have a very easy time ""getting it"". I highly recommend this book and have already secured my copies of his other two similar books, Blink and Tipping Point. I highly enjoyed this!"

Anyway, I enjoyed this book that I read a decade or so ago. I don't know if his reputation will be recuperated but this book was interesting enough for me and the writing style wasn't bad. It kept my interest. He is accessible and shows interesting points in what makes for successful outliers. Decent nonfiction. I don't understand the hate."

173,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2729963-duffy-pratt,3,"Gladwell's basic argument is that people can't pull themselves up by their own bootstraps, and that everyone who is successful had some help, and some luck, along the way. Despite Rush Limbaugh's outrage earlier this year when Obama said pretty much the same thing, I don't think that this is a very challenging or distrubing idea. If that was all there was to it, I wouldn't have liked this book at all. But I did like it, mostly because I found quite a bit of fun in the details.What goes into success? First a person is given both a chance and an advantage. Gladwell points to selection bias when we choose kids for advancement amongst those in their age group. This almost always tends to give an advantage to the oldest children within the age group, because the selection process tends to confound maturity with talent. Seventy percent of Canadian professional hockey players are born in the first half of the year. Why? Because when the kids are young, the best kids born in a year are selected for a better league, with more practice time and better coaching. So they start off better because they are older, but quickly become much better because they are given time, attention and praise. The same results apply almost everywhere, and the effects can be seen in things like who goes to college, to even who is more likely to commit suicide. All of this because of some arbitrary line that we draw about age.This is a very interesting idea, but the basic idea behind it is quite simple and old. It's essentially a variation of Virginia Woolf's idea about Shakespeare's sister - equally talented as the bard, but never given a chance because of a basically irrelevant distinction.Next point is that it takes 10,000 hours to become an expert at anything. This is both an extremely powerful rule of thumb, and just plain wrong. Let's start with why its wrong. How long does it take to become an expert at slot machines? There's no answer because there's no such thing. Now how about tic-tac-toe. I haven't played for 10,000 hours, but I can pretty much guarantee that I will bring anyone to at least a tie in that game, no matter how much more experience they have. Some things defy expertise, and some other things are easy to master. But even in the middle ground, I don't think it's so obvious. Until very recently, the longbow was a superior weapon to a rifle/musket in almost every respect. It had a longer range, a better ability to pierce armor, a superior rate of fire. It was cheaper to construct and maintain. But it had a crippling disadvantage. It did actually take 10,000 hours to master the longbow. It took strength, co-ordination, and lots of practice. By contrast, it was possible to train infantry to shoot a rifle in a very short period of time. Thus, the rifle became the weapon of choice for armies because it was easier to master, not because it was better in other ways.The rule of thumb is powerful, however, because it gives an idea of how much practice and commitment is likely to be involved in learning any fulfilling job or hobby. The examples Gladwell gives are classical musician, composer, chess master, and then he asserts that each of his other success stories have also put in their 10,000. There are two caveats here. Even if it might take 10,000 hours to get good at something, that doesn't mean that putting in the hours means that you will get good. I was probably well on my way to my 10,000 in basketball by the time I graduated high school, and I was never going to be any better than an OK high school player. Other factors were involved (I was slow, but I couldn't jump.) The other thing, and its one that Gladwell doesn't mention. My acting teacher used to define talent as ""the ability to become involved."" In this context, what that means is that if you can devote 10,000 hours of practice and serious concentration to something, that fact alone shows a level of passion and commitment that other people lack. Gladwell makes quite a bit out of Bill Gate's extraordinary opportunities to be around computers before they were widely available. He doesn't make anywhere near as much of what Gates called his ""addiction"" to that computer time. The next element of success is a certain threshold level of ability. Here, Gladwell focuses on IQ, and makes the point that after a certain threshold, IQ tests predict nothing about a person's success. People with the highest IQs are no more likely to win Nobel prizes than others with a fairly high IQ. The same thing goes for SAT and law school entrance scores. Thus, for example, law school affirmative action students get lower scores on the LSAT, and tend to get slightly worse grades in school, but they do just as well as their contemporaries after they get out of school.Sprinkle on top of this a whole lot of luck, or fortuitous timing. The example that Gladwell uses is that about 15 of the 100 richest people in history were all born in the 1830s in the United States. Similarly, the most successful New York Jewish lawyers all tended to be born in the early 1930s. And if you wanted to get really rich in Silicon Valley, you probably needed to be born about 1955. He gives some pretty good arguments for why these things happened, but he also appears here, as well as with some of his other examples, to be cherry-picking the absolute best fits.I'd like to see what Gladwell has to make of the following: Mozart, Beethoven, Haydn, and Schubert were all from a very narrow geographical area, all Austrians, four of the greatest composers of all time. They all lived at very nearly the same time in Vienna. How does something like that happen? Out of all of history, how does so much greatness concentrate itself in both such a narrow area and timeframe? Another similar example: Jerome Kern, Irving Berlin, George Gershwin, Richard Rodgers are four of the towering giants of American songwriting: all of them are from New York City, born within 17 years of each other, and they were all Jewish. Again, how does something like this happen?This leads us to Gladwell's last point: cultural background matters. Gladwell tells a fascinating story of how Korean Air Lines had a rash of crashes. Basically, the reason for the crashes came because the flight crew were uniformly too deferential to the Captain. Planes are safer when an underling can say something like ""There's a mountain right in front of us."" or ""We're running dangerously low on fuel and need to land now."" But my guess is that there are strong cultural reasons that would explain the Vienna musicians, and the New York songwriters. I just don't know what they are.Gladwell also tries to connect the idea that Asian's being good at math with their rice farming. Apparently rice farming takes both a lot of work compared to other farming, and it also takes more thought and planning. This leads to a culture that strongly endorses the work ethic, which in turn leads to better math students. He also claims that these cultures have an advantage because their language more directly models the form of numbers than English and western languages. For example, where we say eleven, the Chinese say ten-one. And twenty-one is two-ten-one.There may be a point here, but I think its a shallow one. This is supposed to be a book about outliers and success stories. Here is an internet ranking of the greatest mathematicians of all time:http://fabpedigree.com/james/mathmen.... Five of the hundred are from China or Japan. None from the other rice growing areas of the world. This is nothing in comparison to the number of French and Germans on the list. Math isn't the kind of field where there would be a strong cultural bias. If the Chinese had been making great discoveries in math, there's no reason to think they wouldn't get credit for it. So, even though Gladwell might have explained why Asian kids get better scores on standardized math tests, that has little to do with the subject he actually said he was going to talk about. The greater question, for me at least, is if Asians are so good at math, why has there been so little development of mathematical knowledge coming out of Asia. In other words, if they are so good at math, why aren't they better mathematicians? I liked this book. I thought it was well written and fun to read. The examples were interesting, but too obviously cherry picked. Much of what's said here is driven home better in Taleb's Fooled by Randomness. But there were some surprising examples and studies that I had not heard before, and Gladwell has a style that makes things both simple and engaging. I would have liked it better if the central idea were a bit more startling, so as it is, it left me feeling that it's just a little slight."
174,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/217489-naeem,5,"Recent class discussions have allowed me to amend my previous rave by including a few criticisms. These I discuss at the end of the review. I have been calling people off the streets to have them listen to the CD version. The book brings out the fascist in me because I wish I could have everyone on the planet read it. Now, today. Why?First, Gladwell takes on the most pernicious, Mobey Dick of a myth: that genius belongs to and emerges from the individual; that such geniuses and self-made men as Carnegies, Mellons, Rockefellers, Mozarts, Beatles, Gates, and Jobs of this world show us that we can in fact ""pull ourselves up by our bootstraps."" You cannot take on such a myth by marshaling facts against it -- mostly you cannot feel facts. Gladwell shows us that such outliers are not outliers at all. What he shows us is how they are embedded within communities, within circumstances, within structures and cultures, within luck that provides them with extraordinary opportunity. He does not mean that they were not skilled or talented. Nor does he mean that they did not work extremely hard. They were and they did. But their skill and hard work were merely necessary, not sufficient conditions for their success. Without the historical circumstance, without the support of their community, without simple, plain, brute luck, their hard work and talent (like yours and mine) gets them no where. So boom! take that you beast of a myth. Second, hundreds and thousands of us make such arguments all day long, 'till we are blue faced, 'till we are weak-kneed and tired. What makes this book so powerful is the WAY Gladwell does it. He does with precise attention to historical context. And he does it with the skills of a fiction writer -- a good fiction writer, not Khaled Hosseini or Ann Patchett. He tells story after story, with the pace and drama of a detective novelist. He refers to social science of all types. But such references are but mere nails that pin down the edges of his sails so that they can capture the narrative energy and convince us that his argument is as moving as the summer breeze.Third, he moves from the cultural embeddedness of individuals in the first part of the book to the affect of culture and inter-generational legacies on individuals in the second part. And here is where the big pay-off is to be found. What does he show? I will tell you. But first let me share the frustration of someone who has been in the classroom for the last 22 years. What can social theory really teach us? Only one thing, I submit, of real importance. Namely that there are these forces, seemingly beyond our control, which make us their puppets, even as we proclaim our freedom, individuality, and self-determination. What forces? The sub-conscious, says Freud. The material effects that result from how a society reproduces itself, say the Scots of the Enlightenment and Marx. Society's compunctions, say Durkheim, Weber, and Giddens. Culture's secret instantiations within our bones and blood, say the anthropologists. The invisible straps of hundreds of past years, say the historians. In a word, structure. Structure is the only thing we teach, the only thing worth teaching. And, damn it, it is also the one thing we cannot seem to get across.Why cannot we get it across? Not because we don't work hard enough or don't have enough creativity. Mostly, because we underestimate the size of the the greatest myth of modernity, of westernization, of capitalism -- (a myth that both Adam Smith and Fredrich Hayek cop to as a deception, even if they call it necessary) the myth of the self-made man; the myth that there is an easy correlation between effort and reward. This myth makes a mockery of structure and and spits bile at teachers and therapists. We can't get structure across because there is a part of us that clings desperately to the myth. We want to believe.Gladwell's is a full out attack on our desire to cling to the myth. Here is what this book gets across: ""structure."" He is a sneaky one this Gladwell fellow. He does it with two brilliantly meshed techniques: a narrative flow that disarms you like only good fiction can, and with a clean, clear, deep understanding of the pervasive presence of ""structure.""I am dancing with joy at the prospect of trying out this book. Naturally, they will resist but that resistance will be oh so tortured. Malcolm Gladwell's fine, fine book will bring intense pressure to bare on our self-deceptions. Not to worry, all this academic stuff I am talking about makes no appearance on the stage of his manuscript. And yet, it is all there. All there. Not there and there, at once. Amendments and Criticisms:Recent class discussions allow me to add the following: Some have suggested that Gladwell's goal is a world where the opportunity to be successful is available to more people and perhaps to everyone. We waste tremendous talent and skill when only a few are given the chance to be successful. If so, he would seem to endorse the equation that correlates effort with reward, rather than to obliterate this equation. This means that Gladwell's purpose is, at best, liberal rather than radical and, at worse, he wants to reform meritocracy and thereby to sustain it. Further, Gladwell implies that the violation of his grandmother by a white man (his grandfather) is the ""gift"" that partly explains both his and his mother's outlier success. Perhaps Gladwell means to use the word ""gift"" ironically, or it could be that he means it. Hard to tell. Either way, his language usage retains a certain ambiguity, an ambiguity that reflects his reformist attitude towards meritocracy. I find myself agreeing with these criticisms. They expose Gladwell to greater searing scrutiny than I had originally managed. Yet, it can be the case that (1) books are smarter than their authors, and (2) books contain deep tensions within their themes. On the one hand, yes, Gladwell seems the liberal reformist. On the other hand, I remain impressed with how far Gladwell's ideas go towards obliterating the myth of meritocracy. Even if he is a reformist, I find his book quite radical.I think the book is smarter than him because it transcends his liberalism. It undermines the core of liberalism and of meritocracy by showing that results are not due to effort. Results are due to many thing -- cultural legacy, fortunate circumstances, systematic skewing of systems towards some people and away from others, and, of course, structure. Rewards are due to many things but not merely the result of effort. If we accept that society lies to us about the nature of effort (by no means an easy thing even after you read this book -- hard to undo a life long lie and and a lie we want to believe), this knowledge can lead us, as my colleague Sean would say, towards creating a ""beloved community."" We take care of each other because we are alive and proximate to each other, and this is enough for each of us to deserve intimate membership in beloved community.The entry cost of this beloved community? Giving up the notion that anything is or is not deserved. "
175,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83348206-zahra-shakarchi,5,"This is my first sociology book I have read yet, but I am glad that this one was, since it discusses many profound topics in an easy way to understand. Gladwell here argues that success is tightly correlated with not only intelligence and hard work, but also opportunity, timing, and luck. He talks about why Asians are good at maths, the hidden lucky factors which made Bill Gates, Mozart, Steve Jobs, and other successful people who they are, the 10,000 hour rule, how background and social status affect the personality and success of people, and how The Beatles are not successful purely because of talent but rather because they had opportunities to practice for many hours in Germany, even though I was not fully convinced with that, since there are many bands and artists who made a name for themselves just as much as the Beatles if not more who didn’t have the same kind of opportunity, or did they? As a person who has grown up in Iraq, I have always felt that one of the most unfortunate aspects of life here is the lack of opportunities for people especially the young to explore, widen their horizons, and discover the kind of intelligence they have which will all contribute to their identity, self-actualization, and how they can put their efforts to make Iraq and the rest of the world a better place.I have thought about how corrupt the school system here is. Imagine Bill Gates, Mozart, Steve Jobs, and members from the Beatles being put from a young age at the same kind of environment that people here is Iraq are forced to put up with. Imagine forcing them to memorize tons of useless information and measure their success, self worth, identity, and future career based on how much they can memorize. Really unfortunate and a waste of potential!"

This book brings forward the idea that success does not just rely on an individual's efforts but also the opportunities provided to them by society. Withstanding years and years of work, put in by the ancestors, to place their children in a position where they can become ""outliers""."
177,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28781546-ana,3,"So this is where the the ""10,000-Hour Rule"" thing comes from. Interesting..."
178,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39637934-randomdots,5,"Read Gladwell for the first time and now I know why he is so highly rated. In one sentence the book can be summarized as - No man, woman or Canadian hockey player is an island. Extraordinary success is the result of an often-unlikely series of opportunities, lucky breaks, and occurrences that combine to create the precise conditions that allow such achievement."
179,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/308912-tucker,4,"Unlike most books on success, Gladwell isn't telling us how to become successful. He's describing who actually does attain success. Academic prowess is one important element. The route to success begins as early as ""birthday cut-offs"" for children entering kindergarten or joining sports teams. The older children are perceived as more talented, and their talent is praised and cultivated until, by the time they finish high school, they really have become more successful. At that point, the important difference is no longer their age, but the opportunities they received and the effort they put in. It is also helpful to be raised by parents who have the money and the interest to nurture their children's thinking skills after school and during vacations. Finally, it helps to grow up in a culture that values hard work and to have the opportunity to practice in one's area of interest. World-class musicians and computer programmers, for example, each put in about 10,000 hours of serious practice time before their gifts and their career trajectories become clear. These factors prove to have a far greater impact on an individual's test scores and academic success than his or her IQ.Another element of success is so-called ""practical intelligence,"" or knowing how to speak up and ask for what you want and need. Good communication skills with one's peers and superiors can help prevent accidents. It is useful to be raised by parents who engaged in meaningful work fueled by labor and innovation and to appreciate the reward that comes with that.And of course there is luck--having the good fortune to be 20 years old, with the business skills of an adult and the flexible mind of a young person, when a seismic technological shift such as the birth of railroads, petroleum, or computers occurs.After finishing the book, I was left with an aftertaste of the ""duh-factor"": of course hard work and luck influence one's chances at success. It didn't produce as much of a mental revolution in me as did his other book,  The Tipping Point. But Gladwell assembled some great anecdotes and mined them well."
180,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5015851-ms-pegasus,5,"OUTLIERS explores the idea of meritocracy with Gladwell's typical focus on aberrational patterns. He begins with an observation about the distribution of birthday months for a professional Canadian hockey team. There is a consistent skewing toward the earliest months in the year. Although he does not explore the probabilities in detail, this fact is especially astonishing since births by month are not evenly distributed, but in fact skewed toward the months in the second half of the year (https://blog.rjmetrics.com/2009/09/14... is one of many websites that cites this distribution). His explanation is persuasive, if not news to parents harboring hopes that their son will be the next Wayne Gretzky (incidentally, a Canadian born in January). Gladwell notes how a few months' advantage of maturity and physical development can reap life-long cumulative advantages: More confidence, more playing time, better coaching, more competitive opportunities, more encouragement.He then shifts his attention to a new thread. One connecting Bill Gates, Bill Joy (co-founder of Sun Microsystems), and The Beatles. This exploration leads him to the “10,000 Hour Rule,” a catchy phrase that has made its way into popular parlance. I was particularly impressed by his mention of Bobby Fischer in this context. Anyone who has read the biography ENDGAME by Frank Brady will find supporting material for Gladwell's ideas.Numerous critics have jumped on this generalization, arguing that it is an oversimplification when taken literally. Gladwell responds to these critics, emphasizing the spirit of his claim (http://www.businessinsider.com/malcol...). In case after case Gladwell poses a prediction based on intuitive ideas about how the world works. In case after case he demonstrates that intuitive ideas are unreliable. The alternative explanations he poses are persuasive, but more important, unexpected.The diversity of his examples make this an entertaining book. The second part of the book shifts gears into an area he calls “Cultural Legacies,” bundles of attitudes subconsciously reinforced through family histories. “Cultural legacies are powerful forces. They have deep roots and long lives. They persist, generation after generation, virtually intact, even as the economic and social and demographic conditions that spawned them have vanished, and they play such a role in directing attitudes and behavior that we cannot make sense of our world without them.” (p.175) The exploration takes Gladwell from Harlan County, Kentucky to South Korea. Between 1988 and 1998 the loss rate for United Airlines was .27/million departures. During the same period the loss rate for Korean Air was 4.79/million departures. (Imagine trying to get “Rainman” aboard a KAL flight!) Gladwell hastens to add that since 1999, KAL's record is spotless, the result of an astonishing turnaround in cockpit training. At its heart was confrontation of a cultural legacy problem — the hierarchical relationship and behaviors between the captain and his subordinates in the flight crew. This was, in fact, my favorite part of the book, and the factor that boosts my rating from 4 to 5 stars. His transcriptions of cockpit recordings are riveting, as each accident scenario unfolds. Readers who have occasion to deal with non-native English speakers, particularly in the software industry, will find ample food for thought.Gladwell's curiosity takes him to many other topics. He looks at the trait of persistence. He questions the role of language in the early mastery of number sense. He examines the effects of summer vacation on academic performance. His restless mind and energetic research stir up contradictions that force the reader to revisit intuitive explanations that are so tempting to grasp. His curiosity is infectious."
181,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/128745-malbadeen,4,"Love him or hate him - whatever. The more I read of his stuff the more I am fascinated by what he does. I think it is so interesting how we can make up a theory and pretty much ascribe all happenings around us as proof that that theory is correct. I do it all the time. My whole family does it, it's how we converse. I think more people do it than are willing to admit and if you read Gladwell with that in mind it is easier to not get so worked up about that fact that he is espousing ideas rather than writing doctoral dissertations that are intended to change the way the world functions. Personally I find myself arguing with/disagreeing with his stuff during a good portion of what he writes but I like arguing so find it mostly enjoyable. In this book Gladwell is attempting to support his belief that successful people are not ""self-made"" but rather the fortunate product of suitable circumstances. A slight variation on ""nature vs. nurture"" nothing new here. I mostly agree with the idea as it fits nicely with my more politically liberal sensibilities but there were several instances when I felt like his words were actually making the counter argument. Specifically in an extended portion about early Jewish immigrants. He seemed to be saying, ""lucky them, they happened to have the right skills at the right time"" while glossing over their relentless attempts to find their own niche.I also found the hairs on my neck raising when he talked about schools. I feel uncomfortable anytime people start suggesting that the solution to closing the achievement gap for the economically disadvantaged and advantaged is to take kids from their families for longer amounts of time. It is troublesome because it doesn't address the larger issue of social inequities on a larger scale and it starts with the presupposition that academic achievement is the pinnacle to which we should all strive to attain and it de-values the role families play in the upbringing of their children. All that being said, I realize this is one book, with one main point and not every conversation can/should end up with a march to the white house demanding social equity for all. But still....maybe just the tiniest nod to the larger issue would have been nice.I was also more than a little aware of the fact that while he attempted to be gracious to groups other than middle and upper class he would throw in statements like, ""....there aren't books lying around her house that she can read if she gets bored. There's *PROBABLY* just a television."" when talking about ""poor"" households and yet there were no ""probablies"" when he spoke about high income households. It was all definite statements of ""positive"" experiences. oh Malcolm. tsk. tsk.(if you've stayed with this ""review"" this long, you should send me your address so I can send you a dollar for your fortitude).So all in all I'd have to say: I disagreed with him a ton but I enjoyed the disagreements and, as always found his writing to be catchy and clever and all that good stuff.*******oh wait, oh wait! note to editors: proof of what a great service you do can be found in the Acknowledgments at the end of this book. I can only assume there is no editorial input for this part as Gladwell used the phrase ""as always"" 4 times on one 1/2 a page! Egads, bring in the editors!!! **********"

“Outliers aren’t outliers…. they are [what they are] not because of some exceptional or heroic individual action on their part but because of whole series of circumstances, environments and cultural legacies.”
 – Malcolm Gladwell in an interview.What is Gladwell essentially saying? He sums up the circumstantial, environmental and cultural reasons for being an outlier in the following ideas:1. Luck has its role to play2. Hard work and enough practice - 10000 hours – makes you good at almost anything 3. IQ doesn’t guarantee success. There exists a concept of IQ threshold. Psychological testing has its limitations4. Being born at the right place, right time helps5. Middle and higher class families typically provide better, nurturing home environments6. Disadvantaged groups have access to fewer opportunities7. If kids put more effort they could fetch better grades 8. Language affects how we organize information9. Culture can shape personality10. Racial discrimination has handicaps associated with it (epilogue)Everything listed above (published in 2008) has either been out there in scientific and pop literature for decades, is scientifically tenuous (10000 hours) or is something that Captain Obvious would state. Gladwell has nothing new to offer, let alone adding an argument to enrich the nature-nurture debate. He ends up trying to convolute it with poorly supported assertions.Part 1 broadly discusses about individuals, who indeed were exceptions. It was still pertinent to the title. In part 2, though, when he discusses the performance of Asians in mathematics or school kids taking California Assessment Battery – he is talking about averages and not outliers per se. Different cultures prepare you for different things - cultural anthropologists established that in the 50s. Rather than comparing westerners and Asians on math performance, he should have addressed the existence of outliers within the oriental culture. That would have made more sense. He lost track in my opinion.He makes sure that not one sentence is spared on confidence, motivation, temperament, personality dimensions, emotional regulation, self-esteem, self-efficacy, interests or learning/ perceptual styles! How did these factors play out in the lives of Gates, Joy or Jobs? Why are 80% of NBA players black? And why is not each one of them a LeBron, a Kobe or a Jordan? He skipped judgment and decision making too. Decisions such as how and where to put effort into could be a critical success factor. I spent 220 minutes on this book. I could have used that time elsewhere. I could have slept or perhaps worked to accumulate those 10000hrs in one of my crafts. Gladwell is not a psychologist; I should have known better. Drivel should have been expected. The only outlier that doesn’t deserve to be one is this book itself. He should write a book on how “Outliers”, a below average text, managed to get a 4+ rating on Goodreads. I gave a star only because of the chapter on ice hockey and the 50 page babble dedicated to pilot communication – which, like so many in this book, was a feeble argument to make for a correlation between cultural legacy and outliers."
183,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1291915-lauren,4,"There were some sections of this book that had me turning the pages so quickly starved for more information, and others that were a little dry. Gladwell has excellent observational skills, and I like his writing style. I enjoyed this book, much like I did with his others. I was particularly happy to see him open with stories about hockey players - as watching hockey is one of my favorite pastimes. However, I went to the NHL page and looked at the birthdays of several of my favorite Canadian players, and they did not seem to follow the same trend as noted in the book. The majority of players I saw were actually born in the summer or in the fall of the year, rather than early in the year. I am not sure what this means for Gladwell's observation, or if the Canadian leagues changed their age limits... I particularly liked the chapters in the middle/end referring to culture and authority figures, etc. in regards to the airline industry. Many times throughout, I found myself thinking ""huh, wow, that is interesting!"" "

She has never done that before so I had to read it, Right? I probably would not have otherwise. I was very surprised how much I enjoyed it. It is well written and entertaining and at the same time informative and educational. Gladwell seems to have a way with drawing out unseen and seen ideas of successful people road to success. He helps his readers perceive familiar information in entirely new ways, a myth-buster if that is a word. In this he tackles the self-made man, pointing out that success stories are a lot more involved than the outside perception. Are the gifted truly gifted? An enlightening read. "
185,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58095391-michelle-scott,4,"As Americans, we tend to think of highly successful individuals, such as Bill Gates, as somehow making their fortunes because of their own innate skills and talents. In fact, we hold the ideal of the self-made man/woman in such high regard that we ignore the facts. In this book, Malcolm Gladwell examines the stories of several very successful people and comes up with some interesting conclusions. It isn't a spring of talent that gushes inside of these outliers, but a combination of hours of drudgery combined with some amazing good luck.The book is well-written and the examples are fascinating. What's lacking is the idea that any of these observations can be learning experiences for the rest of us."

One of the best facets of Atlas Shrugged is its celebration of hard work, the individual human spirit, and achievement. Where it fails is its narrow view of an ideal society based on the value of hard work as purely “us” vs “them”, where those of ability are deified as “ self made men” and damn the rest as lazy, spoiled, or complacent. Malcolm Gladwell, with poignant examples and rational assessments, makes a tremendous case for a broader picture, one in which individual grit and tenacity are indeed a large part of success, but they are only one part. We ignore sociological, cultural, and empathetic factors which contribute to success at our own peril, and the peril of others. I am thankful for its calm and objective study of success to juxtapose with the often angry and callous portrayal of success and virtue which Ayn Rand paints in her opus."

Although all of his stories were very distinct from one another, the context provided to dig down to why someone became successful is remarkable and ties together very nicely. I absolutely recommend reading this book! "
189,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3633211-vikas,5,"Like the subtitle says it's the story of success and provides a wonderful study of successful people and hitting ground running by proving again and again that to be successful along with the person the support area and time period is as important to make sure that the person is successful. Mr. Gladwell takes example from different fields, Sports, Music, IT etc. and prove again and again that their success owed itself to lot of fortunate co-incidents and opportunities which they could utilize. In other words along with the talent these people were there at the right place on the right time and today these guys are Billionaires and superstars. Loved this wonderful book do read it and enjoy.People who don't read generally ask me my reasons for reading. Simply put I just love reading and so to that end I have made it my motto to just Keep on Reading. I love to read everything except for Self Help books but even those once in a while. I read almost all the genre but YA, Fantasy, Biographies are the most. My favorite series is of course Harry Potter but then there are many more books that I just adore. I have bookcases filled with books which are waiting to be read so can't stay and spend more time in this review, so remember I loved reading this and love reading more, you should also read what you love and then just Keep on Reading."

It would have been both inspiring and revealing, something that the Times says it is on the front cover. So I would urge people to read this as early as possible to gain the utmost out of this book.However, for me, there were no new revelations lets alone those revelations being inspiring. The beginning and the conclusion were obvious to anyone who had gone beyond the surface level worship of success stories. The entire book is based on the now known simple fact that there is nothing like a divine and unexpected success. It takes not only the effort of the individual but also his surrounding to cross the finish line before his/her participants.I did, however, find the process of anecdotal argumentation interesting and refreshing. There were a lot of interesting stories of how people have achieved what they have. It does a commendable work of shedding light on the less focused aspect of success, luck. There is a tendency to visualise success as made up of either only hard work or luck. Most success stories depend on a fruitful combination of both. In the case studies mentioned in the book, the luck aspect is defined as the cultural legacy of our family and society in combination with the conducive yet transformative eras.There were a lot of interconnections to be made that would contribute to the enjoyment of the book for me. The chapter on Rice Paddies and Maths had a personal connection to my own maths related issues while the chapter that talked about the feuds in the southern American regions in the first half of the nineteenth century helped me make retrospective sense of the subplot of the Grangerfords and Shepherdsons in The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain. The following points decreased its enjoyment factor for me:1. The book employs a very traditional sense of success in the book which is an economic and productive success. this creates a myopic view of success in life. Although the introductory chapter is an exception by talking about health success, the rest of the book measures success in terms of wealth and fame only. It would have been better to include inventors and discoverers too in the list. 2. This leads to an obvious gender gap visible in the success stories being mentioned that becomes even more prominent due to its very absence. I would have liked the book to address this issue like many others have done. 3. The research at some places seems either too obvious or too simplistic, making me lose confidence in the book. It also sounds instructional rather than inspiring at other places. To give this a positive spin, there are many areas that can be explored further by other people.In short, the book demystifies the success myth as being coincidental and situates it in hard work and cultural legacy of the individuals."
191,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793473-clif-hostetler,5,"This book shows that the stories about self made rugged individualists who are so widely admired are not stories of singularly talented people who took advantage of opportunities. But rather they are stories of talented people who took advantage of singular opportunities. Furthermore, the ability and disposition to work hard is not so much a personal trait as it is a cultural legacy. The author tells numerous true stories of what appears to be shining examples of disadvantaged people who ended up being outstanding success stories. But then the author goes back through the same story and takes a look at where that person came from and shows that they benefited from a combination of a cultural background and set of unique opportunities and timing that allowed them to succeed. The point of the book is not to explain away success stories. But rather it is to learn from these stories, and use this information to help everyone be more productive and successful. The author shows several instances where proactive steps were able to ameliorate the effect of negative cultural legacies.I found this book to be one of the most interesting non-fiction books that I've ever listened to. Some critics of this book have pointed out that the author, Malcolm Gladwell, didn't adhere to strict protocols in his interpretation of data. My response is that this book is for popular consumption, not the academic community. I'm confident that plenty of proper research and analysis will be performed prior to the implementation of major improvements to schools based on Gladwell's recommendations.The following is a copy of the review of this book review taken from the Jaunary 6, 2011 PageADay Book Lover's Calendar:THAT SWEET SMELLMalcolm Gladwell makes sense of yet another aspect of our world in this pleasantly readable account of success and the qualities that lead to it. The question he poses is, Why do the Bill Gateses and Mozarts of the world succeed so brilliantly, while others of the same intelligence and talent end up leading lives of quiet desperation? Using his method of combining the latest academic studies with the most relevant and irresistible stories, Gladwell makes his case that the “outliers” beneft from advantages and opportunities that pass others up. A stimulating read, to say the least.OUTLIERS: THE STORY OF SUCCESS, by Malcolm Gladwell (Little, Brown, 2008)"

And it’s entertaining.I wish I had read this years ago when my children were toddlers. I might have changed some things in how I raised them, not a lot of things, but some decisions might have been different. For example, I might have had them do more academic work in the summers, and felt less guilty about it. But aside from parenting, wow, this is fascinating stuff. The author is a good story teller. He takes an occurrence and analyzes and explains it in an insightful and entertaining way. Most of what he said made sense to me, and I believed him. But I wonder if other experts would have different views. I wonder if there are studies and statistics out there that might say yes this is true in these cases, but it doesn’t apply in all cases. I would have liked seeing arguments on both sides of some of the issues, for example affirmative action at the University of Michigan Law school. He made a statement but he didn’t provide much support for it. On the other hand, too many statistics and opposing views might have made this too dry, less entertaining.It’s a short book.Some of the content:It takes 10,000 hours of practice to become successful at something. It’s not being a genius, it’s practice.Luck is huge element toward success: when one is born, the influence of parents, and one’s culture.The best hockey players are born Jan to March. Geniuses born to poor parents do not do well because their parents don’t show them how to present themselves to the world and how to interact with others. In other words, geniuses need some “emotional IQ” to succeed, but the author doesn’t use that term. S. Korean airlines had more crashes than any other airline because of culture. Copilots were afraid to tell pilots about dangerous plane conditions, because it might sound disrespectful.NARRATOR:The author narrated this book.

193,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/957634-daniel-clausen,4,"It would be easy to fetishize individual greatness and success, but to do so would be a lie. Gladwell takes this simple point and broadens and deepens it with fantastic story-telling. It would be easy to give this book a five-star rating -- but I hesitate to do so. One of the reasons I hesitate is because I've been been duped before. When I was first learning about international affairs, I loved the work of Thomas Friedman. I thought he had a fantastic gift for story-telling and was a very astute observer of international trends. I still do think Friedman is an excellent journalist and popular nonfiction writer; however, as I read more deeply in International Relations, I learned that Thomas Friedman was actually popularizing research that had already been in circulation for a long time that was much richer and more fantastic than he admitted (especially in the International Relations subfield of complex interdependence and other IPE literature). On top of that, Friedman had the nerve to suggest that hedge fund managers were the most insightful observers of international affairs -- an insult that discards the very richness of the literary well that he draws from. For this reason, I have my suspicions about Gladwell's work. Surely, it's better for journalists to be aware of academic work than not to be aware of it. And it is certainly a virtue for work-a-day journalists to read broadly and think through problems like philosophers. But, I worry that like Friedman much of Gladwell's work may just be a popular nonfiction take of even deeper works on the same subject field. In addition, I also worry about the ""value-added"" of his work -- in other words, whether his work contributes something really new to the debate or whether he is just communicating several loosely connected points that were already available in the research. Like Friedman's work, I worry that what I'm reading -- though an entertaining and coherent story -- may be somewhat ""old hat"". Since I'm not a specialist on human development and learning, I can't make this judgment. But what I can say is that the book was a fantastic read (and a pretty quick one too!). "
194,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52500467-whatireallyread,5,"How I felt while reading ""Outliers"":How I feel after finishing ""Outliers"":Honestly, guys, this book is beyond awesome. I recommend it to absolutely everyone. It follows patterns of the human experience backed up by research, it provides data and context. I've seen it shelved as ""self-help"" multiple times, but in fact it's not really ""self-helpey"" at all. It takes examples of great success and great failure and examines it with cold-headed, hard-science, no-nonsense approach. There are absolutely 0 ""steps to success"" chapters, no instructions, no mantras, nothing of the kind. Having said that, the book was very liberating, inspiring and empowering to read. It makes me want to work and learn for 16 hours every day :) It also gave insights into some events in my own life and lives of my family members. Still don't believe it's awesome? Okay. I'll just say it focuses on all of the following:- world cultures - airplane pilots- Beatles- mathematicians and programmers- geniuses- middle-schoolersthe list goes on and on. This book is fire. This book is a ninja. Read this book.P.S. I definitely want to read more about the impact of cultural heritage and language on our everyday life. Any recs?"
195,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/757602-lars-guthrie,5,"Gladwell just gets better for me, going from a general topic of general interest--when a cultural trend takes hold ('The Tipping Point')--to a general topic with a more specific focus that factors into my work with children--the way the brain makes a value judgement ('Blink')--to a specific topic that specifically affects my work--how one's personal history and culture can determine success ('Outliers'). He effectively puts the kibosh on a myth that has particular resonance for Americans--that we make ourselves, that given the will and the work, anybody can be anything. But he doesn't leave it at that. If advantages are a product of culture, he proposes, then we can begin to give those advantages to more by changing the culture. His impassioned plea for a longer school year and a shorter summer vacation was eye-opening. The 'summer slump' well known to educators hits the kids from disadvantaged backgrounds the hardest. I have long felt that real learning is a result of slowing down and letting children discover how things work rather than ""teaching"" them the bullet points we have set as requirements for matriculation. When Gladwell quoted a teacher at a school with a longer academic year who said, ""It seems counterintuitive but we do things at a slower pace and as a result we get through a lot more,"" I stopped reading. And cheered. "
196,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2940271-undrakh,5,"This is not a story of how one hard-working and intelligent man reached to the top all by himself. It's all about what made him successful beyond his own will and talent; some of the factors leading to success were bit unexpected such as a cultural legacy. Those ideas may bring some disappointment to the believers of heroic actions and dramatic rise in people's paths, but they make sense, a lot. This was one of the books which made me take a deep breath, walk around, jump several times, and go back to reading. (I really did, just saying this to express how I feel). The researches, studies, and cases included must been written and discussed for a long time; however, they might have been bit alien to the readers of nonscientific ground. Malcolm Gladwell made it sound so simple and meaningful. There was always a sort of feeling that I was product of my family's meticulous work of crafting my environment to study well and grow up healthy. Those are called the opportunities missed greatly in some others' lives. The successful people had their opportunities too, which can almost be called as sheer luck. There're many other explanations for these people; the stories are just great. It's a really good work of gathering lots of data and information and making a good use of them through insight and a skill of storyteller. "
197,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25032671-kris,2,"Widespread assumptions, anecdotal evidence, emotional appeal. In other words: pop psychology.This felt like even more pop psychology than Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking, which I somewhat enjoyed. But the same errors lay in this book, tenfold. Too much story-telling and not enough evidence. Switching from one scenario to the next without linking things together. Harping on the same point over and over again, without actually expounding upon it. Another review I saw pointed out that he ""infers causation from correlation"" and I totally see that here. It's like Gladwell once again took a topic that should have only been a magazine/journal article, and swelled it into a book.Not impressed. I might still read The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference some day, but that will probably be the last of Gladwell for me."
198,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1757741-kevin,5,"I picked up this book on a whim not knowing anything about it and was captivated by the subject and writing. Malcolm Gladwell explains in an academic yet simple way how seemingly ""self-made"" superstars in business, sports and life are actually the result of hard work, incredible opportunities, culture and timing. From Mozart to the Beatles to Bill Gates to hockey superstars he builds a case for this very theory. Surprisingly fun and a fast read, this book prompts much thought and discussion involving the secrets to success. Outliers is a book that you read out loud to anyone who is nearby (and will listen) and causes you to bring up these examples in conversation. I am not sure I have read a book recently that covers such a thought provoking ideas while reads so smoothly. Gladwell uses such relevant examples that you have a very easy time ""getting it"". I highly recommend this book and have already secured my copies of his other two similar books, Blink and Tipping Point. I highly enjoyed this!"

Anyway, I enjoyed this book that I read a decade or so ago. I don't know if his reputation will be recuperated but this book was interesting enough for me and the writing style wasn't bad. It kept my interest. He is accessible and shows interesting points in what makes for successful outliers. Decent nonfiction. I don't understand the hate."

203,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2729963-duffy-pratt,3,"Gladwell's basic argument is that people can't pull themselves up by their own bootstraps, and that everyone who is successful had some help, and some luck, along the way. Despite Rush Limbaugh's outrage earlier this year when Obama said pretty much the same thing, I don't think that this is a very challenging or distrubing idea. If that was all there was to it, I wouldn't have liked this book at all. But I did like it, mostly because I found quite a bit of fun in the details.What goes into success? First a person is given both a chance and an advantage. Gladwell points to selection bias when we choose kids for advancement amongst those in their age group. This almost always tends to give an advantage to the oldest children within the age group, because the selection process tends to confound maturity with talent. Seventy percent of Canadian professional hockey players are born in the first half of the year. Why? Because when the kids are young, the best kids born in a year are selected for a better league, with more practice time and better coaching. So they start off better because they are older, but quickly become much better because they are given time, attention and praise. The same results apply almost everywhere, and the effects can be seen in things like who goes to college, to even who is more likely to commit suicide. All of this because of some arbitrary line that we draw about age.This is a very interesting idea, but the basic idea behind it is quite simple and old. It's essentially a variation of Virginia Woolf's idea about Shakespeare's sister - equally talented as the bard, but never given a chance because of a basically irrelevant distinction.Next point is that it takes 10,000 hours to become an expert at anything. This is both an extremely powerful rule of thumb, and just plain wrong. Let's start with why its wrong. How long does it take to become an expert at slot machines? There's no answer because there's no such thing. Now how about tic-tac-toe. I haven't played for 10,000 hours, but I can pretty much guarantee that I will bring anyone to at least a tie in that game, no matter how much more experience they have. Some things defy expertise, and some other things are easy to master. But even in the middle ground, I don't think it's so obvious. Until very recently, the longbow was a superior weapon to a rifle/musket in almost every respect. It had a longer range, a better ability to pierce armor, a superior rate of fire. It was cheaper to construct and maintain. But it had a crippling disadvantage. It did actually take 10,000 hours to master the longbow. It took strength, co-ordination, and lots of practice. By contrast, it was possible to train infantry to shoot a rifle in a very short period of time. Thus, the rifle became the weapon of choice for armies because it was easier to master, not because it was better in other ways.The rule of thumb is powerful, however, because it gives an idea of how much practice and commitment is likely to be involved in learning any fulfilling job or hobby. The examples Gladwell gives are classical musician, composer, chess master, and then he asserts that each of his other success stories have also put in their 10,000. There are two caveats here. Even if it might take 10,000 hours to get good at something, that doesn't mean that putting in the hours means that you will get good. I was probably well on my way to my 10,000 in basketball by the time I graduated high school, and I was never going to be any better than an OK high school player. Other factors were involved (I was slow, but I couldn't jump.) The other thing, and its one that Gladwell doesn't mention. My acting teacher used to define talent as ""the ability to become involved."" In this context, what that means is that if you can devote 10,000 hours of practice and serious concentration to something, that fact alone shows a level of passion and commitment that other people lack. Gladwell makes quite a bit out of Bill Gate's extraordinary opportunities to be around computers before they were widely available. He doesn't make anywhere near as much of what Gates called his ""addiction"" to that computer time. The next element of success is a certain threshold level of ability. Here, Gladwell focuses on IQ, and makes the point that after a certain threshold, IQ tests predict nothing about a person's success. People with the highest IQs are no more likely to win Nobel prizes than others with a fairly high IQ. The same thing goes for SAT and law school entrance scores. Thus, for example, law school affirmative action students get lower scores on the LSAT, and tend to get slightly worse grades in school, but they do just as well as their contemporaries after they get out of school.Sprinkle on top of this a whole lot of luck, or fortuitous timing. The example that Gladwell uses is that about 15 of the 100 richest people in history were all born in the 1830s in the United States. Similarly, the most successful New York Jewish lawyers all tended to be born in the early 1930s. And if you wanted to get really rich in Silicon Valley, you probably needed to be born about 1955. He gives some pretty good arguments for why these things happened, but he also appears here, as well as with some of his other examples, to be cherry-picking the absolute best fits.I'd like to see what Gladwell has to make of the following: Mozart, Beethoven, Haydn, and Schubert were all from a very narrow geographical area, all Austrians, four of the greatest composers of all time. They all lived at very nearly the same time in Vienna. How does something like that happen? Out of all of history, how does so much greatness concentrate itself in both such a narrow area and timeframe? Another similar example: Jerome Kern, Irving Berlin, George Gershwin, Richard Rodgers are four of the towering giants of American songwriting: all of them are from New York City, born within 17 years of each other, and they were all Jewish. Again, how does something like this happen?This leads us to Gladwell's last point: cultural background matters. Gladwell tells a fascinating story of how Korean Air Lines had a rash of crashes. Basically, the reason for the crashes came because the flight crew were uniformly too deferential to the Captain. Planes are safer when an underling can say something like ""There's a mountain right in front of us."" or ""We're running dangerously low on fuel and need to land now."" But my guess is that there are strong cultural reasons that would explain the Vienna musicians, and the New York songwriters. I just don't know what they are.Gladwell also tries to connect the idea that Asian's being good at math with their rice farming. Apparently rice farming takes both a lot of work compared to other farming, and it also takes more thought and planning. This leads to a culture that strongly endorses the work ethic, which in turn leads to better math students. He also claims that these cultures have an advantage because their language more directly models the form of numbers than English and western languages. For example, where we say eleven, the Chinese say ten-one. And twenty-one is two-ten-one.There may be a point here, but I think its a shallow one. This is supposed to be a book about outliers and success stories. Here is an internet ranking of the greatest mathematicians of all time:http://fabpedigree.com/james/mathmen.... Five of the hundred are from China or Japan. None from the other rice growing areas of the world. This is nothing in comparison to the number of French and Germans on the list. Math isn't the kind of field where there would be a strong cultural bias. If the Chinese had been making great discoveries in math, there's no reason to think they wouldn't get credit for it. So, even though Gladwell might have explained why Asian kids get better scores on standardized math tests, that has little to do with the subject he actually said he was going to talk about. The greater question, for me at least, is if Asians are so good at math, why has there been so little development of mathematical knowledge coming out of Asia. In other words, if they are so good at math, why aren't they better mathematicians? I liked this book. I thought it was well written and fun to read. The examples were interesting, but too obviously cherry picked. Much of what's said here is driven home better in Taleb's Fooled by Randomness. But there were some surprising examples and studies that I had not heard before, and Gladwell has a style that makes things both simple and engaging. I would have liked it better if the central idea were a bit more startling, so as it is, it left me feeling that it's just a little slight."
204,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/217489-naeem,5,"Recent class discussions have allowed me to amend my previous rave by including a few criticisms. These I discuss at the end of the review. I have been calling people off the streets to have them listen to the CD version. The book brings out the fascist in me because I wish I could have everyone on the planet read it. Now, today. Why?First, Gladwell takes on the most pernicious, Mobey Dick of a myth: that genius belongs to and emerges from the individual; that such geniuses and self-made men as Carnegies, Mellons, Rockefellers, Mozarts, Beatles, Gates, and Jobs of this world show us that we can in fact ""pull ourselves up by our bootstraps."" You cannot take on such a myth by marshaling facts against it -- mostly you cannot feel facts. Gladwell shows us that such outliers are not outliers at all. What he shows us is how they are embedded within communities, within circumstances, within structures and cultures, within luck that provides them with extraordinary opportunity. He does not mean that they were not skilled or talented. Nor does he mean that they did not work extremely hard. They were and they did. But their skill and hard work were merely necessary, not sufficient conditions for their success. Without the historical circumstance, without the support of their community, without simple, plain, brute luck, their hard work and talent (like yours and mine) gets them no where. So boom! take that you beast of a myth. Second, hundreds and thousands of us make such arguments all day long, 'till we are blue faced, 'till we are weak-kneed and tired. What makes this book so powerful is the WAY Gladwell does it. He does with precise attention to historical context. And he does it with the skills of a fiction writer -- a good fiction writer, not Khaled Hosseini or Ann Patchett. He tells story after story, with the pace and drama of a detective novelist. He refers to social science of all types. But such references are but mere nails that pin down the edges of his sails so that they can capture the narrative energy and convince us that his argument is as moving as the summer breeze.Third, he moves from the cultural embeddedness of individuals in the first part of the book to the affect of culture and inter-generational legacies on individuals in the second part. And here is where the big pay-off is to be found. What does he show? I will tell you. But first let me share the frustration of someone who has been in the classroom for the last 22 years. What can social theory really teach us? Only one thing, I submit, of real importance. Namely that there are these forces, seemingly beyond our control, which make us their puppets, even as we proclaim our freedom, individuality, and self-determination. What forces? The sub-conscious, says Freud. The material effects that result from how a society reproduces itself, say the Scots of the Enlightenment and Marx. Society's compunctions, say Durkheim, Weber, and Giddens. Culture's secret instantiations within our bones and blood, say the anthropologists. The invisible straps of hundreds of past years, say the historians. In a word, structure. Structure is the only thing we teach, the only thing worth teaching. And, damn it, it is also the one thing we cannot seem to get across.Why cannot we get it across? Not because we don't work hard enough or don't have enough creativity. Mostly, because we underestimate the size of the the greatest myth of modernity, of westernization, of capitalism -- (a myth that both Adam Smith and Fredrich Hayek cop to as a deception, even if they call it necessary) the myth of the self-made man; the myth that there is an easy correlation between effort and reward. This myth makes a mockery of structure and and spits bile at teachers and therapists. We can't get structure across because there is a part of us that clings desperately to the myth. We want to believe.Gladwell's is a full out attack on our desire to cling to the myth. Here is what this book gets across: ""structure."" He is a sneaky one this Gladwell fellow. He does it with two brilliantly meshed techniques: a narrative flow that disarms you like only good fiction can, and with a clean, clear, deep understanding of the pervasive presence of ""structure.""I am dancing with joy at the prospect of trying out this book. Naturally, they will resist but that resistance will be oh so tortured. Malcolm Gladwell's fine, fine book will bring intense pressure to bare on our self-deceptions. Not to worry, all this academic stuff I am talking about makes no appearance on the stage of his manuscript. And yet, it is all there. All there. Not there and there, at once. Amendments and Criticisms:Recent class discussions allow me to add the following: Some have suggested that Gladwell's goal is a world where the opportunity to be successful is available to more people and perhaps to everyone. We waste tremendous talent and skill when only a few are given the chance to be successful. If so, he would seem to endorse the equation that correlates effort with reward, rather than to obliterate this equation. This means that Gladwell's purpose is, at best, liberal rather than radical and, at worse, he wants to reform meritocracy and thereby to sustain it. Further, Gladwell implies that the violation of his grandmother by a white man (his grandfather) is the ""gift"" that partly explains both his and his mother's outlier success. Perhaps Gladwell means to use the word ""gift"" ironically, or it could be that he means it. Hard to tell. Either way, his language usage retains a certain ambiguity, an ambiguity that reflects his reformist attitude towards meritocracy. I find myself agreeing with these criticisms. They expose Gladwell to greater searing scrutiny than I had originally managed. Yet, it can be the case that (1) books are smarter than their authors, and (2) books contain deep tensions within their themes. On the one hand, yes, Gladwell seems the liberal reformist. On the other hand, I remain impressed with how far Gladwell's ideas go towards obliterating the myth of meritocracy. Even if he is a reformist, I find his book quite radical.I think the book is smarter than him because it transcends his liberalism. It undermines the core of liberalism and of meritocracy by showing that results are not due to effort. Results are due to many thing -- cultural legacy, fortunate circumstances, systematic skewing of systems towards some people and away from others, and, of course, structure. Rewards are due to many things but not merely the result of effort. If we accept that society lies to us about the nature of effort (by no means an easy thing even after you read this book -- hard to undo a life long lie and and a lie we want to believe), this knowledge can lead us, as my colleague Sean would say, towards creating a ""beloved community."" We take care of each other because we are alive and proximate to each other, and this is enough for each of us to deserve intimate membership in beloved community.The entry cost of this beloved community? Giving up the notion that anything is or is not deserved. "
205,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83348206-zahra-shakarchi,5,"This is my first sociology book I have read yet, but I am glad that this one was, since it discusses many profound topics in an easy way to understand. Gladwell here argues that success is tightly correlated with not only intelligence and hard work, but also opportunity, timing, and luck. He talks about why Asians are good at maths, the hidden lucky factors which made Bill Gates, Mozart, Steve Jobs, and other successful people who they are, the 10,000 hour rule, how background and social status affect the personality and success of people, and how The Beatles are not successful purely because of talent but rather because they had opportunities to practice for many hours in Germany, even though I was not fully convinced with that, since there are many bands and artists who made a name for themselves just as much as the Beatles if not more who didn’t have the same kind of opportunity, or did they? As a person who has grown up in Iraq, I have always felt that one of the most unfortunate aspects of life here is the lack of opportunities for people especially the young to explore, widen their horizons, and discover the kind of intelligence they have which will all contribute to their identity, self-actualization, and how they can put their efforts to make Iraq and the rest of the world a better place.I have thought about how corrupt the school system here is. Imagine Bill Gates, Mozart, Steve Jobs, and members from the Beatles being put from a young age at the same kind of environment that people here is Iraq are forced to put up with. Imagine forcing them to memorize tons of useless information and measure their success, self worth, identity, and future career based on how much they can memorize. Really unfortunate and a waste of potential!"

This book brings forward the idea that success does not just rely on an individual's efforts but also the opportunities provided to them by society. Withstanding years and years of work, put in by the ancestors, to place their children in a position where they can become ""outliers""."

208,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39637934-randomdots,5,"Read Gladwell for the first time and now I know why he is so highly rated. In one sentence the book can be summarized as - No man, woman or Canadian hockey player is an island. Extraordinary success is the result of an often-unlikely series of opportunities, lucky breaks, and occurrences that combine to create the precise conditions that allow such achievement."
209,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/308912-tucker,4,"Unlike most books on success, Gladwell isn't telling us how to become successful. He's describing who actually does attain success. Academic prowess is one important element. The route to success begins as early as ""birthday cut-offs"" for children entering kindergarten or joining sports teams. The older children are perceived as more talented, and their talent is praised and cultivated until, by the time they finish high school, they really have become more successful. At that point, the important difference is no longer their age, but the opportunities they received and the effort they put in. It is also helpful to be raised by parents who have the money and the interest to nurture their children's thinking skills after school and during vacations. Finally, it helps to grow up in a culture that values hard work and to have the opportunity to practice in one's area of interest. World-class musicians and computer programmers, for example, each put in about 10,000 hours of serious practice time before their gifts and their career trajectories become clear. These factors prove to have a far greater impact on an individual's test scores and academic success than his or her IQ.Another element of success is so-called ""practical intelligence,"" or knowing how to speak up and ask for what you want and need. Good communication skills with one's peers and superiors can help prevent accidents. It is useful to be raised by parents who engaged in meaningful work fueled by labor and innovation and to appreciate the reward that comes with that.And of course there is luck--having the good fortune to be 20 years old, with the business skills of an adult and the flexible mind of a young person, when a seismic technological shift such as the birth of railroads, petroleum, or computers occurs.After finishing the book, I was left with an aftertaste of the ""duh-factor"": of course hard work and luck influence one's chances at success. It didn't produce as much of a mental revolution in me as did his other book,  The Tipping Point. But Gladwell assembled some great anecdotes and mined them well."
210,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5015851-ms-pegasus,5,"OUTLIERS explores the idea of meritocracy with Gladwell's typical focus on aberrational patterns. He begins with an observation about the distribution of birthday months for a professional Canadian hockey team. There is a consistent skewing toward the earliest months in the year. Although he does not explore the probabilities in detail, this fact is especially astonishing since births by month are not evenly distributed, but in fact skewed toward the months in the second half of the year (https://blog.rjmetrics.com/2009/09/14... is one of many websites that cites this distribution). His explanation is persuasive, if not news to parents harboring hopes that their son will be the next Wayne Gretzky (incidentally, a Canadian born in January). Gladwell notes how a few months' advantage of maturity and physical development can reap life-long cumulative advantages: More confidence, more playing time, better coaching, more competitive opportunities, more encouragement.He then shifts his attention to a new thread. One connecting Bill Gates, Bill Joy (co-founder of Sun Microsystems), and The Beatles. This exploration leads him to the “10,000 Hour Rule,” a catchy phrase that has made its way into popular parlance. I was particularly impressed by his mention of Bobby Fischer in this context. Anyone who has read the biography ENDGAME by Frank Brady will find supporting material for Gladwell's ideas.Numerous critics have jumped on this generalization, arguing that it is an oversimplification when taken literally. Gladwell responds to these critics, emphasizing the spirit of his claim (http://www.businessinsider.com/malcol...). In case after case Gladwell poses a prediction based on intuitive ideas about how the world works. In case after case he demonstrates that intuitive ideas are unreliable. The alternative explanations he poses are persuasive, but more important, unexpected.The diversity of his examples make this an entertaining book. The second part of the book shifts gears into an area he calls “Cultural Legacies,” bundles of attitudes subconsciously reinforced through family histories. “Cultural legacies are powerful forces. They have deep roots and long lives. They persist, generation after generation, virtually intact, even as the economic and social and demographic conditions that spawned them have vanished, and they play such a role in directing attitudes and behavior that we cannot make sense of our world without them.” (p.175) The exploration takes Gladwell from Harlan County, Kentucky to South Korea. Between 1988 and 1998 the loss rate for United Airlines was .27/million departures. During the same period the loss rate for Korean Air was 4.79/million departures. (Imagine trying to get “Rainman” aboard a KAL flight!) Gladwell hastens to add that since 1999, KAL's record is spotless, the result of an astonishing turnaround in cockpit training. At its heart was confrontation of a cultural legacy problem — the hierarchical relationship and behaviors between the captain and his subordinates in the flight crew. This was, in fact, my favorite part of the book, and the factor that boosts my rating from 4 to 5 stars. His transcriptions of cockpit recordings are riveting, as each accident scenario unfolds. Readers who have occasion to deal with non-native English speakers, particularly in the software industry, will find ample food for thought.Gladwell's curiosity takes him to many other topics. He looks at the trait of persistence. He questions the role of language in the early mastery of number sense. He examines the effects of summer vacation on academic performance. His restless mind and energetic research stir up contradictions that force the reader to revisit intuitive explanations that are so tempting to grasp. His curiosity is infectious."
211,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/128745-malbadeen,4,"Love him or hate him - whatever. The more I read of his stuff the more I am fascinated by what he does. I think it is so interesting how we can make up a theory and pretty much ascribe all happenings around us as proof that that theory is correct. I do it all the time. My whole family does it, it's how we converse. I think more people do it than are willing to admit and if you read Gladwell with that in mind it is easier to not get so worked up about that fact that he is espousing ideas rather than writing doctoral dissertations that are intended to change the way the world functions. Personally I find myself arguing with/disagreeing with his stuff during a good portion of what he writes but I like arguing so find it mostly enjoyable. In this book Gladwell is attempting to support his belief that successful people are not ""self-made"" but rather the fortunate product of suitable circumstances. A slight variation on ""nature vs. nurture"" nothing new here. I mostly agree with the idea as it fits nicely with my more politically liberal sensibilities but there were several instances when I felt like his words were actually making the counter argument. Specifically in an extended portion about early Jewish immigrants. He seemed to be saying, ""lucky them, they happened to have the right skills at the right time"" while glossing over their relentless attempts to find their own niche.I also found the hairs on my neck raising when he talked about schools. I feel uncomfortable anytime people start suggesting that the solution to closing the achievement gap for the economically disadvantaged and advantaged is to take kids from their families for longer amounts of time. It is troublesome because it doesn't address the larger issue of social inequities on a larger scale and it starts with the presupposition that academic achievement is the pinnacle to which we should all strive to attain and it de-values the role families play in the upbringing of their children. All that being said, I realize this is one book, with one main point and not every conversation can/should end up with a march to the white house demanding social equity for all. But still....maybe just the tiniest nod to the larger issue would have been nice.I was also more than a little aware of the fact that while he attempted to be gracious to groups other than middle and upper class he would throw in statements like, ""....there aren't books lying around her house that she can read if she gets bored. There's *PROBABLY* just a television."" when talking about ""poor"" households and yet there were no ""probablies"" when he spoke about high income households. It was all definite statements of ""positive"" experiences. oh Malcolm. tsk. tsk.(if you've stayed with this ""review"" this long, you should send me your address so I can send you a dollar for your fortitude).So all in all I'd have to say: I disagreed with him a ton but I enjoyed the disagreements and, as always found his writing to be catchy and clever and all that good stuff.*******oh wait, oh wait! note to editors: proof of what a great service you do can be found in the Acknowledgments at the end of this book. I can only assume there is no editorial input for this part as Gladwell used the phrase ""as always"" 4 times on one 1/2 a page! Egads, bring in the editors!!! **********"

“Outliers aren’t outliers…. they are [what they are] not because of some exceptional or heroic individual action on their part but because of whole series of circumstances, environments and cultural legacies.”
 – Malcolm Gladwell in an interview.What is Gladwell essentially saying? He sums up the circumstantial, environmental and cultural reasons for being an outlier in the following ideas:1. Luck has its role to play2. Hard work and enough practice - 10000 hours – makes you good at almost anything 3. IQ doesn’t guarantee success. There exists a concept of IQ threshold. Psychological testing has its limitations4. Being born at the right place, right time helps5. Middle and higher class families typically provide better, nurturing home environments6. Disadvantaged groups have access to fewer opportunities7. If kids put more effort they could fetch better grades 8. Language affects how we organize information9. Culture can shape personality10. Racial discrimination has handicaps associated with it (epilogue)Everything listed above (published in 2008) has either been out there in scientific and pop literature for decades, is scientifically tenuous (10000 hours) or is something that Captain Obvious would state. Gladwell has nothing new to offer, let alone adding an argument to enrich the nature-nurture debate. He ends up trying to convolute it with poorly supported assertions.Part 1 broadly discusses about individuals, who indeed were exceptions. It was still pertinent to the title. In part 2, though, when he discusses the performance of Asians in mathematics or school kids taking California Assessment Battery – he is talking about averages and not outliers per se. Different cultures prepare you for different things - cultural anthropologists established that in the 50s. Rather than comparing westerners and Asians on math performance, he should have addressed the existence of outliers within the oriental culture. That would have made more sense. He lost track in my opinion.He makes sure that not one sentence is spared on confidence, motivation, temperament, personality dimensions, emotional regulation, self-esteem, self-efficacy, interests or learning/ perceptual styles! How did these factors play out in the lives of Gates, Joy or Jobs? Why are 80% of NBA players black? And why is not each one of them a LeBron, a Kobe or a Jordan? He skipped judgment and decision making too. Decisions such as how and where to put effort into could be a critical success factor. I spent 220 minutes on this book. I could have used that time elsewhere. I could have slept or perhaps worked to accumulate those 10000hrs in one of my crafts. Gladwell is not a psychologist; I should have known better. Drivel should have been expected. The only outlier that doesn’t deserve to be one is this book itself. He should write a book on how “Outliers”, a below average text, managed to get a 4+ rating on Goodreads. I gave a star only because of the chapter on ice hockey and the 50 page babble dedicated to pilot communication – which, like so many in this book, was a feeble argument to make for a correlation between cultural legacy and outliers."
213,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1291915-lauren,4,"There were some sections of this book that had me turning the pages so quickly starved for more information, and others that were a little dry. Gladwell has excellent observational skills, and I like his writing style. I enjoyed this book, much like I did with his others. I was particularly happy to see him open with stories about hockey players - as watching hockey is one of my favorite pastimes. However, I went to the NHL page and looked at the birthdays of several of my favorite Canadian players, and they did not seem to follow the same trend as noted in the book. The majority of players I saw were actually born in the summer or in the fall of the year, rather than early in the year. I am not sure what this means for Gladwell's observation, or if the Canadian leagues changed their age limits... I particularly liked the chapters in the middle/end referring to culture and authority figures, etc. in regards to the airline industry. Many times throughout, I found myself thinking ""huh, wow, that is interesting!"" "
214,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38544962-guy-austin,4,"I really did enjoy this. My daughter, a Junior in college, handed me this book. She has never done that before so I had to read it, Right? I probably would not have otherwise. I was very surprised how much I enjoyed it. It is well written and entertaining and at the same time informative and educational. Gladwell seems to have a way with drawing out unseen and seen ideas of successful people road to success. He helps his readers perceive familiar information in entirely new ways, a myth-buster if that is a word. In this he tackles the self-made man, pointing out that success stories are a lot more involved than the outside perception. Are the gifted truly gifted? An enlightening read. "
215,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58095391-michelle-scott,4,"As Americans, we tend to think of highly successful individuals, such as Bill Gates, as somehow making their fortunes because of their own innate skills and talents. In fact, we hold the ideal of the self-made man/woman in such high regard that we ignore the facts. In this book, Malcolm Gladwell examines the stories of several very successful people and comes up with some interesting conclusions. It isn't a spring of talent that gushes inside of these outliers, but a combination of hours of drudgery combined with some amazing good luck.The book is well-written and the examples are fascinating. What's lacking is the idea that any of these observations can be learning experiences for the rest of us."

217,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30327585-michael-broch,5,"Reading this book so soon after Atlas Shrugged was a lucky break, and gave voice to much I disagreed or was uncomfortable with concerning Ayn Rand’s philosophy—chiefly that selfishness is virtue. One of the best facets of Atlas Shrugged is its celebration of hard work, the individual human spirit, and achievement. Where it fails is its narrow view of an ideal society based on the value of hard work as purely “us” vs “them”, where those of ability are deified as “ self made men” and damn the rest as lazy, spoiled, or complacent. Malcolm Gladwell, with poignant examples and rational assessments, makes a tremendous case for a broader picture, one in which individual grit and tenacity are indeed a large part of success, but they are only one part. We ignore sociological, cultural, and empathetic factors which contribute to success at our own peril, and the peril of others. I am thankful for its calm and objective study of success to juxtapose with the often angry and callous portrayal of success and virtue which Ayn Rand paints in her opus."
218,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/106503484-connor-steckly,4,"Gladwell uses several independent, short historical stories to explain the underlying theme of success being attributed to the conditions and circumstances of the individual. Although all of his stories were very distinct from one another, the context provided to dig down to why someone became successful is remarkable and ties together very nicely. I absolutely recommend reading this book! "
219,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3633211-vikas,5,"Like the subtitle says it's the story of success and provides a wonderful study of successful people and hitting ground running by proving again and again that to be successful along with the person the support area and time period is as important to make sure that the person is successful. Mr. Gladwell takes example from different fields, Sports, Music, IT etc. and prove again and again that their success owed itself to lot of fortunate co-incidents and opportunities which they could utilize. In other words along with the talent these people were there at the right place on the right time and today these guys are Billionaires and superstars. Loved this wonderful book do read it and enjoy.People who don't read generally ask me my reasons for reading. Simply put I just love reading and so to that end I have made it my motto to just Keep on Reading. I love to read everything except for Self Help books but even those once in a while. I read almost all the genre but YA, Fantasy, Biographies are the most. My favorite series is of course Harry Potter but then there are many more books that I just adore. I have bookcases filled with books which are waiting to be read so can't stay and spend more time in this review, so remember I loved reading this and love reading more, you should also read what you love and then just Keep on Reading."
220,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73241274-alokita,3,"caution: a stream of consciousness review I would have been in more awe of this book had I read it at an earlier point in life. It would have been both inspiring and revealing, something that the Times says it is on the front cover. So I would urge people to read this as early as possible to gain the utmost out of this book.However, for me, there were no new revelations lets alone those revelations being inspiring. The beginning and the conclusion were obvious to anyone who had gone beyond the surface level worship of success stories. The entire book is based on the now known simple fact that there is nothing like a divine and unexpected success. It takes not only the effort of the individual but also his surrounding to cross the finish line before his/her participants.I did, however, find the process of anecdotal argumentation interesting and refreshing. There were a lot of interesting stories of how people have achieved what they have. It does a commendable work of shedding light on the less focused aspect of success, luck. There is a tendency to visualise success as made up of either only hard work or luck. Most success stories depend on a fruitful combination of both. In the case studies mentioned in the book, the luck aspect is defined as the cultural legacy of our family and society in combination with the conducive yet transformative eras.There were a lot of interconnections to be made that would contribute to the enjoyment of the book for me. The chapter on Rice Paddies and Maths had a personal connection to my own maths related issues while the chapter that talked about the feuds in the southern American regions in the first half of the nineteenth century helped me make retrospective sense of the subplot of the Grangerfords and Shepherdsons in The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain. The following points decreased its enjoyment factor for me:1. The book employs a very traditional sense of success in the book which is an economic and productive success. this creates a myopic view of success in life. Although the introductory chapter is an exception by talking about health success, the rest of the book measures success in terms of wealth and fame only. It would have been better to include inventors and discoverers too in the list. 2. This leads to an obvious gender gap visible in the success stories being mentioned that becomes even more prominent due to its very absence. I would have liked the book to address this issue like many others have done. 3. The research at some places seems either too obvious or too simplistic, making me lose confidence in the book. It also sounds instructional rather than inspiring at other places. To give this a positive spin, there are many areas that can be explored further by other people.In short, the book demystifies the success myth as being coincidental and situates it in hard work and cultural legacy of the individuals."
221,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793473-clif-hostetler,5,"This book shows that the stories about self made rugged individualists who are so widely admired are not stories of singularly talented people who took advantage of opportunities. But rather they are stories of talented people who took advantage of singular opportunities. Furthermore, the ability and disposition to work hard is not so much a personal trait as it is a cultural legacy. The author tells numerous true stories of what appears to be shining examples of disadvantaged people who ended up being outstanding success stories. But then the author goes back through the same story and takes a look at where that person came from and shows that they benefited from a combination of a cultural background and set of unique opportunities and timing that allowed them to succeed. The point of the book is not to explain away success stories. But rather it is to learn from these stories, and use this information to help everyone be more productive and successful. The author shows several instances where proactive steps were able to ameliorate the effect of negative cultural legacies.I found this book to be one of the most interesting non-fiction books that I've ever listened to. Some critics of this book have pointed out that the author, Malcolm Gladwell, didn't adhere to strict protocols in his interpretation of data. My response is that this book is for popular consumption, not the academic community. I'm confident that plenty of proper research and analysis will be performed prior to the implementation of major improvements to schools based on Gladwell's recommendations.The following is a copy of the review of this book review taken from the Jaunary 6, 2011 PageADay Book Lover's Calendar:THAT SWEET SMELLMalcolm Gladwell makes sense of yet another aspect of our world in this pleasantly readable account of success and the qualities that lead to it. The question he poses is, Why do the Bill Gateses and Mozarts of the world succeed so brilliantly, while others of the same intelligence and talent end up leading lives of quiet desperation? Using his method of combining the latest academic studies with the most relevant and irresistible stories, Gladwell makes his case that the “outliers” beneft from advantages and opportunities that pass others up. A stimulating read, to say the least.OUTLIERS: THE STORY OF SUCCESS, by Malcolm Gladwell (Little, Brown, 2008)"

And it’s entertaining.I wish I had read this years ago when my children were toddlers. I might have changed some things in how I raised them, not a lot of things, but some decisions might have been different. For example, I might have had them do more academic work in the summers, and felt less guilty about it. But aside from parenting, wow, this is fascinating stuff. The author is a good story teller. He takes an occurrence and analyzes and explains it in an insightful and entertaining way. Most of what he said made sense to me, and I believed him. But I wonder if other experts would have different views. I wonder if there are studies and statistics out there that might say yes this is true in these cases, but it doesn’t apply in all cases. I would have liked seeing arguments on both sides of some of the issues, for example affirmative action at the University of Michigan Law school. He made a statement but he didn’t provide much support for it. On the other hand, too many statistics and opposing views might have made this too dry, less entertaining.It’s a short book.Some of the content:It takes 10,000 hours of practice to become successful at something. It’s not being a genius, it’s practice.Luck is huge element toward success: when one is born, the influence of parents, and one’s culture.The best hockey players are born Jan to March. Geniuses born to poor parents do not do well because their parents don’t show them how to present themselves to the world and how to interact with others. In other words, geniuses need some “emotional IQ” to succeed, but the author doesn’t use that term. S. Korean airlines had more crashes than any other airline because of culture. Copilots were afraid to tell pilots about dangerous plane conditions, because it might sound disrespectful.NARRATOR:The author narrated this book.

223,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/957634-daniel-clausen,4,"It would be easy to fetishize individual greatness and success, but to do so would be a lie. Gladwell takes this simple point and broadens and deepens it with fantastic story-telling. It would be easy to give this book a five-star rating -- but I hesitate to do so. One of the reasons I hesitate is because I've been been duped before. When I was first learning about international affairs, I loved the work of Thomas Friedman. I thought he had a fantastic gift for story-telling and was a very astute observer of international trends. I still do think Friedman is an excellent journalist and popular nonfiction writer; however, as I read more deeply in International Relations, I learned that Thomas Friedman was actually popularizing research that had already been in circulation for a long time that was much richer and more fantastic than he admitted (especially in the International Relations subfield of complex interdependence and other IPE literature). On top of that, Friedman had the nerve to suggest that hedge fund managers were the most insightful observers of international affairs -- an insult that discards the very richness of the literary well that he draws from. For this reason, I have my suspicions about Gladwell's work. Surely, it's better for journalists to be aware of academic work than not to be aware of it. And it is certainly a virtue for work-a-day journalists to read broadly and think through problems like philosophers. But, I worry that like Friedman much of Gladwell's work may just be a popular nonfiction take of even deeper works on the same subject field. In addition, I also worry about the ""value-added"" of his work -- in other words, whether his work contributes something really new to the debate or whether he is just communicating several loosely connected points that were already available in the research. Like Friedman's work, I worry that what I'm reading -- though an entertaining and coherent story -- may be somewhat ""old hat"". Since I'm not a specialist on human development and learning, I can't make this judgment. But what I can say is that the book was a fantastic read (and a pretty quick one too!). "

I recommend it to absolutely everyone. It follows patterns of the human experience backed up by research, it provides data and context. I've seen it shelved as ""self-help"" multiple times, but in fact it's not really ""self-helpey"" at all. It takes examples of great success and great failure and examines it with cold-headed, hard-science, no-nonsense approach. There are absolutely 0 ""steps to success"" chapters, no instructions, no mantras, nothing of the kind. Having said that, the book was very liberating, inspiring and empowering to read. It makes me want to work and learn for 16 hours every day :) It also gave insights into some events in my own life and lives of my family members. Still don't believe it's awesome? Okay. I'll just say it focuses on all of the following:- world cultures - airplane pilots- Beatles- mathematicians and programmers- geniuses- middle-schoolersthe list goes on and on. This book is fire. This book is a ninja. Read this book.P.S. I definitely want to read more about the impact of cultural heritage and language on our everyday life. Any recs?"
225,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/757602-lars-guthrie,5,"Gladwell just gets better for me, going from a general topic of general interest--when a cultural trend takes hold ('The Tipping Point')--to a general topic with a more specific focus that factors into my work with children--the way the brain makes a value judgement ('Blink')--to a specific topic that specifically affects my work--how one's personal history and culture can determine success ('Outliers'). He effectively puts the kibosh on a myth that has particular resonance for Americans--that we make ourselves, that given the will and the work, anybody can be anything. But he doesn't leave it at that. If advantages are a product of culture, he proposes, then we can begin to give those advantages to more by changing the culture. His impassioned plea for a longer school year and a shorter summer vacation was eye-opening. The 'summer slump' well known to educators hits the kids from disadvantaged backgrounds the hardest. I have long felt that real learning is a result of slowing down and letting children discover how things work rather than ""teaching"" them the bullet points we have set as requirements for matriculation. When Gladwell quoted a teacher at a school with a longer academic year who said, ""It seems counterintuitive but we do things at a slower pace and as a result we get through a lot more,"" I stopped reading. And cheered. "
226,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2940271-undrakh,5,"This is not a story of how one hard-working and intelligent man reached to the top all by himself. It's all about what made him successful beyond his own will and talent; some of the factors leading to success were bit unexpected such as a cultural legacy. Those ideas may bring some disappointment to the believers of heroic actions and dramatic rise in people's paths, but they make sense, a lot. This was one of the books which made me take a deep breath, walk around, jump several times, and go back to reading. (I really did, just saying this to express how I feel). The researches, studies, and cases included must been written and discussed for a long time; however, they might have been bit alien to the readers of nonscientific ground. Malcolm Gladwell made it sound so simple and meaningful. There was always a sort of feeling that I was product of my family's meticulous work of crafting my environment to study well and grow up healthy. Those are called the opportunities missed greatly in some others' lives. The successful people had their opportunities too, which can almost be called as sheer luck. There're many other explanations for these people; the stories are just great. It's a really good work of gathering lots of data and information and making a good use of them through insight and a skill of storyteller. "
227,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25032671-kris,2,"Widespread assumptions, anecdotal evidence, emotional appeal. In other words: pop psychology.This felt like even more pop psychology than Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking, which I somewhat enjoyed. But the same errors lay in this book, tenfold. Too much story-telling and not enough evidence. Switching from one scenario to the next without linking things together. Harping on the same point over and over again, without actually expounding upon it. Another review I saw pointed out that he ""infers causation from correlation"" and I totally see that here. It's like Gladwell once again took a topic that should have only been a magazine/journal article, and swelled it into a book.Not impressed. I might still read The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference some day, but that will probably be the last of Gladwell for me."
228,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1757741-kevin,5,"I picked up this book on a whim not knowing anything about it and was captivated by the subject and writing. Malcolm Gladwell explains in an academic yet simple way how seemingly ""self-made"" superstars in business, sports and life are actually the result of hard work, incredible opportunities, culture and timing. From Mozart to the Beatles to Bill Gates to hockey superstars he builds a case for this very theory. Surprisingly fun and a fast read, this book prompts much thought and discussion involving the secrets to success. Outliers is a book that you read out loud to anyone who is nearby (and will listen) and causes you to bring up these examples in conversation. I am not sure I have read a book recently that covers such a thought provoking ideas while reads so smoothly. Gladwell uses such relevant examples that you have a very easy time ""getting it"". I highly recommend this book and have already secured my copies of his other two similar books, Blink and Tipping Point. I highly enjoyed this!"
229,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,5," I know Gladwell gets a lot of hate these days. I guess he has fallen out of fashion. Anyway, I enjoyed this book that I read a decade or so ago. I don't know if his reputation will be recuperated but this book was interesting enough for me and the writing style wasn't bad. It kept my interest. He is accessible and shows interesting points in what makes for successful outliers. Decent nonfiction. I don't understand the hate."
230,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4719513-ali-sattari,4,"There were some painful moments, about individual's social class and cultural heritage, that somehow found it's way to my feels (ouch!)I guess some of over-generalization can be scrutinized by someone like N.N.Taleb, but it tries to introduce a new perspective that is valuable on it's own, mostly regardless of statistical accuracy of examples."

232,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34203976-sundus,4,"What a thought provoking, inspiring and entertaining book !!! My first read of Gladwell and I believe he is an excellent writer. Thoroughly enjoyed it from the beginning to end. Recommended to all"
233,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2729963-duffy-pratt,3,"Gladwell's basic argument is that people can't pull themselves up by their own bootstraps, and that everyone who is successful had some help, and some luck, along the way. Despite Rush Limbaugh's outrage earlier this year when Obama said pretty much the same thing, I don't think that this is a very challenging or distrubing idea. If that was all there was to it, I wouldn't have liked this book at all. But I did like it, mostly because I found quite a bit of fun in the details.What goes into success? First a person is given both a chance and an advantage. Gladwell points to selection bias when we choose kids for advancement amongst those in their age group. This almost always tends to give an advantage to the oldest children within the age group, because the selection process tends to confound maturity with talent. Seventy percent of Canadian professional hockey players are born in the first half of the year. Why? Because when the kids are young, the best kids born in a year are selected for a better league, with more practice time and better coaching. So they start off better because they are older, but quickly become much better because they are given time, attention and praise. The same results apply almost everywhere, and the effects can be seen in things like who goes to college, to even who is more likely to commit suicide. All of this because of some arbitrary line that we draw about age.This is a very interesting idea, but the basic idea behind it is quite simple and old. It's essentially a variation of Virginia Woolf's idea about Shakespeare's sister - equally talented as the bard, but never given a chance because of a basically irrelevant distinction.Next point is that it takes 10,000 hours to become an expert at anything. This is both an extremely powerful rule of thumb, and just plain wrong. Let's start with why its wrong. How long does it take to become an expert at slot machines? There's no answer because there's no such thing. Now how about tic-tac-toe. I haven't played for 10,000 hours, but I can pretty much guarantee that I will bring anyone to at least a tie in that game, no matter how much more experience they have. Some things defy expertise, and some other things are easy to master. But even in the middle ground, I don't think it's so obvious. Until very recently, the longbow was a superior weapon to a rifle/musket in almost every respect. It had a longer range, a better ability to pierce armor, a superior rate of fire. It was cheaper to construct and maintain. But it had a crippling disadvantage. It did actually take 10,000 hours to master the longbow. It took strength, co-ordination, and lots of practice. By contrast, it was possible to train infantry to shoot a rifle in a very short period of time. Thus, the rifle became the weapon of choice for armies because it was easier to master, not because it was better in other ways.The rule of thumb is powerful, however, because it gives an idea of how much practice and commitment is likely to be involved in learning any fulfilling job or hobby. The examples Gladwell gives are classical musician, composer, chess master, and then he asserts that each of his other success stories have also put in their 10,000. There are two caveats here. Even if it might take 10,000 hours to get good at something, that doesn't mean that putting in the hours means that you will get good. I was probably well on my way to my 10,000 in basketball by the time I graduated high school, and I was never going to be any better than an OK high school player. Other factors were involved (I was slow, but I couldn't jump.) The other thing, and its one that Gladwell doesn't mention. My acting teacher used to define talent as ""the ability to become involved."" In this context, what that means is that if you can devote 10,000 hours of practice and serious concentration to something, that fact alone shows a level of passion and commitment that other people lack. Gladwell makes quite a bit out of Bill Gate's extraordinary opportunities to be around computers before they were widely available. He doesn't make anywhere near as much of what Gates called his ""addiction"" to that computer time. The next element of success is a certain threshold level of ability. Here, Gladwell focuses on IQ, and makes the point that after a certain threshold, IQ tests predict nothing about a person's success. People with the highest IQs are no more likely to win Nobel prizes than others with a fairly high IQ. The same thing goes for SAT and law school entrance scores. Thus, for example, law school affirmative action students get lower scores on the LSAT, and tend to get slightly worse grades in school, but they do just as well as their contemporaries after they get out of school.Sprinkle on top of this a whole lot of luck, or fortuitous timing. The example that Gladwell uses is that about 15 of the 100 richest people in history were all born in the 1830s in the United States. Similarly, the most successful New York Jewish lawyers all tended to be born in the early 1930s. And if you wanted to get really rich in Silicon Valley, you probably needed to be born about 1955. He gives some pretty good arguments for why these things happened, but he also appears here, as well as with some of his other examples, to be cherry-picking the absolute best fits.I'd like to see what Gladwell has to make of the following: Mozart, Beethoven, Haydn, and Schubert were all from a very narrow geographical area, all Austrians, four of the greatest composers of all time. They all lived at very nearly the same time in Vienna. How does something like that happen? Out of all of history, how does so much greatness concentrate itself in both such a narrow area and timeframe? Another similar example: Jerome Kern, Irving Berlin, George Gershwin, Richard Rodgers are four of the towering giants of American songwriting: all of them are from New York City, born within 17 years of each other, and they were all Jewish. Again, how does something like this happen?This leads us to Gladwell's last point: cultural background matters. Gladwell tells a fascinating story of how Korean Air Lines had a rash of crashes. Basically, the reason for the crashes came because the flight crew were uniformly too deferential to the Captain. Planes are safer when an underling can say something like ""There's a mountain right in front of us."" or ""We're running dangerously low on fuel and need to land now."" But my guess is that there are strong cultural reasons that would explain the Vienna musicians, and the New York songwriters. I just don't know what they are.Gladwell also tries to connect the idea that Asian's being good at math with their rice farming. Apparently rice farming takes both a lot of work compared to other farming, and it also takes more thought and planning. This leads to a culture that strongly endorses the work ethic, which in turn leads to better math students. He also claims that these cultures have an advantage because their language more directly models the form of numbers than English and western languages. For example, where we say eleven, the Chinese say ten-one. And twenty-one is two-ten-one.There may be a point here, but I think its a shallow one. This is supposed to be a book about outliers and success stories. Here is an internet ranking of the greatest mathematicians of all time:http://fabpedigree.com/james/mathmen.... Five of the hundred are from China or Japan. None from the other rice growing areas of the world. This is nothing in comparison to the number of French and Germans on the list. Math isn't the kind of field where there would be a strong cultural bias. If the Chinese had been making great discoveries in math, there's no reason to think they wouldn't get credit for it. So, even though Gladwell might have explained why Asian kids get better scores on standardized math tests, that has little to do with the subject he actually said he was going to talk about. The greater question, for me at least, is if Asians are so good at math, why has there been so little development of mathematical knowledge coming out of Asia. In other words, if they are so good at math, why aren't they better mathematicians? I liked this book. I thought it was well written and fun to read. The examples were interesting, but too obviously cherry picked. Much of what's said here is driven home better in Taleb's Fooled by Randomness. But there were some surprising examples and studies that I had not heard before, and Gladwell has a style that makes things both simple and engaging. I would have liked it better if the central idea were a bit more startling, so as it is, it left me feeling that it's just a little slight."
234,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/217489-naeem,5,"Recent class discussions have allowed me to amend my previous rave by including a few criticisms. These I discuss at the end of the review. I have been calling people off the streets to have them listen to the CD version. The book brings out the fascist in me because I wish I could have everyone on the planet read it. Now, today. Why?First, Gladwell takes on the most pernicious, Mobey Dick of a myth: that genius belongs to and emerges from the individual; that such geniuses and self-made men as Carnegies, Mellons, Rockefellers, Mozarts, Beatles, Gates, and Jobs of this world show us that we can in fact ""pull ourselves up by our bootstraps."" You cannot take on such a myth by marshaling facts against it -- mostly you cannot feel facts. Gladwell shows us that such outliers are not outliers at all. What he shows us is how they are embedded within communities, within circumstances, within structures and cultures, within luck that provides them with extraordinary opportunity. He does not mean that they were not skilled or talented. Nor does he mean that they did not work extremely hard. They were and they did. But their skill and hard work were merely necessary, not sufficient conditions for their success. Without the historical circumstance, without the support of their community, without simple, plain, brute luck, their hard work and talent (like yours and mine) gets them no where. So boom! take that you beast of a myth. Second, hundreds and thousands of us make such arguments all day long, 'till we are blue faced, 'till we are weak-kneed and tired. What makes this book so powerful is the WAY Gladwell does it. He does with precise attention to historical context. And he does it with the skills of a fiction writer -- a good fiction writer, not Khaled Hosseini or Ann Patchett. He tells story after story, with the pace and drama of a detective novelist. He refers to social science of all types. But such references are but mere nails that pin down the edges of his sails so that they can capture the narrative energy and convince us that his argument is as moving as the summer breeze.Third, he moves from the cultural embeddedness of individuals in the first part of the book to the affect of culture and inter-generational legacies on individuals in the second part. And here is where the big pay-off is to be found. What does he show? I will tell you. But first let me share the frustration of someone who has been in the classroom for the last 22 years. What can social theory really teach us? Only one thing, I submit, of real importance. Namely that there are these forces, seemingly beyond our control, which make us their puppets, even as we proclaim our freedom, individuality, and self-determination. What forces? The sub-conscious, says Freud. The material effects that result from how a society reproduces itself, say the Scots of the Enlightenment and Marx. Society's compunctions, say Durkheim, Weber, and Giddens. Culture's secret instantiations within our bones and blood, say the anthropologists. The invisible straps of hundreds of past years, say the historians. In a word, structure. Structure is the only thing we teach, the only thing worth teaching. And, damn it, it is also the one thing we cannot seem to get across.Why cannot we get it across? Not because we don't work hard enough or don't have enough creativity. Mostly, because we underestimate the size of the the greatest myth of modernity, of westernization, of capitalism -- (a myth that both Adam Smith and Fredrich Hayek cop to as a deception, even if they call it necessary) the myth of the self-made man; the myth that there is an easy correlation between effort and reward. This myth makes a mockery of structure and and spits bile at teachers and therapists. We can't get structure across because there is a part of us that clings desperately to the myth. We want to believe.Gladwell's is a full out attack on our desire to cling to the myth. Here is what this book gets across: ""structure."" He is a sneaky one this Gladwell fellow. He does it with two brilliantly meshed techniques: a narrative flow that disarms you like only good fiction can, and with a clean, clear, deep understanding of the pervasive presence of ""structure.""I am dancing with joy at the prospect of trying out this book. Naturally, they will resist but that resistance will be oh so tortured. Malcolm Gladwell's fine, fine book will bring intense pressure to bare on our self-deceptions. Not to worry, all this academic stuff I am talking about makes no appearance on the stage of his manuscript. And yet, it is all there. All there. Not there and there, at once. Amendments and Criticisms:Recent class discussions allow me to add the following: Some have suggested that Gladwell's goal is a world where the opportunity to be successful is available to more people and perhaps to everyone. We waste tremendous talent and skill when only a few are given the chance to be successful. If so, he would seem to endorse the equation that correlates effort with reward, rather than to obliterate this equation. This means that Gladwell's purpose is, at best, liberal rather than radical and, at worse, he wants to reform meritocracy and thereby to sustain it. Further, Gladwell implies that the violation of his grandmother by a white man (his grandfather) is the ""gift"" that partly explains both his and his mother's outlier success. Perhaps Gladwell means to use the word ""gift"" ironically, or it could be that he means it. Hard to tell. Either way, his language usage retains a certain ambiguity, an ambiguity that reflects his reformist attitude towards meritocracy. I find myself agreeing with these criticisms. They expose Gladwell to greater searing scrutiny than I had originally managed. Yet, it can be the case that (1) books are smarter than their authors, and (2) books contain deep tensions within their themes. On the one hand, yes, Gladwell seems the liberal reformist. On the other hand, I remain impressed with how far Gladwell's ideas go towards obliterating the myth of meritocracy. Even if he is a reformist, I find his book quite radical.I think the book is smarter than him because it transcends his liberalism. It undermines the core of liberalism and of meritocracy by showing that results are not due to effort. Results are due to many thing -- cultural legacy, fortunate circumstances, systematic skewing of systems towards some people and away from others, and, of course, structure. Rewards are due to many things but not merely the result of effort. If we accept that society lies to us about the nature of effort (by no means an easy thing even after you read this book -- hard to undo a life long lie and and a lie we want to believe), this knowledge can lead us, as my colleague Sean would say, towards creating a ""beloved community."" We take care of each other because we are alive and proximate to each other, and this is enough for each of us to deserve intimate membership in beloved community.The entry cost of this beloved community? Giving up the notion that anything is or is not deserved. "
235,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83348206-zahra-shakarchi,5,"This is my first sociology book I have read yet, but I am glad that this one was, since it discusses many profound topics in an easy way to understand. Gladwell here argues that success is tightly correlated with not only intelligence and hard work, but also opportunity, timing, and luck. He talks about why Asians are good at maths, the hidden lucky factors which made Bill Gates, Mozart, Steve Jobs, and other successful people who they are, the 10,000 hour rule, how background and social status affect the personality and success of people, and how The Beatles are not successful purely because of talent but rather because they had opportunities to practice for many hours in Germany, even though I was not fully convinced with that, since there are many bands and artists who made a name for themselves just as much as the Beatles if not more who didn’t have the same kind of opportunity, or did they? As a person who has grown up in Iraq, I have always felt that one of the most unfortunate aspects of life here is the lack of opportunities for people especially the young to explore, widen their horizons, and discover the kind of intelligence they have which will all contribute to their identity, self-actualization, and how they can put their efforts to make Iraq and the rest of the world a better place.I have thought about how corrupt the school system here is. Imagine Bill Gates, Mozart, Steve Jobs, and members from the Beatles being put from a young age at the same kind of environment that people here is Iraq are forced to put up with. Imagine forcing them to memorize tons of useless information and measure their success, self worth, identity, and future career based on how much they can memorize. Really unfortunate and a waste of potential!"

This book brings forward the idea that success does not just rely on an individual's efforts but also the opportunities provided to them by society. Withstanding years and years of work, put in by the ancestors, to place their children in a position where they can become ""outliers""."

238,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39637934-randomdots,5,"Read Gladwell for the first time and now I know why he is so highly rated. In one sentence the book can be summarized as - No man, woman or Canadian hockey player is an island. Extraordinary success is the result of an often-unlikely series of opportunities, lucky breaks, and occurrences that combine to create the precise conditions that allow such achievement."
239,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/308912-tucker,4,"Unlike most books on success, Gladwell isn't telling us how to become successful. He's describing who actually does attain success. Academic prowess is one important element. The route to success begins as early as ""birthday cut-offs"" for children entering kindergarten or joining sports teams. The older children are perceived as more talented, and their talent is praised and cultivated until, by the time they finish high school, they really have become more successful. At that point, the important difference is no longer their age, but the opportunities they received and the effort they put in. It is also helpful to be raised by parents who have the money and the interest to nurture their children's thinking skills after school and during vacations. Finally, it helps to grow up in a culture that values hard work and to have the opportunity to practice in one's area of interest. World-class musicians and computer programmers, for example, each put in about 10,000 hours of serious practice time before their gifts and their career trajectories become clear. These factors prove to have a far greater impact on an individual's test scores and academic success than his or her IQ.Another element of success is so-called ""practical intelligence,"" or knowing how to speak up and ask for what you want and need. Good communication skills with one's peers and superiors can help prevent accidents. It is useful to be raised by parents who engaged in meaningful work fueled by labor and innovation and to appreciate the reward that comes with that.And of course there is luck--having the good fortune to be 20 years old, with the business skills of an adult and the flexible mind of a young person, when a seismic technological shift such as the birth of railroads, petroleum, or computers occurs.After finishing the book, I was left with an aftertaste of the ""duh-factor"": of course hard work and luck influence one's chances at success. It didn't produce as much of a mental revolution in me as did his other book,  The Tipping Point. But Gladwell assembled some great anecdotes and mined them well."
240,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5015851-ms-pegasus,5,"OUTLIERS explores the idea of meritocracy with Gladwell's typical focus on aberrational patterns. He begins with an observation about the distribution of birthday months for a professional Canadian hockey team. There is a consistent skewing toward the earliest months in the year. Although he does not explore the probabilities in detail, this fact is especially astonishing since births by month are not evenly distributed, but in fact skewed toward the months in the second half of the year (https://blog.rjmetrics.com/2009/09/14... is one of many websites that cites this distribution). His explanation is persuasive, if not news to parents harboring hopes that their son will be the next Wayne Gretzky (incidentally, a Canadian born in January). Gladwell notes how a few months' advantage of maturity and physical development can reap life-long cumulative advantages: More confidence, more playing time, better coaching, more competitive opportunities, more encouragement.He then shifts his attention to a new thread. One connecting Bill Gates, Bill Joy (co-founder of Sun Microsystems), and The Beatles. This exploration leads him to the “10,000 Hour Rule,” a catchy phrase that has made its way into popular parlance. I was particularly impressed by his mention of Bobby Fischer in this context. Anyone who has read the biography ENDGAME by Frank Brady will find supporting material for Gladwell's ideas.Numerous critics have jumped on this generalization, arguing that it is an oversimplification when taken literally. Gladwell responds to these critics, emphasizing the spirit of his claim (http://www.businessinsider.com/malcol...). In case after case Gladwell poses a prediction based on intuitive ideas about how the world works. In case after case he demonstrates that intuitive ideas are unreliable. The alternative explanations he poses are persuasive, but more important, unexpected.The diversity of his examples make this an entertaining book. The second part of the book shifts gears into an area he calls “Cultural Legacies,” bundles of attitudes subconsciously reinforced through family histories. “Cultural legacies are powerful forces. They have deep roots and long lives. They persist, generation after generation, virtually intact, even as the economic and social and demographic conditions that spawned them have vanished, and they play such a role in directing attitudes and behavior that we cannot make sense of our world without them.” (p.175) The exploration takes Gladwell from Harlan County, Kentucky to South Korea. Between 1988 and 1998 the loss rate for United Airlines was .27/million departures. During the same period the loss rate for Korean Air was 4.79/million departures. (Imagine trying to get “Rainman” aboard a KAL flight!) Gladwell hastens to add that since 1999, KAL's record is spotless, the result of an astonishing turnaround in cockpit training. At its heart was confrontation of a cultural legacy problem — the hierarchical relationship and behaviors between the captain and his subordinates in the flight crew. This was, in fact, my favorite part of the book, and the factor that boosts my rating from 4 to 5 stars. His transcriptions of cockpit recordings are riveting, as each accident scenario unfolds. Readers who have occasion to deal with non-native English speakers, particularly in the software industry, will find ample food for thought.Gladwell's curiosity takes him to many other topics. He looks at the trait of persistence. He questions the role of language in the early mastery of number sense. He examines the effects of summer vacation on academic performance. His restless mind and energetic research stir up contradictions that force the reader to revisit intuitive explanations that are so tempting to grasp. His curiosity is infectious."
241,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/128745-malbadeen,4,"Love him or hate him - whatever. The more I read of his stuff the more I am fascinated by what he does. I think it is so interesting how we can make up a theory and pretty much ascribe all happenings around us as proof that that theory is correct. I do it all the time. My whole family does it, it's how we converse. I think more people do it than are willing to admit and if you read Gladwell with that in mind it is easier to not get so worked up about that fact that he is espousing ideas rather than writing doctoral dissertations that are intended to change the way the world functions. Personally I find myself arguing with/disagreeing with his stuff during a good portion of what he writes but I like arguing so find it mostly enjoyable. In this book Gladwell is attempting to support his belief that successful people are not ""self-made"" but rather the fortunate product of suitable circumstances. A slight variation on ""nature vs. nurture"" nothing new here. I mostly agree with the idea as it fits nicely with my more politically liberal sensibilities but there were several instances when I felt like his words were actually making the counter argument. Specifically in an extended portion about early Jewish immigrants. He seemed to be saying, ""lucky them, they happened to have the right skills at the right time"" while glossing over their relentless attempts to find their own niche.I also found the hairs on my neck raising when he talked about schools. I feel uncomfortable anytime people start suggesting that the solution to closing the achievement gap for the economically disadvantaged and advantaged is to take kids from their families for longer amounts of time. It is troublesome because it doesn't address the larger issue of social inequities on a larger scale and it starts with the presupposition that academic achievement is the pinnacle to which we should all strive to attain and it de-values the role families play in the upbringing of their children. All that being said, I realize this is one book, with one main point and not every conversation can/should end up with a march to the white house demanding social equity for all. But still....maybe just the tiniest nod to the larger issue would have been nice.I was also more than a little aware of the fact that while he attempted to be gracious to groups other than middle and upper class he would throw in statements like, ""....there aren't books lying around her house that she can read if she gets bored. There's *PROBABLY* just a television."" when talking about ""poor"" households and yet there were no ""probablies"" when he spoke about high income households. It was all definite statements of ""positive"" experiences. oh Malcolm. tsk. tsk.(if you've stayed with this ""review"" this long, you should send me your address so I can send you a dollar for your fortitude).So all in all I'd have to say: I disagreed with him a ton but I enjoyed the disagreements and, as always found his writing to be catchy and clever and all that good stuff.*******oh wait, oh wait! note to editors: proof of what a great service you do can be found in the Acknowledgments at the end of this book. I can only assume there is no editorial input for this part as Gladwell used the phrase ""as always"" 4 times on one 1/2 a page! Egads, bring in the editors!!! **********"

“Outliers aren’t outliers…. they are [what they are] not because of some exceptional or heroic individual action on their part but because of whole series of circumstances, environments and cultural legacies.”
 – Malcolm Gladwell in an interview.What is Gladwell essentially saying? He sums up the circumstantial, environmental and cultural reasons for being an outlier in the following ideas:1. Luck has its role to play2. Hard work and enough practice - 10000 hours – makes you good at almost anything 3. IQ doesn’t guarantee success. There exists a concept of IQ threshold. Psychological testing has its limitations4. Being born at the right place, right time helps5. Middle and higher class families typically provide better, nurturing home environments6. Disadvantaged groups have access to fewer opportunities7. If kids put more effort they could fetch better grades 8. Language affects how we organize information9. Culture can shape personality10. Racial discrimination has handicaps associated with it (epilogue)Everything listed above (published in 2008) has either been out there in scientific and pop literature for decades, is scientifically tenuous (10000 hours) or is something that Captain Obvious would state. Gladwell has nothing new to offer, let alone adding an argument to enrich the nature-nurture debate. He ends up trying to convolute it with poorly supported assertions.Part 1 broadly discusses about individuals, who indeed were exceptions. It was still pertinent to the title. In part 2, though, when he discusses the performance of Asians in mathematics or school kids taking California Assessment Battery – he is talking about averages and not outliers per se. Different cultures prepare you for different things - cultural anthropologists established that in the 50s. Rather than comparing westerners and Asians on math performance, he should have addressed the existence of outliers within the oriental culture. That would have made more sense. He lost track in my opinion.He makes sure that not one sentence is spared on confidence, motivation, temperament, personality dimensions, emotional regulation, self-esteem, self-efficacy, interests or learning/ perceptual styles! How did these factors play out in the lives of Gates, Joy or Jobs? Why are 80% of NBA players black? And why is not each one of them a LeBron, a Kobe or a Jordan? He skipped judgment and decision making too. Decisions such as how and where to put effort into could be a critical success factor. I spent 220 minutes on this book. I could have used that time elsewhere. I could have slept or perhaps worked to accumulate those 10000hrs in one of my crafts. Gladwell is not a psychologist; I should have known better. Drivel should have been expected. The only outlier that doesn’t deserve to be one is this book itself. He should write a book on how “Outliers”, a below average text, managed to get a 4+ rating on Goodreads. I gave a star only because of the chapter on ice hockey and the 50 page babble dedicated to pilot communication – which, like so many in this book, was a feeble argument to make for a correlation between cultural legacy and outliers."
243,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1291915-lauren,4,"There were some sections of this book that had me turning the pages so quickly starved for more information, and others that were a little dry. Gladwell has excellent observational skills, and I like his writing style. I enjoyed this book, much like I did with his others. I was particularly happy to see him open with stories about hockey players - as watching hockey is one of my favorite pastimes. However, I went to the NHL page and looked at the birthdays of several of my favorite Canadian players, and they did not seem to follow the same trend as noted in the book. The majority of players I saw were actually born in the summer or in the fall of the year, rather than early in the year. I am not sure what this means for Gladwell's observation, or if the Canadian leagues changed their age limits... I particularly liked the chapters in the middle/end referring to culture and authority figures, etc. in regards to the airline industry. Many times throughout, I found myself thinking ""huh, wow, that is interesting!"" "

She has never done that before so I had to read it, Right? I probably would not have otherwise. I was very surprised how much I enjoyed it. It is well written and entertaining and at the same time informative and educational. Gladwell seems to have a way with drawing out unseen and seen ideas of successful people road to success. He helps his readers perceive familiar information in entirely new ways, a myth-buster if that is a word. In this he tackles the self-made man, pointing out that success stories are a lot more involved than the outside perception. Are the gifted truly gifted? An enlightening read. "
245,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58095391-michelle-scott,4,"As Americans, we tend to think of highly successful individuals, such as Bill Gates, as somehow making their fortunes because of their own innate skills and talents. In fact, we hold the ideal of the self-made man/woman in such high regard that we ignore the facts. In this book, Malcolm Gladwell examines the stories of several very successful people and comes up with some interesting conclusions. It isn't a spring of talent that gushes inside of these outliers, but a combination of hours of drudgery combined with some amazing good luck.The book is well-written and the examples are fascinating. What's lacking is the idea that any of these observations can be learning experiences for the rest of us."

247,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30327585-michael-broch,5,"Reading this book so soon after Atlas Shrugged was a lucky break, and gave voice to much I disagreed or was uncomfortable with concerning Ayn Rand’s philosophy—chiefly that selfishness is virtue. One of the best facets of Atlas Shrugged is its celebration of hard work, the individual human spirit, and achievement. Where it fails is its narrow view of an ideal society based on the value of hard work as purely “us” vs “them”, where those of ability are deified as “ self made men” and damn the rest as lazy, spoiled, or complacent. Malcolm Gladwell, with poignant examples and rational assessments, makes a tremendous case for a broader picture, one in which individual grit and tenacity are indeed a large part of success, but they are only one part. We ignore sociological, cultural, and empathetic factors which contribute to success at our own peril, and the peril of others. I am thankful for its calm and objective study of success to juxtapose with the often angry and callous portrayal of success and virtue which Ayn Rand paints in her opus."
248,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/106503484-connor-steckly,4,"Gladwell uses several independent, short historical stories to explain the underlying theme of success being attributed to the conditions and circumstances of the individual. Although all of his stories were very distinct from one another, the context provided to dig down to why someone became successful is remarkable and ties together very nicely. I absolutely recommend reading this book! "
249,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3633211-vikas,5,"Like the subtitle says it's the story of success and provides a wonderful study of successful people and hitting ground running by proving again and again that to be successful along with the person the support area and time period is as important to make sure that the person is successful. Mr. Gladwell takes example from different fields, Sports, Music, IT etc. and prove again and again that their success owed itself to lot of fortunate co-incidents and opportunities which they could utilize. In other words along with the talent these people were there at the right place on the right time and today these guys are Billionaires and superstars. Loved this wonderful book do read it and enjoy.People who don't read generally ask me my reasons for reading. Simply put I just love reading and so to that end I have made it my motto to just Keep on Reading. I love to read everything except for Self Help books but even those once in a while. I read almost all the genre but YA, Fantasy, Biographies are the most. My favorite series is of course Harry Potter but then there are many more books that I just adore. I have bookcases filled with books which are waiting to be read so can't stay and spend more time in this review, so remember I loved reading this and love reading more, you should also read what you love and then just Keep on Reading."
250,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73241274-alokita,3,"caution: a stream of consciousness review I would have been in more awe of this book had I read it at an earlier point in life. It would have been both inspiring and revealing, something that the Times says it is on the front cover. So I would urge people to read this as early as possible to gain the utmost out of this book.However, for me, there were no new revelations lets alone those revelations being inspiring. The beginning and the conclusion were obvious to anyone who had gone beyond the surface level worship of success stories. The entire book is based on the now known simple fact that there is nothing like a divine and unexpected success. It takes not only the effort of the individual but also his surrounding to cross the finish line before his/her participants.I did, however, find the process of anecdotal argumentation interesting and refreshing. There were a lot of interesting stories of how people have achieved what they have. It does a commendable work of shedding light on the less focused aspect of success, luck. There is a tendency to visualise success as made up of either only hard work or luck. Most success stories depend on a fruitful combination of both. In the case studies mentioned in the book, the luck aspect is defined as the cultural legacy of our family and society in combination with the conducive yet transformative eras.There were a lot of interconnections to be made that would contribute to the enjoyment of the book for me. The chapter on Rice Paddies and Maths had a personal connection to my own maths related issues while the chapter that talked about the feuds in the southern American regions in the first half of the nineteenth century helped me make retrospective sense of the subplot of the Grangerfords and Shepherdsons in The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain. The following points decreased its enjoyment factor for me:1. The book employs a very traditional sense of success in the book which is an economic and productive success. this creates a myopic view of success in life. Although the introductory chapter is an exception by talking about health success, the rest of the book measures success in terms of wealth and fame only. It would have been better to include inventors and discoverers too in the list. 2. This leads to an obvious gender gap visible in the success stories being mentioned that becomes even more prominent due to its very absence. I would have liked the book to address this issue like many others have done. 3. The research at some places seems either too obvious or too simplistic, making me lose confidence in the book. It also sounds instructional rather than inspiring at other places. To give this a positive spin, there are many areas that can be explored further by other people.In short, the book demystifies the success myth as being coincidental and situates it in hard work and cultural legacy of the individuals."
251,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793473-clif-hostetler,5,"This book shows that the stories about self made rugged individualists who are so widely admired are not stories of singularly talented people who took advantage of opportunities. But rather they are stories of talented people who took advantage of singular opportunities. Furthermore, the ability and disposition to work hard is not so much a personal trait as it is a cultural legacy. The author tells numerous true stories of what appears to be shining examples of disadvantaged people who ended up being outstanding success stories. But then the author goes back through the same story and takes a look at where that person came from and shows that they benefited from a combination of a cultural background and set of unique opportunities and timing that allowed them to succeed. The point of the book is not to explain away success stories. But rather it is to learn from these stories, and use this information to help everyone be more productive and successful. The author shows several instances where proactive steps were able to ameliorate the effect of negative cultural legacies.I found this book to be one of the most interesting non-fiction books that I've ever listened to. Some critics of this book have pointed out that the author, Malcolm Gladwell, didn't adhere to strict protocols in his interpretation of data. My response is that this book is for popular consumption, not the academic community. I'm confident that plenty of proper research and analysis will be performed prior to the implementation of major improvements to schools based on Gladwell's recommendations.The following is a copy of the review of this book review taken from the Jaunary 6, 2011 PageADay Book Lover's Calendar:THAT SWEET SMELLMalcolm Gladwell makes sense of yet another aspect of our world in this pleasantly readable account of success and the qualities that lead to it. The question he poses is, Why do the Bill Gateses and Mozarts of the world succeed so brilliantly, while others of the same intelligence and talent end up leading lives of quiet desperation? Using his method of combining the latest academic studies with the most relevant and irresistible stories, Gladwell makes his case that the “outliers” beneft from advantages and opportunities that pass others up. A stimulating read, to say the least.OUTLIERS: THE STORY OF SUCCESS, by Malcolm Gladwell (Little, Brown, 2008)"
252,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3789528-jane-stewart,5,"4 ½ stars. I was amazed and surprised at what I learned about what makes people successful. And it’s entertaining.I wish I had read this years ago when my children were toddlers. I might have changed some things in how I raised them, not a lot of things, but some decisions might have been different. For example, I might have had them do more academic work in the summers, and felt less guilty about it. But aside from parenting, wow, this is fascinating stuff. The author is a good story teller. He takes an occurrence and analyzes and explains it in an insightful and entertaining way. Most of what he said made sense to me, and I believed him. But I wonder if other experts would have different views. I wonder if there are studies and statistics out there that might say yes this is true in these cases, but it doesn’t apply in all cases. I would have liked seeing arguments on both sides of some of the issues, for example affirmative action at the University of Michigan Law school. He made a statement but he didn’t provide much support for it. On the other hand, too many statistics and opposing views might have made this too dry, less entertaining.It’s a short book.Some of the content:It takes 10,000 hours of practice to become successful at something. It’s not being a genius, it’s practice.Luck is huge element toward success: when one is born, the influence of parents, and one’s culture.The best hockey players are born Jan to March. Geniuses born to poor parents do not do well because their parents don’t show them how to present themselves to the world and how to interact with others. In other words, geniuses need some “emotional IQ” to succeed, but the author doesn’t use that term. S. Korean airlines had more crashes than any other airline because of culture. Copilots were afraid to tell pilots about dangerous plane conditions, because it might sound disrespectful.NARRATOR:The author narrated this book.

253,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/957634-daniel-clausen,4,"It would be easy to fetishize individual greatness and success, but to do so would be a lie. Gladwell takes this simple point and broadens and deepens it with fantastic story-telling. It would be easy to give this book a five-star rating -- but I hesitate to do so. One of the reasons I hesitate is because I've been been duped before. When I was first learning about international affairs, I loved the work of Thomas Friedman. I thought he had a fantastic gift for story-telling and was a very astute observer of international trends. I still do think Friedman is an excellent journalist and popular nonfiction writer; however, as I read more deeply in International Relations, I learned that Thomas Friedman was actually popularizing research that had already been in circulation for a long time that was much richer and more fantastic than he admitted (especially in the International Relations subfield of complex interdependence and other IPE literature). On top of that, Friedman had the nerve to suggest that hedge fund managers were the most insightful observers of international affairs -- an insult that discards the very richness of the literary well that he draws from. For this reason, I have my suspicions about Gladwell's work. Surely, it's better for journalists to be aware of academic work than not to be aware of it. And it is certainly a virtue for work-a-day journalists to read broadly and think through problems like philosophers. But, I worry that like Friedman much of Gladwell's work may just be a popular nonfiction take of even deeper works on the same subject field. In addition, I also worry about the ""value-added"" of his work -- in other words, whether his work contributes something really new to the debate or whether he is just communicating several loosely connected points that were already available in the research. Like Friedman's work, I worry that what I'm reading -- though an entertaining and coherent story -- may be somewhat ""old hat"". Since I'm not a specialist on human development and learning, I can't make this judgment. But what I can say is that the book was a fantastic read (and a pretty quick one too!). "

I recommend it to absolutely everyone. It follows patterns of the human experience backed up by research, it provides data and context. I've seen it shelved as ""self-help"" multiple times, but in fact it's not really ""self-helpey"" at all. It takes examples of great success and great failure and examines it with cold-headed, hard-science, no-nonsense approach. There are absolutely 0 ""steps to success"" chapters, no instructions, no mantras, nothing of the kind. Having said that, the book was very liberating, inspiring and empowering to read. It makes me want to work and learn for 16 hours every day :) It also gave insights into some events in my own life and lives of my family members. Still don't believe it's awesome? Okay. I'll just say it focuses on all of the following:- world cultures - airplane pilots- Beatles- mathematicians and programmers- geniuses- middle-schoolersthe list goes on and on. This book is fire. This book is a ninja. Read this book.P.S. I definitely want to read more about the impact of cultural heritage and language on our everyday life. Any recs?"
255,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/757602-lars-guthrie,5,"Gladwell just gets better for me, going from a general topic of general interest--when a cultural trend takes hold ('The Tipping Point')--to a general topic with a more specific focus that factors into my work with children--the way the brain makes a value judgement ('Blink')--to a specific topic that specifically affects my work--how one's personal history and culture can determine success ('Outliers'). He effectively puts the kibosh on a myth that has particular resonance for Americans--that we make ourselves, that given the will and the work, anybody can be anything. But he doesn't leave it at that. If advantages are a product of culture, he proposes, then we can begin to give those advantages to more by changing the culture. His impassioned plea for a longer school year and a shorter summer vacation was eye-opening. The 'summer slump' well known to educators hits the kids from disadvantaged backgrounds the hardest. I have long felt that real learning is a result of slowing down and letting children discover how things work rather than ""teaching"" them the bullet points we have set as requirements for matriculation. When Gladwell quoted a teacher at a school with a longer academic year who said, ""It seems counterintuitive but we do things at a slower pace and as a result we get through a lot more,"" I stopped reading. And cheered. "
256,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2940271-undrakh,5,"This is not a story of how one hard-working and intelligent man reached to the top all by himself. It's all about what made him successful beyond his own will and talent; some of the factors leading to success were bit unexpected such as a cultural legacy. Those ideas may bring some disappointment to the believers of heroic actions and dramatic rise in people's paths, but they make sense, a lot. This was one of the books which made me take a deep breath, walk around, jump several times, and go back to reading. (I really did, just saying this to express how I feel). The researches, studies, and cases included must been written and discussed for a long time; however, they might have been bit alien to the readers of nonscientific ground. Malcolm Gladwell made it sound so simple and meaningful. There was always a sort of feeling that I was product of my family's meticulous work of crafting my environment to study well and grow up healthy. Those are called the opportunities missed greatly in some others' lives. The successful people had their opportunities too, which can almost be called as sheer luck. There're many other explanations for these people; the stories are just great. It's a really good work of gathering lots of data and information and making a good use of them through insight and a skill of storyteller. "

In other words: pop psychology.This felt like even more pop psychology than Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking, which I somewhat enjoyed. But the same errors lay in this book, tenfold. Too much story-telling and not enough evidence. Switching from one scenario to the next without linking things together. Harping on the same point over and over again, without actually expounding upon it. Another review I saw pointed out that he ""infers causation from correlation"" and I totally see that here. It's like Gladwell once again took a topic that should have only been a magazine/journal article, and swelled it into a book.Not impressed. I might still read The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference some day, but that will probably be the last of Gladwell for me."
258,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1757741-kevin,5,"I picked up this book on a whim not knowing anything about it and was captivated by the subject and writing. Malcolm Gladwell explains in an academic yet simple way how seemingly ""self-made"" superstars in business, sports and life are actually the result of hard work, incredible opportunities, culture and timing. From Mozart to the Beatles to Bill Gates to hockey superstars he builds a case for this very theory. Surprisingly fun and a fast read, this book prompts much thought and discussion involving the secrets to success. Outliers is a book that you read out loud to anyone who is nearby (and will listen) and causes you to bring up these examples in conversation. I am not sure I have read a book recently that covers such a thought provoking ideas while reads so smoothly. Gladwell uses such relevant examples that you have a very easy time ""getting it"". I highly recommend this book and have already secured my copies of his other two similar books, Blink and Tipping Point. I highly enjoyed this!"

Anyway, I enjoyed this book that I read a decade or so ago. I don't know if his reputation will be recuperated but this book was interesting enough for me and the writing style wasn't bad. It kept my interest. He is accessible and shows interesting points in what makes for successful outliers. Decent nonfiction. I don't understand the hate."

263,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2729963-duffy-pratt,3,"Gladwell's basic argument is that people can't pull themselves up by their own bootstraps, and that everyone who is successful had some help, and some luck, along the way. Despite Rush Limbaugh's outrage earlier this year when Obama said pretty much the same thing, I don't think that this is a very challenging or distrubing idea. If that was all there was to it, I wouldn't have liked this book at all. But I did like it, mostly because I found quite a bit of fun in the details.What goes into success? First a person is given both a chance and an advantage. Gladwell points to selection bias when we choose kids for advancement amongst those in their age group. This almost always tends to give an advantage to the oldest children within the age group, because the selection process tends to confound maturity with talent. Seventy percent of Canadian professional hockey players are born in the first half of the year. Why? Because when the kids are young, the best kids born in a year are selected for a better league, with more practice time and better coaching. So they start off better because they are older, but quickly become much better because they are given time, attention and praise. The same results apply almost everywhere, and the effects can be seen in things like who goes to college, to even who is more likely to commit suicide. All of this because of some arbitrary line that we draw about age.This is a very interesting idea, but the basic idea behind it is quite simple and old. It's essentially a variation of Virginia Woolf's idea about Shakespeare's sister - equally talented as the bard, but never given a chance because of a basically irrelevant distinction.Next point is that it takes 10,000 hours to become an expert at anything. This is both an extremely powerful rule of thumb, and just plain wrong. Let's start with why its wrong. How long does it take to become an expert at slot machines? There's no answer because there's no such thing. Now how about tic-tac-toe. I haven't played for 10,000 hours, but I can pretty much guarantee that I will bring anyone to at least a tie in that game, no matter how much more experience they have. Some things defy expertise, and some other things are easy to master. But even in the middle ground, I don't think it's so obvious. Until very recently, the longbow was a superior weapon to a rifle/musket in almost every respect. It had a longer range, a better ability to pierce armor, a superior rate of fire. It was cheaper to construct and maintain. But it had a crippling disadvantage. It did actually take 10,000 hours to master the longbow. It took strength, co-ordination, and lots of practice. By contrast, it was possible to train infantry to shoot a rifle in a very short period of time. Thus, the rifle became the weapon of choice for armies because it was easier to master, not because it was better in other ways.The rule of thumb is powerful, however, because it gives an idea of how much practice and commitment is likely to be involved in learning any fulfilling job or hobby. The examples Gladwell gives are classical musician, composer, chess master, and then he asserts that each of his other success stories have also put in their 10,000. There are two caveats here. Even if it might take 10,000 hours to get good at something, that doesn't mean that putting in the hours means that you will get good. I was probably well on my way to my 10,000 in basketball by the time I graduated high school, and I was never going to be any better than an OK high school player. Other factors were involved (I was slow, but I couldn't jump.) The other thing, and its one that Gladwell doesn't mention. My acting teacher used to define talent as ""the ability to become involved."" In this context, what that means is that if you can devote 10,000 hours of practice and serious concentration to something, that fact alone shows a level of passion and commitment that other people lack. Gladwell makes quite a bit out of Bill Gate's extraordinary opportunities to be around computers before they were widely available. He doesn't make anywhere near as much of what Gates called his ""addiction"" to that computer time. The next element of success is a certain threshold level of ability. Here, Gladwell focuses on IQ, and makes the point that after a certain threshold, IQ tests predict nothing about a person's success. People with the highest IQs are no more likely to win Nobel prizes than others with a fairly high IQ. The same thing goes for SAT and law school entrance scores. Thus, for example, law school affirmative action students get lower scores on the LSAT, and tend to get slightly worse grades in school, but they do just as well as their contemporaries after they get out of school.Sprinkle on top of this a whole lot of luck, or fortuitous timing. The example that Gladwell uses is that about 15 of the 100 richest people in history were all born in the 1830s in the United States. Similarly, the most successful New York Jewish lawyers all tended to be born in the early 1930s. And if you wanted to get really rich in Silicon Valley, you probably needed to be born about 1955. He gives some pretty good arguments for why these things happened, but he also appears here, as well as with some of his other examples, to be cherry-picking the absolute best fits.I'd like to see what Gladwell has to make of the following: Mozart, Beethoven, Haydn, and Schubert were all from a very narrow geographical area, all Austrians, four of the greatest composers of all time. They all lived at very nearly the same time in Vienna. How does something like that happen? Out of all of history, how does so much greatness concentrate itself in both such a narrow area and timeframe? Another similar example: Jerome Kern, Irving Berlin, George Gershwin, Richard Rodgers are four of the towering giants of American songwriting: all of them are from New York City, born within 17 years of each other, and they were all Jewish. Again, how does something like this happen?This leads us to Gladwell's last point: cultural background matters. Gladwell tells a fascinating story of how Korean Air Lines had a rash of crashes. Basically, the reason for the crashes came because the flight crew were uniformly too deferential to the Captain. Planes are safer when an underling can say something like ""There's a mountain right in front of us."" or ""We're running dangerously low on fuel and need to land now."" But my guess is that there are strong cultural reasons that would explain the Vienna musicians, and the New York songwriters. I just don't know what they are.Gladwell also tries to connect the idea that Asian's being good at math with their rice farming. Apparently rice farming takes both a lot of work compared to other farming, and it also takes more thought and planning. This leads to a culture that strongly endorses the work ethic, which in turn leads to better math students. He also claims that these cultures have an advantage because their language more directly models the form of numbers than English and western languages. For example, where we say eleven, the Chinese say ten-one. And twenty-one is two-ten-one.There may be a point here, but I think its a shallow one. This is supposed to be a book about outliers and success stories. Here is an internet ranking of the greatest mathematicians of all time:http://fabpedigree.com/james/mathmen.... Five of the hundred are from China or Japan. None from the other rice growing areas of the world. This is nothing in comparison to the number of French and Germans on the list. Math isn't the kind of field where there would be a strong cultural bias. If the Chinese had been making great discoveries in math, there's no reason to think they wouldn't get credit for it. So, even though Gladwell might have explained why Asian kids get better scores on standardized math tests, that has little to do with the subject he actually said he was going to talk about. The greater question, for me at least, is if Asians are so good at math, why has there been so little development of mathematical knowledge coming out of Asia. In other words, if they are so good at math, why aren't they better mathematicians? I liked this book. I thought it was well written and fun to read. The examples were interesting, but too obviously cherry picked. Much of what's said here is driven home better in Taleb's Fooled by Randomness. But there were some surprising examples and studies that I had not heard before, and Gladwell has a style that makes things both simple and engaging. I would have liked it better if the central idea were a bit more startling, so as it is, it left me feeling that it's just a little slight."
264,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/217489-naeem,5,"Recent class discussions have allowed me to amend my previous rave by including a few criticisms. These I discuss at the end of the review. I have been calling people off the streets to have them listen to the CD version. The book brings out the fascist in me because I wish I could have everyone on the planet read it. Now, today. Why?First, Gladwell takes on the most pernicious, Mobey Dick of a myth: that genius belongs to and emerges from the individual; that such geniuses and self-made men as Carnegies, Mellons, Rockefellers, Mozarts, Beatles, Gates, and Jobs of this world show us that we can in fact ""pull ourselves up by our bootstraps."" You cannot take on such a myth by marshaling facts against it -- mostly you cannot feel facts. Gladwell shows us that such outliers are not outliers at all. What he shows us is how they are embedded within communities, within circumstances, within structures and cultures, within luck that provides them with extraordinary opportunity. He does not mean that they were not skilled or talented. Nor does he mean that they did not work extremely hard. They were and they did. But their skill and hard work were merely necessary, not sufficient conditions for their success. Without the historical circumstance, without the support of their community, without simple, plain, brute luck, their hard work and talent (like yours and mine) gets them no where. So boom! take that you beast of a myth. Second, hundreds and thousands of us make such arguments all day long, 'till we are blue faced, 'till we are weak-kneed and tired. What makes this book so powerful is the WAY Gladwell does it. He does with precise attention to historical context. And he does it with the skills of a fiction writer -- a good fiction writer, not Khaled Hosseini or Ann Patchett. He tells story after story, with the pace and drama of a detective novelist. He refers to social science of all types. But such references are but mere nails that pin down the edges of his sails so that they can capture the narrative energy and convince us that his argument is as moving as the summer breeze.Third, he moves from the cultural embeddedness of individuals in the first part of the book to the affect of culture and inter-generational legacies on individuals in the second part. And here is where the big pay-off is to be found. What does he show? I will tell you. But first let me share the frustration of someone who has been in the classroom for the last 22 years. What can social theory really teach us? Only one thing, I submit, of real importance. Namely that there are these forces, seemingly beyond our control, which make us their puppets, even as we proclaim our freedom, individuality, and self-determination. What forces? The sub-conscious, says Freud. The material effects that result from how a society reproduces itself, say the Scots of the Enlightenment and Marx. Society's compunctions, say Durkheim, Weber, and Giddens. Culture's secret instantiations within our bones and blood, say the anthropologists. The invisible straps of hundreds of past years, say the historians. In a word, structure. Structure is the only thing we teach, the only thing worth teaching. And, damn it, it is also the one thing we cannot seem to get across.Why cannot we get it across? Not because we don't work hard enough or don't have enough creativity. Mostly, because we underestimate the size of the the greatest myth of modernity, of westernization, of capitalism -- (a myth that both Adam Smith and Fredrich Hayek cop to as a deception, even if they call it necessary) the myth of the self-made man; the myth that there is an easy correlation between effort and reward. This myth makes a mockery of structure and and spits bile at teachers and therapists. We can't get structure across because there is a part of us that clings desperately to the myth. We want to believe.Gladwell's is a full out attack on our desire to cling to the myth. Here is what this book gets across: ""structure."" He is a sneaky one this Gladwell fellow. He does it with two brilliantly meshed techniques: a narrative flow that disarms you like only good fiction can, and with a clean, clear, deep understanding of the pervasive presence of ""structure.""I am dancing with joy at the prospect of trying out this book. Naturally, they will resist but that resistance will be oh so tortured. Malcolm Gladwell's fine, fine book will bring intense pressure to bare on our self-deceptions. Not to worry, all this academic stuff I am talking about makes no appearance on the stage of his manuscript. And yet, it is all there. All there. Not there and there, at once. Amendments and Criticisms:Recent class discussions allow me to add the following: Some have suggested that Gladwell's goal is a world where the opportunity to be successful is available to more people and perhaps to everyone. We waste tremendous talent and skill when only a few are given the chance to be successful. If so, he would seem to endorse the equation that correlates effort with reward, rather than to obliterate this equation. This means that Gladwell's purpose is, at best, liberal rather than radical and, at worse, he wants to reform meritocracy and thereby to sustain it. Further, Gladwell implies that the violation of his grandmother by a white man (his grandfather) is the ""gift"" that partly explains both his and his mother's outlier success. Perhaps Gladwell means to use the word ""gift"" ironically, or it could be that he means it. Hard to tell. Either way, his language usage retains a certain ambiguity, an ambiguity that reflects his reformist attitude towards meritocracy. I find myself agreeing with these criticisms. They expose Gladwell to greater searing scrutiny than I had originally managed. Yet, it can be the case that (1) books are smarter than their authors, and (2) books contain deep tensions within their themes. On the one hand, yes, Gladwell seems the liberal reformist. On the other hand, I remain impressed with how far Gladwell's ideas go towards obliterating the myth of meritocracy. Even if he is a reformist, I find his book quite radical.I think the book is smarter than him because it transcends his liberalism. It undermines the core of liberalism and of meritocracy by showing that results are not due to effort. Results are due to many thing -- cultural legacy, fortunate circumstances, systematic skewing of systems towards some people and away from others, and, of course, structure. Rewards are due to many things but not merely the result of effort. If we accept that society lies to us about the nature of effort (by no means an easy thing even after you read this book -- hard to undo a life long lie and and a lie we want to believe), this knowledge can lead us, as my colleague Sean would say, towards creating a ""beloved community."" We take care of each other because we are alive and proximate to each other, and this is enough for each of us to deserve intimate membership in beloved community.The entry cost of this beloved community? Giving up the notion that anything is or is not deserved. "

Gladwell here argues that success is tightly correlated with not only intelligence and hard work, but also opportunity, timing, and luck. He talks about why Asians are good at maths, the hidden lucky factors which made Bill Gates, Mozart, Steve Jobs, and other successful people who they are, the 10,000 hour rule, how background and social status affect the personality and success of people, and how The Beatles are not successful purely because of talent but rather because they had opportunities to practice for many hours in Germany, even though I was not fully convinced with that, since there are many bands and artists who made a name for themselves just as much as the Beatles if not more who didn’t have the same kind of opportunity, or did they? As a person who has grown up in Iraq, I have always felt that one of the most unfortunate aspects of life here is the lack of opportunities for people especially the young to explore, widen their horizons, and discover the kind of intelligence they have which will all contribute to their identity, self-actualization, and how they can put their efforts to make Iraq and the rest of the world a better place.I have thought about how corrupt the school system here is. Imagine Bill Gates, Mozart, Steve Jobs, and members from the Beatles being put from a young age at the same kind of environment that people here is Iraq are forced to put up with. Imagine forcing them to memorize tons of useless information and measure their success, self worth, identity, and future career based on how much they can memorize. Really unfortunate and a waste of potential!"

This book brings forward the idea that success does not just rely on an individual's efforts but also the opportunities provided to them by society. Withstanding years and years of work, put in by the ancestors, to place their children in a position where they can become ""outliers""."
267,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28781546-ana,3,"So this is where the the ""10,000-Hour Rule"" thing comes from. Interesting..."
268,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39637934-randomdots,5,"Read Gladwell for the first time and now I know why he is so highly rated. In one sentence the book can be summarized as - No man, woman or Canadian hockey player is an island. Extraordinary success is the result of an often-unlikely series of opportunities, lucky breaks, and occurrences that combine to create the precise conditions that allow such achievement."
269,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/308912-tucker,4,"Unlike most books on success, Gladwell isn't telling us how to become successful. He's describing who actually does attain success. Academic prowess is one important element. The route to success begins as early as ""birthday cut-offs"" for children entering kindergarten or joining sports teams. The older children are perceived as more talented, and their talent is praised and cultivated until, by the time they finish high school, they really have become more successful. At that point, the important difference is no longer their age, but the opportunities they received and the effort they put in. It is also helpful to be raised by parents who have the money and the interest to nurture their children's thinking skills after school and during vacations. Finally, it helps to grow up in a culture that values hard work and to have the opportunity to practice in one's area of interest. World-class musicians and computer programmers, for example, each put in about 10,000 hours of serious practice time before their gifts and their career trajectories become clear. These factors prove to have a far greater impact on an individual's test scores and academic success than his or her IQ.Another element of success is so-called ""practical intelligence,"" or knowing how to speak up and ask for what you want and need. Good communication skills with one's peers and superiors can help prevent accidents. It is useful to be raised by parents who engaged in meaningful work fueled by labor and innovation and to appreciate the reward that comes with that.And of course there is luck--having the good fortune to be 20 years old, with the business skills of an adult and the flexible mind of a young person, when a seismic technological shift such as the birth of railroads, petroleum, or computers occurs.After finishing the book, I was left with an aftertaste of the ""duh-factor"": of course hard work and luck influence one's chances at success. It didn't produce as much of a mental revolution in me as did his other book,  The Tipping Point. But Gladwell assembled some great anecdotes and mined them well."
270,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5015851-ms-pegasus,5,"OUTLIERS explores the idea of meritocracy with Gladwell's typical focus on aberrational patterns. He begins with an observation about the distribution of birthday months for a professional Canadian hockey team. There is a consistent skewing toward the earliest months in the year. Although he does not explore the probabilities in detail, this fact is especially astonishing since births by month are not evenly distributed, but in fact skewed toward the months in the second half of the year (https://blog.rjmetrics.com/2009/09/14... is one of many websites that cites this distribution). His explanation is persuasive, if not news to parents harboring hopes that their son will be the next Wayne Gretzky (incidentally, a Canadian born in January). Gladwell notes how a few months' advantage of maturity and physical development can reap life-long cumulative advantages: More confidence, more playing time, better coaching, more competitive opportunities, more encouragement.He then shifts his attention to a new thread. One connecting Bill Gates, Bill Joy (co-founder of Sun Microsystems), and The Beatles. This exploration leads him to the “10,000 Hour Rule,” a catchy phrase that has made its way into popular parlance. I was particularly impressed by his mention of Bobby Fischer in this context. Anyone who has read the biography ENDGAME by Frank Brady will find supporting material for Gladwell's ideas.Numerous critics have jumped on this generalization, arguing that it is an oversimplification when taken literally. Gladwell responds to these critics, emphasizing the spirit of his claim (http://www.businessinsider.com/malcol...). In case after case Gladwell poses a prediction based on intuitive ideas about how the world works. In case after case he demonstrates that intuitive ideas are unreliable. The alternative explanations he poses are persuasive, but more important, unexpected.The diversity of his examples make this an entertaining book. The second part of the book shifts gears into an area he calls “Cultural Legacies,” bundles of attitudes subconsciously reinforced through family histories. “Cultural legacies are powerful forces. They have deep roots and long lives. They persist, generation after generation, virtually intact, even as the economic and social and demographic conditions that spawned them have vanished, and they play such a role in directing attitudes and behavior that we cannot make sense of our world without them.” (p.175) The exploration takes Gladwell from Harlan County, Kentucky to South Korea. Between 1988 and 1998 the loss rate for United Airlines was .27/million departures. During the same period the loss rate for Korean Air was 4.79/million departures. (Imagine trying to get “Rainman” aboard a KAL flight!) Gladwell hastens to add that since 1999, KAL's record is spotless, the result of an astonishing turnaround in cockpit training. At its heart was confrontation of a cultural legacy problem — the hierarchical relationship and behaviors between the captain and his subordinates in the flight crew. This was, in fact, my favorite part of the book, and the factor that boosts my rating from 4 to 5 stars. His transcriptions of cockpit recordings are riveting, as each accident scenario unfolds. Readers who have occasion to deal with non-native English speakers, particularly in the software industry, will find ample food for thought.Gladwell's curiosity takes him to many other topics. He looks at the trait of persistence. He questions the role of language in the early mastery of number sense. He examines the effects of summer vacation on academic performance. His restless mind and energetic research stir up contradictions that force the reader to revisit intuitive explanations that are so tempting to grasp. His curiosity is infectious."
271,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/128745-malbadeen,4,"Love him or hate him - whatever. The more I read of his stuff the more I am fascinated by what he does. I think it is so interesting how we can make up a theory and pretty much ascribe all happenings around us as proof that that theory is correct. I do it all the time. My whole family does it, it's how we converse. I think more people do it than are willing to admit and if you read Gladwell with that in mind it is easier to not get so worked up about that fact that he is espousing ideas rather than writing doctoral dissertations that are intended to change the way the world functions. Personally I find myself arguing with/disagreeing with his stuff during a good portion of what he writes but I like arguing so find it mostly enjoyable. In this book Gladwell is attempting to support his belief that successful people are not ""self-made"" but rather the fortunate product of suitable circumstances. A slight variation on ""nature vs. nurture"" nothing new here. I mostly agree with the idea as it fits nicely with my more politically liberal sensibilities but there were several instances when I felt like his words were actually making the counter argument. Specifically in an extended portion about early Jewish immigrants. He seemed to be saying, ""lucky them, they happened to have the right skills at the right time"" while glossing over their relentless attempts to find their own niche.I also found the hairs on my neck raising when he talked about schools. I feel uncomfortable anytime people start suggesting that the solution to closing the achievement gap for the economically disadvantaged and advantaged is to take kids from their families for longer amounts of time. It is troublesome because it doesn't address the larger issue of social inequities on a larger scale and it starts with the presupposition that academic achievement is the pinnacle to which we should all strive to attain and it de-values the role families play in the upbringing of their children. All that being said, I realize this is one book, with one main point and not every conversation can/should end up with a march to the white house demanding social equity for all. But still....maybe just the tiniest nod to the larger issue would have been nice.I was also more than a little aware of the fact that while he attempted to be gracious to groups other than middle and upper class he would throw in statements like, ""....there aren't books lying around her house that she can read if she gets bored. There's *PROBABLY* just a television."" when talking about ""poor"" households and yet there were no ""probablies"" when he spoke about high income households. It was all definite statements of ""positive"" experiences. oh Malcolm. tsk. tsk.(if you've stayed with this ""review"" this long, you should send me your address so I can send you a dollar for your fortitude).So all in all I'd have to say: I disagreed with him a ton but I enjoyed the disagreements and, as always found his writing to be catchy and clever and all that good stuff.*******oh wait, oh wait! note to editors: proof of what a great service you do can be found in the Acknowledgments at the end of this book. I can only assume there is no editorial input for this part as Gladwell used the phrase ""as always"" 4 times on one 1/2 a page! Egads, bring in the editors!!! **********"

“Outliers aren’t outliers…. they are [what they are] not because of some exceptional or heroic individual action on their part but because of whole series of circumstances, environments and cultural legacies.”
 – Malcolm Gladwell in an interview.What is Gladwell essentially saying? He sums up the circumstantial, environmental and cultural reasons for being an outlier in the following ideas:1. Luck has its role to play2. Hard work and enough practice - 10000 hours – makes you good at almost anything 3. IQ doesn’t guarantee success. There exists a concept of IQ threshold. Psychological testing has its limitations4. Being born at the right place, right time helps5. Middle and higher class families typically provide better, nurturing home environments6. Disadvantaged groups have access to fewer opportunities7. If kids put more effort they could fetch better grades 8. Language affects how we organize information9. Culture can shape personality10. Racial discrimination has handicaps associated with it (epilogue)Everything listed above (published in 2008) has either been out there in scientific and pop literature for decades, is scientifically tenuous (10000 hours) or is something that Captain Obvious would state. Gladwell has nothing new to offer, let alone adding an argument to enrich the nature-nurture debate. He ends up trying to convolute it with poorly supported assertions.Part 1 broadly discusses about individuals, who indeed were exceptions. It was still pertinent to the title. In part 2, though, when he discusses the performance of Asians in mathematics or school kids taking California Assessment Battery – he is talking about averages and not outliers per se. Different cultures prepare you for different things - cultural anthropologists established that in the 50s. Rather than comparing westerners and Asians on math performance, he should have addressed the existence of outliers within the oriental culture. That would have made more sense. He lost track in my opinion.He makes sure that not one sentence is spared on confidence, motivation, temperament, personality dimensions, emotional regulation, self-esteem, self-efficacy, interests or learning/ perceptual styles! How did these factors play out in the lives of Gates, Joy or Jobs? Why are 80% of NBA players black? And why is not each one of them a LeBron, a Kobe or a Jordan? He skipped judgment and decision making too. Decisions such as how and where to put effort into could be a critical success factor. I spent 220 minutes on this book. I could have used that time elsewhere. I could have slept or perhaps worked to accumulate those 10000hrs in one of my crafts. Gladwell is not a psychologist; I should have known better. Drivel should have been expected. The only outlier that doesn’t deserve to be one is this book itself. He should write a book on how “Outliers”, a below average text, managed to get a 4+ rating on Goodreads. I gave a star only because of the chapter on ice hockey and the 50 page babble dedicated to pilot communication – which, like so many in this book, was a feeble argument to make for a correlation between cultural legacy and outliers."
273,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1291915-lauren,4,"There were some sections of this book that had me turning the pages so quickly starved for more information, and others that were a little dry. Gladwell has excellent observational skills, and I like his writing style. I enjoyed this book, much like I did with his others. I was particularly happy to see him open with stories about hockey players - as watching hockey is one of my favorite pastimes. However, I went to the NHL page and looked at the birthdays of several of my favorite Canadian players, and they did not seem to follow the same trend as noted in the book. The majority of players I saw were actually born in the summer or in the fall of the year, rather than early in the year. I am not sure what this means for Gladwell's observation, or if the Canadian leagues changed their age limits... I particularly liked the chapters in the middle/end referring to culture and authority figures, etc. in regards to the airline industry. Many times throughout, I found myself thinking ""huh, wow, that is interesting!"" "

She has never done that before so I had to read it, Right? I probably would not have otherwise. I was very surprised how much I enjoyed it. It is well written and entertaining and at the same time informative and educational. Gladwell seems to have a way with drawing out unseen and seen ideas of successful people road to success. He helps his readers perceive familiar information in entirely new ways, a myth-buster if that is a word. In this he tackles the self-made man, pointing out that success stories are a lot more involved than the outside perception. Are the gifted truly gifted? An enlightening read. "
275,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58095391-michelle-scott,4,"As Americans, we tend to think of highly successful individuals, such as Bill Gates, as somehow making their fortunes because of their own innate skills and talents. In fact, we hold the ideal of the self-made man/woman in such high regard that we ignore the facts. In this book, Malcolm Gladwell examines the stories of several very successful people and comes up with some interesting conclusions. It isn't a spring of talent that gushes inside of these outliers, but a combination of hours of drudgery combined with some amazing good luck.The book is well-written and the examples are fascinating. What's lacking is the idea that any of these observations can be learning experiences for the rest of us."

One of the best facets of Atlas Shrugged is its celebration of hard work, the individual human spirit, and achievement. Where it fails is its narrow view of an ideal society based on the value of hard work as purely “us” vs “them”, where those of ability are deified as “ self made men” and damn the rest as lazy, spoiled, or complacent. Malcolm Gladwell, with poignant examples and rational assessments, makes a tremendous case for a broader picture, one in which individual grit and tenacity are indeed a large part of success, but they are only one part. We ignore sociological, cultural, and empathetic factors which contribute to success at our own peril, and the peril of others. I am thankful for its calm and objective study of success to juxtapose with the often angry and callous portrayal of success and virtue which Ayn Rand paints in her opus."
278,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/106503484-connor-steckly,4,"Gladwell uses several independent, short historical stories to explain the underlying theme of success being attributed to the conditions and circumstances of the individual. Although all of his stories were very distinct from one another, the context provided to dig down to why someone became successful is remarkable and ties together very nicely. I absolutely recommend reading this book! "
279,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3633211-vikas,5,"Like the subtitle says it's the story of success and provides a wonderful study of successful people and hitting ground running by proving again and again that to be successful along with the person the support area and time period is as important to make sure that the person is successful. Mr. Gladwell takes example from different fields, Sports, Music, IT etc. and prove again and again that their success owed itself to lot of fortunate co-incidents and opportunities which they could utilize. In other words along with the talent these people were there at the right place on the right time and today these guys are Billionaires and superstars. Loved this wonderful book do read it and enjoy.People who don't read generally ask me my reasons for reading. Simply put I just love reading and so to that end I have made it my motto to just Keep on Reading. I love to read everything except for Self Help books but even those once in a while. I read almost all the genre but YA, Fantasy, Biographies are the most. My favorite series is of course Harry Potter but then there are many more books that I just adore. I have bookcases filled with books which are waiting to be read so can't stay and spend more time in this review, so remember I loved reading this and love reading more, you should also read what you love and then just Keep on Reading."

It would have been both inspiring and revealing, something that the Times says it is on the front cover. So I would urge people to read this as early as possible to gain the utmost out of this book.However, for me, there were no new revelations lets alone those revelations being inspiring. The beginning and the conclusion were obvious to anyone who had gone beyond the surface level worship of success stories. The entire book is based on the now known simple fact that there is nothing like a divine and unexpected success. It takes not only the effort of the individual but also his surrounding to cross the finish line before his/her participants.I did, however, find the process of anecdotal argumentation interesting and refreshing. There were a lot of interesting stories of how people have achieved what they have. It does a commendable work of shedding light on the less focused aspect of success, luck. There is a tendency to visualise success as made up of either only hard work or luck. Most success stories depend on a fruitful combination of both. In the case studies mentioned in the book, the luck aspect is defined as the cultural legacy of our family and society in combination with the conducive yet transformative eras.There were a lot of interconnections to be made that would contribute to the enjoyment of the book for me. The chapter on Rice Paddies and Maths had a personal connection to my own maths related issues while the chapter that talked about the feuds in the southern American regions in the first half of the nineteenth century helped me make retrospective sense of the subplot of the Grangerfords and Shepherdsons in The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain. The following points decreased its enjoyment factor for me:1. The book employs a very traditional sense of success in the book which is an economic and productive success. this creates a myopic view of success in life. Although the introductory chapter is an exception by talking about health success, the rest of the book measures success in terms of wealth and fame only. It would have been better to include inventors and discoverers too in the list. 2. This leads to an obvious gender gap visible in the success stories being mentioned that becomes even more prominent due to its very absence. I would have liked the book to address this issue like many others have done. 3. The research at some places seems either too obvious or too simplistic, making me lose confidence in the book. It also sounds instructional rather than inspiring at other places. To give this a positive spin, there are many areas that can be explored further by other people.In short, the book demystifies the success myth as being coincidental and situates it in hard work and cultural legacy of the individuals."
281,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793473-clif-hostetler,5,"This book shows that the stories about self made rugged individualists who are so widely admired are not stories of singularly talented people who took advantage of opportunities. But rather they are stories of talented people who took advantage of singular opportunities. Furthermore, the ability and disposition to work hard is not so much a personal trait as it is a cultural legacy. The author tells numerous true stories of what appears to be shining examples of disadvantaged people who ended up being outstanding success stories. But then the author goes back through the same story and takes a look at where that person came from and shows that they benefited from a combination of a cultural background and set of unique opportunities and timing that allowed them to succeed. The point of the book is not to explain away success stories. But rather it is to learn from these stories, and use this information to help everyone be more productive and successful. The author shows several instances where proactive steps were able to ameliorate the effect of negative cultural legacies.I found this book to be one of the most interesting non-fiction books that I've ever listened to. Some critics of this book have pointed out that the author, Malcolm Gladwell, didn't adhere to strict protocols in his interpretation of data. My response is that this book is for popular consumption, not the academic community. I'm confident that plenty of proper research and analysis will be performed prior to the implementation of major improvements to schools based on Gladwell's recommendations.The following is a copy of the review of this book review taken from the Jaunary 6, 2011 PageADay Book Lover's Calendar:THAT SWEET SMELLMalcolm Gladwell makes sense of yet another aspect of our world in this pleasantly readable account of success and the qualities that lead to it. The question he poses is, Why do the Bill Gateses and Mozarts of the world succeed so brilliantly, while others of the same intelligence and talent end up leading lives of quiet desperation? Using his method of combining the latest academic studies with the most relevant and irresistible stories, Gladwell makes his case that the “outliers” beneft from advantages and opportunities that pass others up. A stimulating read, to say the least.OUTLIERS: THE STORY OF SUCCESS, by Malcolm Gladwell (Little, Brown, 2008)"

And it’s entertaining.I wish I had read this years ago when my children were toddlers. I might have changed some things in how I raised them, not a lot of things, but some decisions might have been different. For example, I might have had them do more academic work in the summers, and felt less guilty about it. But aside from parenting, wow, this is fascinating stuff. The author is a good story teller. He takes an occurrence and analyzes and explains it in an insightful and entertaining way. Most of what he said made sense to me, and I believed him. But I wonder if other experts would have different views. I wonder if there are studies and statistics out there that might say yes this is true in these cases, but it doesn’t apply in all cases. I would have liked seeing arguments on both sides of some of the issues, for example affirmative action at the University of Michigan Law school. He made a statement but he didn’t provide much support for it. On the other hand, too many statistics and opposing views might have made this too dry, less entertaining.It’s a short book.Some of the content:It takes 10,000 hours of practice to become successful at something. It’s not being a genius, it’s practice.Luck is huge element toward success: when one is born, the influence of parents, and one’s culture.The best hockey players are born Jan to March. Geniuses born to poor parents do not do well because their parents don’t show them how to present themselves to the world and how to interact with others. In other words, geniuses need some “emotional IQ” to succeed, but the author doesn’t use that term. S. Korean airlines had more crashes than any other airline because of culture. Copilots were afraid to tell pilots about dangerous plane conditions, because it might sound disrespectful.NARRATOR:The author narrated this book.

Gladwell takes this simple point and broadens and deepens it with fantastic story-telling. It would be easy to give this book a five-star rating -- but I hesitate to do so. One of the reasons I hesitate is because I've been been duped before. When I was first learning about international affairs, I loved the work of Thomas Friedman. I thought he had a fantastic gift for story-telling and was a very astute observer of international trends. I still do think Friedman is an excellent journalist and popular nonfiction writer; however, as I read more deeply in International Relations, I learned that Thomas Friedman was actually popularizing research that had already been in circulation for a long time that was much richer and more fantastic than he admitted (especially in the International Relations subfield of complex interdependence and other IPE literature). On top of that, Friedman had the nerve to suggest that hedge fund managers were the most insightful observers of international affairs -- an insult that discards the very richness of the literary well that he draws from. For this reason, I have my suspicions about Gladwell's work. Surely, it's better for journalists to be aware of academic work than not to be aware of it. And it is certainly a virtue for work-a-day journalists to read broadly and think through problems like philosophers. But, I worry that like Friedman much of Gladwell's work may just be a popular nonfiction take of even deeper works on the same subject field. In addition, I also worry about the ""value-added"" of his work -- in other words, whether his work contributes something really new to the debate or whether he is just communicating several loosely connected points that were already available in the research. Like Friedman's work, I worry that what I'm reading -- though an entertaining and coherent story -- may be somewhat ""old hat"". Since I'm not a specialist on human development and learning, I can't make this judgment. But what I can say is that the book was a fantastic read (and a pretty quick one too!). "

I recommend it to absolutely everyone. It follows patterns of the human experience backed up by research, it provides data and context. I've seen it shelved as ""self-help"" multiple times, but in fact it's not really ""self-helpey"" at all. It takes examples of great success and great failure and examines it with cold-headed, hard-science, no-nonsense approach. There are absolutely 0 ""steps to success"" chapters, no instructions, no mantras, nothing of the kind. Having said that, the book was very liberating, inspiring and empowering to read. It makes me want to work and learn for 16 hours every day :) It also gave insights into some events in my own life and lives of my family members. Still don't believe it's awesome? Okay. I'll just say it focuses on all of the following:- world cultures - airplane pilots- Beatles- mathematicians and programmers- geniuses- middle-schoolersthe list goes on and on. This book is fire. This book is a ninja. Read this book.P.S. I definitely want to read more about the impact of cultural heritage and language on our everyday life. Any recs?"
285,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/757602-lars-guthrie,5,"Gladwell just gets better for me, going from a general topic of general interest--when a cultural trend takes hold ('The Tipping Point')--to a general topic with a more specific focus that factors into my work with children--the way the brain makes a value judgement ('Blink')--to a specific topic that specifically affects my work--how one's personal history and culture can determine success ('Outliers'). He effectively puts the kibosh on a myth that has particular resonance for Americans--that we make ourselves, that given the will and the work, anybody can be anything. But he doesn't leave it at that. If advantages are a product of culture, he proposes, then we can begin to give those advantages to more by changing the culture. His impassioned plea for a longer school year and a shorter summer vacation was eye-opening. The 'summer slump' well known to educators hits the kids from disadvantaged backgrounds the hardest. I have long felt that real learning is a result of slowing down and letting children discover how things work rather than ""teaching"" them the bullet points we have set as requirements for matriculation. When Gladwell quoted a teacher at a school with a longer academic year who said, ""It seems counterintuitive but we do things at a slower pace and as a result we get through a lot more,"" I stopped reading. And cheered. "
286,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2940271-undrakh,5,"This is not a story of how one hard-working and intelligent man reached to the top all by himself. It's all about what made him successful beyond his own will and talent; some of the factors leading to success were bit unexpected such as a cultural legacy. Those ideas may bring some disappointment to the believers of heroic actions and dramatic rise in people's paths, but they make sense, a lot. This was one of the books which made me take a deep breath, walk around, jump several times, and go back to reading. (I really did, just saying this to express how I feel). The researches, studies, and cases included must been written and discussed for a long time; however, they might have been bit alien to the readers of nonscientific ground. Malcolm Gladwell made it sound so simple and meaningful. There was always a sort of feeling that I was product of my family's meticulous work of crafting my environment to study well and grow up healthy. Those are called the opportunities missed greatly in some others' lives. The successful people had their opportunities too, which can almost be called as sheer luck. There're many other explanations for these people; the stories are just great. It's a really good work of gathering lots of data and information and making a good use of them through insight and a skill of storyteller. "
287,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25032671-kris,2,"Widespread assumptions, anecdotal evidence, emotional appeal. In other words: pop psychology.This felt like even more pop psychology than Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking, which I somewhat enjoyed. But the same errors lay in this book, tenfold. Too much story-telling and not enough evidence. Switching from one scenario to the next without linking things together. Harping on the same point over and over again, without actually expounding upon it. Another review I saw pointed out that he ""infers causation from correlation"" and I totally see that here. It's like Gladwell once again took a topic that should have only been a magazine/journal article, and swelled it into a book.Not impressed. I might still read The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference some day, but that will probably be the last of Gladwell for me."
288,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1757741-kevin,5,"I picked up this book on a whim not knowing anything about it and was captivated by the subject and writing. Malcolm Gladwell explains in an academic yet simple way how seemingly ""self-made"" superstars in business, sports and life are actually the result of hard work, incredible opportunities, culture and timing. From Mozart to the Beatles to Bill Gates to hockey superstars he builds a case for this very theory. Surprisingly fun and a fast read, this book prompts much thought and discussion involving the secrets to success. Outliers is a book that you read out loud to anyone who is nearby (and will listen) and causes you to bring up these examples in conversation. I am not sure I have read a book recently that covers such a thought provoking ideas while reads so smoothly. Gladwell uses such relevant examples that you have a very easy time ""getting it"". I highly recommend this book and have already secured my copies of his other two similar books, Blink and Tipping Point. I highly enjoyed this!"

Anyway, I enjoyed this book that I read a decade or so ago. I don't know if his reputation will be recuperated but this book was interesting enough for me and the writing style wasn't bad. It kept my interest. He is accessible and shows interesting points in what makes for successful outliers. Decent nonfiction. I don't understand the hate."

293,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2729963-duffy-pratt,3,"Gladwell's basic argument is that people can't pull themselves up by their own bootstraps, and that everyone who is successful had some help, and some luck, along the way. Despite Rush Limbaugh's outrage earlier this year when Obama said pretty much the same thing, I don't think that this is a very challenging or distrubing idea. If that was all there was to it, I wouldn't have liked this book at all. But I did like it, mostly because I found quite a bit of fun in the details.What goes into success? First a person is given both a chance and an advantage. Gladwell points to selection bias when we choose kids for advancement amongst those in their age group. This almost always tends to give an advantage to the oldest children within the age group, because the selection process tends to confound maturity with talent. Seventy percent of Canadian professional hockey players are born in the first half of the year. Why? Because when the kids are young, the best kids born in a year are selected for a better league, with more practice time and better coaching. So they start off better because they are older, but quickly become much better because they are given time, attention and praise. The same results apply almost everywhere, and the effects can be seen in things like who goes to college, to even who is more likely to commit suicide. All of this because of some arbitrary line that we draw about age.This is a very interesting idea, but the basic idea behind it is quite simple and old. It's essentially a variation of Virginia Woolf's idea about Shakespeare's sister - equally talented as the bard, but never given a chance because of a basically irrelevant distinction.Next point is that it takes 10,000 hours to become an expert at anything. This is both an extremely powerful rule of thumb, and just plain wrong. Let's start with why its wrong. How long does it take to become an expert at slot machines? There's no answer because there's no such thing. Now how about tic-tac-toe. I haven't played for 10,000 hours, but I can pretty much guarantee that I will bring anyone to at least a tie in that game, no matter how much more experience they have. Some things defy expertise, and some other things are easy to master. But even in the middle ground, I don't think it's so obvious. Until very recently, the longbow was a superior weapon to a rifle/musket in almost every respect. It had a longer range, a better ability to pierce armor, a superior rate of fire. It was cheaper to construct and maintain. But it had a crippling disadvantage. It did actually take 10,000 hours to master the longbow. It took strength, co-ordination, and lots of practice. By contrast, it was possible to train infantry to shoot a rifle in a very short period of time. Thus, the rifle became the weapon of choice for armies because it was easier to master, not because it was better in other ways.The rule of thumb is powerful, however, because it gives an idea of how much practice and commitment is likely to be involved in learning any fulfilling job or hobby. The examples Gladwell gives are classical musician, composer, chess master, and then he asserts that each of his other success stories have also put in their 10,000. There are two caveats here. Even if it might take 10,000 hours to get good at something, that doesn't mean that putting in the hours means that you will get good. I was probably well on my way to my 10,000 in basketball by the time I graduated high school, and I was never going to be any better than an OK high school player. Other factors were involved (I was slow, but I couldn't jump.) The other thing, and its one that Gladwell doesn't mention. My acting teacher used to define talent as ""the ability to become involved."" In this context, what that means is that if you can devote 10,000 hours of practice and serious concentration to something, that fact alone shows a level of passion and commitment that other people lack. Gladwell makes quite a bit out of Bill Gate's extraordinary opportunities to be around computers before they were widely available. He doesn't make anywhere near as much of what Gates called his ""addiction"" to that computer time. The next element of success is a certain threshold level of ability. Here, Gladwell focuses on IQ, and makes the point that after a certain threshold, IQ tests predict nothing about a person's success. People with the highest IQs are no more likely to win Nobel prizes than others with a fairly high IQ. The same thing goes for SAT and law school entrance scores. Thus, for example, law school affirmative action students get lower scores on the LSAT, and tend to get slightly worse grades in school, but they do just as well as their contemporaries after they get out of school.Sprinkle on top of this a whole lot of luck, or fortuitous timing. The example that Gladwell uses is that about 15 of the 100 richest people in history were all born in the 1830s in the United States. Similarly, the most successful New York Jewish lawyers all tended to be born in the early 1930s. And if you wanted to get really rich in Silicon Valley, you probably needed to be born about 1955. He gives some pretty good arguments for why these things happened, but he also appears here, as well as with some of his other examples, to be cherry-picking the absolute best fits.I'd like to see what Gladwell has to make of the following: Mozart, Beethoven, Haydn, and Schubert were all from a very narrow geographical area, all Austrians, four of the greatest composers of all time. They all lived at very nearly the same time in Vienna. How does something like that happen? Out of all of history, how does so much greatness concentrate itself in both such a narrow area and timeframe? Another similar example: Jerome Kern, Irving Berlin, George Gershwin, Richard Rodgers are four of the towering giants of American songwriting: all of them are from New York City, born within 17 years of each other, and they were all Jewish. Again, how does something like this happen?This leads us to Gladwell's last point: cultural background matters. Gladwell tells a fascinating story of how Korean Air Lines had a rash of crashes. Basically, the reason for the crashes came because the flight crew were uniformly too deferential to the Captain. Planes are safer when an underling can say something like ""There's a mountain right in front of us."" or ""We're running dangerously low on fuel and need to land now."" But my guess is that there are strong cultural reasons that would explain the Vienna musicians, and the New York songwriters. I just don't know what they are.Gladwell also tries to connect the idea that Asian's being good at math with their rice farming. Apparently rice farming takes both a lot of work compared to other farming, and it also takes more thought and planning. This leads to a culture that strongly endorses the work ethic, which in turn leads to better math students. He also claims that these cultures have an advantage because their language more directly models the form of numbers than English and western languages. For example, where we say eleven, the Chinese say ten-one. And twenty-one is two-ten-one.There may be a point here, but I think its a shallow one. This is supposed to be a book about outliers and success stories. Here is an internet ranking of the greatest mathematicians of all time:http://fabpedigree.com/james/mathmen.... Five of the hundred are from China or Japan. None from the other rice growing areas of the world. This is nothing in comparison to the number of French and Germans on the list. Math isn't the kind of field where there would be a strong cultural bias. If the Chinese had been making great discoveries in math, there's no reason to think they wouldn't get credit for it. So, even though Gladwell might have explained why Asian kids get better scores on standardized math tests, that has little to do with the subject he actually said he was going to talk about. The greater question, for me at least, is if Asians are so good at math, why has there been so little development of mathematical knowledge coming out of Asia. In other words, if they are so good at math, why aren't they better mathematicians? I liked this book. I thought it was well written and fun to read. The examples were interesting, but too obviously cherry picked. Much of what's said here is driven home better in Taleb's Fooled by Randomness. But there were some surprising examples and studies that I had not heard before, and Gladwell has a style that makes things both simple and engaging. I would have liked it better if the central idea were a bit more startling, so as it is, it left me feeling that it's just a little slight."
294,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/217489-naeem,5,"Recent class discussions have allowed me to amend my previous rave by including a few criticisms. These I discuss at the end of the review. I have been calling people off the streets to have them listen to the CD version. The book brings out the fascist in me because I wish I could have everyone on the planet read it. Now, today. Why?First, Gladwell takes on the most pernicious, Mobey Dick of a myth: that genius belongs to and emerges from the individual; that such geniuses and self-made men as Carnegies, Mellons, Rockefellers, Mozarts, Beatles, Gates, and Jobs of this world show us that we can in fact ""pull ourselves up by our bootstraps."" You cannot take on such a myth by marshaling facts against it -- mostly you cannot feel facts. Gladwell shows us that such outliers are not outliers at all. What he shows us is how they are embedded within communities, within circumstances, within structures and cultures, within luck that provides them with extraordinary opportunity. He does not mean that they were not skilled or talented. Nor does he mean that they did not work extremely hard. They were and they did. But their skill and hard work were merely necessary, not sufficient conditions for their success. Without the historical circumstance, without the support of their community, without simple, plain, brute luck, their hard work and talent (like yours and mine) gets them no where. So boom! take that you beast of a myth. Second, hundreds and thousands of us make such arguments all day long, 'till we are blue faced, 'till we are weak-kneed and tired. What makes this book so powerful is the WAY Gladwell does it. He does with precise attention to historical context. And he does it with the skills of a fiction writer -- a good fiction writer, not Khaled Hosseini or Ann Patchett. He tells story after story, with the pace and drama of a detective novelist. He refers to social science of all types. But such references are but mere nails that pin down the edges of his sails so that they can capture the narrative energy and convince us that his argument is as moving as the summer breeze.Third, he moves from the cultural embeddedness of individuals in the first part of the book to the affect of culture and inter-generational legacies on individuals in the second part. And here is where the big pay-off is to be found. What does he show? I will tell you. But first let me share the frustration of someone who has been in the classroom for the last 22 years. What can social theory really teach us? Only one thing, I submit, of real importance. Namely that there are these forces, seemingly beyond our control, which make us their puppets, even as we proclaim our freedom, individuality, and self-determination. What forces? The sub-conscious, says Freud. The material effects that result from how a society reproduces itself, say the Scots of the Enlightenment and Marx. Society's compunctions, say Durkheim, Weber, and Giddens. Culture's secret instantiations within our bones and blood, say the anthropologists. The invisible straps of hundreds of past years, say the historians. In a word, structure. Structure is the only thing we teach, the only thing worth teaching. And, damn it, it is also the one thing we cannot seem to get across.Why cannot we get it across? Not because we don't work hard enough or don't have enough creativity. Mostly, because we underestimate the size of the the greatest myth of modernity, of westernization, of capitalism -- (a myth that both Adam Smith and Fredrich Hayek cop to as a deception, even if they call it necessary) the myth of the self-made man; the myth that there is an easy correlation between effort and reward. This myth makes a mockery of structure and and spits bile at teachers and therapists. We can't get structure across because there is a part of us that clings desperately to the myth. We want to believe.Gladwell's is a full out attack on our desire to cling to the myth. Here is what this book gets across: ""structure."" He is a sneaky one this Gladwell fellow. He does it with two brilliantly meshed techniques: a narrative flow that disarms you like only good fiction can, and with a clean, clear, deep understanding of the pervasive presence of ""structure.""I am dancing with joy at the prospect of trying out this book. Naturally, they will resist but that resistance will be oh so tortured. Malcolm Gladwell's fine, fine book will bring intense pressure to bare on our self-deceptions. Not to worry, all this academic stuff I am talking about makes no appearance on the stage of his manuscript. And yet, it is all there. All there. Not there and there, at once. Amendments and Criticisms:Recent class discussions allow me to add the following: Some have suggested that Gladwell's goal is a world where the opportunity to be successful is available to more people and perhaps to everyone. We waste tremendous talent and skill when only a few are given the chance to be successful. If so, he would seem to endorse the equation that correlates effort with reward, rather than to obliterate this equation. This means that Gladwell's purpose is, at best, liberal rather than radical and, at worse, he wants to reform meritocracy and thereby to sustain it. Further, Gladwell implies that the violation of his grandmother by a white man (his grandfather) is the ""gift"" that partly explains both his and his mother's outlier success. Perhaps Gladwell means to use the word ""gift"" ironically, or it could be that he means it. Hard to tell. Either way, his language usage retains a certain ambiguity, an ambiguity that reflects his reformist attitude towards meritocracy. I find myself agreeing with these criticisms. They expose Gladwell to greater searing scrutiny than I had originally managed. Yet, it can be the case that (1) books are smarter than their authors, and (2) books contain deep tensions within their themes. On the one hand, yes, Gladwell seems the liberal reformist. On the other hand, I remain impressed with how far Gladwell's ideas go towards obliterating the myth of meritocracy. Even if he is a reformist, I find his book quite radical.I think the book is smarter than him because it transcends his liberalism. It undermines the core of liberalism and of meritocracy by showing that results are not due to effort. Results are due to many thing -- cultural legacy, fortunate circumstances, systematic skewing of systems towards some people and away from others, and, of course, structure. Rewards are due to many things but not merely the result of effort. If we accept that society lies to us about the nature of effort (by no means an easy thing even after you read this book -- hard to undo a life long lie and and a lie we want to believe), this knowledge can lead us, as my colleague Sean would say, towards creating a ""beloved community."" We take care of each other because we are alive and proximate to each other, and this is enough for each of us to deserve intimate membership in beloved community.The entry cost of this beloved community? Giving up the notion that anything is or is not deserved. "

Gladwell here argues that success is tightly correlated with not only intelligence and hard work, but also opportunity, timing, and luck. He talks about why Asians are good at maths, the hidden lucky factors which made Bill Gates, Mozart, Steve Jobs, and other successful people who they are, the 10,000 hour rule, how background and social status affect the personality and success of people, and how The Beatles are not successful purely because of talent but rather because they had opportunities to practice for many hours in Germany, even though I was not fully convinced with that, since there are many bands and artists who made a name for themselves just as much as the Beatles if not more who didn’t have the same kind of opportunity, or did they? As a person who has grown up in Iraq, I have always felt that one of the most unfortunate aspects of life here is the lack of opportunities for people especially the young to explore, widen their horizons, and discover the kind of intelligence they have which will all contribute to their identity, self-actualization, and how they can put their efforts to make Iraq and the rest of the world a better place.I have thought about how corrupt the school system here is. Imagine Bill Gates, Mozart, Steve Jobs, and members from the Beatles being put from a young age at the same kind of environment that people here is Iraq are forced to put up with. Imagine forcing them to memorize tons of useless information and measure their success, self worth, identity, and future career based on how much they can memorize. Really unfortunate and a waste of potential!"

In one sentence the book can be summarized as - No man, woman or Canadian hockey player is an island. Extraordinary success is the result of an often-unlikely series of opportunities, lucky breaks, and occurrences that combine to create the precise conditions that allow such achievement."
299,0316017922,http://goodreads.com/user/show/308912-tucker,4,"Unlike most books on success, Gladwell isn't telling us how to become successful. He's describing who actually does attain success. Academic prowess is one important element. The route to success begins as early as ""birthday cut-offs"" for children entering kindergarten or joining sports teams. The older children are perceived as more talented, and their talent is praised and cultivated until, by the time they finish high school, they really have become more successful. At that point, the important difference is no longer their age, but the opportunities they received and the effort they put in. It is also helpful to be raised by parents who have the money and the interest to nurture their children's thinking skills after school and during vacations. Finally, it helps to grow up in a culture that values hard work and to have the opportunity to practice in one's area of interest. World-class musicians and computer programmers, for example, each put in about 10,000 hours of serious practice time before their gifts and their career trajectories become clear. These factors prove to have a far greater impact on an individual's test scores and academic success than his or her IQ.Another element of success is so-called ""practical intelligence,"" or knowing how to speak up and ask for what you want and need. Good communication skills with one's peers and superiors can help prevent accidents. It is useful to be raised by parents who engaged in meaningful work fueled by labor and innovation and to appreciate the reward that comes with that.And of course there is luck--having the good fortune to be 20 years old, with the business skills of an adult and the flexible mind of a young person, when a seismic technological shift such as the birth of railroads, petroleum, or computers occurs.After finishing the book, I was left with an aftertaste of the ""duh-factor"": of course hard work and luck influence one's chances at success. It didn't produce as much of a mental revolution in me as did his other book,  The Tipping Point. But Gladwell assembled some great anecdotes and mined them well."
