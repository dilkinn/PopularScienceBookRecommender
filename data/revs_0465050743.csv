0,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17744555-blackoxford,2," Idealised Objects Love makes us say and do silly things. But without love worse things happen. So I can’t fault Frenkel for his loving devotion to his subject. Nevertheless what he says is often silly. And he needn’t say it in order to get his point across: math (or ‘maths’ for those in the Mother Country) is beautiful.Here’s the love note from his introduction:  “Math is a way to describe reality and figure out how the world works, a universal language that has become the gold standard of truth.” If math is a description of anything (and that is controversial), it is of numbers and their relationships, certainly not of reality. It tells us how numbers work with each other, often in surprising ways. But ‘the world’ is a big place and math doesn’t say much about how love works, among much else. And while math does rely a great deal on the criterion of truth, what it means by truth is severely restricted. Truth in math is a definitional phenomenon which concerns numbers and their relationships and nothing else. Even then, math has to pretend that certain untruths about itself don’t exist (the name Gödel should not be mentioned in company). So the beloved has several imperfections that the lover doesn’t notice.The language of mathematics is indeed unlike any other language.* This is because each element of it - its vocabulary and its grammar - is precisely and invariably defined. They are  “idealised objects.” Everything about them is known because they are their definition  tout court.  In this sense at least math is entirely artificial. There is no need for a dictionary because all the words (numbers) have fixed relationships to one another. There is no ambiguity in the specification of prime numbers, for example. There are no ‘dialects’ in which a number is possibly prime or not. There is no variation in the relations among numbers despite the different notations used in 17th century France and 21st century Russia.But like all languages, the language of mathematics is entirely ‘closed.’ That is, everyone of its components can only be described by other of its components. There is no connection, for example, between the number 1 and anything outside the mathematical language in which 1 is defined. There is no 1 in non-language. This becomes absolutely clear when dealing with numbers that are negative or irrational like the square root of 2 (the hypotenuse of the unit triangle), which simply cannot exist except in mathematical language.Like many other mathematicians from the ancient Greeks onward, Frenkel tends toward the reification of numbers as things which exist independently of their definitions in language:  “... mathematical concepts exist in a world separate from the physical and mental worlds – which is sometimes referred to as the Platonic world of mathematics” This is to some degree understandable. All language is mysterious regarding where it comes from and where it ‘lives’ when not being used. And for Frenkel, the language of mathematics has personally important associations: it provided a refuge in the oppressive intellectual regime of the Soviet Union, and eventually a way to escape the memory of that oppression.Consequently, like many lovers, Frenkel considers his beloved as something effectively supernatural. Math is more real to him than is anything that is not math.** Math is an ideal world, indeed he calls it a  “parallel world” of infinite possibility, beautiful symmetry, and perfect stability - in a word: heaven. He yearns for this world as much as any believer yearns for the next life, or nirvana, or the face of God. He all but asserts the divine character of mathematics:  “Mathematics directs the flow of the universe, lurks behind its shapes and curves, holds the reins of everything from tiny atoms to the biggest stars.” But Frenkel’s breathless praise of mathematics is both unnecessary and counter-productive. Unnecessary because the beauty of mathematics doesn’t need what amounts to idolatry to inspire admiration. And counter-productive because it makes mathematics into a quasi-religion which threatens to be as arrogantly smug and self-satisfied as any other religion. He is quite right to claim that  “Mathematics is a way to break the barriers of the conventional, an expression of unbounded imagination in the search for truth.” And so is poetry, sculpture, or, for that matter, writing book reviews about hyperbolic math books. * In fact there are a large number of mathematical languages. The Langlands Project, in which Frenkel is involved is committed to translating among them in order to consolidate mathematical advances across sub-disciplines.** For example, Frenkel’s observation about the difficulty of conceiving of the square root of a negative number is telling:  “The reason is purely psychological: whereas we can represent as the length of a side of a right triangle, we don’t have such an obvious geometric representation of the square root of minus 1. But we can manipulate the square root of minus 1 algebraically as effectively as the square root of 2.” He is wrong in both his analogy and his conclusion. But for him this is the ‘real world.’"

But no, Frenkel claims that he intends to dazzle you with so much mathematical beauty that it will make you - you, as in, you the layman reader - fall in love with math. I'm afraid this book will do no such thing. "
2,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,3,"I wanted so much to love this book, but it was difficult. About half of the book is about Frenkel's life; and it was fascinating. The other half, interleaved with his memoirs, are descriptions of Frenkel's mathematical work and discoveries. I had a great deal of trouble following the descriptions of the math. I am superficially familiar with many of the concepts, but it just gets more and more complex. Toward the end, especially, I became quite confused.Frenkel grew up in a small town in the Soviet Union, a two-hour train ride from Moscow. Initially interested in physics, Frenkel's father introduced him to a mentor who showed him how modern physics, especially quantum mechanics, relies on some very modern concepts in mathematics. In that way, Frenkel got hooked on math.When he was in high school, starting to think about college, Frenkel applied to the math department at Moscow State University. It was explained to him that he had no chance of being admitted. He had a Jewish last name, and anti-Semitism would prevent his admission. Frenkel applied for admission anyway, and he was grilled mercilessly during an oral entrance exam. The examiners found excuses to refuse him admission. So, Frenkel went to undergraduate school at a different college, one that did not discriminate so much. Nevertheless, he attended lectures and seminars at Moscow State University. He didn't have a college ID, so he scaled the fence to get in! The Soviets put tight controls on photocopiers. While in undergraduate school, his research papers were secretly copied and smuggled out, and reached mathematicians around the world. One day, Frenkel received an invitation from the president of Harvard University to come to Harvard on a fellowship grant, and become an assistant professor. At that point in time, he didn't even have a PhD!What I did get out of the math descriptions, is the inner beauty of math. Vastly different areas of math can be connected, through hidden connections, as if by magic. This attracted Frenkel to the Langlands Program, a grand unified theory of mathematics. Now a vast subject, the program tries to connect number theory, harmonic analysis, geometry, representation theory, and mathematical physics. Riemann geometry is the cornerstone of Einstein's Theory of General Relativity. It contains hidden connections with number theory. Frenkel's career goal is to establish connections between the dualities in physics and the dualities in mathematics.In the last chapter, Frenkel spent a sabbatical in France, writing and producing a short film. He also co-stars in the film, titled Rites of Love and Math. The  trailer is on a site on YouTube.com. In this allegorical film, a mathematician discovers a mathematical formula for love. He realizes the formula's importance, and that it could be used for good as well as for evil. He tattoos the formula on his lover's body. The film was screened at many film festivals to wide acclaim, but also received a lot of controversy.You can read the book and skim or skip through the math. Frenkel does a good job of describing the hidden connections and beauty of math. But he leaves the average reader lost in the details."
3,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4027539-audrey,4,"I loved this book and found it riveting. My parents gave it to me last Christmas, and I avoided reading it because the cover and description didn't give many clues as to the content. (Sadly, I DO judge books by their covers.) I'd also never heard of Frenkel (yikes, that's embarrassing). Once I cracked it open, I was hooked. Equal parts autobiography and ""mathematical-research-y,"" it was a fascinating true story of discrimination against Jews in Russia, Frenkel's journey to becoming a world-renowned mathematician, and an introduction to the exciting world of modern math (the Langlands program).I would have given this 5 stars. However, I think Frenkel severely overestimates the math knowledge of the average American reader. I'm not sure why, as he's an experienced professor at Berkeley. As someone who is working on my master's in math, I caught on to the phrasing and style. I was with him through Galois groups and Riemann surfaces (mostly), but he lost me somewhere between Lie algebras and quantum physics.As a college math instructor, I'd be willing to bet that 99% of my students would have put down this book in frustration after a few chapters. Someone who is not familiar with the language of formal proofs is going to be lost amidst phrases like ""suppose, to the contrary"" and ""opening the brackets"" and discussion of 2D analogues to problems of higher dimension. Frenkel tries to confine the math details to the notes in the back of the book, but even the main content is likely to turn away the average reader from a quite fantastic book.And that's a tragedy. Because this is a timely book, written engagingly by a brilliant man. Last semester, while teaching an introductory unit on Number Theory, I referenced the recent proof of the ""bounded gaps"" conjecture. I actually had a student comment ""Oh, that's so cool! I had no idea people were still working on math! I thought everything was finished - like, it was all proved and done!"" I'd like to rewind time and hand her this book.For all my students who constantly question, ""Why do we need math?,"" I'd like to hand them this book and make them read Chapter 12. In fact, I think that's going to be required reading next semester. :) Frenkel explains his work analyzing data for a doctor. His patients' systems were not accepting transplanted kidneys, and he needed to find a way to objectively decide whether or not to try to save the kidney or remove it. Frenkel analyzed a large volume of data and used his mathematician's ability to see general patterns from specific cases, and he created a simple algorithm which gave a good diagnosis with only 4 questions. That's math, working to make a life-and-death decision process more effective. Tell me that's not fascinating!I'll finish my lengthy review with perhaps my favorite thought from the book:
This area appeared to be pure and abstract, without immediate applications. But we have to realize that fundamental scientific research forms the basis of all technological progress. Often, what looked like the most abstract and abstruse discoveries in math and physics subsequently led to innovations that we now use in our everyday life. Think of the arithmetic modulo primes, for example. When we see it for the first time it looks so abstract that it seems impossible something like this could have any real world applications....But...many apparently esoteric results in number theory...are now ubiquitous in, say, online banking....We should never try to prejudge the potential of a mathematical formula or idea for practical applications.
History shows that all spectacular technological breakthroughs were preceded, often decades earlier, by advances in pure research. Therefore, if we limit support for basic science, we limit our progress and power.
 (Pg. 188, bold emphasis mine.)"
4,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3260895-stuart,0,"If you're a math geek, Love and Math will be up your alley. If you're a math geek who is Jewish and whose parents (or you) come from Eastern Europe, it's probably a must read. Love and Math is a hybrid book, kind of a mix between Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman and George Polya's How To Solve It. The Feynman type bits - Frenkel dealing with anti-Semitism in Russia and making an erotic math film - are a mix of amusement and pathos. But mostly this book is an autobiography of math problems examined in the career of a top flight mathematician. The problems are explained succinctly and lucidly. If you aren't a math type, they'll be over your head. If you are a math type, this book is an intellectual treasure trove for casual reading. I note (not advertising, mind you) that when I was working on my novel about a Polish mathematician and her family (out next fall, but really I'm not advertising, that would be in bad taste), I read a fair number of math autobiographies while looking for a proper tone for the narrator. I settled on using Polya's book as a guide. Had this book been published a couple of years ago, it would have influenced my writing."
5,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6226405-yasiru,5,"The general tone of negative and middling reviews for this book suggest why it is (especially in countries like the United States) that while popular science seems to be embraced more and more by the masses, actual scientific and mathematical literary seems to be on the decline or finds itself at least consistently below average.The autobiographical part of the book weaves through the mathematics well enough and is very interesting in its own right, from its reflections on Russian mathematics to the antisemitism implicit in Soviet university administration that the author was directly confronted with on his academic journey. As for the maths, you'd think reading such an earnest and painstakingly clarified account of the forefront of mathematical research (producing at least a couple of Fields Medals in the last few years) merits taking out paper and pencil to try and reproduce some of the author's arguments (mostly verifying basic properties), or at least a careful read of the chapter notes. Apparently not!- it's bite-sized memes and pretty pictures or nothing (as with popular science on television and certain intelligent-seeming books by Gladwell and the like; on the other hand some sources try not to compromise too much; for instance the Numberphile Youtube channel on which Frenkel has had appearances).This response is disappointing, but I still think a keen high school student (and not necessarily as keen as Frenkel appears to have been) or even a not so keen one might find something beautiful about mathematics in this book and be persuaded to follow it (likely with the odds considerably more in their favour than for Frenkel in Soviet Russia). Certainly Frenkel's greatest achievement here is communicating as simply as possible (but making it no simpler) the essential motivation behind Galois groups, representations, Lie theory and Langlands duality. There's also a compelling bird's eye view from his experience working on the programme, but the returns for the average reader are greatest when it comes to the motivations and basic definitions and arguments. Such persuasion would be a considerable enough ambition fulfilled, whatever the book's success with a lay audience not willing to deviate the slightest from the expectation of a novel-like experience whatever the gains that might be in store.Edited to add:Having written this review, I was further disheartened to read this blog post-http://www.dam.brown.edu/people/mumfo...Nature apparently found this article unnatural (for scientists!) and rejected it. Honestly, I didn't get a nuanced picture of what Grothendieck's work was all about from this, but that's not the point- the basic ideas, in spite of the almost unavoidable jargon (given the length), do get through to a non-trivial degree and what's most valuable about a piece like this is having experts in a notoriously difficult field deign to simplify their eagle's eye view for the public- the least the public could do, especially the scientific public, is make an effort!"
6,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18185192-athan-tolis,5,"This is, comfortably, the best popular math book I’ve ever had the fortune to lay my eyes on.I have a couple degrees in the subject. One in applied math, that I studied in college, and one in pure math that I got twelve years later. Indeed, I coincided with the author at Harvard, and his description of the Math department in the Science Center, the ping pong table and that hidden gem of a library brought back memories of my first semester in college, which was largely spent poring over impossible math assignments. (It also reminded me of the rather poor personal hygiene of some of the guys there, which goes unmentioned in the book!) This is now my favorite popular math book.I don’t know math anymore, but I regardless LOVED LOVED LOVED reading this. The man has an unbelievable gift for explaining stuff and flattering you into thinking you understand it too. I can probably now blag about SO(3) and SU(2) and SU(3) and fibres and sheaves and fundamental groups with the best of them and I feel like I own the material (which of course I don’t.)For three days of my life I did math with Grothendieck and Gelfand, Drinfeld and Kac, basically, I sat there at the table with them. It was a massive high! A couple months ago, to resolve a dispute with an almost equally spent former mathematician, I wasted hours scouring the Internet to remind myself what the real meaning of the cross product is, to no avail. Frenkel slips the answer en passant on page 121: the tangent space to the unity element of a Lie group is a simpler construct called a Lie algebra. The Lie algebra of an n-dimensional Lie group is a vector space of dimension n, basically. Well, the operation under which 3D space is such an algebra is the cross product. Cool, eh?And so on. You close your eyes and you follow this boy, who grew up as a little dreamer in a city two hours out of Moscow and just wanted to know how the universe works. And you meet his teachers and take part in his search as he tries to solve the problem that consumed Einstein in the last 20 years of his life, that of coming up with a single theory that can reach beyond the “standard model” and also cover gravitation. You start with his first ever big triumph (something to do with the “knot groups,” which are explained beautifully) and you move on from there to the most intuitive ever explanation of Galois’ insight regarding the solution of polynomials (basically drawing an analogy between irrational numbers and imaginary numbers I wish somebody had told me about 30 years ago) and eventually you make it to the “Langlands problem” which I must admit went 101% over my head.But I had enough there to cheer the author on, all the way.The bit about the “equation of love” was beyond weird, of course, but I’m alright with it. Nobody forced me to read it. It was a bit as if somebody cooks you the best meal in history and then offers you the option of flamingo feather pie as desert: you don’t have to eat it. It did not undo the amazing first 228 pages, or that phenomenal set of notes in the back.Also, the guy loves math. It’s so evident, it’s infectious. And he gives you a very long warning that you cannot judge math from the abject crap that passes for math in the world’s high school curricula. He hated that too, despite the fact that he could do it. Math is the amazing construct that, whether we like it or not, surrounds us, underpins the physical world and is waiting for us to go, discover it and get the answers we seek. Chris Isham aside (who does not know me from Adam, but I once took his class), this is the most a man has ever inspired me to read math, and he did it from a book. What can I say?I’m not sure I’ve had more fun reading a book, frankly. Did not really learn anything, it would be beyond presumptuous to say so, but It flattered me so hard, I got a proper high. Thank you, Bernard, for suggesting this!"
7,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7124955-jennifer-stephens,2,"update : i finally gave up on this book. i just cannot make myself read any more of it.original review in progress: So I am slogging my way through this new memoir aptly named 'Love and Math' from a Russian Jewish mathematician. I haven't gotten to any bits about love between people yet (I was hoping for some romance) - it's mostly about his love OF math with bits of details on the deep antisemitism that used to be present in Russia. Starting to realize math geeks are a bit like dirty hippies what with their ""the beauty of the universe man; the melody of the interrelated number systems"" etc etc. Some of the math he writes about is way over my head (I couldn't follow his discussion on braids at all this morning despite rereading it 3 times) and although he presents his ideas in a conversational tone like Brian Greene does for physics (I love how BG makes me feel like I ""get"" physics; it makes me feel smart!) he's not as good as translating to common man speak as Brian is. Mostly i can tell you that the guy has a deep deep passionate love for math that borders on nuts. You ever seen that movie where Ryan Gosling buys himself a RealDoll silicone woman and pretends it is real (if you haven't you should b/c it is freaky and awesome and sweet and beautiful)? Yeah this guy is like that about math. :p"
8,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6030701-karlus,2,"An overly ambitious attempt by a brilliant mathematician to inculcate his love for the subject into a lay audience. The topic is modern mathematics, beyond the usual math we have mostly been exposed to in school. When he says ""algebra"" he means abstract algebra. Similarly for ""group,"" ""field,"" ""category"" and on up to ""strings"" and ""sheaves."" He briefly describes these objects, but sentences with ten unfamiliar terms in them are just too much for me. His topic is The Langlands Project -- also new to me -- and he vastly overestimates his ability to give an understandable overview of its content, beyond its aim of trying to unify areas of modern math and modern physics through ultra-modern research."
9,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5283134-john-karabaic,2,"Edward Frenkel needs both a better agent and a better editor.A better agent would have had a heart-to-heart talk with him about his objectives in writing this book. Frenkel claims he wants to inspire a new generation of mathematicians, particularly by bridging the ""two cultures"" between the arts and science by using the powers of love and math. That agent might have advised him that, since his work sorely needs the power of visualization, he hook up with a comic book artist--someone who knows the power of image and story combined--and create something along the lines of Larry Gonick's Cartoon History and Cartoon Guide series. (For an excellent example of cartoons in the service of teaching mathematical proof, see Gonick's wonderful single-pager on the irrationality of the square root of 2 in the Cartoon History of the Universe v1-7.) He could have then animated the story and placed it online or presented a summary in a TED talk, where I'm certain it would have gone viral.A better editor would have forced Frenkel to weave his personal and professional memoirs more tightly around a unified theme, as Eric Kandel did in his stunning ""In Search of Memory"". That editor would have recommended that he use more accessible phrasing for some terms, like ""hula hoop"" instead of ""ring used in rhythmic gymnastics."" It turns out that Frenkel perfected his English by watching David Letterman. That's unfortunate; Letterman is a genius of the absurd, but he never showcased popular explainers and debunkers like Sagan and Randi, as Carson did. Perhaps if Frenkel had seen those masters, he would have learned better how to harness the power of imagery and pop culture references.This book lacks the discipline necessary to apply the steady force to bend the topic to its narrative, jumping from trite autobiography (only because of its reliance on cliché) to strange screenplay excerpts. (Screenplay excerpts that are unintentionally hilarious; they resemble the first draft of Roman and Kent's scifi movie from the ""Steve Guttenberg's Birthday"" Party Down episode.)The Langlands Program seems like an important effort in modern math. American taxpayers have funded it with millions of dollars through DARPA. It would have been great if Frenkel could have told us about it with more skill. Ultimately, I wish that Frenkel had found that agent and that editor, because he has a lot to say. I couldn't understand most of it through the jargon-laden text that made it to final production. I wish it had been presented in such a way that I--and a much larger audience--could."
10,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6243880-gary-beauregard-bottomley,4,"I enjoyed the book, but would be hard pressed to recommend it since he does explain all the details that goes into the relevant math and the listener can get lost within the weeds of the math. I did not know this branch of mathematics and was able to follow the details, but sometimes it did get overwhelming.Math is beautiful. Behind our current different branches of abstract math there exist an ultimate theory that ties each branch together. This book explains all of this by delving into the mathematical details and stepping the listener through many abstract math concepts.The author tells an exciting story. The description of the fundamental particles of nature are said to be described by the ""eight fold path"". I've often wondered what that meant. The book starts by explaining what it means to be symmetrical and how we can transform objects into mathematically equivalent systems. This leads to Evariste Galois the greatest mathematician who you probably never have heard of. On the night before he died in a duel, he connected number theory to geometry by considering the relationship of certain groups (Galois Groups) with their fields and some symmetries in order to solve quintic equations (fifth degree polynomials). Once again, I had often wondered about what was so special about solving fifth degree polynomials. The book steps me through that.The ultimate theory of math tries to show the correspondences between different diverse areas of abstract math and then the author ties this to QED and string theory. He'll even explain what SU3 means in the standard model by analogy with constructing SO3 spaces (standard 3 dimensional ordinate systems). He'll step you through the vector spaces, function theory, and metric spaces and the functions of the metric space (sheaves) that you'll need to understand what it all means.He really does tie all the concepts together and explains them as he presents them. You'll understand why string theorist think there could be 10 to the 500 different possible universes and so on.Just so that any reader of this review fully understands, this is a very difficult book, and should only be listened to by someone who has wondered about some of the following topics, the meaning of the ""eight fold path"", the SU3 construction, and why Galois is relevant to today's physics, tying of math branches and physics together, and other just as intriguing ideas. I had, and he answers these by getting in the weeds and never talking down to the listener, but I'm guessing the typical reader hasn't wondered these topics and this book will not be as entertaining to them and might be hard to follow.P.S. A book like this really highlights while I like audible so much. If I had read the book instead of listening to it, it would have taken me eight hours per most pages because I would have had to understand everything before preceding, but by listening I have to not dwell on a page. Another thing, the author really missed a great opportunity by making the book too complex, because he has a great math story to tell and he could have made easier analogies and talked around the jargon better. "
11,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2130032-daniel-r,3,"This book would have been better if it was structured as two short novels, one about his life and the other about the mathematics he has worked on, instead of one interwoven book. The author provides suggestions for skipping chapters heavy on math but I feel that weakens the author's goal of wanting to create a book about mathematics that could be enjoyed by those terrified of math. As the book progresses the math gets more complex and the examples and analogies for it get fewer. As a reader I got lost, started skimming, and had to agree with the author that only a handful of people in the world understand what he works on. Unfortunately as a result I didn't come away with an impression or appreciation for the beauty of mathematics like I have for the double helix of DNA even though I don't understand the biology behind DNA. What I did enjoy about the book was the author's struggle and journey through life. As a persecuted Jewish boy in Russia he managed to overcome multiple roadblocks, with the help of an amazing cast of mentors, in order to pursue his love of mathematics once he discovered that was his true calling. Given the recentness of many events in the book it is an inspiring story worth reading and makes up for the book's other shortcomings."
12,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1188122-kara-babcock,3,"I’m disappointed that so many people seem underwhelmed by the autobiographical parts of this book and feel that they are ancillary to Frenkel’s purpose. I disagree: they are, in fact, the heart and soul of Love & Math. Without them, this would be a fairly intense treatise on deep connections between abstract algebra, algebraic geometry, and quantum physics. With them, Frenkel demonstrates how the study of mathematics and a devotion to thought for thought’s sake, to fulfil human curiosity helped him personally through anti-Semitism and Soviet persecution. In some ways I was reminded of remarks Neil Turok makes in 
The Universe Within
 (if I am remembering correctly) about the state of education in many African countries depriving us of staggering potential intellects. How many people, poor or Jewish or otherwise unprivileged, were not as lucky as Frenkel happened to be?Frenkel’s personal recollections are also interesting because they provide a glimpse into the lifestyle and community of professional mathematicians. This is not something most people think about, even people who are scientifically-minded. There are a few famously reclusive or otherwise lone-wolf mathematicians out there (though I think that most of them at least maintain some kind of correspondence with a few respected colleagues), but for the most part, twentieth and twenty-first century mathematics is very much a group endeavour. Frenkel describes how he helped to organize new research in the Langlands Program by gathering together mathematicians from various institutions to hear their input. Belying the stereotypes, mathematics is a very social world.Ultimately, of course, the personal parts of the story are essential to Frenkel’s explanation of why he loves math. Again, I must disagree with those reviewers who pan this book because it doesn’t inspire them to love math … that was never the aim. Neither the book nor Frenkel are naive enough to believe that, I think. But I suspect one reason many people react the way they do when one reveals one’s mathematical inclinations is genuine bewilderment over the idea that a “normal” person could actually love math. As Frenkel points out, even when mathematical achievements are depicted in popular culture, the subject is always a social outsider.(In a way, it’s similar to this whole idea of left brain/right brain people. “Oh, you’re a left brain person!” and, when people find out I teach both math and English, “You’ve got a weird left and right brain thing going on!” But the truth is, a lot of people in “left brain” positions that require logical reasoning are also very creative and passionate and linguistic—and a lot of “right brain” thinkers are also organized and calculating. Humans are diverse, and the stereotypes and categories we create are not that good at classifying us.)The autobiographical elements also humanize what might otherwise be a fairly involved book. When Frenkel talks about loving math, he isn’t pulling a 
Cabinet of Curiosities
 here. Don’t get me wrong: I’m all for books explaining elementary math. But I’m pleased that Frenkel tackles much higher-concept, abstract mathematics in a nonetheless accessible and approachable way.I’ve forgotten a lot of my undergraduate math, I am sorry to say. One day I’ll delve back into ring theory and group theory for some fun. I’m pleased by how much I do remember, however. I recognized a great deal of what Frenkel explained, even though some of it still managed to escape me. So when I say Love & Math is accessible, I’m not claiming Frenkel is going to help you comprehend abstract algebra. Rather, he demonstrates some of the concepts that power abstract algebra through some clever diagrams and explanations, and he connects abstract algebra to quantum physics.I particularly enjoyed this latter endeavour. I knew that symmetry was one of the most significant aspects of group theory, but I didn’t understand the specific ways in which group theory actually underlies a good deal of the interactions between subatomic particles. So that was cool. There are many points where Frenkel basically explains the math behind the physics, then says, “Oh, and mathematicians figured this out long before physicists came along and discovered the math was useful.” That’s not to say math is more important than physics (that’s just, like, self-evident), but I love that we can build these models in math without any reference to the physical world … and then somehow, these models become useful in explaining the physical world. That is just mind-boggling.As an educator, I also sympathized with another remark Frenkel makes, rather early in the book. He compares the teaching of math in high schools now to the prospect of teaching art by having students paint fences. That is, we barely get to scratch the surface of what mathematics is in high school. Frenkel speaks of quadratics with the disdain only a pure mathematician could muster. But it’s true: I don’t blame students for thinking that math is boring, because the topics we drill into them and the way we do it tends to communicate that fact. You really don’t need to know the quadratic formula—not in the days of Wolfram Alpha—but symmetry? That’s not only important but beautiful as well.Honestly, Love & Math is not going to make you love math, and it was never supposed to. It’s not going to teach you group theory or representation theory, and you probably won’t have any clue what a Riemannian Surface or a Kac–Moody Algebra is after reading the book. (Maybe you’ll understand what a group is, in some way.) If you’re really interested in learning those things, there are books and videos and courses and wikis to help you out.Instead, Love & Math is one mathematician’s story of how he fell in love with math, how it saved and defined his life, and how he feels honoured and awed that he has had the chance to give back to the mathematical community. Frenkel goes so far as to make a weird surrealist movie about loving math … and that is not my thing, but it’s clearly his thing, and I’m all for people doing their thing. So you go, Frenkel. And while you do that, hopefully some of the people who read this book come away with a better understanding of what it might mean to love math, even if they don’t quite share that feeling themselves.

13,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4277032-d,3,"As stated in a previous comment, I really enjoyed the first part that contains the story of the author’s first research in mathematics, including some optional mathematical details and motivations. I learned a lot from it. Unfortunately, after that the details disappear and ideas are sketched in an, for me, incomprehensible way. Further on, the subject changes to autobiography and random musings on e.g. the idea that mathematics is not invented but discovered, supporting Plato’s thesis. If the book only contained the ‘mathematical part’, I would give it five stars. Sadly, the second part spoiled it for me. "
14,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6816078-maru-kun,2,"The author certainly has a talent for explaining mathematical concepts clearly in a way that leaves you wanting to hear more, if you will excuse the cliche.I was pleased with myself understanding the idea behind braids and also how ""addition"" and ""identity"" could be applied to them in a manner analogous to these ideas in the more conventional maths I was taught at school. I could even glimpse how these concepts might be abstracted to ever higher levels.We were teased with notion that the symmetries of a certain mathematical set corresponded to the model for the fundamental particles of physics and the author explained how this amazing insight set him on the path to a love of maths, but unfortunately few further details were forthcoming.So it's a shame that the author's talent for explaining maths was only on display in a few sections of the book, with a lot of the filler being name dropping of some undoubtedly great mathematical geniuses with whom he works. Unfortunately no one except the most ardent maths geek will ever have heard of most of them. A long and moderately interesting tale of persecution of Jewish mathematicians in late communist Russia padded out the rest of the book, but not much maths there.If the author had a go at writing another book and stuck to the maths I would certainly want to give it a look. Otherwise it is difficult to see who this book is really aimed at."

16,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3115107-chimezie-ogbuji,3,"This book is billed as being both for mathematicians and non-mathematicians, but only the first half of that is correct. The author doesn't make enough of an effort to make the language more accessible for laypeople or at least people who don't do research in math or theoretical physics for a living (which is a general problem of the style of writing in the sciences)"
17,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7384655-rick-goff,5,"To paraphrase William Hurt from The Big Chill, sometimes you just have to let math flow over you. I realized while reading chapter 2 that I wasn't going to be able to grok and synthesize the mathematical content of this book, but this didn't stop me from enjoying it immensely. The passion of the writer for his subject is contagious, and his biography is interesting and inspiring.Frenkel's book is a memoir of his introduction to The Other Math, the one that is creative and deep. He is diligent and obviously talented from the start, and the only hindrance to his advancement is his Jewish surname in pre-peristroika USSR. His achievements as a teenager lead to an opportunity to go to Harvard for a 3-month visit. He winds up staying 5 years, finishing a PhD and being appointed Assistant Professor. He's not yet 25 years old. The rest of the memoir follows this arc. This is the kind of guy who, while recounting a story about co-authoring a groundbreaking paper, says, ""meanwhile I had become fluent in French and Portuguese ..."". Yeh. Me too, buddy.Anyway, Frenkel's narrative of his mathematical investigations is based around his involvement with something called the Langlands Program, which is a pure math initiative, as well as research in quantum physics. These two areas of research are mutually enriching to the dozen humans who understand them.A front cover reviewer says, ""If you're not a mathematician, then this book might make you want to become one."" That's right but, for me, it's obvious that this wish wouldn't refer only to the opportunity, but also to the talent. I wouldn't want to become a Chicago Bull as a 49-year-old vertically challenged, poor-sighted man; I'd want to do it as a 6'6"" 20-year-old with a reliable jumpshot and a sick crossover.It is entirely possible that I will read this book again. The math smells fascinating. I can only imagine how edifying it would be if I actually understood it."
18,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11935227-matt,3,"Frenkel takes the reader through the world of modern math in an expression of great passion for an often maligned subject. He interlaces the story of mathematical developments in the last fifty or so years with his personal story of growing up in Soviet Russia and emigrating to the United States. The stories of anti-Semitism he encountered in Russia are cringe worthy. Imagine being singled out with especially difficult testing for a college entrance exam, which you still pass, and then being failed by racist examiners. Despite this discrimination, Frenkel's pursuit of mathematical frontiers led him to top of his field. There he found his work contributing to what's known as the Langland's Program, which seeks to unite seemingly separate fields of math (like number theory and geometry). Connecting these worlds of math have contributed to an increased understanding of quantum physics and formulated cryptography methods used every day on the internet. Even if I can't understand some of the denser language, it's exciting to read the passion researchers have for pushing on the boundaries of human knowledge."
19,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/664250-rissie,2,"Here's the thing ... I like math. I teach honors level math to high school students, I enjoy working on problems recreationally and I have read (and enjoyed) many math related books. So, it's not because I don't like or understand mathematics that this book did not appeal to me. I liked the autobiographical parts about learning math and pursuing his dream no matter the obstacles, but I think the math was too abstract for me (and especially for the lay audience for which it is intended). Perhaps I have the same relationship with this author as my students have with me. I like the guy as a person and respect the work he does and the passion he has, but a lot of the stuff was too far beyond my comprehension to see the beauty in it, let alone love it. "
20,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/145381-brian,4,"(4.0) Trouble following at points in the mathy bits, not sure it's the fault of the book :( Enjoyed the autobiographical stuff a lot though."
21,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7386193-jane,3,"I did not have the privilege of taking a class with Edward Frenkel while a student at UC Berkeley, but his book has been on my radar for a while. The biographical details about Frenkel's upbringing in the former Soviet Union and the anti-Semitic discrimination he faced are truly interesting, and as a math nerd I enjoyed the math portions too. But I'm skeptical that someone without a math background or a ton of interest and motivation would actually be converted to thinking math is beautiful based on this book, which is what Frenkel is clearly aiming for. All of this would have placed Love and Math comfortably in a four-star rating-- not a ringing endorsement, but a solid thumbs up nevertheless-- if it weren't for the chapter covering Frenkel's short film, Rites of Love and Math, which stars a mathematician (played by Frenkel himself) who discovers a formula for love. I haven't seen the film, but the chapter in the book effectively summarizes the plot, and I just found the whole thing to be a problematic clusterfuck with Unfortunate Implications. Frenkel states that he made Rites of Love and Math, which has erotic elements, partly to combat stereotypes about mathematicians being cold and sexless beings. I am 10/10 all about that. But here are the other main takeaways I had based on the plot summary: Sure, the mathematician protagonist is handsome and has sex, but I think he still perpetuates the stereotype of mathematicians being reclusive white males obsessed with their work-- the only other character he seems to interact with is his lover, a Japanese woman named Mariko. Again, since I haven't seen this film, I can't pick up on the finer nuances of their relationship, but it's certainly a red flag for geisha fetishization bullshit. Another red flag: the film is supposedly a nod to the Japanese film Patriotism (originally released in English at The Rite of Love and Death). In it, a lieutenant commits seppuku when he is ordered to execute fellow mutineers after a failed coup. In Rites of Love and Math, the mathematician commits suicide after realizing his formula for love is too dangerous. I'm not saying that a couple of white guys can't draw inspiration from a Japanese film and create a respectful homage, but this homage is not looking good. The best part, though, is before he commits suicide, the mathematician tattoos his formula for love (you know, the one that's too dangerous for him to keep track of) on Mariko's body. So there's the nonsensical (if artistic and titillating) angle for his actions. Then it symbolically places men as mathematicians and actors with agency in contrast to women as receiving vessels for their greatness (pure mathematics is already one of the most egregious examples of male-dominated STEM fields). Plus there's the layer of the mathematician being a white man and Mariko being an Asian woman (which is not fundamentally wrong, but art doesn't exist in a vacuum). And then, if you think about it, hiding the formula as a tattoo on Mariko's body means that Mariko is going to need to cover it up for the rest of her life. She's going to have to avoid swimming and public changing rooms and having sex with other people. Here that, ladies? IF YOU HAVE SEX YOU COULD DESTROY THE ENTIRE WORLD. Yes, I'm technically reviewing Frenkel's book and not his film, and discussion of the film occupies a single chapter out of many in his book. But I felt it would be remiss if I didn't take away at least one star for that. "
22,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,3,"Not long after I started reading this book, I happened to have it out at a coffeeshop when an acquaintance of mine saw it, and said she had read it as well. Or rather, the first half of it.I didn't ask why only the first half, but I think I can guess. It is Edward Frenkel's mission in life to make you love math, and not just the relatively accessible kind that you might find in newspaper puzzles. He wants to introduce you to the Langlands Program, a sort of Theory of Everything for advanced math that involves topics so abstract it takes you several chapters to even understand what they're attempting, let alone any description of what progress they have actually made.Frenkel is a good storyteller, though, and he weaves this with his own life, as a youngster in the last days of the Soviet Union, struggling to find a way to be a mathematician in a society that closed most of the obvious paths towards that to anyone with a Jewish parent. This is partly infuriating, and partly fascinating, as he gives us a peek into a society we rarely read about in the West, one where there are almost clandestine meetings of mathematicians, meeting informally to present to each other (after getting off of work in whatever day job actually paid their rent) in a way that it is hard to imagine many Americans doing.There is a point, perhaps about halfway through the book, where I had to take a step back from the math. Instead of actually understanding what I was being told in detail, I had to content myself with just getting the general gist of what he was talking about. I couldn't, for example, remember what exactly a Galois group was and how that compared to a Reimann surface; I could just remember they were two kinds of math that had originally appeared to be totally unrelated, that they had found surprising and deep connections between.If you're able to content yourself with this level of understanding, Frenkel's book is an engaging read. If you don't, and you're not ready to do a lot of heavy lifting to pound some rather abstract topics into your head just to read this book, then you may not. But if nothing else, Frenkel does a great job of convincing you that mathematicians are not, on the whole, less passionate and more coldly logical than the rest of us. On the contrary, a large part of becoming a great mathematician seems to consist of immersing yourself in it long enough to acquire an intuition about what to try when attacking a new problem. Moreover, in the current labor market, people with good analytical skills usually could be making more money doing something else, like engineering or computer programming. The ones who nonetheless choose to pursue what they view as the purest form of knowledge, are self-selected for being a little bit on the idealistic side.I was never tempted to stop, and I'm kind of sorry it's finished. Reading this book is kind of like spending a few hours with that super-smart friend of yours who is excited about something that you cannot really understand, but it's still fun to hear him talk about it because he's so into it. Life is full of people trying to pretend they are not impressed. This guy is impressed, and he wants to share what he's found. It's worth the effort to let him tell you about it."
23,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23212031-james-foster,3,"“Love and Math” is an unusual mash-up of three different stories. In one, a young Jewish prodigy transcends the antisemitism of Soviet Russia to take a preeminent place in the world of professional mathematics. The second story is love for the mathematics itself—a radical unification of different, apparently distinct, fields of pure mathematics. The third story is a reflection on how erotic love is built on symmetries, much like the mathematics. I found this third bit silly and strained.The author’s love of mathematics comes through very strongly, so an autobiography would have been a terrific book if it unified these first two parts more clearly. Unfortunately, the author loves the math so much that he commits the cardinal sin of those who love too much: assuming the reader is as infatuated as he is. Sometimes one want to interrupt “no, her smile really doesn't outshine the sun, and her walk really isn’t more graceful than a doe.” That said, I personally share the author’s love of this kind of mathematics. In fact, after finishing this book, I took down some of my college math texts (I was in an honors math program at a top university many years ago) an re-experienced the arcane joy of doing pure math. To be fair, he tried to keep the difficult stuff in (long) end notes, so as not to interrupt the narrative. And it may have been my own fault that I couldn’t resist spending a lot of time working through those end notes. But without the end notes, the narrative would be a lot of “math speak” that would make no sense to most readers. But I think he could have conveyed the joy of abstract thought without requiring the reader to choose between wading into or skimming over the details. We really don’t need to know what a Lie group, or even a group, is in order to appreciate that the author was extremely fortunate in his mentors. My bottom line: if you really want to know how modern efforts to unify algebra, geometry, and number theory arose, read the book (except for the last chapter). Otherwise, hope that the author comes out with an autobiography that dwells more on his inter-personal relationships."
24,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25338445-angie-reisetter,5,"Disclaimer: I don't think I was the target audience for this book. I'm a physicist. I use math a lot, and many of the concepts in the book were either already familiar to me or at least on the periphery of my awareness. I got a lot out of the math explanations here. I really appreciated that, but I think that maybe Frenkel fell short of his goal of making these concepts accessible to the average reader.Maybe the goal, though, isn't for everyone to understand the concepts, but appreciate his passion for them. In that, he definitely succeeds. His life story is captivating, and the conviction with which he tells us how interesting all these topics are is overwhelming. I generally don't like math -- that's what I have in common with the average reader, I guess. I do lots of math -- I use it, I need it, and I'm pretty good at it -- but pure math has never interested me. I'm interested in its applications, which is why I'm a physicist and not a mathematician. My vision generally starts clouding over whenever branes are mentioned. I found myself being drawn into his explanations of riemann surfaces and Lie algebras, though. He actually got me interested in some pure math. And so yes, he succeeded. He made someone who isn't crazy about math interested in what he's working on. The Langlands program actually is fascinating. Isn't that amazing? Connections between big ideas are startling and exciting. Ultimately, I can't analyze this book from anyone's perspective but my own. So I'll just say that I though that was most assuredly a 5-star amazing book. I'll put all the usual caveats on there that people are different and maybe others won't like it as much, but that's true of any book I like.The writing of this book was a bold, ambitious move. I applaud Frenkel for the effort and thoroughly enjoyed reading it."
25,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55639871-j-nick-fisk,4,"I can't in good faith give this book a 5 star rating, despite my immense enjoyment of it. The introduction frames the book as an exploration of modern math and how to appreciate it--with particular focus on the layperson. Unfortunately, this promise is never really delivered upon. The book is far more a memoir--which is far from a bad thing. Dr. Frenkel lived an interesting life and it was a compelling tale of his voyage through mathematics. However, the math quickly flies off the rails. I am a computational biologist in a biostats type field and I was still largely left in the dust in chapters 14 and 17. I imagine complete laymen would lose their way even earlier. Dr. Frenkel does poise that it is ok to skip math heavy sections; however, some chapters (like 14 and 17) consist majorly of mathematics. If you can make it to Chapter 18, Dr. Frenkel does delve a bit more into the 'love' aspect that is this book's namesake. Generally, I really enjoyed the book. If he had written strictly as a memoir, it would have gotten a 5 star rating. Likewise, if he had managed to keep the mathematics at a lower level (he succeeds early in the book, but loses it later, in my opinion) I would also give it a 5. But it ends up being slightly muddied by the two together, as it breaks the smoothness of the narrative. Still, I think Frenkel is the man. If you want a sense of his personality, he has done a few videos in conjunction with Numberphile on Youtube that I highly recommend."
26,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6376973-caroline-gordon,4,"Wondering why my undergraduate degree in pure maths didn't cover the concepts that drove Frenkel through his love affair with maths, it seemed to me a fairly uninspiring area that never really got too hard, unlike applied maths which was much more real and much more satisfyingly hard. His stated mission is to show the world what maths is really about, I think he succeeded but he is preaching to the converted in selling the idea that maths is at the heart of the meaning of the universe. In fact more that he shows how it exists independently of thought and physical reality, there just waiting to be discovered. The maths we learn at school he says is like only ever being taught how to paint the front fence, never being shown the work of the great masters and then we wonder why maths is not part of the modern discourse and there is no universal appreciation of what it really is. In a world increasing driven by algorithms we have to move discussion of those algorithms from the tutor room to the 7 o'clock news.You won't really comprehend the maths he presents but you will understand that maths is all about the world of conceptual frameworks, ideas and constructions that sometimes match reality and sometimes just provide a way to link with other frameworks that do. His descriptions of the joys of mathematical discovery are themselves pure joy. "

While it's not an ""easy"" read, Frenkel does a great job of making complicated concepts understandable and interesting. He exposed me to a world I never even knew existed (even though I've taken over a dozen applied math courses in university). If you don't finish this book with a burning desire to learn more about the beautiful world of mathematics, I'd be willing to bet you didn't give this book the time or attention it needs to be fully appreciated. This is by far one of the best books I've ever read. "

He had to overcome blatant anti-Semitic discrimination in the Soviet Union, and he did this with a refusal to give up or to give in.Much of the book discussed symmetry, and how it has been applied to analysis in the search for quarks, etc. The language was not hard to understand, although I did have to take this very slow. And go over it several times. My preference in math is algebra, due to its perfect logic and black & white results: Either a = b, or not. No in between. Symmetry is not that limited, and it has vast power simply due to its ability to illuminate things that otherwise might never be seen.A lot of number theory also is included. All with a very ""how do we apply this?"" attitude. Even toward Fermet's last theorem.From Chapter 6:""Solving a mathematical problem is like doing a jigsaw puzzle, except you don't know in advance what the final picture will look like.

I've always loved math, but reading this book hasn't made me want to run and become a mathematician. Half the book reads like a memoir, which I didn't mind as I enjoy that genre, but like I said, not what I was expecting. Pure, 'non-practictal' math is impossible to grasp for the non mathematician and there's a lot of that in this book. Frenkel does try to explain using analogies, but that's not always possible. In one instance, when referring to a formula he wrote, he concedes that maybe only 10 or 12 people in the entire world can understand it. Not even math students will get it! On the other hand, I have become familiarized with a lot of math theories that is being studied in the last 50 years, so I'm still glad I read this book. It's obvious Frenkel has a deep passion for his field. You have to be extremely passionate to devote years and years looking for discoveries and connections in things that seem unrelated. This is still pretty accessible and if you want to see math like you've never seen in the classroom, give it a shot. Definitely mind-expanding."

This book discussed lots of things concerning which I had zero knowledge. It dealt with groups, symmetries, topology, etc. All of those are (for the most part) beyond my level of training. I've gotten moderately far into elementary number theory -- dealing with modular arithmetic, encryption, and even some into quadratic reciprocity (for which I've not managed to master the proofs). Frenkel's book might be a good book for a professional mathematician, but laymen will find it tough going -- except for the biographical aspects of the book, which are very nicely written. As for myself, if I'd known how tough this book is, I would likely not have bought it. But then, I'm not a professional mathematician or mathematics student. "

This book is decidedly of the second group. The author interleaves with the difficult parts a memoir of growing up a prodigy in the USSR, facing discrimination and eventually escaping to a visiting position at Harvard despite not having finished his undergrad(!) He talks about his involvement in the Langlands Program, an attempt at a sort of Grand Unified Theory of Maths, and attempts to convey the beauty and excitement he finds in it. Starting with symmetry and groups, Frenkel rapidly progresses into the heart of contemporary mathematics: Lie algebras, Riemann surfaces, elliptic curves in the complex plane, n-branes, quantum field applications of theorised supersymmetries, and much more. I would lie if I claimed to have grasped it all, but I got a lot out of following the threads in each chapter as far as I could, stopping, rereading and Wikipedia-ing.

I also felt that the couple last chapters did not really fit well with the rest of the book and felt a bit tacky.I would've given this 2 stars, or maybe even 1 star, if not for the first several chapters."

40,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30982871-james-f,4,"Edward Frenkel, Love and Math [2013] 306 pages [Kindle]I read this amazing book more or less by accident; I was testing the direct download link in the library catalogue and this is the book I happened to download to my Kindle. I started looking through it and the preface convinced me to read it. Frenkel is a mathematician, born in the U.S.S.R. and now at Berkeley, who is working on something called the ""Langlands Project"". He begins by discussing the fact that otherwise well-educated people who would never brag that they hated literature or art or music seem proud to say they ""hate math"", and admit they know nothing about it; and he suggests that the reason is the way it is taught. He uses the analogy, suppose you took a course in Art, and instead of showing you the works of Rembrandt and Van Gogh they spent the entire class teaching you to paint -- fences. Would you be interested in pursuing art? But this is the way that math is generally taught -- as a practical collection of tools for doing other (mostly boring) things. The ""masterpieces"" of math are never mentioned. He also points out that most of the math which is taught in high school and even the early years of college dates from the ancient Greeks or the early modern period -- current work is never mentioned; it's as if a physics course ended with the work of Galileo and Newton, and gave the impression that everything in physics was already discovered and all that was left was to use it for practical engineering. Then he goes on to talk about popular science writers, such as Stephen Hawking or Brian Greene, who present the exciting developments of contemporary work in physics for the layperson, and asks why there are so few if any popularizations of work at the frontiers of contemporary math. He warns of the political dangers of allowing a small elite to monopolize knowledge of mathematics in an age when all our lives depend more than ever before on applications of math, from the Internet to Wall Street; he suggests that a mathematically literate population would not be so easily taken in by the doubletalk of the bankers and politicians. That is the gap he is trying to fill with this book. The focus is on his own work on the Langlands Project, and like the physics books of Kip Thorne or Leonard Susskind, he includes much of his own experiences. In the first few chapters, he explains how he became interested in math as a high school student; how he was denied entry into the more prestigious schools because he was Jewish, and the official academic world in the era of the final decay of the Soviet bureaucracy was highly anti-Semitic; how he was privately mentored by some of the great Soviet mathematicians, who were opposed to anti-Semitism, including the legendary Israel Gelfand, who was himself Jewish; how he worked in private and more or less secretly on group theory, and sent his first papers abroad; how he was invited to Harvard in the first months of perestroika under Gorbachev, where he became a Visiting Professor before he had even become a grad student; and how he came in contact with the Langlands Project. After that, the book is largely a popular account of the Langlands Project itself. While popular physics books try to avoid math, a popular math book of course has to be about math, and I learned much from this book. At the beginning, his explanations are very clear, and make ideas like modulo arithmetic, finite fields, Lie groups and Riemann surfaces understandable (some of the very subjects I had trouble with in reading Penrose's The Road to Reality). Later on, the book becomes more difficult to follow and his explanations of vector spaces and representations were briefer and less clear; by the end he is mentioning things like fiber bundles and automorphic functions without any explanation at all. If we keep in mind the comparison to someone like Brian Greene, though, it is hard to fault this too much; no one expects to actually learn quantum theory or string theory from a popular science book, and we shouldn't expect to learn advanced math from a book like this -- what we want to learn is what in general it is about, what the questions are and what sort of research is going on, and he is very good at that. His observations that sets, functions and numbers have been left behind for categories, sheaves and vector spaces was interesting; something like the way classical physics gave way to quantum theory. Quantum theory and string theory are here, as the ""fourth column"" of the Langlands Program; the author has collaborated with physicist-mathematicians such as Edward Witten on the connections between the two fields. So what is the Langlands Program? Essentially, it is a program to discover patterns common to various seemingly unrelated branches of mathematics (and recently physics), in particular to relate group theory and curves over finite fields to subjects like harmonic analysis and Riemann surfaces. If you don't know what these things are -- that's evidence for his thesis. "

42,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42063497-christina,3,"Yes, most of the mathematics in this book is hard. Edward Frenkel's work is cutting-edge mathematical research, after all, with applications in quantum mechanics, so it's no walk in the park. I give him credit for even attempting to explain it to a lay audience. As he states in ""A Guide for the Reader"", you can skip the sections and chapters that deal with the math. I think most readers of this book will end up doing so at some point, mainly enjoying the biographical parts.Frenkel's point in writing this book, as he explains in the ""Preface"", is to share his love for mathematics with an audience who doesn't get to see much of its hidden beauty. He does this by taking the reader on the journey that led him to mathematics, starting with a friend of his father's who taught Frenkle about symmetries and braid groups when he was in his late teens. This sparked his lifelong passion for math, and we learn all about the obstacles thrown into his path by the Soviet system that made it next to impossible for a son of a Jew to study or work in research mathematics. Luckily, he was the right age to take advantage of Perestroika, and then the collapse of the Soviet Union, and was able to both finish his studies and find an academic position in the United States.We get introduced to the main project in Frankel's career, the Langlands Program, in chapter 8, ""Magic Numbers,"" where a lot of background is given. The Langlands Program, if finished, will link together several fields of mathematics that seem unrelated on the surface. This is difficult to do and pretty rare. The background leading up to this is wide-ranging, and Frenkle tries to simplify his explanations as much as possible, but this is where the abstract nature of advanced mathematics is probably going to confuse most of his audience. In a mere 15 pages, you get a high-level whirlwind tour of the Galois groups, how the Shimura-Taniyama-Weil conjecture was used to prove Fermat's Last Theorem, how this conjecture is a general result for finding the generating function of cubic equations (using the generating function of the Fibonacci numbers as an analogy), and how it is a special case of the Langlands Program. I had to read chapter 8 very carefully and slowly, but I got the gist of it, if not a deep understanding. By the next chapter, where he introduces Lie (pronounced ""lee"") groups and algebras, I admit I was lost.The remaining math sections left me feeling like Frenkel was Beethoven, explaining how he had composed his symphonies, while I was the novice student who had finished a basic course in music theory, and knew how to play ""Für Elise"" but not much else. While his enthusiasm for mathematics and his life's work are all obvious, I just cannot appreciate the depth or the details on the same level. I found this discouraging and more than a little frustrating, because I wanted to see the same beauty that he did. I did appreciate the journey he has taken to get to this point, and the real-life depiction of how mathematical research is actually done - sometimes painfully slowly. Perhaps after some years of study I will be able to appreciate the mathematical sections just as much as the biographical ones."
43,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5931241-jenny,2,"This author was a guest on the Colbert Report, which is when I first learned of his book. He described the concept so passionately, and he argued that mathematics has been so misunderstood because it isn't given its fair due in K-12 school curricula. Frenkel is disillusioned that the general masses don't appreciate math, and he set out to conquer our hearts with this book. He stated that this book was written specifically for people like me, laypeople who have never had the opportunity to give math a fair shake because all they learn are boring basic concepts in school and they never see the true beauty of it. He compared it to taking an art class in which you only get to paint a fence and are never actually shown the works of great artists. Fair enough, I thought. I'll give it a try.By chapter three, I realized that Edward Frenkel is a misguided genius who truly believes that laypeople could possibly understand what he is talking about. I don't sense that he is a self-righteous individual who wants to come across as ridiculously smart (he is, in fact, ridiculously smart). I think he really just doesn't get that trying to relate these concepts to people like me, who only made it through Calc A, cannot be done. Hence, large parts of the book left me absolutely lost. Even BJ, who was a math minor, said he wasn't keeping up and so he quit reading it. Consider this sentence: ""The idea of string theory is that by doing calculations in these sigma models and summing up the results over all possible Riemann surfaces E (that is, over all possible paths of the strings propagating in a fixed space-time S) we can reproduce the physics that we observe in space-time S."" Honestly, I wish this particular sentence, which I chose at random, was a stand-apart in terms of its difficulty, but the truth is that much of this book is written in this language with ten unfamiliar concepts thrown together in the same sentence, all with the assumption that we must understand what the heck he is talking about. The redeeming points of the book were the interspersed memoir portions, which were extremely interesting. Frenkel was born in the Soviet Union and endured intense antisemitism at practically every turn in his education, but still prevailed and eventually traveled to Harvard and then to UC-Berkeley with professorships. I very much loved hearing about his experiences growing up, in college, working with colleagues, and his personal excitement about solving mathematical problems. It was only that he felt the need to then delve INTO those problems with technical language that made this book a disappointment--along with the fact that I didn't feel it delivered what it originally promised.In the end, I walked away appreciating Edward Frenkel's personal story. However, I did NOT end up appreciating math anymore than I ever did before, which was precisely why I decided to read the book in the first place. Unless you're ready to skip some major portions or else you're a mathematician, I don't recommend this book to you. This book is truly written for mathematicians, not laypeople, as it was so described."
44,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28285354-ron,3,"Love and Math: The Heart of Hidden Reality by Edward FrenkelThis is the story of a young boy of 12 who loved quantum physics, but not math. When he learned that the quark was found by using math, he decided to study math. He grew up a 100 miles from Moscow and he was Jewish. He was a very bright student and when he finished public school, he went to Moscow to take the test to enter the Moscow State University but at that time MSU discriminated against the Jewish people and when Edward went to take the test, he was taken to a room by two of the testers and given an oral exam and the testers did not like the correct answers he gave to the questions, so he failed the entrance exam. Later one of the testers came to him and told him that he could get into Moscow Institute of Oil and Gas, where they also had a good applied mathematics school and even used some of the professors who taught at MSU. He was accepted to the Moscow Institute of Oil and Gas and in his second year there he solved a difficult problem and it was brought to the attention of one of the MSU top mathematician professors. He solved an even more advanced math problem that this professor gave him and he wrote his first juried math paper for the Journal of Mathematics. Soon, he received a three month invitation to learn at Harvard. He was on his way to becoming a top flight mathematician. He worked on the Langlands program to unify various branches of mathematics. Edward and other mathematicians worked to unify number theory and harmonic analysis. Frankel uses two irrational numbers to construct a system of hybrid numbers in which one term is rational and the other term is a rational multiple of the irrational numbers. These numbers are now constructed into a new numeral system called a “number field”, and they form a mathematical structure called the “Galois group” of the polynomial equation. An analysis of this Galois group can produce solutions of harmonic analysis (a more sophisticated version of the study of sines and cosines.) Frenkel and his group of mathematicians in the Langlands program are producing solutions that will tie other mathematical branches together. Edward presents these mathematical equations equal to oil paintings and sculptures exhibited in museums throughout the world. The book is well written and the explanations go a long way forward to knowing about the mathematical solutions presented. I believe you would need a bachelor of mathematics degree or equivalent in order to see the “Mona Lisa” Frenkel has presented here. "
45,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1856047-jonna-higgins-freese,5,"I can't say I understand The Langlands Program any more now than I did before, except that it has something to do with sheaves and making it possible to ""translate"" between different areas of mathematics. I also picked up that the mathematics has some real-world implications in terms of symmetry and quantum physics, which I'd already picked up on from reading _The God Particle._ Unlike many of the other reviewers, I enjoyed the way he narrated his own engagement with and love of mathematics -- before I could love math myself, I needed to understand how anyone could love it, and I felt he did a good job of showing what it's like to be a person who loves mathematics.There were several interesting quotes --Thoreau: ""We have heard about the poetry of mathematics, but very little of it has yet been sung."" (A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers, cited on p. 228 of L&M)p. 241: ""Albert Einstein wrote, 'Every one who is seriously involved in thepursuit of science becomes convinced that some spirit is manifest in the laws of the Universe -- a spirit vastly superior to that of man, and one in the face of which we with our modest powers must feel humble.' And Isaac Newton expressed his feelings this way: 'to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the seashore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.'""My dream is that one day we will all awaken to this hidden reality. We may then perhaps be able to set aside our differences and focus on the profound truths that unite us. Then, we will all be like children playing on the seashore, marveling at the dazzling beauty and harmony we discover, share, and cherish together.""And this is what I love about reading books about math and science whose content I can barely understand -- it puts my life into perspective. When I'm frustrated about a completely illogical decision at work, or asked to accomplish something without the tools to do so, or when I feel that my life is spent in entirely too much make-work that takes me away from my children, reading such books for a few minutes before bed each night puts things into a larger perspective, opens up the world so that I feel I have space to breathe again."
46,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91748031-hobart-mariner,3,"As a personal memoir, this book is a both good and a bit frustrating. As a lay introduction to the ideas behind general advanced mathematics, and in particular the Langlands program (and its ties to string and superstring theory), it is very good, if a little daunting toward the end.In the early parts, the author does a very fine job of describing the hideous antisemitism that he encountered in the Soviet Union of the 1980s and how it prevented a generation of young Jewish mathematicians from developing to their fullest. He does a good job of recounting the unfairness of the oral examinations that prevented him from attending the Moscow State University Mechanics and Mathematics Department. In particular, his losing admission over a farcically nitpicky definition of circle (""the set of all points equidistant from a fixed point"" instead of ""the set of points equidistant from a fixed point"") serves as an illustration of the utter absurdity of this system. Later on, in the United States, he and several other Russian-Jewish mathematicians are given an opportunity to get back at the antisemitic Rector of MSU and this provides a satisfying and compelling scene.The author also presents warm and personal sketches of the mentors who helped him both to learn mathematics and to escape the clutches of this oppressive system. The author, for one who showed such incredible ability so young, is admirably free of vanity regarding his career, constantly giving credit to his advisors, teachers, and fellow students. There are a few personal bits that could have used more fleshing out (in particular, when he meets Feigin's family, he mentions that he would come to become very close with them, but the reader doesn't really see this). I thought that the depiction of the life of the ""Kerosinka"" was very interesting, an applied math hub full of frustrated young pure mathematicians. I thought that Yakov Khurgin, the charismatic probabilist studying with physicians to ensure his own access to medical care, made a very sympathetic character. It was poignant when the author described leaving his paltry instructorship (obtained by Khurgin with some difficulty) at the Kerosinka behind to study at Harvard. After the author moves to the United States, the story becomes a bit less personal and instead becomes more of a purely popular scientific book. Of the first twelve chapters, several are completely given over to mathematical exposition (some without any mention of the author's personal history). Yet it felt as I read it that after the author moves to Cambridge in Chapter 13, the book became much less personal. This corresponds with the author's life becoming less contingent and unstable, and maybe as a consequence less interesting. He sketches a few scenes of adjusting to life in the United States (being overwhelmed by the choices at a supermarket, learning colloquial English by watching David Letterman, walking around in jeans with a Walkman). I can't find it now but later on he provides a single paragraph of personal history, including marriage, divorce, and moving his Russian family to the United States. I would have liked to see a bit more of this, even if it has limited bearing on the mathematical parts of the memoir. As a work of mathematical exposition for a lay audience this book is quite successful, particularly in the earlier parts. (Disclaimer: I'm an academic mathematician, although in a different field of math than the author's.) I've seen many, many descriptions of the notion of symmetry group meant for lay audiences and I think that the author's stands out in terms of clarity. His own charming initial encounter with group theory (a mathematician friend of the family showing him the links the subject has with particle physics) might not make it easier for everyone else to comprehend, but at least gives an idea that the subject has meaning outside of the abstractions of pure math. He does a very fine job explaining the notions of groups, braid groups, fundamental group, modular arithmetic, and the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. I was quite impressed with his ability to describe Galois theory in relatively low-tech terms (in particular, he employs a wonderfully evocative metaphor involving the wings of a butterfly). The scientific exposition later on (in particular the bits with supersymmetry and string theory) were a bit harder for me to digest, but that doesn't mean he didn't present them in very clear terms. The main mathematical focus of the book is the Langlands Program, which the author repeatedly refers to as a Grand Unified Theory of Math, a description that overstates things slightly (there are several major fields of mathematics that do not really fall under the umbrella of the Langlands Program). It is no surprise that the author, one of the Langlands Program's superstars, does an excellent job laying out the basic ideas behind this ambitious research program. There are good explanations of Galois theory (mentioned above) and a solid example of how modular forms tie in to the subject. A bit more said about the general idea of modular forms might have been useful, but it's possible that it would be too technical for most readers. The author perhaps overloads a metaphor concerning people in Europe and North America, but not to the detriment of the books readability. I do think that it's possible readers with a limited mathematical background will get a bit lost in these sections, because they discuss fairly airy connections between subjects that have only briefly been sketched. There is a very good discussion of Weil's ""Rosetta stone"" in Chapter 9 that provides a nice backbone for all of the Langlands Program discussion. The last chapter, which contains a description of the author's screenplay (The Two-Body Problem) and short film (Rites of Love and Math), felt a bit disconnected from the rest of the book. His description of the screenwriting process is interesting and gives him the opportunity to credit yet another mentor. When he discusses the film-making process he employs a reconstructed dialogue with a French director which seems a bit artificial (similar to several other dialogues in the book). The film, which features a mathematician writing a powerful formula on the body of a woman, seems half-baked in its concept, although its clear that it means quite a lot to the author. It's a bit hard to see how this artsy, somewhat pretentious production is the best way to make someone feel the importance of math, when the author himself has done a good job in his earlier chapters making the reader feel the urgency of his initial mathematical work. A short film about a young Jewish mathematician in the Soviet Union trying with all his energy to get into MSU, prove a theorem, break into a lecture hall, etc. would be much more compelling and get across the feeling of doing math much better, in my opinion. He leaves out any mention of the minor controversy that the film provoked among feminist circles, instead offering platitudes like ""it's all in the eye of the bholder."" This section is larded with quotations from Thoreau, Einstein, etc, and overall is a bit flabby and formless in comparison with the rest of the book. Sort of disappointing that he chose to end on this note. "
47,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11253338-andrew,3,"This book was much more enjoyable when I gave up trying to understand.The author is clearly knowledgeable about mathematics. He is also very very passionate.The difficulty lies in informing the rest of us about his passion. A Nobel Laureate in Physics claims this book is ""very readable."" Which is great news, except I am not a Nobel Laureate in the realm Frenkel's work deals with.This is the struggle he faces: Mathematics is far larger and deeper than most people encounter. We are taught from a young age that math is ugly and mostly esoteric. Trying to overcome that by bringing up ideas that mean absolutely nothing to those who have not studied Algebraic Symmetries, Modular Forms, and Reimannian Surfaces is not effective.HOWEVER, when I accepted that I didn't have a clue what he was talking about, and chose to pay attention to the links between those ideas (which was his purpose), life got easier.The purpose of this book isn't to teach the reader mathematics, but to show how various ideas in mathematics are related, to the surprise of the rest of us. Math is about exotic connections and powerful generalizations, not calculation. In the 17th Chapter, Dr. Frenkel writes ""But my point is not for you to learn them all. Rather, I want to indicate the logical connections between these objects and show the creative process of scientists studying them: what drives them, how they learn from each other, how the knowledge they acquire is used to advance our understanding of the key questions.""THAT should have been in the introduction, alongside the anecdote of drunks and fractions. It would have made the rest SO MUCH easier. If the reader begins with that idea, then the book is wonderful. Math is beautiful, not because it is useful, but because it is the art of the universe itself. A famous sculptor (I believe it was Michelangelo) once said that the statue was already in the marble, he just discovered it. Many mathematicians feel that they do not create math, they find the rules that were already there. This book does a great job demonstrating that concept. Provided you ignore the footnotes and don't try to understand the math he is using to present this idea."
48,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3016981-girish,3,"There is a wave of ""pop-math"" books aimed at the interested amateur, and Edward Frenkel's memoir/masturbatory ode to math is a whirlwind tour of his life and research interests. Frenkel tries to acclimate the reader to the mathematical castle in the sky by attempting to avoid jargon and using commonplace examples to elucidate mathematical concepts (e.g. the ""symmetrical circle group"" as an example of a group).My main complaint is that I don't know who this book is for. I got out of what I wanted (and expected) - an increased appreciation for the thought patterns around math, a birds eye view of the Langland's Program, some interesting succinct definitions of mathematical concepts, and some cool visualizations. The autobiographical tidbits were interesting, but for orthogonal reasons (one of my coworkers is Russian Jewish and that got me interested in Frenkel's story; not to mention just how wrong what happened to him was).You won't learn any math from this book. It's an interesting foray into the emotional connection to math, so even though one of Frenkel's explicit goals is to demystify the intricate edifice of theory that is the Langland's Program, I'd say he failed in that endeavor. I suppose for the right person who really thinks of mathematics as SAT-style word problems, then it might be incredibly interesting to learn that it's much more artistic, revelatory, and exploratory.I'll note that Frenkel makes a couple claims in this book. First, the implicit claim that mathematical discoveries should be elevated in stature and aesthetic to the pyramids or hanging gardens, and second, that pure mathematical research is valuable but that we can't always perceive the applications immediately. I love #1 and hope that happens. #2 requires a more nuanced look, especially if it's used as justification for any and all theoretical mathematical research. Most math research, is (while beautiful/curious/amazing) useless.Mathematics used to occupy the highest stage of the cultural aristocracy as late as the 1800s, I wonder if it's time for a cultural resurgence. The gods of social status are fickle, so who knows? Math may become cool. If that's to be, than a broader appreciation for its beauty is necessary. "
49,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1849937-yofish,3,"Really 3.5.Written by a mathematician whose stated aim is to get his readers to understand what math is *really* about (as opposed to what one learns in school). The guy has had an interesting life. He was born in the USSR, and couldn't get into the ""right"" college (MGU) for math because he's Jewish. But he's able to muddle through, thanks to the large population of Jewish (and non-Jewish) mathematicians in Moscow who are used to getting around this exact problem. He's a really good mathematician and gets published and so on; but then he graduates and has the same problem---he can't get into a graduate school in the USSR because he's Jewish. Fortunately, he's just exactly the right age, and perestroika is starting, so when he gets invited to Harvard, he can go. (And eventually when he's visiting professorship is up, Harvard lets him be demoted to graduate student so that he can get his Ph.D.) While he was giving the more biographical story, I was pretty interested. But remember that his stated purpose was to introduce his math (the Langlands Program) to the layman. I can't really say whether he succeeded, as I skimmed through most of it. Not that I couldn't have understood (probably)---after all, I am a mathematician. The thing is, though, that if I was interested in that particular math, I would have studied it in grad school. The writing is a little choppy, which is surely understandable as English is his second language. But the editing is pretty poor, too---there seemed to be several places where he repeated himself without saying ""as I mentioned before"" or something similar. That was a little weird. He also seemed a little full of himself at times. There was a particular story, during his first year at Harvard, where the head of the dept of MGU is invited to MIT. That was (apparently) controversial at the time, as he wasn't supposed to be much of a mathematician, and he apparently was overseeing the rejection of Jews. There's sort of a public confrontation between him and the author. It was an interesting story--I'm a little surprised that I hadn't heard it before, as it happened while I was in grad school, and it's the kind of thing I might have noticed."
50,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18370648-mishehu,3,"Author writes, ""...we, mathematicians, need to do a better job of unlocking the power and beauty of our subject to a wider audience."" Alas, he himself resoundingly fails to do so. 5 stars for the autobiographical material in this book. The author's personal story -- and his mathematical biography -- are quite interesting. 1.5 stars for the exposition of mathematical ideas. Whatever pretense the author may have to being a math popularizer, he has many miles to travel in developing his expository chops before he can count himself among those of his colleagues who do this sort of thing well. I recently finished reading the second of Brian Greene's masterful books on cosmology -- books that are pitched to a highly interested readership willing to put in a serious readerly effort. Occasionally, in his books, Greene elaborates certain ideas in footnotes that are expressly written for ""mathematically inclined readers."" Nearly all of Frenkel's math discussion (in both the text and the footnotes of the book in review) are, whatever anyone may claim to the contrary, pitched to mathematically inclined readers. A few chapters in and the going is pretty much impossible for the lay reader. The best I can say about Frenkel's skills as a pop math expositor is that he did manage to convey an impression of what his mathematical research is about, of why it matters, and of why it's fascinating/inspiring. So, though I understood very little of the book, I did get something out of it (not simply insights into the author's personal story). But the investment of my time was poorly paid. All that said, Frenkel writes well, and his work really IS quite fascinating. I hope he'll continue to develop his pop writing skills, and I hope that future editors/publishers of his (and other first time pop math/sci authors) will give some thought to the target audience of books like these before they let manuscripts go to press."
51,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24055618-noah,5," Non-fiction books generally explain something that is true, or at least true for the author, about a particular topic. They can range from stories about people’s lives to discoveries that have been made, as well as pure factual information. One might expect non-fiction books to be purely facts and not memoirs, but that isn’t always the case. What surprised me about the book Love and Math is that this book was laid out in a different format that what I would expect from most non-fiction books. It’s laid out more like a novel, with chapters and memoirs and such. Love and Math by Edward Frenkel is a great nonfiction book mainly focusing on the symmetry groups in math of SO(3) and SO(n). Love and Math starts by easing the reader into advanced mathematics with the use of diagrams and symmetry, then gets into some more advanced ideas such as symmetry groups for higher dimensions. Love and Math is part thoughtful memoir, and part math textbook. Edward Frenkel mixes these two things perfectly to make an enticing book that just makes you want to read more. One of the main things that helped make the book so good was that Edward Frenkel had such an amazing childhood, he met famous mathematicians, he published papers, and faced tragedies such as being persecuted because he was Jewish. Edward Frenkel is an accomplished mathematician who wants to inspire other people to become mathematicians. I think that Edward Frenkel did an awesome job of explaining advanced mathematical concepts. I would give this book five stars and recommend this book to anyone who doesn’t mind curling up somewhere for a few hours while expanding their mind and having fun."
52,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4922601-deborah-flores,5,"Very enjoyable! Some reviewers seemed uncomfortable with the neither-fish-nor-fowl feel - neither pure autobiography nor pure mathematics tome - but this approach worked well for me. Rather than simply describing the solution to a problem, the author takes the time to describe the thrill of finding an elegant solution to a problem on which you'd labored for weeks or months. Rather than just describing a mathematician's theories, the author provides sufficient details to get a feel for the mathematician as a person. I found this approach an effective way to help non-mathematicians connect to math and those who study it. I picked up this book because I was interested in Dr. Frenkel's experiences as a mathematician in the twilight years of the Soviet Union. Specifically, I wanted to learn more about the author's experiences with the harrowing, Kafkaesque Moscow State University (MGU) mathematics entrance examination, through which undesirable students (read: those of Jewish descent) were deliberately weeded out and denied admittance. This is exactly what happened to the author, and I was deeply impressed by his commitment to study math at any cost as well as his later willingness to speak out publicly against about these discriminatory policies. Bravo! It was also fascinating to read about how many Soviet mathematicians and others worked with and mentored students who had experienced discrimination, and how many of these students ended up immigrating to the West soon afterwards. As to mathematics, the author clearly loves what he does, and his love is infectious. While I didn't read the book primarily for this angle, I did gain a deeper appreciation of mathematics as well as the Langlands Program. Intriguing stuff! "
53,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5664087-john,3,"Edward Frenkel’s Love and Math joins a long list of mathematical memoirs. In the last two centuries many eminent mathematicians have attempted to describe what they do, why they do it and how they came to it. Without exception they fail the “what we do” test but often brilliantly succeed on why and how they came to mathematics. Mathematics does not admit casual observers. You have to do it to fully appreciate it and doing it at the levels Frenkel describes takes gifted minds years of hard work. “There are no royal roads to geometry.” Love and Math goes further than most in this genre. It doesn't flinch when a formula really helps and the end notes are detailed and reference laden enough to get you started on learning what’s really the deal with SO(3).The best part of the book deals with the author’s start in mathematics as a precious Russian teenager. Frenkel's father was Jewish and this created problems. The Soviet Union, in addition to being a murderous totalitarian state, was overtly anti-Semitic. Scholars of Jewish descent faced “extra” hurdles when it came to university admissions and securing jobs. Frenkel’s account of his MGU exam should be required reading for every leftist imbecile in the west. It clearly shows that secondary school mathematics was taught at levels far beyond the execrable Common Core, (affirmative action), standard now being pushed in the US and that bureaucrats can always find ways to exclude even the best of “undesirables.” Love and Math is an entertaining, enlightening and important book."
54,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8824504-leslie,3,"This one was between 3 and 3.5 stars.At the beginning of the novel the author states that he hopes to accomplish two things: first he hopes to convey his love of math and then he hopes to imbue this love into the reader. These are lofty goals. He is successful in the former but falls a bit short in the latter. The novel is part memoir and is is perhaps the most interesting section of the book. Frenkle's tale of overcoming the anti Semitic policy of the Soviet Union is incredibly moving. His love of mathematics is earnestly depicted and you root for his success in the face of adversity. The other parts of the novel focus on his contribution to the Langlands program and here I found that the quality varied. The math is certainly an important contribution but he only succeeded at making about half of it accessible to me. I will openly admit that my affinity for mathematics is limited to applied math. It is important for me to understand the context behind the concepts and unfortunately certain aspects where too abstract. I could not help but compare it to Hawking's works which successfully engaged my interest and made the esoteric aspects of quantum mechanics and physics accessible to the layperson. His works made me love physics and cosmology while this book only somewhat piqued my interest. However, I recommend the book for those interested in obtaining a peek into the mysterious world of mathematics. I believe it is an important field and completely agree with the author that it should be taught in a more engaging way. "
55,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51268208-akbar-gumbira,3,"This book is not for everyone.Through this book, the author (Edward Frenkel) tried to explain a lot of mathematical concepts in layman's terms. But no matter how hard he tried, it's just not for everyone. I have no background in mathematics or physics (as a degree) and I find it hard to understand many concepts told in the book. Though I still could follow some concepts such as generating function, fermat's little and last theorem, RSA, and most of the number theory part since I thought myself in high school some high level mathematics for olympiad. But when it comes to concepts such as Langlands program, Galois group, and the links to quantum duality, I just skim-read it.But we couldn't help it. Edward is a world-renowned and gifted mathematician. He's already working on unsolved mathematical problems since he's in college, had a patent in his 4th year in college (or 5th year I forgot exactly), and invited to Harvard in his early 20's. Things that are obvious to him, and perhaps that he also thinks to others, might not be that obvious to the readers.Apart from that, I enjoyed his personal story, telling the readers about anti-semitism in Soviet Union, his first time in Harvard (spending 45 minutes at the supermarket to just buy salt), how the project went to link quantum dualities and the Langlands program, his film-making story, and how he perceives mathematics in general.Oh I found many typos! I wonder if he's in a rush to publish it?"
56,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15546947-haydee-romero,0,"I picked up this book because love and math are two words I have never used in the same sentence. Math intimidates me but reading Frenkel’s introduction he made it clear that the goal and target audience was me! A person who fears the word math, “If you think that math is hard, that you won’t get it, if you are terrified by math but at the same time curious whether there is something worth knowing- then this book is for you.” Frenkel says that math is at the heart of love and his tone and acknowledgement of his audience made me comfortable starting the book. Frenkel did a great job at breaking down COMPLEX math equations and idea BUT it was not enough for me, personally. I would have to put the book down, reread the paragraph to grasp the concept. I would but I had to think about it... a lot. Frenkel did an amazing job of integrating his personal journey as a mathematician and the math equations he explained. It was clear throughout his book that he knew his audience were not mathematicians. Frenkel would define words that may have a different meaning in the math field. He would apply theories to concepts we may know about or explain what they are used for. I have learned and gained a much greater respect to the subject of math. I would use this book as an example of how keeping who your audience is when writing a piece makes a big difference and is so important. "
57,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1357119-david,4,"1. Frenkel and his friends would scale 20 foot walls in order to sneak into mathematics lectures - this increases my faith in humanity.2. The portrait of how Frenkel and his kindred spirits were able to find one another and prosper in the USSR is absolutely fascinating. He and his friends would tear through their official duties in no time and get real work done while operating within their largely informal and much less hierarchical intellectual network. This also increases my faith in humanity.3. On a less happy note, Frenkel's experience illuminates the weaknesses of the rigid (and far too common) approach to mathematical education. It is possible to reach some individuals even when mathematical concepts are taught as pure abstractions - you can reach people who focus intensely on discreet tasks and who follow instructions first and ask questions later. Others, however, learn through a much more context-driven approach. If you present them with a new abstract concept and fail to connect it to what they have learned before or demonstrate how it can be visualized or applied, they are going to struggle. Frenkel found wonderful mentors who helped him see math as an area to explore rather than an area where one duplicates rote instructions - I sure didn't find anyone like that, and I doubt many others do either."
58,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22906182-kat-steiner,3,"Argh, finally finished this book. Unsurprisingly, it does not work as an audiobook. Do not buy it from Audible.I think when I got it, I believed it was more of a book about mathematicians or a fictionalised autobiography, than a book about maths. It's sort of both, but there is a fair amount of actual maths (and significantly advanced maths, at that). And that's just impossible to make sense of while listening. Particularly as the narrator, Tony Craine, clearly has absolutely no idea what he is saying, so his emphasis is often totally off, or he reads things in a way that doesn't distinguish where brackets would be, so it's just impossible to follow no matter how hard you listen - there's not enough information conveyed.The story itself I really enjoyed - it was a fascinating account of education and anti-semitism in Soviet Russia, as well as great insight into the lives of professional mathematicians. I did a maths degree so I can't comment on how it would come across to the layman, but I found the actual maths a bit hard-going and uninteresting - these are difficult, complicated concepts that weren't very interesting when you can't get into either the nitty-gritty or appreciate the broader concepts.A bit of a mixed bag. Quite enjoyable in parts, but I'm glad to be done. Don't get the audiobook."
59,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10145524-charles-daney,5,"The love referred to is mainly for mathematics, though there is one chapter on the human-related form. The first chapters are about Frenkel's struggles to get a math education in the last years of the Soviet Union. He had to literally climb fences to get access to the best seminars and experts. Most of the book deals with his primary interest: an extremely esoteric, but important, area of current research, known as the ""Langlands Program"". I really enjoyed his presentation, since this is one of my main interests also, and this is the best ""nontechnical"" explanation I've ever seen of the subject. It made things a lot clearer for me. The basic idea is that there are very deep relationships among a number of mathematical concepts that on the surface seem quite unrelated. And besides that, there may be important applications to particle physics theory. It could turn out that a lot of why fundamental physics works the way it does is a result of mathematical relationships. Someday before too long (I hope), I can write about the Langlands Program on my math blog. It's related to stuff I've already written about there (number theory). I find that the best way to learn about new things is to write about them - as a process of explaining the subject to myself."
60,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7412717-suzie-shatarevyan,3,"Not exactly what I was expecting when I picked up this book. I've always loved math, but reading this book hasn't made me want to run and become a mathematician. Half the book reads like a memoir, which I didn't mind as I enjoy that genre, but like I said, not what I was expecting. Pure, 'non-practictal' math is impossible to grasp for the non mathematician and there's a lot of that in this book. Frenkel does try to explain using analogies, but that's not always possible. In one instance, when referring to a formula he wrote, he concedes that maybe only 10 or 12 people in the entire world can understand it. Not even math students will get it! On the other hand, I have become familiarized with a lot of math theories that is being studied in the last 50 years, so I'm still glad I read this book. It's obvious Frenkel has a deep passion for his field. You have to be extremely passionate to devote years and years looking for discoveries and connections in things that seem unrelated. This is still pretty accessible and if you want to see math like you've never seen in the classroom, give it a shot. Definitely mind-expanding."
61,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67447577-joseph-schrock,4,"This book was tough reading for me. I'm a mathematical hobbyist -- not a professional mathematician. This book discussed lots of things concerning which I had zero knowledge. It dealt with groups, symmetries, topology, etc. All of those are (for the most part) beyond my level of training. I've gotten moderately far into elementary number theory -- dealing with modular arithmetic, encryption, and even some into quadratic reciprocity (for which I've not managed to master the proofs). Frenkel's book might be a good book for a professional mathematician, but laymen will find it tough going -- except for the biographical aspects of the book, which are very nicely written. As for myself, if I'd known how tough this book is, I would likely not have bought it. But then, I'm not a professional mathematician or mathematics student. "
62,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30252254-shivam-agarwal,4,Simply amazing. This is the first Math book I have read which is written in the form of biography. Now this engages reader and encourages readers to hold on when Math part kicks in.I would suggest the book to second year undergraduates specially who are reading discrete mathematics for the first time. The works of author will give the idea about applications of the subject.
63,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7226831-josh-friedlander,3,"There are basically two ways to write popular books on difficult topics: cut and simplify to make it accessible to anyone, or just pour in details and hope that readers will move on despite not grasping all the fine points. This book is decidedly of the second group. The author interleaves with the difficult parts a memoir of growing up a prodigy in the USSR, facing discrimination and eventually escaping to a visiting position at Harvard despite not having finished his undergrad(!) He talks about his involvement in the Langlands Program, an attempt at a sort of Grand Unified Theory of Maths, and attempts to convey the beauty and excitement he finds in it. Starting with symmetry and groups, Frenkel rapidly progresses into the heart of contemporary mathematics: Lie algebras, Riemann surfaces, elliptic curves in the complex plane, n-branes, quantum field applications of theorised supersymmetries, and much more. I would lie if I claimed to have grasped it all, but I got a lot out of following the threads in each chapter as far as I could, stopping, rereading and Wikipedia-ing. This book works best as a subjective, impassioned introduction to what mathematicians work on all day, and what might make someone want to join them."

It was also interesting to learn how apparently closely related are math and the laws of nature.Unfortunately I did not particularly enjoy lengthy chapters on particular mathematical research and results – I felt it was inconsistent with the more lyric chapters. In that sense the book didn't provide optimal reading flow for me. I also felt that the couple last chapters did not really fit well with the rest of the book and felt a bit tacky.I would've given this 2 stars, or maybe even 1 star, if not for the first several chapters."

At the end, I did enjoy reading the autobiographical parts and the maths that I could comprehend, but I would not recommend this book to just the average reader. I have a two star rating because even though it was enjoyable, the purpose of the book is very misleading. "

70,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30982871-james-f,4,"Edward Frenkel, Love and Math [2013] 306 pages [Kindle]I read this amazing book more or less by accident; I was testing the direct download link in the library catalogue and this is the book I happened to download to my Kindle. I started looking through it and the preface convinced me to read it. Frenkel is a mathematician, born in the U.S.S.R. and now at Berkeley, who is working on something called the ""Langlands Project"". He begins by discussing the fact that otherwise well-educated people who would never brag that they hated literature or art or music seem proud to say they ""hate math"", and admit they know nothing about it; and he suggests that the reason is the way it is taught. He uses the analogy, suppose you took a course in Art, and instead of showing you the works of Rembrandt and Van Gogh they spent the entire class teaching you to paint -- fences. Would you be interested in pursuing art? But this is the way that math is generally taught -- as a practical collection of tools for doing other (mostly boring) things. The ""masterpieces"" of math are never mentioned. He also points out that most of the math which is taught in high school and even the early years of college dates from the ancient Greeks or the early modern period -- current work is never mentioned; it's as if a physics course ended with the work of Galileo and Newton, and gave the impression that everything in physics was already discovered and all that was left was to use it for practical engineering. Then he goes on to talk about popular science writers, such as Stephen Hawking or Brian Greene, who present the exciting developments of contemporary work in physics for the layperson, and asks why there are so few if any popularizations of work at the frontiers of contemporary math. He warns of the political dangers of allowing a small elite to monopolize knowledge of mathematics in an age when all our lives depend more than ever before on applications of math, from the Internet to Wall Street; he suggests that a mathematically literate population would not be so easily taken in by the doubletalk of the bankers and politicians. That is the gap he is trying to fill with this book. The focus is on his own work on the Langlands Project, and like the physics books of Kip Thorne or Leonard Susskind, he includes much of his own experiences. In the first few chapters, he explains how he became interested in math as a high school student; how he was denied entry into the more prestigious schools because he was Jewish, and the official academic world in the era of the final decay of the Soviet bureaucracy was highly anti-Semitic; how he was privately mentored by some of the great Soviet mathematicians, who were opposed to anti-Semitism, including the legendary Israel Gelfand, who was himself Jewish; how he worked in private and more or less secretly on group theory, and sent his first papers abroad; how he was invited to Harvard in the first months of perestroika under Gorbachev, where he became a Visiting Professor before he had even become a grad student; and how he came in contact with the Langlands Project. After that, the book is largely a popular account of the Langlands Project itself. While popular physics books try to avoid math, a popular math book of course has to be about math, and I learned much from this book. At the beginning, his explanations are very clear, and make ideas like modulo arithmetic, finite fields, Lie groups and Riemann surfaces understandable (some of the very subjects I had trouble with in reading Penrose's The Road to Reality). Later on, the book becomes more difficult to follow and his explanations of vector spaces and representations were briefer and less clear; by the end he is mentioning things like fiber bundles and automorphic functions without any explanation at all. If we keep in mind the comparison to someone like Brian Greene, though, it is hard to fault this too much; no one expects to actually learn quantum theory or string theory from a popular science book, and we shouldn't expect to learn advanced math from a book like this -- what we want to learn is what in general it is about, what the questions are and what sort of research is going on, and he is very good at that. His observations that sets, functions and numbers have been left behind for categories, sheaves and vector spaces was interesting; something like the way classical physics gave way to quantum theory. Quantum theory and string theory are here, as the ""fourth column"" of the Langlands Program; the author has collaborated with physicist-mathematicians such as Edward Witten on the connections between the two fields. So what is the Langlands Program? Essentially, it is a program to discover patterns common to various seemingly unrelated branches of mathematics (and recently physics), in particular to relate group theory and curves over finite fields to subjects like harmonic analysis and Riemann surfaces. If you don't know what these things are -- that's evidence for his thesis. "
71,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86000064-stephanie,4,"I think I am too dumb for this book but I enjoyed what I could understand! It's clear Frenkel has a lot of infectious passion for his work, and I liked his explanations"
72,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42063497-christina,3,"Yes, most of the mathematics in this book is hard. Edward Frenkel's work is cutting-edge mathematical research, after all, with applications in quantum mechanics, so it's no walk in the park. I give him credit for even attempting to explain it to a lay audience. As he states in ""A Guide for the Reader"", you can skip the sections and chapters that deal with the math. I think most readers of this book will end up doing so at some point, mainly enjoying the biographical parts.Frenkel's point in writing this book, as he explains in the ""Preface"", is to share his love for mathematics with an audience who doesn't get to see much of its hidden beauty. He does this by taking the reader on the journey that led him to mathematics, starting with a friend of his father's who taught Frenkle about symmetries and braid groups when he was in his late teens. This sparked his lifelong passion for math, and we learn all about the obstacles thrown into his path by the Soviet system that made it next to impossible for a son of a Jew to study or work in research mathematics. Luckily, he was the right age to take advantage of Perestroika, and then the collapse of the Soviet Union, and was able to both finish his studies and find an academic position in the United States.We get introduced to the main project in Frankel's career, the Langlands Program, in chapter 8, ""Magic Numbers,"" where a lot of background is given. The Langlands Program, if finished, will link together several fields of mathematics that seem unrelated on the surface. This is difficult to do and pretty rare. The background leading up to this is wide-ranging, and Frenkle tries to simplify his explanations as much as possible, but this is where the abstract nature of advanced mathematics is probably going to confuse most of his audience. In a mere 15 pages, you get a high-level whirlwind tour of the Galois groups, how the Shimura-Taniyama-Weil conjecture was used to prove Fermat's Last Theorem, how this conjecture is a general result for finding the generating function of cubic equations (using the generating function of the Fibonacci numbers as an analogy), and how it is a special case of the Langlands Program. I had to read chapter 8 very carefully and slowly, but I got the gist of it, if not a deep understanding. By the next chapter, where he introduces Lie (pronounced ""lee"") groups and algebras, I admit I was lost.The remaining math sections left me feeling like Frenkel was Beethoven, explaining how he had composed his symphonies, while I was the novice student who had finished a basic course in music theory, and knew how to play ""Für Elise"" but not much else. While his enthusiasm for mathematics and his life's work are all obvious, I just cannot appreciate the depth or the details on the same level. I found this discouraging and more than a little frustrating, because I wanted to see the same beauty that he did. I did appreciate the journey he has taken to get to this point, and the real-life depiction of how mathematical research is actually done - sometimes painfully slowly. Perhaps after some years of study I will be able to appreciate the mathematical sections just as much as the biographical ones."
73,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5931241-jenny,2,"This author was a guest on the Colbert Report, which is when I first learned of his book. He described the concept so passionately, and he argued that mathematics has been so misunderstood because it isn't given its fair due in K-12 school curricula. Frenkel is disillusioned that the general masses don't appreciate math, and he set out to conquer our hearts with this book. He stated that this book was written specifically for people like me, laypeople who have never had the opportunity to give math a fair shake because all they learn are boring basic concepts in school and they never see the true beauty of it. He compared it to taking an art class in which you only get to paint a fence and are never actually shown the works of great artists. Fair enough, I thought. I'll give it a try.By chapter three, I realized that Edward Frenkel is a misguided genius who truly believes that laypeople could possibly understand what he is talking about. I don't sense that he is a self-righteous individual who wants to come across as ridiculously smart (he is, in fact, ridiculously smart). I think he really just doesn't get that trying to relate these concepts to people like me, who only made it through Calc A, cannot be done. Hence, large parts of the book left me absolutely lost. Even BJ, who was a math minor, said he wasn't keeping up and so he quit reading it. Consider this sentence: ""The idea of string theory is that by doing calculations in these sigma models and summing up the results over all possible Riemann surfaces E (that is, over all possible paths of the strings propagating in a fixed space-time S) we can reproduce the physics that we observe in space-time S."" Honestly, I wish this particular sentence, which I chose at random, was a stand-apart in terms of its difficulty, but the truth is that much of this book is written in this language with ten unfamiliar concepts thrown together in the same sentence, all with the assumption that we must understand what the heck he is talking about. The redeeming points of the book were the interspersed memoir portions, which were extremely interesting. Frenkel was born in the Soviet Union and endured intense antisemitism at practically every turn in his education, but still prevailed and eventually traveled to Harvard and then to UC-Berkeley with professorships. I very much loved hearing about his experiences growing up, in college, working with colleagues, and his personal excitement about solving mathematical problems. It was only that he felt the need to then delve INTO those problems with technical language that made this book a disappointment--along with the fact that I didn't feel it delivered what it originally promised.In the end, I walked away appreciating Edward Frenkel's personal story. However, I did NOT end up appreciating math anymore than I ever did before, which was precisely why I decided to read the book in the first place. Unless you're ready to skip some major portions or else you're a mathematician, I don't recommend this book to you. This book is truly written for mathematicians, not laypeople, as it was so described."
74,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28285354-ron,3,"Love and Math: The Heart of Hidden Reality by Edward FrenkelThis is the story of a young boy of 12 who loved quantum physics, but not math. When he learned that the quark was found by using math, he decided to study math. He grew up a 100 miles from Moscow and he was Jewish. He was a very bright student and when he finished public school, he went to Moscow to take the test to enter the Moscow State University but at that time MSU discriminated against the Jewish people and when Edward went to take the test, he was taken to a room by two of the testers and given an oral exam and the testers did not like the correct answers he gave to the questions, so he failed the entrance exam. Later one of the testers came to him and told him that he could get into Moscow Institute of Oil and Gas, where they also had a good applied mathematics school and even used some of the professors who taught at MSU. He was accepted to the Moscow Institute of Oil and Gas and in his second year there he solved a difficult problem and it was brought to the attention of one of the MSU top mathematician professors. He solved an even more advanced math problem that this professor gave him and he wrote his first juried math paper for the Journal of Mathematics. Soon, he received a three month invitation to learn at Harvard. He was on his way to becoming a top flight mathematician. He worked on the Langlands program to unify various branches of mathematics. Edward and other mathematicians worked to unify number theory and harmonic analysis. Frankel uses two irrational numbers to construct a system of hybrid numbers in which one term is rational and the other term is a rational multiple of the irrational numbers. These numbers are now constructed into a new numeral system called a “number field”, and they form a mathematical structure called the “Galois group” of the polynomial equation. An analysis of this Galois group can produce solutions of harmonic analysis (a more sophisticated version of the study of sines and cosines.) Frenkel and his group of mathematicians in the Langlands program are producing solutions that will tie other mathematical branches together. Edward presents these mathematical equations equal to oil paintings and sculptures exhibited in museums throughout the world. The book is well written and the explanations go a long way forward to knowing about the mathematical solutions presented. I believe you would need a bachelor of mathematics degree or equivalent in order to see the “Mona Lisa” Frenkel has presented here. "
75,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1856047-jonna-higgins-freese,5,"I can't say I understand The Langlands Program any more now than I did before, except that it has something to do with sheaves and making it possible to ""translate"" between different areas of mathematics. I also picked up that the mathematics has some real-world implications in terms of symmetry and quantum physics, which I'd already picked up on from reading _The God Particle._ Unlike many of the other reviewers, I enjoyed the way he narrated his own engagement with and love of mathematics -- before I could love math myself, I needed to understand how anyone could love it, and I felt he did a good job of showing what it's like to be a person who loves mathematics.There were several interesting quotes --Thoreau: ""We have heard about the poetry of mathematics, but very little of it has yet been sung."" (A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers, cited on p. 228 of L&M)p. 241: ""Albert Einstein wrote, 'Every one who is seriously involved in thepursuit of science becomes convinced that some spirit is manifest in the laws of the Universe -- a spirit vastly superior to that of man, and one in the face of which we with our modest powers must feel humble.' And Isaac Newton expressed his feelings this way: 'to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the seashore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.'""My dream is that one day we will all awaken to this hidden reality. We may then perhaps be able to set aside our differences and focus on the profound truths that unite us. Then, we will all be like children playing on the seashore, marveling at the dazzling beauty and harmony we discover, share, and cherish together.""And this is what I love about reading books about math and science whose content I can barely understand -- it puts my life into perspective. When I'm frustrated about a completely illogical decision at work, or asked to accomplish something without the tools to do so, or when I feel that my life is spent in entirely too much make-work that takes me away from my children, reading such books for a few minutes before bed each night puts things into a larger perspective, opens up the world so that I feel I have space to breathe again."
76,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91748031-hobart-mariner,3,"As a personal memoir, this book is a both good and a bit frustrating. As a lay introduction to the ideas behind general advanced mathematics, and in particular the Langlands program (and its ties to string and superstring theory), it is very good, if a little daunting toward the end.In the early parts, the author does a very fine job of describing the hideous antisemitism that he encountered in the Soviet Union of the 1980s and how it prevented a generation of young Jewish mathematicians from developing to their fullest. He does a good job of recounting the unfairness of the oral examinations that prevented him from attending the Moscow State University Mechanics and Mathematics Department. In particular, his losing admission over a farcically nitpicky definition of circle (""the set of all points equidistant from a fixed point"" instead of ""the set of points equidistant from a fixed point"") serves as an illustration of the utter absurdity of this system. Later on, in the United States, he and several other Russian-Jewish mathematicians are given an opportunity to get back at the antisemitic Rector of MSU and this provides a satisfying and compelling scene.The author also presents warm and personal sketches of the mentors who helped him both to learn mathematics and to escape the clutches of this oppressive system. The author, for one who showed such incredible ability so young, is admirably free of vanity regarding his career, constantly giving credit to his advisors, teachers, and fellow students. There are a few personal bits that could have used more fleshing out (in particular, when he meets Feigin's family, he mentions that he would come to become very close with them, but the reader doesn't really see this). I thought that the depiction of the life of the ""Kerosinka"" was very interesting, an applied math hub full of frustrated young pure mathematicians. I thought that Yakov Khurgin, the charismatic probabilist studying with physicians to ensure his own access to medical care, made a very sympathetic character. It was poignant when the author described leaving his paltry instructorship (obtained by Khurgin with some difficulty) at the Kerosinka behind to study at Harvard. After the author moves to the United States, the story becomes a bit less personal and instead becomes more of a purely popular scientific book. Of the first twelve chapters, several are completely given over to mathematical exposition (some without any mention of the author's personal history). Yet it felt as I read it that after the author moves to Cambridge in Chapter 13, the book became much less personal. This corresponds with the author's life becoming less contingent and unstable, and maybe as a consequence less interesting. He sketches a few scenes of adjusting to life in the United States (being overwhelmed by the choices at a supermarket, learning colloquial English by watching David Letterman, walking around in jeans with a Walkman). I can't find it now but later on he provides a single paragraph of personal history, including marriage, divorce, and moving his Russian family to the United States. I would have liked to see a bit more of this, even if it has limited bearing on the mathematical parts of the memoir. As a work of mathematical exposition for a lay audience this book is quite successful, particularly in the earlier parts. (Disclaimer: I'm an academic mathematician, although in a different field of math than the author's.) I've seen many, many descriptions of the notion of symmetry group meant for lay audiences and I think that the author's stands out in terms of clarity. His own charming initial encounter with group theory (a mathematician friend of the family showing him the links the subject has with particle physics) might not make it easier for everyone else to comprehend, but at least gives an idea that the subject has meaning outside of the abstractions of pure math. He does a very fine job explaining the notions of groups, braid groups, fundamental group, modular arithmetic, and the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. I was quite impressed with his ability to describe Galois theory in relatively low-tech terms (in particular, he employs a wonderfully evocative metaphor involving the wings of a butterfly). The scientific exposition later on (in particular the bits with supersymmetry and string theory) were a bit harder for me to digest, but that doesn't mean he didn't present them in very clear terms. The main mathematical focus of the book is the Langlands Program, which the author repeatedly refers to as a Grand Unified Theory of Math, a description that overstates things slightly (there are several major fields of mathematics that do not really fall under the umbrella of the Langlands Program). It is no surprise that the author, one of the Langlands Program's superstars, does an excellent job laying out the basic ideas behind this ambitious research program. There are good explanations of Galois theory (mentioned above) and a solid example of how modular forms tie in to the subject. A bit more said about the general idea of modular forms might have been useful, but it's possible that it would be too technical for most readers. The author perhaps overloads a metaphor concerning people in Europe and North America, but not to the detriment of the books readability. I do think that it's possible readers with a limited mathematical background will get a bit lost in these sections, because they discuss fairly airy connections between subjects that have only briefly been sketched. There is a very good discussion of Weil's ""Rosetta stone"" in Chapter 9 that provides a nice backbone for all of the Langlands Program discussion. The last chapter, which contains a description of the author's screenplay (The Two-Body Problem) and short film (Rites of Love and Math), felt a bit disconnected from the rest of the book. His description of the screenwriting process is interesting and gives him the opportunity to credit yet another mentor. When he discusses the film-making process he employs a reconstructed dialogue with a French director which seems a bit artificial (similar to several other dialogues in the book). The film, which features a mathematician writing a powerful formula on the body of a woman, seems half-baked in its concept, although its clear that it means quite a lot to the author. It's a bit hard to see how this artsy, somewhat pretentious production is the best way to make someone feel the importance of math, when the author himself has done a good job in his earlier chapters making the reader feel the urgency of his initial mathematical work. A short film about a young Jewish mathematician in the Soviet Union trying with all his energy to get into MSU, prove a theorem, break into a lecture hall, etc. would be much more compelling and get across the feeling of doing math much better, in my opinion. He leaves out any mention of the minor controversy that the film provoked among feminist circles, instead offering platitudes like ""it's all in the eye of the bholder."" This section is larded with quotations from Thoreau, Einstein, etc, and overall is a bit flabby and formless in comparison with the rest of the book. Sort of disappointing that he chose to end on this note. "
77,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11253338-andrew,3,"This book was much more enjoyable when I gave up trying to understand.The author is clearly knowledgeable about mathematics. He is also very very passionate.The difficulty lies in informing the rest of us about his passion. A Nobel Laureate in Physics claims this book is ""very readable."" Which is great news, except I am not a Nobel Laureate in the realm Frenkel's work deals with.This is the struggle he faces: Mathematics is far larger and deeper than most people encounter. We are taught from a young age that math is ugly and mostly esoteric. Trying to overcome that by bringing up ideas that mean absolutely nothing to those who have not studied Algebraic Symmetries, Modular Forms, and Reimannian Surfaces is not effective.HOWEVER, when I accepted that I didn't have a clue what he was talking about, and chose to pay attention to the links between those ideas (which was his purpose), life got easier.The purpose of this book isn't to teach the reader mathematics, but to show how various ideas in mathematics are related, to the surprise of the rest of us. Math is about exotic connections and powerful generalizations, not calculation. In the 17th Chapter, Dr. Frenkel writes ""But my point is not for you to learn them all. Rather, I want to indicate the logical connections between these objects and show the creative process of scientists studying them: what drives them, how they learn from each other, how the knowledge they acquire is used to advance our understanding of the key questions.""THAT should have been in the introduction, alongside the anecdote of drunks and fractions. It would have made the rest SO MUCH easier. If the reader begins with that idea, then the book is wonderful. Math is beautiful, not because it is useful, but because it is the art of the universe itself. A famous sculptor (I believe it was Michelangelo) once said that the statue was already in the marble, he just discovered it. Many mathematicians feel that they do not create math, they find the rules that were already there. This book does a great job demonstrating that concept. Provided you ignore the footnotes and don't try to understand the math he is using to present this idea."
78,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3016981-girish,3,"There is a wave of ""pop-math"" books aimed at the interested amateur, and Edward Frenkel's memoir/masturbatory ode to math is a whirlwind tour of his life and research interests. Frenkel tries to acclimate the reader to the mathematical castle in the sky by attempting to avoid jargon and using commonplace examples to elucidate mathematical concepts (e.g. the ""symmetrical circle group"" as an example of a group).My main complaint is that I don't know who this book is for. I got out of what I wanted (and expected) - an increased appreciation for the thought patterns around math, a birds eye view of the Langland's Program, some interesting succinct definitions of mathematical concepts, and some cool visualizations. The autobiographical tidbits were interesting, but for orthogonal reasons (one of my coworkers is Russian Jewish and that got me interested in Frenkel's story; not to mention just how wrong what happened to him was).You won't learn any math from this book. It's an interesting foray into the emotional connection to math, so even though one of Frenkel's explicit goals is to demystify the intricate edifice of theory that is the Langland's Program, I'd say he failed in that endeavor. I suppose for the right person who really thinks of mathematics as SAT-style word problems, then it might be incredibly interesting to learn that it's much more artistic, revelatory, and exploratory.I'll note that Frenkel makes a couple claims in this book. First, the implicit claim that mathematical discoveries should be elevated in stature and aesthetic to the pyramids or hanging gardens, and second, that pure mathematical research is valuable but that we can't always perceive the applications immediately. I love #1 and hope that happens. #2 requires a more nuanced look, especially if it's used as justification for any and all theoretical mathematical research. Most math research, is (while beautiful/curious/amazing) useless.Mathematics used to occupy the highest stage of the cultural aristocracy as late as the 1800s, I wonder if it's time for a cultural resurgence. The gods of social status are fickle, so who knows? Math may become cool. If that's to be, than a broader appreciation for its beauty is necessary. "
79,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1849937-yofish,3,"Really 3.5.Written by a mathematician whose stated aim is to get his readers to understand what math is *really* about (as opposed to what one learns in school). The guy has had an interesting life. He was born in the USSR, and couldn't get into the ""right"" college (MGU) for math because he's Jewish. But he's able to muddle through, thanks to the large population of Jewish (and non-Jewish) mathematicians in Moscow who are used to getting around this exact problem. He's a really good mathematician and gets published and so on; but then he graduates and has the same problem---he can't get into a graduate school in the USSR because he's Jewish. Fortunately, he's just exactly the right age, and perestroika is starting, so when he gets invited to Harvard, he can go. (And eventually when he's visiting professorship is up, Harvard lets him be demoted to graduate student so that he can get his Ph.D.) While he was giving the more biographical story, I was pretty interested. But remember that his stated purpose was to introduce his math (the Langlands Program) to the layman. I can't really say whether he succeeded, as I skimmed through most of it. Not that I couldn't have understood (probably)---after all, I am a mathematician. The thing is, though, that if I was interested in that particular math, I would have studied it in grad school. The writing is a little choppy, which is surely understandable as English is his second language. But the editing is pretty poor, too---there seemed to be several places where he repeated himself without saying ""as I mentioned before"" or something similar. That was a little weird. He also seemed a little full of himself at times. There was a particular story, during his first year at Harvard, where the head of the dept of MGU is invited to MIT. That was (apparently) controversial at the time, as he wasn't supposed to be much of a mathematician, and he apparently was overseeing the rejection of Jews. There's sort of a public confrontation between him and the author. It was an interesting story--I'm a little surprised that I hadn't heard it before, as it happened while I was in grad school, and it's the kind of thing I might have noticed."
80,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18370648-mishehu,3,"Author writes, ""...we, mathematicians, need to do a better job of unlocking the power and beauty of our subject to a wider audience."" Alas, he himself resoundingly fails to do so. 5 stars for the autobiographical material in this book. The author's personal story -- and his mathematical biography -- are quite interesting. 1.5 stars for the exposition of mathematical ideas. Whatever pretense the author may have to being a math popularizer, he has many miles to travel in developing his expository chops before he can count himself among those of his colleagues who do this sort of thing well. I recently finished reading the second of Brian Greene's masterful books on cosmology -- books that are pitched to a highly interested readership willing to put in a serious readerly effort. Occasionally, in his books, Greene elaborates certain ideas in footnotes that are expressly written for ""mathematically inclined readers."" Nearly all of Frenkel's math discussion (in both the text and the footnotes of the book in review) are, whatever anyone may claim to the contrary, pitched to mathematically inclined readers. A few chapters in and the going is pretty much impossible for the lay reader. The best I can say about Frenkel's skills as a pop math expositor is that he did manage to convey an impression of what his mathematical research is about, of why it matters, and of why it's fascinating/inspiring. So, though I understood very little of the book, I did get something out of it (not simply insights into the author's personal story). But the investment of my time was poorly paid. All that said, Frenkel writes well, and his work really IS quite fascinating. I hope he'll continue to develop his pop writing skills, and I hope that future editors/publishers of his (and other first time pop math/sci authors) will give some thought to the target audience of books like these before they let manuscripts go to press."
81,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24055618-noah,5," Non-fiction books generally explain something that is true, or at least true for the author, about a particular topic. They can range from stories about people’s lives to discoveries that have been made, as well as pure factual information. One might expect non-fiction books to be purely facts and not memoirs, but that isn’t always the case. What surprised me about the book Love and Math is that this book was laid out in a different format that what I would expect from most non-fiction books. It’s laid out more like a novel, with chapters and memoirs and such. Love and Math by Edward Frenkel is a great nonfiction book mainly focusing on the symmetry groups in math of SO(3) and SO(n). Love and Math starts by easing the reader into advanced mathematics with the use of diagrams and symmetry, then gets into some more advanced ideas such as symmetry groups for higher dimensions. Love and Math is part thoughtful memoir, and part math textbook. Edward Frenkel mixes these two things perfectly to make an enticing book that just makes you want to read more. One of the main things that helped make the book so good was that Edward Frenkel had such an amazing childhood, he met famous mathematicians, he published papers, and faced tragedies such as being persecuted because he was Jewish. Edward Frenkel is an accomplished mathematician who wants to inspire other people to become mathematicians. I think that Edward Frenkel did an awesome job of explaining advanced mathematical concepts. I would give this book five stars and recommend this book to anyone who doesn’t mind curling up somewhere for a few hours while expanding their mind and having fun."
82,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4922601-deborah-flores,5,"Very enjoyable! Some reviewers seemed uncomfortable with the neither-fish-nor-fowl feel - neither pure autobiography nor pure mathematics tome - but this approach worked well for me. Rather than simply describing the solution to a problem, the author takes the time to describe the thrill of finding an elegant solution to a problem on which you'd labored for weeks or months. Rather than just describing a mathematician's theories, the author provides sufficient details to get a feel for the mathematician as a person. I found this approach an effective way to help non-mathematicians connect to math and those who study it. I picked up this book because I was interested in Dr. Frenkel's experiences as a mathematician in the twilight years of the Soviet Union. Specifically, I wanted to learn more about the author's experiences with the harrowing, Kafkaesque Moscow State University (MGU) mathematics entrance examination, through which undesirable students (read: those of Jewish descent) were deliberately weeded out and denied admittance. This is exactly what happened to the author, and I was deeply impressed by his commitment to study math at any cost as well as his later willingness to speak out publicly against about these discriminatory policies. Bravo! It was also fascinating to read about how many Soviet mathematicians and others worked with and mentored students who had experienced discrimination, and how many of these students ended up immigrating to the West soon afterwards. As to mathematics, the author clearly loves what he does, and his love is infectious. While I didn't read the book primarily for this angle, I did gain a deeper appreciation of mathematics as well as the Langlands Program. Intriguing stuff! "
83,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5664087-john,3,"Edward Frenkel’s Love and Math joins a long list of mathematical memoirs. In the last two centuries many eminent mathematicians have attempted to describe what they do, why they do it and how they came to it. Without exception they fail the “what we do” test but often brilliantly succeed on why and how they came to mathematics. Mathematics does not admit casual observers. You have to do it to fully appreciate it and doing it at the levels Frenkel describes takes gifted minds years of hard work. “There are no royal roads to geometry.” Love and Math goes further than most in this genre. It doesn't flinch when a formula really helps and the end notes are detailed and reference laden enough to get you started on learning what’s really the deal with SO(3).The best part of the book deals with the author’s start in mathematics as a precious Russian teenager. Frenkel's father was Jewish and this created problems. The Soviet Union, in addition to being a murderous totalitarian state, was overtly anti-Semitic. Scholars of Jewish descent faced “extra” hurdles when it came to university admissions and securing jobs. Frenkel’s account of his MGU exam should be required reading for every leftist imbecile in the west. It clearly shows that secondary school mathematics was taught at levels far beyond the execrable Common Core, (affirmative action), standard now being pushed in the US and that bureaucrats can always find ways to exclude even the best of “undesirables.” Love and Math is an entertaining, enlightening and important book."
84,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8824504-leslie,3,"This one was between 3 and 3.5 stars.At the beginning of the novel the author states that he hopes to accomplish two things: first he hopes to convey his love of math and then he hopes to imbue this love into the reader. These are lofty goals. He is successful in the former but falls a bit short in the latter. The novel is part memoir and is is perhaps the most interesting section of the book. Frenkle's tale of overcoming the anti Semitic policy of the Soviet Union is incredibly moving. His love of mathematics is earnestly depicted and you root for his success in the face of adversity. The other parts of the novel focus on his contribution to the Langlands program and here I found that the quality varied. The math is certainly an important contribution but he only succeeded at making about half of it accessible to me. I will openly admit that my affinity for mathematics is limited to applied math. It is important for me to understand the context behind the concepts and unfortunately certain aspects where too abstract. I could not help but compare it to Hawking's works which successfully engaged my interest and made the esoteric aspects of quantum mechanics and physics accessible to the layperson. His works made me love physics and cosmology while this book only somewhat piqued my interest. However, I recommend the book for those interested in obtaining a peek into the mysterious world of mathematics. I believe it is an important field and completely agree with the author that it should be taught in a more engaging way. "
85,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51268208-akbar-gumbira,3,"This book is not for everyone.Through this book, the author (Edward Frenkel) tried to explain a lot of mathematical concepts in layman's terms. But no matter how hard he tried, it's just not for everyone. I have no background in mathematics or physics (as a degree) and I find it hard to understand many concepts told in the book. Though I still could follow some concepts such as generating function, fermat's little and last theorem, RSA, and most of the number theory part since I thought myself in high school some high level mathematics for olympiad. But when it comes to concepts such as Langlands program, Galois group, and the links to quantum duality, I just skim-read it.But we couldn't help it. Edward is a world-renowned and gifted mathematician. He's already working on unsolved mathematical problems since he's in college, had a patent in his 4th year in college (or 5th year I forgot exactly), and invited to Harvard in his early 20's. Things that are obvious to him, and perhaps that he also thinks to others, might not be that obvious to the readers.Apart from that, I enjoyed his personal story, telling the readers about anti-semitism in Soviet Union, his first time in Harvard (spending 45 minutes at the supermarket to just buy salt), how the project went to link quantum dualities and the Langlands program, his film-making story, and how he perceives mathematics in general.Oh I found many typos! I wonder if he's in a rush to publish it?"
86,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15546947-haydee-romero,0,"I picked up this book because love and math are two words I have never used in the same sentence. Math intimidates me but reading Frenkel’s introduction he made it clear that the goal and target audience was me! A person who fears the word math, “If you think that math is hard, that you won’t get it, if you are terrified by math but at the same time curious whether there is something worth knowing- then this book is for you.” Frenkel says that math is at the heart of love and his tone and acknowledgement of his audience made me comfortable starting the book. Frenkel did a great job at breaking down COMPLEX math equations and idea BUT it was not enough for me, personally. I would have to put the book down, reread the paragraph to grasp the concept. I would but I had to think about it... a lot. Frenkel did an amazing job of integrating his personal journey as a mathematician and the math equations he explained. It was clear throughout his book that he knew his audience were not mathematicians. Frenkel would define words that may have a different meaning in the math field. He would apply theories to concepts we may know about or explain what they are used for. I have learned and gained a much greater respect to the subject of math. I would use this book as an example of how keeping who your audience is when writing a piece makes a big difference and is so important. "
87,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1357119-david,4,"1. Frenkel and his friends would scale 20 foot walls in order to sneak into mathematics lectures - this increases my faith in humanity.2. The portrait of how Frenkel and his kindred spirits were able to find one another and prosper in the USSR is absolutely fascinating. He and his friends would tear through their official duties in no time and get real work done while operating within their largely informal and much less hierarchical intellectual network. This also increases my faith in humanity.3. On a less happy note, Frenkel's experience illuminates the weaknesses of the rigid (and far too common) approach to mathematical education. It is possible to reach some individuals even when mathematical concepts are taught as pure abstractions - you can reach people who focus intensely on discreet tasks and who follow instructions first and ask questions later. Others, however, learn through a much more context-driven approach. If you present them with a new abstract concept and fail to connect it to what they have learned before or demonstrate how it can be visualized or applied, they are going to struggle. Frenkel found wonderful mentors who helped him see math as an area to explore rather than an area where one duplicates rote instructions - I sure didn't find anyone like that, and I doubt many others do either."
88,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22906182-kat-steiner,3,"Argh, finally finished this book. Unsurprisingly, it does not work as an audiobook. Do not buy it from Audible.I think when I got it, I believed it was more of a book about mathematicians or a fictionalised autobiography, than a book about maths. It's sort of both, but there is a fair amount of actual maths (and significantly advanced maths, at that). And that's just impossible to make sense of while listening. Particularly as the narrator, Tony Craine, clearly has absolutely no idea what he is saying, so his emphasis is often totally off, or he reads things in a way that doesn't distinguish where brackets would be, so it's just impossible to follow no matter how hard you listen - there's not enough information conveyed.The story itself I really enjoyed - it was a fascinating account of education and anti-semitism in Soviet Russia, as well as great insight into the lives of professional mathematicians. I did a maths degree so I can't comment on how it would come across to the layman, but I found the actual maths a bit hard-going and uninteresting - these are difficult, complicated concepts that weren't very interesting when you can't get into either the nitty-gritty or appreciate the broader concepts.A bit of a mixed bag. Quite enjoyable in parts, but I'm glad to be done. Don't get the audiobook."
89,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10145524-charles-daney,5,"The love referred to is mainly for mathematics, though there is one chapter on the human-related form. The first chapters are about Frenkel's struggles to get a math education in the last years of the Soviet Union. He had to literally climb fences to get access to the best seminars and experts. Most of the book deals with his primary interest: an extremely esoteric, but important, area of current research, known as the ""Langlands Program"". I really enjoyed his presentation, since this is one of my main interests also, and this is the best ""nontechnical"" explanation I've ever seen of the subject. It made things a lot clearer for me. The basic idea is that there are very deep relationships among a number of mathematical concepts that on the surface seem quite unrelated. And besides that, there may be important applications to particle physics theory. It could turn out that a lot of why fundamental physics works the way it does is a result of mathematical relationships. Someday before too long (I hope), I can write about the Langlands Program on my math blog. It's related to stuff I've already written about there (number theory). I find that the best way to learn about new things is to write about them - as a process of explaining the subject to myself."
90,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7412717-suzie-shatarevyan,3,"Not exactly what I was expecting when I picked up this book. I've always loved math, but reading this book hasn't made me want to run and become a mathematician. Half the book reads like a memoir, which I didn't mind as I enjoy that genre, but like I said, not what I was expecting. Pure, 'non-practictal' math is impossible to grasp for the non mathematician and there's a lot of that in this book. Frenkel does try to explain using analogies, but that's not always possible. In one instance, when referring to a formula he wrote, he concedes that maybe only 10 or 12 people in the entire world can understand it. Not even math students will get it! On the other hand, I have become familiarized with a lot of math theories that is being studied in the last 50 years, so I'm still glad I read this book. It's obvious Frenkel has a deep passion for his field. You have to be extremely passionate to devote years and years looking for discoveries and connections in things that seem unrelated. This is still pretty accessible and if you want to see math like you've never seen in the classroom, give it a shot. Definitely mind-expanding."
91,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67447577-joseph-schrock,4,"This book was tough reading for me. I'm a mathematical hobbyist -- not a professional mathematician. This book discussed lots of things concerning which I had zero knowledge. It dealt with groups, symmetries, topology, etc. All of those are (for the most part) beyond my level of training. I've gotten moderately far into elementary number theory -- dealing with modular arithmetic, encryption, and even some into quadratic reciprocity (for which I've not managed to master the proofs). Frenkel's book might be a good book for a professional mathematician, but laymen will find it tough going -- except for the biographical aspects of the book, which are very nicely written. As for myself, if I'd known how tough this book is, I would likely not have bought it. But then, I'm not a professional mathematician or mathematics student. "

This book is decidedly of the second group. The author interleaves with the difficult parts a memoir of growing up a prodigy in the USSR, facing discrimination and eventually escaping to a visiting position at Harvard despite not having finished his undergrad(!) He talks about his involvement in the Langlands Program, an attempt at a sort of Grand Unified Theory of Maths, and attempts to convey the beauty and excitement he finds in it. Starting with symmetry and groups, Frenkel rapidly progresses into the heart of contemporary mathematics: Lie algebras, Riemann surfaces, elliptic curves in the complex plane, n-branes, quantum field applications of theorised supersymmetries, and much more. I would lie if I claimed to have grasped it all, but I got a lot out of following the threads in each chapter as far as I could, stopping, rereading and Wikipedia-ing. This book works best as a subjective, impassioned introduction to what mathematicians work on all day, and what might make someone want to join them."

In that sense the book didn't provide optimal reading flow for me. I also felt that the couple last chapters did not really fit well with the rest of the book and felt a bit tacky.I would've given this 2 stars, or maybe even 1 star, if not for the first several chapters."

I started looking through it and the preface convinced me to read it. Frenkel is a mathematician, born in the U.S.S.R. and now at Berkeley, who is working on something called the ""Langlands Project"". He begins by discussing the fact that otherwise well-educated people who would never brag that they hated literature or art or music seem proud to say they ""hate math"", and admit they know nothing about it; and he suggests that the reason is the way it is taught. He uses the analogy, suppose you took a course in Art, and instead of showing you the works of Rembrandt and Van Gogh they spent the entire class teaching you to paint -- fences. Would you be interested in pursuing art? But this is the way that math is generally taught -- as a practical collection of tools for doing other (mostly boring) things. The ""masterpieces"" of math are never mentioned. He also points out that most of the math which is taught in high school and even the early years of college dates from the ancient Greeks or the early modern period -- current work is never mentioned; it's as if a physics course ended with the work of Galileo and Newton, and gave the impression that everything in physics was already discovered and all that was left was to use it for practical engineering. Then he goes on to talk about popular science writers, such as Stephen Hawking or Brian Greene, who present the exciting developments of contemporary work in physics for the layperson, and asks why there are so few if any popularizations of work at the frontiers of contemporary math. He warns of the political dangers of allowing a small elite to monopolize knowledge of mathematics in an age when all our lives depend more than ever before on applications of math, from the Internet to Wall Street; he suggests that a mathematically literate population would not be so easily taken in by the doubletalk of the bankers and politicians. That is the gap he is trying to fill with this book. The focus is on his own work on the Langlands Project, and like the physics books of Kip Thorne or Leonard Susskind, he includes much of his own experiences. In the first few chapters, he explains how he became interested in math as a high school student; how he was denied entry into the more prestigious schools because he was Jewish, and the official academic world in the era of the final decay of the Soviet bureaucracy was highly anti-Semitic; how he was privately mentored by some of the great Soviet mathematicians, who were opposed to anti-Semitism, including the legendary Israel Gelfand, who was himself Jewish; how he worked in private and more or less secretly on group theory, and sent his first papers abroad; how he was invited to Harvard in the first months of perestroika under Gorbachev, where he became a Visiting Professor before he had even become a grad student; and how he came in contact with the Langlands Project. After that, the book is largely a popular account of the Langlands Project itself. While popular physics books try to avoid math, a popular math book of course has to be about math, and I learned much from this book. At the beginning, his explanations are very clear, and make ideas like modulo arithmetic, finite fields, Lie groups and Riemann surfaces understandable (some of the very subjects I had trouble with in reading Penrose's The Road to Reality). Later on, the book becomes more difficult to follow and his explanations of vector spaces and representations were briefer and less clear; by the end he is mentioning things like fiber bundles and automorphic functions without any explanation at all. If we keep in mind the comparison to someone like Brian Greene, though, it is hard to fault this too much; no one expects to actually learn quantum theory or string theory from a popular science book, and we shouldn't expect to learn advanced math from a book like this -- what we want to learn is what in general it is about, what the questions are and what sort of research is going on, and he is very good at that. His observations that sets, functions and numbers have been left behind for categories, sheaves and vector spaces was interesting; something like the way classical physics gave way to quantum theory. Quantum theory and string theory are here, as the ""fourth column"" of the Langlands Program; the author has collaborated with physicist-mathematicians such as Edward Witten on the connections between the two fields. So what is the Langlands Program? Essentially, it is a program to discover patterns common to various seemingly unrelated branches of mathematics (and recently physics), in particular to relate group theory and curves over finite fields to subjects like harmonic analysis and Riemann surfaces. If you don't know what these things are -- that's evidence for his thesis. "
101,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86000064-stephanie,4,"I think I am too dumb for this book but I enjoyed what I could understand! It's clear Frenkel has a lot of infectious passion for his work, and I liked his explanations"
102,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42063497-christina,3,"Yes, most of the mathematics in this book is hard. Edward Frenkel's work is cutting-edge mathematical research, after all, with applications in quantum mechanics, so it's no walk in the park. I give him credit for even attempting to explain it to a lay audience. As he states in ""A Guide for the Reader"", you can skip the sections and chapters that deal with the math. I think most readers of this book will end up doing so at some point, mainly enjoying the biographical parts.Frenkel's point in writing this book, as he explains in the ""Preface"", is to share his love for mathematics with an audience who doesn't get to see much of its hidden beauty. He does this by taking the reader on the journey that led him to mathematics, starting with a friend of his father's who taught Frenkle about symmetries and braid groups when he was in his late teens. This sparked his lifelong passion for math, and we learn all about the obstacles thrown into his path by the Soviet system that made it next to impossible for a son of a Jew to study or work in research mathematics. Luckily, he was the right age to take advantage of Perestroika, and then the collapse of the Soviet Union, and was able to both finish his studies and find an academic position in the United States.We get introduced to the main project in Frankel's career, the Langlands Program, in chapter 8, ""Magic Numbers,"" where a lot of background is given. The Langlands Program, if finished, will link together several fields of mathematics that seem unrelated on the surface. This is difficult to do and pretty rare. The background leading up to this is wide-ranging, and Frenkle tries to simplify his explanations as much as possible, but this is where the abstract nature of advanced mathematics is probably going to confuse most of his audience. In a mere 15 pages, you get a high-level whirlwind tour of the Galois groups, how the Shimura-Taniyama-Weil conjecture was used to prove Fermat's Last Theorem, how this conjecture is a general result for finding the generating function of cubic equations (using the generating function of the Fibonacci numbers as an analogy), and how it is a special case of the Langlands Program. I had to read chapter 8 very carefully and slowly, but I got the gist of it, if not a deep understanding. By the next chapter, where he introduces Lie (pronounced ""lee"") groups and algebras, I admit I was lost.The remaining math sections left me feeling like Frenkel was Beethoven, explaining how he had composed his symphonies, while I was the novice student who had finished a basic course in music theory, and knew how to play ""Für Elise"" but not much else. While his enthusiasm for mathematics and his life's work are all obvious, I just cannot appreciate the depth or the details on the same level. I found this discouraging and more than a little frustrating, because I wanted to see the same beauty that he did. I did appreciate the journey he has taken to get to this point, and the real-life depiction of how mathematical research is actually done - sometimes painfully slowly. Perhaps after some years of study I will be able to appreciate the mathematical sections just as much as the biographical ones."
103,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5931241-jenny,2,"This author was a guest on the Colbert Report, which is when I first learned of his book. He described the concept so passionately, and he argued that mathematics has been so misunderstood because it isn't given its fair due in K-12 school curricula. Frenkel is disillusioned that the general masses don't appreciate math, and he set out to conquer our hearts with this book. He stated that this book was written specifically for people like me, laypeople who have never had the opportunity to give math a fair shake because all they learn are boring basic concepts in school and they never see the true beauty of it. He compared it to taking an art class in which you only get to paint a fence and are never actually shown the works of great artists. Fair enough, I thought. I'll give it a try.By chapter three, I realized that Edward Frenkel is a misguided genius who truly believes that laypeople could possibly understand what he is talking about. I don't sense that he is a self-righteous individual who wants to come across as ridiculously smart (he is, in fact, ridiculously smart). I think he really just doesn't get that trying to relate these concepts to people like me, who only made it through Calc A, cannot be done. Hence, large parts of the book left me absolutely lost. Even BJ, who was a math minor, said he wasn't keeping up and so he quit reading it. Consider this sentence: ""The idea of string theory is that by doing calculations in these sigma models and summing up the results over all possible Riemann surfaces E (that is, over all possible paths of the strings propagating in a fixed space-time S) we can reproduce the physics that we observe in space-time S."" Honestly, I wish this particular sentence, which I chose at random, was a stand-apart in terms of its difficulty, but the truth is that much of this book is written in this language with ten unfamiliar concepts thrown together in the same sentence, all with the assumption that we must understand what the heck he is talking about. The redeeming points of the book were the interspersed memoir portions, which were extremely interesting. Frenkel was born in the Soviet Union and endured intense antisemitism at practically every turn in his education, but still prevailed and eventually traveled to Harvard and then to UC-Berkeley with professorships. I very much loved hearing about his experiences growing up, in college, working with colleagues, and his personal excitement about solving mathematical problems. It was only that he felt the need to then delve INTO those problems with technical language that made this book a disappointment--along with the fact that I didn't feel it delivered what it originally promised.In the end, I walked away appreciating Edward Frenkel's personal story. However, I did NOT end up appreciating math anymore than I ever did before, which was precisely why I decided to read the book in the first place. Unless you're ready to skip some major portions or else you're a mathematician, I don't recommend this book to you. This book is truly written for mathematicians, not laypeople, as it was so described."
104,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28285354-ron,3,"Love and Math: The Heart of Hidden Reality by Edward FrenkelThis is the story of a young boy of 12 who loved quantum physics, but not math. When he learned that the quark was found by using math, he decided to study math. He grew up a 100 miles from Moscow and he was Jewish. He was a very bright student and when he finished public school, he went to Moscow to take the test to enter the Moscow State University but at that time MSU discriminated against the Jewish people and when Edward went to take the test, he was taken to a room by two of the testers and given an oral exam and the testers did not like the correct answers he gave to the questions, so he failed the entrance exam. Later one of the testers came to him and told him that he could get into Moscow Institute of Oil and Gas, where they also had a good applied mathematics school and even used some of the professors who taught at MSU. He was accepted to the Moscow Institute of Oil and Gas and in his second year there he solved a difficult problem and it was brought to the attention of one of the MSU top mathematician professors. He solved an even more advanced math problem that this professor gave him and he wrote his first juried math paper for the Journal of Mathematics. Soon, he received a three month invitation to learn at Harvard. He was on his way to becoming a top flight mathematician. He worked on the Langlands program to unify various branches of mathematics. Edward and other mathematicians worked to unify number theory and harmonic analysis. Frankel uses two irrational numbers to construct a system of hybrid numbers in which one term is rational and the other term is a rational multiple of the irrational numbers. These numbers are now constructed into a new numeral system called a “number field”, and they form a mathematical structure called the “Galois group” of the polynomial equation. An analysis of this Galois group can produce solutions of harmonic analysis (a more sophisticated version of the study of sines and cosines.) Frenkel and his group of mathematicians in the Langlands program are producing solutions that will tie other mathematical branches together. Edward presents these mathematical equations equal to oil paintings and sculptures exhibited in museums throughout the world. The book is well written and the explanations go a long way forward to knowing about the mathematical solutions presented. I believe you would need a bachelor of mathematics degree or equivalent in order to see the “Mona Lisa” Frenkel has presented here. "
105,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1856047-jonna-higgins-freese,5,"I can't say I understand The Langlands Program any more now than I did before, except that it has something to do with sheaves and making it possible to ""translate"" between different areas of mathematics. I also picked up that the mathematics has some real-world implications in terms of symmetry and quantum physics, which I'd already picked up on from reading _The God Particle._ Unlike many of the other reviewers, I enjoyed the way he narrated his own engagement with and love of mathematics -- before I could love math myself, I needed to understand how anyone could love it, and I felt he did a good job of showing what it's like to be a person who loves mathematics.There were several interesting quotes --Thoreau: ""We have heard about the poetry of mathematics, but very little of it has yet been sung."" (A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers, cited on p. 228 of L&M)p. 241: ""Albert Einstein wrote, 'Every one who is seriously involved in thepursuit of science becomes convinced that some spirit is manifest in the laws of the Universe -- a spirit vastly superior to that of man, and one in the face of which we with our modest powers must feel humble.' And Isaac Newton expressed his feelings this way: 'to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the seashore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.'""My dream is that one day we will all awaken to this hidden reality. We may then perhaps be able to set aside our differences and focus on the profound truths that unite us. Then, we will all be like children playing on the seashore, marveling at the dazzling beauty and harmony we discover, share, and cherish together.""And this is what I love about reading books about math and science whose content I can barely understand -- it puts my life into perspective. When I'm frustrated about a completely illogical decision at work, or asked to accomplish something without the tools to do so, or when I feel that my life is spent in entirely too much make-work that takes me away from my children, reading such books for a few minutes before bed each night puts things into a larger perspective, opens up the world so that I feel I have space to breathe again."
106,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91748031-hobart-mariner,3,"As a personal memoir, this book is a both good and a bit frustrating. As a lay introduction to the ideas behind general advanced mathematics, and in particular the Langlands program (and its ties to string and superstring theory), it is very good, if a little daunting toward the end.In the early parts, the author does a very fine job of describing the hideous antisemitism that he encountered in the Soviet Union of the 1980s and how it prevented a generation of young Jewish mathematicians from developing to their fullest. He does a good job of recounting the unfairness of the oral examinations that prevented him from attending the Moscow State University Mechanics and Mathematics Department. In particular, his losing admission over a farcically nitpicky definition of circle (""the set of all points equidistant from a fixed point"" instead of ""the set of points equidistant from a fixed point"") serves as an illustration of the utter absurdity of this system. Later on, in the United States, he and several other Russian-Jewish mathematicians are given an opportunity to get back at the antisemitic Rector of MSU and this provides a satisfying and compelling scene.The author also presents warm and personal sketches of the mentors who helped him both to learn mathematics and to escape the clutches of this oppressive system. The author, for one who showed such incredible ability so young, is admirably free of vanity regarding his career, constantly giving credit to his advisors, teachers, and fellow students. There are a few personal bits that could have used more fleshing out (in particular, when he meets Feigin's family, he mentions that he would come to become very close with them, but the reader doesn't really see this). I thought that the depiction of the life of the ""Kerosinka"" was very interesting, an applied math hub full of frustrated young pure mathematicians. I thought that Yakov Khurgin, the charismatic probabilist studying with physicians to ensure his own access to medical care, made a very sympathetic character. It was poignant when the author described leaving his paltry instructorship (obtained by Khurgin with some difficulty) at the Kerosinka behind to study at Harvard. After the author moves to the United States, the story becomes a bit less personal and instead becomes more of a purely popular scientific book. Of the first twelve chapters, several are completely given over to mathematical exposition (some without any mention of the author's personal history). Yet it felt as I read it that after the author moves to Cambridge in Chapter 13, the book became much less personal. This corresponds with the author's life becoming less contingent and unstable, and maybe as a consequence less interesting. He sketches a few scenes of adjusting to life in the United States (being overwhelmed by the choices at a supermarket, learning colloquial English by watching David Letterman, walking around in jeans with a Walkman). I can't find it now but later on he provides a single paragraph of personal history, including marriage, divorce, and moving his Russian family to the United States. I would have liked to see a bit more of this, even if it has limited bearing on the mathematical parts of the memoir. As a work of mathematical exposition for a lay audience this book is quite successful, particularly in the earlier parts. (Disclaimer: I'm an academic mathematician, although in a different field of math than the author's.) I've seen many, many descriptions of the notion of symmetry group meant for lay audiences and I think that the author's stands out in terms of clarity. His own charming initial encounter with group theory (a mathematician friend of the family showing him the links the subject has with particle physics) might not make it easier for everyone else to comprehend, but at least gives an idea that the subject has meaning outside of the abstractions of pure math. He does a very fine job explaining the notions of groups, braid groups, fundamental group, modular arithmetic, and the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. I was quite impressed with his ability to describe Galois theory in relatively low-tech terms (in particular, he employs a wonderfully evocative metaphor involving the wings of a butterfly). The scientific exposition later on (in particular the bits with supersymmetry and string theory) were a bit harder for me to digest, but that doesn't mean he didn't present them in very clear terms. The main mathematical focus of the book is the Langlands Program, which the author repeatedly refers to as a Grand Unified Theory of Math, a description that overstates things slightly (there are several major fields of mathematics that do not really fall under the umbrella of the Langlands Program). It is no surprise that the author, one of the Langlands Program's superstars, does an excellent job laying out the basic ideas behind this ambitious research program. There are good explanations of Galois theory (mentioned above) and a solid example of how modular forms tie in to the subject. A bit more said about the general idea of modular forms might have been useful, but it's possible that it would be too technical for most readers. The author perhaps overloads a metaphor concerning people in Europe and North America, but not to the detriment of the books readability. I do think that it's possible readers with a limited mathematical background will get a bit lost in these sections, because they discuss fairly airy connections between subjects that have only briefly been sketched. There is a very good discussion of Weil's ""Rosetta stone"" in Chapter 9 that provides a nice backbone for all of the Langlands Program discussion. The last chapter, which contains a description of the author's screenplay (The Two-Body Problem) and short film (Rites of Love and Math), felt a bit disconnected from the rest of the book. His description of the screenwriting process is interesting and gives him the opportunity to credit yet another mentor. When he discusses the film-making process he employs a reconstructed dialogue with a French director which seems a bit artificial (similar to several other dialogues in the book). The film, which features a mathematician writing a powerful formula on the body of a woman, seems half-baked in its concept, although its clear that it means quite a lot to the author. It's a bit hard to see how this artsy, somewhat pretentious production is the best way to make someone feel the importance of math, when the author himself has done a good job in his earlier chapters making the reader feel the urgency of his initial mathematical work. A short film about a young Jewish mathematician in the Soviet Union trying with all his energy to get into MSU, prove a theorem, break into a lecture hall, etc. would be much more compelling and get across the feeling of doing math much better, in my opinion. He leaves out any mention of the minor controversy that the film provoked among feminist circles, instead offering platitudes like ""it's all in the eye of the bholder."" This section is larded with quotations from Thoreau, Einstein, etc, and overall is a bit flabby and formless in comparison with the rest of the book. Sort of disappointing that he chose to end on this note. "
107,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11253338-andrew,3,"This book was much more enjoyable when I gave up trying to understand.The author is clearly knowledgeable about mathematics. He is also very very passionate.The difficulty lies in informing the rest of us about his passion. A Nobel Laureate in Physics claims this book is ""very readable."" Which is great news, except I am not a Nobel Laureate in the realm Frenkel's work deals with.This is the struggle he faces: Mathematics is far larger and deeper than most people encounter. We are taught from a young age that math is ugly and mostly esoteric. Trying to overcome that by bringing up ideas that mean absolutely nothing to those who have not studied Algebraic Symmetries, Modular Forms, and Reimannian Surfaces is not effective.HOWEVER, when I accepted that I didn't have a clue what he was talking about, and chose to pay attention to the links between those ideas (which was his purpose), life got easier.The purpose of this book isn't to teach the reader mathematics, but to show how various ideas in mathematics are related, to the surprise of the rest of us. Math is about exotic connections and powerful generalizations, not calculation. In the 17th Chapter, Dr. Frenkel writes ""But my point is not for you to learn them all. Rather, I want to indicate the logical connections between these objects and show the creative process of scientists studying them: what drives them, how they learn from each other, how the knowledge they acquire is used to advance our understanding of the key questions.""THAT should have been in the introduction, alongside the anecdote of drunks and fractions. It would have made the rest SO MUCH easier. If the reader begins with that idea, then the book is wonderful. Math is beautiful, not because it is useful, but because it is the art of the universe itself. A famous sculptor (I believe it was Michelangelo) once said that the statue was already in the marble, he just discovered it. Many mathematicians feel that they do not create math, they find the rules that were already there. This book does a great job demonstrating that concept. Provided you ignore the footnotes and don't try to understand the math he is using to present this idea."
108,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3016981-girish,3,"There is a wave of ""pop-math"" books aimed at the interested amateur, and Edward Frenkel's memoir/masturbatory ode to math is a whirlwind tour of his life and research interests. Frenkel tries to acclimate the reader to the mathematical castle in the sky by attempting to avoid jargon and using commonplace examples to elucidate mathematical concepts (e.g. the ""symmetrical circle group"" as an example of a group).My main complaint is that I don't know who this book is for. I got out of what I wanted (and expected) - an increased appreciation for the thought patterns around math, a birds eye view of the Langland's Program, some interesting succinct definitions of mathematical concepts, and some cool visualizations. The autobiographical tidbits were interesting, but for orthogonal reasons (one of my coworkers is Russian Jewish and that got me interested in Frenkel's story; not to mention just how wrong what happened to him was).You won't learn any math from this book. It's an interesting foray into the emotional connection to math, so even though one of Frenkel's explicit goals is to demystify the intricate edifice of theory that is the Langland's Program, I'd say he failed in that endeavor. I suppose for the right person who really thinks of mathematics as SAT-style word problems, then it might be incredibly interesting to learn that it's much more artistic, revelatory, and exploratory.I'll note that Frenkel makes a couple claims in this book. First, the implicit claim that mathematical discoveries should be elevated in stature and aesthetic to the pyramids or hanging gardens, and second, that pure mathematical research is valuable but that we can't always perceive the applications immediately. I love #1 and hope that happens. #2 requires a more nuanced look, especially if it's used as justification for any and all theoretical mathematical research. Most math research, is (while beautiful/curious/amazing) useless.Mathematics used to occupy the highest stage of the cultural aristocracy as late as the 1800s, I wonder if it's time for a cultural resurgence. The gods of social status are fickle, so who knows? Math may become cool. If that's to be, than a broader appreciation for its beauty is necessary. "
109,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1849937-yofish,3,"Really 3.5.Written by a mathematician whose stated aim is to get his readers to understand what math is *really* about (as opposed to what one learns in school). The guy has had an interesting life. He was born in the USSR, and couldn't get into the ""right"" college (MGU) for math because he's Jewish. But he's able to muddle through, thanks to the large population of Jewish (and non-Jewish) mathematicians in Moscow who are used to getting around this exact problem. He's a really good mathematician and gets published and so on; but then he graduates and has the same problem---he can't get into a graduate school in the USSR because he's Jewish. Fortunately, he's just exactly the right age, and perestroika is starting, so when he gets invited to Harvard, he can go. (And eventually when he's visiting professorship is up, Harvard lets him be demoted to graduate student so that he can get his Ph.D.) While he was giving the more biographical story, I was pretty interested. But remember that his stated purpose was to introduce his math (the Langlands Program) to the layman. I can't really say whether he succeeded, as I skimmed through most of it. Not that I couldn't have understood (probably)---after all, I am a mathematician. The thing is, though, that if I was interested in that particular math, I would have studied it in grad school. The writing is a little choppy, which is surely understandable as English is his second language. But the editing is pretty poor, too---there seemed to be several places where he repeated himself without saying ""as I mentioned before"" or something similar. That was a little weird. He also seemed a little full of himself at times. There was a particular story, during his first year at Harvard, where the head of the dept of MGU is invited to MIT. That was (apparently) controversial at the time, as he wasn't supposed to be much of a mathematician, and he apparently was overseeing the rejection of Jews. There's sort of a public confrontation between him and the author. It was an interesting story--I'm a little surprised that I hadn't heard it before, as it happened while I was in grad school, and it's the kind of thing I might have noticed."
110,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18370648-mishehu,3,"Author writes, ""...we, mathematicians, need to do a better job of unlocking the power and beauty of our subject to a wider audience."" Alas, he himself resoundingly fails to do so. 5 stars for the autobiographical material in this book. The author's personal story -- and his mathematical biography -- are quite interesting. 1.5 stars for the exposition of mathematical ideas. Whatever pretense the author may have to being a math popularizer, he has many miles to travel in developing his expository chops before he can count himself among those of his colleagues who do this sort of thing well. I recently finished reading the second of Brian Greene's masterful books on cosmology -- books that are pitched to a highly interested readership willing to put in a serious readerly effort. Occasionally, in his books, Greene elaborates certain ideas in footnotes that are expressly written for ""mathematically inclined readers."" Nearly all of Frenkel's math discussion (in both the text and the footnotes of the book in review) are, whatever anyone may claim to the contrary, pitched to mathematically inclined readers. A few chapters in and the going is pretty much impossible for the lay reader. The best I can say about Frenkel's skills as a pop math expositor is that he did manage to convey an impression of what his mathematical research is about, of why it matters, and of why it's fascinating/inspiring. So, though I understood very little of the book, I did get something out of it (not simply insights into the author's personal story). But the investment of my time was poorly paid. All that said, Frenkel writes well, and his work really IS quite fascinating. I hope he'll continue to develop his pop writing skills, and I hope that future editors/publishers of his (and other first time pop math/sci authors) will give some thought to the target audience of books like these before they let manuscripts go to press."
111,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24055618-noah,5," Non-fiction books generally explain something that is true, or at least true for the author, about a particular topic. They can range from stories about people’s lives to discoveries that have been made, as well as pure factual information. One might expect non-fiction books to be purely facts and not memoirs, but that isn’t always the case. What surprised me about the book Love and Math is that this book was laid out in a different format that what I would expect from most non-fiction books. It’s laid out more like a novel, with chapters and memoirs and such. Love and Math by Edward Frenkel is a great nonfiction book mainly focusing on the symmetry groups in math of SO(3) and SO(n). Love and Math starts by easing the reader into advanced mathematics with the use of diagrams and symmetry, then gets into some more advanced ideas such as symmetry groups for higher dimensions. Love and Math is part thoughtful memoir, and part math textbook. Edward Frenkel mixes these two things perfectly to make an enticing book that just makes you want to read more. One of the main things that helped make the book so good was that Edward Frenkel had such an amazing childhood, he met famous mathematicians, he published papers, and faced tragedies such as being persecuted because he was Jewish. Edward Frenkel is an accomplished mathematician who wants to inspire other people to become mathematicians. I think that Edward Frenkel did an awesome job of explaining advanced mathematical concepts. I would give this book five stars and recommend this book to anyone who doesn’t mind curling up somewhere for a few hours while expanding their mind and having fun."
112,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4922601-deborah-flores,5,"Very enjoyable! Some reviewers seemed uncomfortable with the neither-fish-nor-fowl feel - neither pure autobiography nor pure mathematics tome - but this approach worked well for me. Rather than simply describing the solution to a problem, the author takes the time to describe the thrill of finding an elegant solution to a problem on which you'd labored for weeks or months. Rather than just describing a mathematician's theories, the author provides sufficient details to get a feel for the mathematician as a person. I found this approach an effective way to help non-mathematicians connect to math and those who study it. I picked up this book because I was interested in Dr. Frenkel's experiences as a mathematician in the twilight years of the Soviet Union. Specifically, I wanted to learn more about the author's experiences with the harrowing, Kafkaesque Moscow State University (MGU) mathematics entrance examination, through which undesirable students (read: those of Jewish descent) were deliberately weeded out and denied admittance. This is exactly what happened to the author, and I was deeply impressed by his commitment to study math at any cost as well as his later willingness to speak out publicly against about these discriminatory policies. Bravo! It was also fascinating to read about how many Soviet mathematicians and others worked with and mentored students who had experienced discrimination, and how many of these students ended up immigrating to the West soon afterwards. As to mathematics, the author clearly loves what he does, and his love is infectious. While I didn't read the book primarily for this angle, I did gain a deeper appreciation of mathematics as well as the Langlands Program. Intriguing stuff! "
113,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5664087-john,3,"Edward Frenkel’s Love and Math joins a long list of mathematical memoirs. In the last two centuries many eminent mathematicians have attempted to describe what they do, why they do it and how they came to it. Without exception they fail the “what we do” test but often brilliantly succeed on why and how they came to mathematics. Mathematics does not admit casual observers. You have to do it to fully appreciate it and doing it at the levels Frenkel describes takes gifted minds years of hard work. “There are no royal roads to geometry.” Love and Math goes further than most in this genre. It doesn't flinch when a formula really helps and the end notes are detailed and reference laden enough to get you started on learning what’s really the deal with SO(3).The best part of the book deals with the author’s start in mathematics as a precious Russian teenager. Frenkel's father was Jewish and this created problems. The Soviet Union, in addition to being a murderous totalitarian state, was overtly anti-Semitic. Scholars of Jewish descent faced “extra” hurdles when it came to university admissions and securing jobs. Frenkel’s account of his MGU exam should be required reading for every leftist imbecile in the west. It clearly shows that secondary school mathematics was taught at levels far beyond the execrable Common Core, (affirmative action), standard now being pushed in the US and that bureaucrats can always find ways to exclude even the best of “undesirables.” Love and Math is an entertaining, enlightening and important book."
114,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8824504-leslie,3,"This one was between 3 and 3.5 stars.At the beginning of the novel the author states that he hopes to accomplish two things: first he hopes to convey his love of math and then he hopes to imbue this love into the reader. These are lofty goals. He is successful in the former but falls a bit short in the latter. The novel is part memoir and is is perhaps the most interesting section of the book. Frenkle's tale of overcoming the anti Semitic policy of the Soviet Union is incredibly moving. His love of mathematics is earnestly depicted and you root for his success in the face of adversity. The other parts of the novel focus on his contribution to the Langlands program and here I found that the quality varied. The math is certainly an important contribution but he only succeeded at making about half of it accessible to me. I will openly admit that my affinity for mathematics is limited to applied math. It is important for me to understand the context behind the concepts and unfortunately certain aspects where too abstract. I could not help but compare it to Hawking's works which successfully engaged my interest and made the esoteric aspects of quantum mechanics and physics accessible to the layperson. His works made me love physics and cosmology while this book only somewhat piqued my interest. However, I recommend the book for those interested in obtaining a peek into the mysterious world of mathematics. I believe it is an important field and completely agree with the author that it should be taught in a more engaging way. "
115,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51268208-akbar-gumbira,3,"This book is not for everyone.Through this book, the author (Edward Frenkel) tried to explain a lot of mathematical concepts in layman's terms. But no matter how hard he tried, it's just not for everyone. I have no background in mathematics or physics (as a degree) and I find it hard to understand many concepts told in the book. Though I still could follow some concepts such as generating function, fermat's little and last theorem, RSA, and most of the number theory part since I thought myself in high school some high level mathematics for olympiad. But when it comes to concepts such as Langlands program, Galois group, and the links to quantum duality, I just skim-read it.But we couldn't help it. Edward is a world-renowned and gifted mathematician. He's already working on unsolved mathematical problems since he's in college, had a patent in his 4th year in college (or 5th year I forgot exactly), and invited to Harvard in his early 20's. Things that are obvious to him, and perhaps that he also thinks to others, might not be that obvious to the readers.Apart from that, I enjoyed his personal story, telling the readers about anti-semitism in Soviet Union, his first time in Harvard (spending 45 minutes at the supermarket to just buy salt), how the project went to link quantum dualities and the Langlands program, his film-making story, and how he perceives mathematics in general.Oh I found many typos! I wonder if he's in a rush to publish it?"
116,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15546947-haydee-romero,0,"I picked up this book because love and math are two words I have never used in the same sentence. Math intimidates me but reading Frenkel’s introduction he made it clear that the goal and target audience was me! A person who fears the word math, “If you think that math is hard, that you won’t get it, if you are terrified by math but at the same time curious whether there is something worth knowing- then this book is for you.” Frenkel says that math is at the heart of love and his tone and acknowledgement of his audience made me comfortable starting the book. Frenkel did a great job at breaking down COMPLEX math equations and idea BUT it was not enough for me, personally. I would have to put the book down, reread the paragraph to grasp the concept. I would but I had to think about it... a lot. Frenkel did an amazing job of integrating his personal journey as a mathematician and the math equations he explained. It was clear throughout his book that he knew his audience were not mathematicians. Frenkel would define words that may have a different meaning in the math field. He would apply theories to concepts we may know about or explain what they are used for. I have learned and gained a much greater respect to the subject of math. I would use this book as an example of how keeping who your audience is when writing a piece makes a big difference and is so important. "
117,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1357119-david,4,"1. Frenkel and his friends would scale 20 foot walls in order to sneak into mathematics lectures - this increases my faith in humanity.2. The portrait of how Frenkel and his kindred spirits were able to find one another and prosper in the USSR is absolutely fascinating. He and his friends would tear through their official duties in no time and get real work done while operating within their largely informal and much less hierarchical intellectual network. This also increases my faith in humanity.3. On a less happy note, Frenkel's experience illuminates the weaknesses of the rigid (and far too common) approach to mathematical education. It is possible to reach some individuals even when mathematical concepts are taught as pure abstractions - you can reach people who focus intensely on discreet tasks and who follow instructions first and ask questions later. Others, however, learn through a much more context-driven approach. If you present them with a new abstract concept and fail to connect it to what they have learned before or demonstrate how it can be visualized or applied, they are going to struggle. Frenkel found wonderful mentors who helped him see math as an area to explore rather than an area where one duplicates rote instructions - I sure didn't find anyone like that, and I doubt many others do either."
118,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22906182-kat-steiner,3,"Argh, finally finished this book. Unsurprisingly, it does not work as an audiobook. Do not buy it from Audible.I think when I got it, I believed it was more of a book about mathematicians or a fictionalised autobiography, than a book about maths. It's sort of both, but there is a fair amount of actual maths (and significantly advanced maths, at that). And that's just impossible to make sense of while listening. Particularly as the narrator, Tony Craine, clearly has absolutely no idea what he is saying, so his emphasis is often totally off, or he reads things in a way that doesn't distinguish where brackets would be, so it's just impossible to follow no matter how hard you listen - there's not enough information conveyed.The story itself I really enjoyed - it was a fascinating account of education and anti-semitism in Soviet Russia, as well as great insight into the lives of professional mathematicians. I did a maths degree so I can't comment on how it would come across to the layman, but I found the actual maths a bit hard-going and uninteresting - these are difficult, complicated concepts that weren't very interesting when you can't get into either the nitty-gritty or appreciate the broader concepts.A bit of a mixed bag. Quite enjoyable in parts, but I'm glad to be done. Don't get the audiobook."
119,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10145524-charles-daney,5,"The love referred to is mainly for mathematics, though there is one chapter on the human-related form. The first chapters are about Frenkel's struggles to get a math education in the last years of the Soviet Union. He had to literally climb fences to get access to the best seminars and experts. Most of the book deals with his primary interest: an extremely esoteric, but important, area of current research, known as the ""Langlands Program"". I really enjoyed his presentation, since this is one of my main interests also, and this is the best ""nontechnical"" explanation I've ever seen of the subject. It made things a lot clearer for me. The basic idea is that there are very deep relationships among a number of mathematical concepts that on the surface seem quite unrelated. And besides that, there may be important applications to particle physics theory. It could turn out that a lot of why fundamental physics works the way it does is a result of mathematical relationships. Someday before too long (I hope), I can write about the Langlands Program on my math blog. It's related to stuff I've already written about there (number theory). I find that the best way to learn about new things is to write about them - as a process of explaining the subject to myself."
120,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7412717-suzie-shatarevyan,3,"Not exactly what I was expecting when I picked up this book. I've always loved math, but reading this book hasn't made me want to run and become a mathematician. Half the book reads like a memoir, which I didn't mind as I enjoy that genre, but like I said, not what I was expecting. Pure, 'non-practictal' math is impossible to grasp for the non mathematician and there's a lot of that in this book. Frenkel does try to explain using analogies, but that's not always possible. In one instance, when referring to a formula he wrote, he concedes that maybe only 10 or 12 people in the entire world can understand it. Not even math students will get it! On the other hand, I have become familiarized with a lot of math theories that is being studied in the last 50 years, so I'm still glad I read this book. It's obvious Frenkel has a deep passion for his field. You have to be extremely passionate to devote years and years looking for discoveries and connections in things that seem unrelated. This is still pretty accessible and if you want to see math like you've never seen in the classroom, give it a shot. Definitely mind-expanding."
121,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67447577-joseph-schrock,4,"This book was tough reading for me. I'm a mathematical hobbyist -- not a professional mathematician. This book discussed lots of things concerning which I had zero knowledge. It dealt with groups, symmetries, topology, etc. All of those are (for the most part) beyond my level of training. I've gotten moderately far into elementary number theory -- dealing with modular arithmetic, encryption, and even some into quadratic reciprocity (for which I've not managed to master the proofs). Frenkel's book might be a good book for a professional mathematician, but laymen will find it tough going -- except for the biographical aspects of the book, which are very nicely written. As for myself, if I'd known how tough this book is, I would likely not have bought it. But then, I'm not a professional mathematician or mathematics student. "

Now this engages reader and encourages readers to hold on when Math part kicks in.I would suggest the book to second year undergraduates specially who are reading discrete mathematics for the first time. The works of author will give the idea about applications of the subject.
123,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7226831-josh-friedlander,3,"There are basically two ways to write popular books on difficult topics: cut and simplify to make it accessible to anyone, or just pour in details and hope that readers will move on despite not grasping all the fine points. This book is decidedly of the second group. The author interleaves with the difficult parts a memoir of growing up a prodigy in the USSR, facing discrimination and eventually escaping to a visiting position at Harvard despite not having finished his undergrad(!) He talks about his involvement in the Langlands Program, an attempt at a sort of Grand Unified Theory of Maths, and attempts to convey the beauty and excitement he finds in it. Starting with symmetry and groups, Frenkel rapidly progresses into the heart of contemporary mathematics: Lie algebras, Riemann surfaces, elliptic curves in the complex plane, n-branes, quantum field applications of theorised supersymmetries, and much more. I would lie if I claimed to have grasped it all, but I got a lot out of following the threads in each chapter as far as I could, stopping, rereading and Wikipedia-ing. This book works best as a subjective, impassioned introduction to what mathematicians work on all day, and what might make someone want to join them."

It was also interesting to learn how apparently closely related are math and the laws of nature.Unfortunately I did not particularly enjoy lengthy chapters on particular mathematical research and results – I felt it was inconsistent with the more lyric chapters. In that sense the book didn't provide optimal reading flow for me. I also felt that the couple last chapters did not really fit well with the rest of the book and felt a bit tacky.I would've given this 2 stars, or maybe even 1 star, if not for the first several chapters."

At the end, I did enjoy reading the autobiographical parts and the maths that I could comprehend, but I would not recommend this book to just the average reader. I have a two star rating because even though it was enjoyable, the purpose of the book is very misleading. "

130,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30982871-james-f,4,"Edward Frenkel, Love and Math [2013] 306 pages [Kindle]I read this amazing book more or less by accident; I was testing the direct download link in the library catalogue and this is the book I happened to download to my Kindle. I started looking through it and the preface convinced me to read it. Frenkel is a mathematician, born in the U.S.S.R. and now at Berkeley, who is working on something called the ""Langlands Project"". He begins by discussing the fact that otherwise well-educated people who would never brag that they hated literature or art or music seem proud to say they ""hate math"", and admit they know nothing about it; and he suggests that the reason is the way it is taught. He uses the analogy, suppose you took a course in Art, and instead of showing you the works of Rembrandt and Van Gogh they spent the entire class teaching you to paint -- fences. Would you be interested in pursuing art? But this is the way that math is generally taught -- as a practical collection of tools for doing other (mostly boring) things. The ""masterpieces"" of math are never mentioned. He also points out that most of the math which is taught in high school and even the early years of college dates from the ancient Greeks or the early modern period -- current work is never mentioned; it's as if a physics course ended with the work of Galileo and Newton, and gave the impression that everything in physics was already discovered and all that was left was to use it for practical engineering. Then he goes on to talk about popular science writers, such as Stephen Hawking or Brian Greene, who present the exciting developments of contemporary work in physics for the layperson, and asks why there are so few if any popularizations of work at the frontiers of contemporary math. He warns of the political dangers of allowing a small elite to monopolize knowledge of mathematics in an age when all our lives depend more than ever before on applications of math, from the Internet to Wall Street; he suggests that a mathematically literate population would not be so easily taken in by the doubletalk of the bankers and politicians. That is the gap he is trying to fill with this book. The focus is on his own work on the Langlands Project, and like the physics books of Kip Thorne or Leonard Susskind, he includes much of his own experiences. In the first few chapters, he explains how he became interested in math as a high school student; how he was denied entry into the more prestigious schools because he was Jewish, and the official academic world in the era of the final decay of the Soviet bureaucracy was highly anti-Semitic; how he was privately mentored by some of the great Soviet mathematicians, who were opposed to anti-Semitism, including the legendary Israel Gelfand, who was himself Jewish; how he worked in private and more or less secretly on group theory, and sent his first papers abroad; how he was invited to Harvard in the first months of perestroika under Gorbachev, where he became a Visiting Professor before he had even become a grad student; and how he came in contact with the Langlands Project. After that, the book is largely a popular account of the Langlands Project itself. While popular physics books try to avoid math, a popular math book of course has to be about math, and I learned much from this book. At the beginning, his explanations are very clear, and make ideas like modulo arithmetic, finite fields, Lie groups and Riemann surfaces understandable (some of the very subjects I had trouble with in reading Penrose's The Road to Reality). Later on, the book becomes more difficult to follow and his explanations of vector spaces and representations were briefer and less clear; by the end he is mentioning things like fiber bundles and automorphic functions without any explanation at all. If we keep in mind the comparison to someone like Brian Greene, though, it is hard to fault this too much; no one expects to actually learn quantum theory or string theory from a popular science book, and we shouldn't expect to learn advanced math from a book like this -- what we want to learn is what in general it is about, what the questions are and what sort of research is going on, and he is very good at that. His observations that sets, functions and numbers have been left behind for categories, sheaves and vector spaces was interesting; something like the way classical physics gave way to quantum theory. Quantum theory and string theory are here, as the ""fourth column"" of the Langlands Program; the author has collaborated with physicist-mathematicians such as Edward Witten on the connections between the two fields. So what is the Langlands Program? Essentially, it is a program to discover patterns common to various seemingly unrelated branches of mathematics (and recently physics), in particular to relate group theory and curves over finite fields to subjects like harmonic analysis and Riemann surfaces. If you don't know what these things are -- that's evidence for his thesis. "
131,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86000064-stephanie,4,"I think I am too dumb for this book but I enjoyed what I could understand! It's clear Frenkel has a lot of infectious passion for his work, and I liked his explanations"
132,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42063497-christina,3,"Yes, most of the mathematics in this book is hard. Edward Frenkel's work is cutting-edge mathematical research, after all, with applications in quantum mechanics, so it's no walk in the park. I give him credit for even attempting to explain it to a lay audience. As he states in ""A Guide for the Reader"", you can skip the sections and chapters that deal with the math. I think most readers of this book will end up doing so at some point, mainly enjoying the biographical parts.Frenkel's point in writing this book, as he explains in the ""Preface"", is to share his love for mathematics with an audience who doesn't get to see much of its hidden beauty. He does this by taking the reader on the journey that led him to mathematics, starting with a friend of his father's who taught Frenkle about symmetries and braid groups when he was in his late teens. This sparked his lifelong passion for math, and we learn all about the obstacles thrown into his path by the Soviet system that made it next to impossible for a son of a Jew to study or work in research mathematics. Luckily, he was the right age to take advantage of Perestroika, and then the collapse of the Soviet Union, and was able to both finish his studies and find an academic position in the United States.We get introduced to the main project in Frankel's career, the Langlands Program, in chapter 8, ""Magic Numbers,"" where a lot of background is given. The Langlands Program, if finished, will link together several fields of mathematics that seem unrelated on the surface. This is difficult to do and pretty rare. The background leading up to this is wide-ranging, and Frenkle tries to simplify his explanations as much as possible, but this is where the abstract nature of advanced mathematics is probably going to confuse most of his audience. In a mere 15 pages, you get a high-level whirlwind tour of the Galois groups, how the Shimura-Taniyama-Weil conjecture was used to prove Fermat's Last Theorem, how this conjecture is a general result for finding the generating function of cubic equations (using the generating function of the Fibonacci numbers as an analogy), and how it is a special case of the Langlands Program. I had to read chapter 8 very carefully and slowly, but I got the gist of it, if not a deep understanding. By the next chapter, where he introduces Lie (pronounced ""lee"") groups and algebras, I admit I was lost.The remaining math sections left me feeling like Frenkel was Beethoven, explaining how he had composed his symphonies, while I was the novice student who had finished a basic course in music theory, and knew how to play ""Für Elise"" but not much else. While his enthusiasm for mathematics and his life's work are all obvious, I just cannot appreciate the depth or the details on the same level. I found this discouraging and more than a little frustrating, because I wanted to see the same beauty that he did. I did appreciate the journey he has taken to get to this point, and the real-life depiction of how mathematical research is actually done - sometimes painfully slowly. Perhaps after some years of study I will be able to appreciate the mathematical sections just as much as the biographical ones."
133,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5931241-jenny,2,"This author was a guest on the Colbert Report, which is when I first learned of his book. He described the concept so passionately, and he argued that mathematics has been so misunderstood because it isn't given its fair due in K-12 school curricula. Frenkel is disillusioned that the general masses don't appreciate math, and he set out to conquer our hearts with this book. He stated that this book was written specifically for people like me, laypeople who have never had the opportunity to give math a fair shake because all they learn are boring basic concepts in school and they never see the true beauty of it. He compared it to taking an art class in which you only get to paint a fence and are never actually shown the works of great artists. Fair enough, I thought. I'll give it a try.By chapter three, I realized that Edward Frenkel is a misguided genius who truly believes that laypeople could possibly understand what he is talking about. I don't sense that he is a self-righteous individual who wants to come across as ridiculously smart (he is, in fact, ridiculously smart). I think he really just doesn't get that trying to relate these concepts to people like me, who only made it through Calc A, cannot be done. Hence, large parts of the book left me absolutely lost. Even BJ, who was a math minor, said he wasn't keeping up and so he quit reading it. Consider this sentence: ""The idea of string theory is that by doing calculations in these sigma models and summing up the results over all possible Riemann surfaces E (that is, over all possible paths of the strings propagating in a fixed space-time S) we can reproduce the physics that we observe in space-time S."" Honestly, I wish this particular sentence, which I chose at random, was a stand-apart in terms of its difficulty, but the truth is that much of this book is written in this language with ten unfamiliar concepts thrown together in the same sentence, all with the assumption that we must understand what the heck he is talking about. The redeeming points of the book were the interspersed memoir portions, which were extremely interesting. Frenkel was born in the Soviet Union and endured intense antisemitism at practically every turn in his education, but still prevailed and eventually traveled to Harvard and then to UC-Berkeley with professorships. I very much loved hearing about his experiences growing up, in college, working with colleagues, and his personal excitement about solving mathematical problems. It was only that he felt the need to then delve INTO those problems with technical language that made this book a disappointment--along with the fact that I didn't feel it delivered what it originally promised.In the end, I walked away appreciating Edward Frenkel's personal story. However, I did NOT end up appreciating math anymore than I ever did before, which was precisely why I decided to read the book in the first place. Unless you're ready to skip some major portions or else you're a mathematician, I don't recommend this book to you. This book is truly written for mathematicians, not laypeople, as it was so described."
134,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28285354-ron,3,"Love and Math: The Heart of Hidden Reality by Edward FrenkelThis is the story of a young boy of 12 who loved quantum physics, but not math. When he learned that the quark was found by using math, he decided to study math. He grew up a 100 miles from Moscow and he was Jewish. He was a very bright student and when he finished public school, he went to Moscow to take the test to enter the Moscow State University but at that time MSU discriminated against the Jewish people and when Edward went to take the test, he was taken to a room by two of the testers and given an oral exam and the testers did not like the correct answers he gave to the questions, so he failed the entrance exam. Later one of the testers came to him and told him that he could get into Moscow Institute of Oil and Gas, where they also had a good applied mathematics school and even used some of the professors who taught at MSU. He was accepted to the Moscow Institute of Oil and Gas and in his second year there he solved a difficult problem and it was brought to the attention of one of the MSU top mathematician professors. He solved an even more advanced math problem that this professor gave him and he wrote his first juried math paper for the Journal of Mathematics. Soon, he received a three month invitation to learn at Harvard. He was on his way to becoming a top flight mathematician. He worked on the Langlands program to unify various branches of mathematics. Edward and other mathematicians worked to unify number theory and harmonic analysis. Frankel uses two irrational numbers to construct a system of hybrid numbers in which one term is rational and the other term is a rational multiple of the irrational numbers. These numbers are now constructed into a new numeral system called a “number field”, and they form a mathematical structure called the “Galois group” of the polynomial equation. An analysis of this Galois group can produce solutions of harmonic analysis (a more sophisticated version of the study of sines and cosines.) Frenkel and his group of mathematicians in the Langlands program are producing solutions that will tie other mathematical branches together. Edward presents these mathematical equations equal to oil paintings and sculptures exhibited in museums throughout the world. The book is well written and the explanations go a long way forward to knowing about the mathematical solutions presented. I believe you would need a bachelor of mathematics degree or equivalent in order to see the “Mona Lisa” Frenkel has presented here. "
135,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1856047-jonna-higgins-freese,5,"I can't say I understand The Langlands Program any more now than I did before, except that it has something to do with sheaves and making it possible to ""translate"" between different areas of mathematics. I also picked up that the mathematics has some real-world implications in terms of symmetry and quantum physics, which I'd already picked up on from reading _The God Particle._ Unlike many of the other reviewers, I enjoyed the way he narrated his own engagement with and love of mathematics -- before I could love math myself, I needed to understand how anyone could love it, and I felt he did a good job of showing what it's like to be a person who loves mathematics.There were several interesting quotes --Thoreau: ""We have heard about the poetry of mathematics, but very little of it has yet been sung."" (A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers, cited on p. 228 of L&M)p. 241: ""Albert Einstein wrote, 'Every one who is seriously involved in thepursuit of science becomes convinced that some spirit is manifest in the laws of the Universe -- a spirit vastly superior to that of man, and one in the face of which we with our modest powers must feel humble.' And Isaac Newton expressed his feelings this way: 'to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the seashore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.'""My dream is that one day we will all awaken to this hidden reality. We may then perhaps be able to set aside our differences and focus on the profound truths that unite us. Then, we will all be like children playing on the seashore, marveling at the dazzling beauty and harmony we discover, share, and cherish together.""And this is what I love about reading books about math and science whose content I can barely understand -- it puts my life into perspective. When I'm frustrated about a completely illogical decision at work, or asked to accomplish something without the tools to do so, or when I feel that my life is spent in entirely too much make-work that takes me away from my children, reading such books for a few minutes before bed each night puts things into a larger perspective, opens up the world so that I feel I have space to breathe again."
136,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91748031-hobart-mariner,3,"As a personal memoir, this book is a both good and a bit frustrating. As a lay introduction to the ideas behind general advanced mathematics, and in particular the Langlands program (and its ties to string and superstring theory), it is very good, if a little daunting toward the end.In the early parts, the author does a very fine job of describing the hideous antisemitism that he encountered in the Soviet Union of the 1980s and how it prevented a generation of young Jewish mathematicians from developing to their fullest. He does a good job of recounting the unfairness of the oral examinations that prevented him from attending the Moscow State University Mechanics and Mathematics Department. In particular, his losing admission over a farcically nitpicky definition of circle (""the set of all points equidistant from a fixed point"" instead of ""the set of points equidistant from a fixed point"") serves as an illustration of the utter absurdity of this system. Later on, in the United States, he and several other Russian-Jewish mathematicians are given an opportunity to get back at the antisemitic Rector of MSU and this provides a satisfying and compelling scene.The author also presents warm and personal sketches of the mentors who helped him both to learn mathematics and to escape the clutches of this oppressive system. The author, for one who showed such incredible ability so young, is admirably free of vanity regarding his career, constantly giving credit to his advisors, teachers, and fellow students. There are a few personal bits that could have used more fleshing out (in particular, when he meets Feigin's family, he mentions that he would come to become very close with them, but the reader doesn't really see this). I thought that the depiction of the life of the ""Kerosinka"" was very interesting, an applied math hub full of frustrated young pure mathematicians. I thought that Yakov Khurgin, the charismatic probabilist studying with physicians to ensure his own access to medical care, made a very sympathetic character. It was poignant when the author described leaving his paltry instructorship (obtained by Khurgin with some difficulty) at the Kerosinka behind to study at Harvard. After the author moves to the United States, the story becomes a bit less personal and instead becomes more of a purely popular scientific book. Of the first twelve chapters, several are completely given over to mathematical exposition (some without any mention of the author's personal history). Yet it felt as I read it that after the author moves to Cambridge in Chapter 13, the book became much less personal. This corresponds with the author's life becoming less contingent and unstable, and maybe as a consequence less interesting. He sketches a few scenes of adjusting to life in the United States (being overwhelmed by the choices at a supermarket, learning colloquial English by watching David Letterman, walking around in jeans with a Walkman). I can't find it now but later on he provides a single paragraph of personal history, including marriage, divorce, and moving his Russian family to the United States. I would have liked to see a bit more of this, even if it has limited bearing on the mathematical parts of the memoir. As a work of mathematical exposition for a lay audience this book is quite successful, particularly in the earlier parts. (Disclaimer: I'm an academic mathematician, although in a different field of math than the author's.) I've seen many, many descriptions of the notion of symmetry group meant for lay audiences and I think that the author's stands out in terms of clarity. His own charming initial encounter with group theory (a mathematician friend of the family showing him the links the subject has with particle physics) might not make it easier for everyone else to comprehend, but at least gives an idea that the subject has meaning outside of the abstractions of pure math. He does a very fine job explaining the notions of groups, braid groups, fundamental group, modular arithmetic, and the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. I was quite impressed with his ability to describe Galois theory in relatively low-tech terms (in particular, he employs a wonderfully evocative metaphor involving the wings of a butterfly). The scientific exposition later on (in particular the bits with supersymmetry and string theory) were a bit harder for me to digest, but that doesn't mean he didn't present them in very clear terms. The main mathematical focus of the book is the Langlands Program, which the author repeatedly refers to as a Grand Unified Theory of Math, a description that overstates things slightly (there are several major fields of mathematics that do not really fall under the umbrella of the Langlands Program). It is no surprise that the author, one of the Langlands Program's superstars, does an excellent job laying out the basic ideas behind this ambitious research program. There are good explanations of Galois theory (mentioned above) and a solid example of how modular forms tie in to the subject. A bit more said about the general idea of modular forms might have been useful, but it's possible that it would be too technical for most readers. The author perhaps overloads a metaphor concerning people in Europe and North America, but not to the detriment of the books readability. I do think that it's possible readers with a limited mathematical background will get a bit lost in these sections, because they discuss fairly airy connections between subjects that have only briefly been sketched. There is a very good discussion of Weil's ""Rosetta stone"" in Chapter 9 that provides a nice backbone for all of the Langlands Program discussion. The last chapter, which contains a description of the author's screenplay (The Two-Body Problem) and short film (Rites of Love and Math), felt a bit disconnected from the rest of the book. His description of the screenwriting process is interesting and gives him the opportunity to credit yet another mentor. When he discusses the film-making process he employs a reconstructed dialogue with a French director which seems a bit artificial (similar to several other dialogues in the book). The film, which features a mathematician writing a powerful formula on the body of a woman, seems half-baked in its concept, although its clear that it means quite a lot to the author. It's a bit hard to see how this artsy, somewhat pretentious production is the best way to make someone feel the importance of math, when the author himself has done a good job in his earlier chapters making the reader feel the urgency of his initial mathematical work. A short film about a young Jewish mathematician in the Soviet Union trying with all his energy to get into MSU, prove a theorem, break into a lecture hall, etc. would be much more compelling and get across the feeling of doing math much better, in my opinion. He leaves out any mention of the minor controversy that the film provoked among feminist circles, instead offering platitudes like ""it's all in the eye of the bholder."" This section is larded with quotations from Thoreau, Einstein, etc, and overall is a bit flabby and formless in comparison with the rest of the book. Sort of disappointing that he chose to end on this note. "
137,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11253338-andrew,3,"This book was much more enjoyable when I gave up trying to understand.The author is clearly knowledgeable about mathematics. He is also very very passionate.The difficulty lies in informing the rest of us about his passion. A Nobel Laureate in Physics claims this book is ""very readable."" Which is great news, except I am not a Nobel Laureate in the realm Frenkel's work deals with.This is the struggle he faces: Mathematics is far larger and deeper than most people encounter. We are taught from a young age that math is ugly and mostly esoteric. Trying to overcome that by bringing up ideas that mean absolutely nothing to those who have not studied Algebraic Symmetries, Modular Forms, and Reimannian Surfaces is not effective.HOWEVER, when I accepted that I didn't have a clue what he was talking about, and chose to pay attention to the links between those ideas (which was his purpose), life got easier.The purpose of this book isn't to teach the reader mathematics, but to show how various ideas in mathematics are related, to the surprise of the rest of us. Math is about exotic connections and powerful generalizations, not calculation. In the 17th Chapter, Dr. Frenkel writes ""But my point is not for you to learn them all. Rather, I want to indicate the logical connections between these objects and show the creative process of scientists studying them: what drives them, how they learn from each other, how the knowledge they acquire is used to advance our understanding of the key questions.""THAT should have been in the introduction, alongside the anecdote of drunks and fractions. It would have made the rest SO MUCH easier. If the reader begins with that idea, then the book is wonderful. Math is beautiful, not because it is useful, but because it is the art of the universe itself. A famous sculptor (I believe it was Michelangelo) once said that the statue was already in the marble, he just discovered it. Many mathematicians feel that they do not create math, they find the rules that were already there. This book does a great job demonstrating that concept. Provided you ignore the footnotes and don't try to understand the math he is using to present this idea."
138,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3016981-girish,3,"There is a wave of ""pop-math"" books aimed at the interested amateur, and Edward Frenkel's memoir/masturbatory ode to math is a whirlwind tour of his life and research interests. Frenkel tries to acclimate the reader to the mathematical castle in the sky by attempting to avoid jargon and using commonplace examples to elucidate mathematical concepts (e.g. the ""symmetrical circle group"" as an example of a group).My main complaint is that I don't know who this book is for. I got out of what I wanted (and expected) - an increased appreciation for the thought patterns around math, a birds eye view of the Langland's Program, some interesting succinct definitions of mathematical concepts, and some cool visualizations. The autobiographical tidbits were interesting, but for orthogonal reasons (one of my coworkers is Russian Jewish and that got me interested in Frenkel's story; not to mention just how wrong what happened to him was).You won't learn any math from this book. It's an interesting foray into the emotional connection to math, so even though one of Frenkel's explicit goals is to demystify the intricate edifice of theory that is the Langland's Program, I'd say he failed in that endeavor. I suppose for the right person who really thinks of mathematics as SAT-style word problems, then it might be incredibly interesting to learn that it's much more artistic, revelatory, and exploratory.I'll note that Frenkel makes a couple claims in this book. First, the implicit claim that mathematical discoveries should be elevated in stature and aesthetic to the pyramids or hanging gardens, and second, that pure mathematical research is valuable but that we can't always perceive the applications immediately. I love #1 and hope that happens. #2 requires a more nuanced look, especially if it's used as justification for any and all theoretical mathematical research. Most math research, is (while beautiful/curious/amazing) useless.Mathematics used to occupy the highest stage of the cultural aristocracy as late as the 1800s, I wonder if it's time for a cultural resurgence. The gods of social status are fickle, so who knows? Math may become cool. If that's to be, than a broader appreciation for its beauty is necessary. "
139,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1849937-yofish,3,"Really 3.5.Written by a mathematician whose stated aim is to get his readers to understand what math is *really* about (as opposed to what one learns in school). The guy has had an interesting life. He was born in the USSR, and couldn't get into the ""right"" college (MGU) for math because he's Jewish. But he's able to muddle through, thanks to the large population of Jewish (and non-Jewish) mathematicians in Moscow who are used to getting around this exact problem. He's a really good mathematician and gets published and so on; but then he graduates and has the same problem---he can't get into a graduate school in the USSR because he's Jewish. Fortunately, he's just exactly the right age, and perestroika is starting, so when he gets invited to Harvard, he can go. (And eventually when he's visiting professorship is up, Harvard lets him be demoted to graduate student so that he can get his Ph.D.) While he was giving the more biographical story, I was pretty interested. But remember that his stated purpose was to introduce his math (the Langlands Program) to the layman. I can't really say whether he succeeded, as I skimmed through most of it. Not that I couldn't have understood (probably)---after all, I am a mathematician. The thing is, though, that if I was interested in that particular math, I would have studied it in grad school. The writing is a little choppy, which is surely understandable as English is his second language. But the editing is pretty poor, too---there seemed to be several places where he repeated himself without saying ""as I mentioned before"" or something similar. That was a little weird. He also seemed a little full of himself at times. There was a particular story, during his first year at Harvard, where the head of the dept of MGU is invited to MIT. That was (apparently) controversial at the time, as he wasn't supposed to be much of a mathematician, and he apparently was overseeing the rejection of Jews. There's sort of a public confrontation between him and the author. It was an interesting story--I'm a little surprised that I hadn't heard it before, as it happened while I was in grad school, and it's the kind of thing I might have noticed."
140,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18370648-mishehu,3,"Author writes, ""...we, mathematicians, need to do a better job of unlocking the power and beauty of our subject to a wider audience."" Alas, he himself resoundingly fails to do so. 5 stars for the autobiographical material in this book. The author's personal story -- and his mathematical biography -- are quite interesting. 1.5 stars for the exposition of mathematical ideas. Whatever pretense the author may have to being a math popularizer, he has many miles to travel in developing his expository chops before he can count himself among those of his colleagues who do this sort of thing well. I recently finished reading the second of Brian Greene's masterful books on cosmology -- books that are pitched to a highly interested readership willing to put in a serious readerly effort. Occasionally, in his books, Greene elaborates certain ideas in footnotes that are expressly written for ""mathematically inclined readers."" Nearly all of Frenkel's math discussion (in both the text and the footnotes of the book in review) are, whatever anyone may claim to the contrary, pitched to mathematically inclined readers. A few chapters in and the going is pretty much impossible for the lay reader. The best I can say about Frenkel's skills as a pop math expositor is that he did manage to convey an impression of what his mathematical research is about, of why it matters, and of why it's fascinating/inspiring. So, though I understood very little of the book, I did get something out of it (not simply insights into the author's personal story). But the investment of my time was poorly paid. All that said, Frenkel writes well, and his work really IS quite fascinating. I hope he'll continue to develop his pop writing skills, and I hope that future editors/publishers of his (and other first time pop math/sci authors) will give some thought to the target audience of books like these before they let manuscripts go to press."
141,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24055618-noah,5," Non-fiction books generally explain something that is true, or at least true for the author, about a particular topic. They can range from stories about people’s lives to discoveries that have been made, as well as pure factual information. One might expect non-fiction books to be purely facts and not memoirs, but that isn’t always the case. What surprised me about the book Love and Math is that this book was laid out in a different format that what I would expect from most non-fiction books. It’s laid out more like a novel, with chapters and memoirs and such. Love and Math by Edward Frenkel is a great nonfiction book mainly focusing on the symmetry groups in math of SO(3) and SO(n). Love and Math starts by easing the reader into advanced mathematics with the use of diagrams and symmetry, then gets into some more advanced ideas such as symmetry groups for higher dimensions. Love and Math is part thoughtful memoir, and part math textbook. Edward Frenkel mixes these two things perfectly to make an enticing book that just makes you want to read more. One of the main things that helped make the book so good was that Edward Frenkel had such an amazing childhood, he met famous mathematicians, he published papers, and faced tragedies such as being persecuted because he was Jewish. Edward Frenkel is an accomplished mathematician who wants to inspire other people to become mathematicians. I think that Edward Frenkel did an awesome job of explaining advanced mathematical concepts. I would give this book five stars and recommend this book to anyone who doesn’t mind curling up somewhere for a few hours while expanding their mind and having fun."
142,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4922601-deborah-flores,5,"Very enjoyable! Some reviewers seemed uncomfortable with the neither-fish-nor-fowl feel - neither pure autobiography nor pure mathematics tome - but this approach worked well for me. Rather than simply describing the solution to a problem, the author takes the time to describe the thrill of finding an elegant solution to a problem on which you'd labored for weeks or months. Rather than just describing a mathematician's theories, the author provides sufficient details to get a feel for the mathematician as a person. I found this approach an effective way to help non-mathematicians connect to math and those who study it. I picked up this book because I was interested in Dr. Frenkel's experiences as a mathematician in the twilight years of the Soviet Union. Specifically, I wanted to learn more about the author's experiences with the harrowing, Kafkaesque Moscow State University (MGU) mathematics entrance examination, through which undesirable students (read: those of Jewish descent) were deliberately weeded out and denied admittance. This is exactly what happened to the author, and I was deeply impressed by his commitment to study math at any cost as well as his later willingness to speak out publicly against about these discriminatory policies. Bravo! It was also fascinating to read about how many Soviet mathematicians and others worked with and mentored students who had experienced discrimination, and how many of these students ended up immigrating to the West soon afterwards. As to mathematics, the author clearly loves what he does, and his love is infectious. While I didn't read the book primarily for this angle, I did gain a deeper appreciation of mathematics as well as the Langlands Program. Intriguing stuff! "
143,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5664087-john,3,"Edward Frenkel’s Love and Math joins a long list of mathematical memoirs. In the last two centuries many eminent mathematicians have attempted to describe what they do, why they do it and how they came to it. Without exception they fail the “what we do” test but often brilliantly succeed on why and how they came to mathematics. Mathematics does not admit casual observers. You have to do it to fully appreciate it and doing it at the levels Frenkel describes takes gifted minds years of hard work. “There are no royal roads to geometry.” Love and Math goes further than most in this genre. It doesn't flinch when a formula really helps and the end notes are detailed and reference laden enough to get you started on learning what’s really the deal with SO(3).The best part of the book deals with the author’s start in mathematics as a precious Russian teenager. Frenkel's father was Jewish and this created problems. The Soviet Union, in addition to being a murderous totalitarian state, was overtly anti-Semitic. Scholars of Jewish descent faced “extra” hurdles when it came to university admissions and securing jobs. Frenkel’s account of his MGU exam should be required reading for every leftist imbecile in the west. It clearly shows that secondary school mathematics was taught at levels far beyond the execrable Common Core, (affirmative action), standard now being pushed in the US and that bureaucrats can always find ways to exclude even the best of “undesirables.” Love and Math is an entertaining, enlightening and important book."
144,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8824504-leslie,3,"This one was between 3 and 3.5 stars.At the beginning of the novel the author states that he hopes to accomplish two things: first he hopes to convey his love of math and then he hopes to imbue this love into the reader. These are lofty goals. He is successful in the former but falls a bit short in the latter. The novel is part memoir and is is perhaps the most interesting section of the book. Frenkle's tale of overcoming the anti Semitic policy of the Soviet Union is incredibly moving. His love of mathematics is earnestly depicted and you root for his success in the face of adversity. The other parts of the novel focus on his contribution to the Langlands program and here I found that the quality varied. The math is certainly an important contribution but he only succeeded at making about half of it accessible to me. I will openly admit that my affinity for mathematics is limited to applied math. It is important for me to understand the context behind the concepts and unfortunately certain aspects where too abstract. I could not help but compare it to Hawking's works which successfully engaged my interest and made the esoteric aspects of quantum mechanics and physics accessible to the layperson. His works made me love physics and cosmology while this book only somewhat piqued my interest. However, I recommend the book for those interested in obtaining a peek into the mysterious world of mathematics. I believe it is an important field and completely agree with the author that it should be taught in a more engaging way. "
145,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51268208-akbar-gumbira,3,"This book is not for everyone.Through this book, the author (Edward Frenkel) tried to explain a lot of mathematical concepts in layman's terms. But no matter how hard he tried, it's just not for everyone. I have no background in mathematics or physics (as a degree) and I find it hard to understand many concepts told in the book. Though I still could follow some concepts such as generating function, fermat's little and last theorem, RSA, and most of the number theory part since I thought myself in high school some high level mathematics for olympiad. But when it comes to concepts such as Langlands program, Galois group, and the links to quantum duality, I just skim-read it.But we couldn't help it. Edward is a world-renowned and gifted mathematician. He's already working on unsolved mathematical problems since he's in college, had a patent in his 4th year in college (or 5th year I forgot exactly), and invited to Harvard in his early 20's. Things that are obvious to him, and perhaps that he also thinks to others, might not be that obvious to the readers.Apart from that, I enjoyed his personal story, telling the readers about anti-semitism in Soviet Union, his first time in Harvard (spending 45 minutes at the supermarket to just buy salt), how the project went to link quantum dualities and the Langlands program, his film-making story, and how he perceives mathematics in general.Oh I found many typos! I wonder if he's in a rush to publish it?"
146,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15546947-haydee-romero,0,"I picked up this book because love and math are two words I have never used in the same sentence. Math intimidates me but reading Frenkel’s introduction he made it clear that the goal and target audience was me! A person who fears the word math, “If you think that math is hard, that you won’t get it, if you are terrified by math but at the same time curious whether there is something worth knowing- then this book is for you.” Frenkel says that math is at the heart of love and his tone and acknowledgement of his audience made me comfortable starting the book. Frenkel did a great job at breaking down COMPLEX math equations and idea BUT it was not enough for me, personally. I would have to put the book down, reread the paragraph to grasp the concept. I would but I had to think about it... a lot. Frenkel did an amazing job of integrating his personal journey as a mathematician and the math equations he explained. It was clear throughout his book that he knew his audience were not mathematicians. Frenkel would define words that may have a different meaning in the math field. He would apply theories to concepts we may know about or explain what they are used for. I have learned and gained a much greater respect to the subject of math. I would use this book as an example of how keeping who your audience is when writing a piece makes a big difference and is so important. "
147,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1357119-david,4,"1. Frenkel and his friends would scale 20 foot walls in order to sneak into mathematics lectures - this increases my faith in humanity.2. The portrait of how Frenkel and his kindred spirits were able to find one another and prosper in the USSR is absolutely fascinating. He and his friends would tear through their official duties in no time and get real work done while operating within their largely informal and much less hierarchical intellectual network. This also increases my faith in humanity.3. On a less happy note, Frenkel's experience illuminates the weaknesses of the rigid (and far too common) approach to mathematical education. It is possible to reach some individuals even when mathematical concepts are taught as pure abstractions - you can reach people who focus intensely on discreet tasks and who follow instructions first and ask questions later. Others, however, learn through a much more context-driven approach. If you present them with a new abstract concept and fail to connect it to what they have learned before or demonstrate how it can be visualized or applied, they are going to struggle. Frenkel found wonderful mentors who helped him see math as an area to explore rather than an area where one duplicates rote instructions - I sure didn't find anyone like that, and I doubt many others do either."
148,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22906182-kat-steiner,3,"Argh, finally finished this book. Unsurprisingly, it does not work as an audiobook. Do not buy it from Audible.I think when I got it, I believed it was more of a book about mathematicians or a fictionalised autobiography, than a book about maths. It's sort of both, but there is a fair amount of actual maths (and significantly advanced maths, at that). And that's just impossible to make sense of while listening. Particularly as the narrator, Tony Craine, clearly has absolutely no idea what he is saying, so his emphasis is often totally off, or he reads things in a way that doesn't distinguish where brackets would be, so it's just impossible to follow no matter how hard you listen - there's not enough information conveyed.The story itself I really enjoyed - it was a fascinating account of education and anti-semitism in Soviet Russia, as well as great insight into the lives of professional mathematicians. I did a maths degree so I can't comment on how it would come across to the layman, but I found the actual maths a bit hard-going and uninteresting - these are difficult, complicated concepts that weren't very interesting when you can't get into either the nitty-gritty or appreciate the broader concepts.A bit of a mixed bag. Quite enjoyable in parts, but I'm glad to be done. Don't get the audiobook."
149,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10145524-charles-daney,5,"The love referred to is mainly for mathematics, though there is one chapter on the human-related form. The first chapters are about Frenkel's struggles to get a math education in the last years of the Soviet Union. He had to literally climb fences to get access to the best seminars and experts. Most of the book deals with his primary interest: an extremely esoteric, but important, area of current research, known as the ""Langlands Program"". I really enjoyed his presentation, since this is one of my main interests also, and this is the best ""nontechnical"" explanation I've ever seen of the subject. It made things a lot clearer for me. The basic idea is that there are very deep relationships among a number of mathematical concepts that on the surface seem quite unrelated. And besides that, there may be important applications to particle physics theory. It could turn out that a lot of why fundamental physics works the way it does is a result of mathematical relationships. Someday before too long (I hope), I can write about the Langlands Program on my math blog. It's related to stuff I've already written about there (number theory). I find that the best way to learn about new things is to write about them - as a process of explaining the subject to myself."
150,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7412717-suzie-shatarevyan,3,"Not exactly what I was expecting when I picked up this book. I've always loved math, but reading this book hasn't made me want to run and become a mathematician. Half the book reads like a memoir, which I didn't mind as I enjoy that genre, but like I said, not what I was expecting. Pure, 'non-practictal' math is impossible to grasp for the non mathematician and there's a lot of that in this book. Frenkel does try to explain using analogies, but that's not always possible. In one instance, when referring to a formula he wrote, he concedes that maybe only 10 or 12 people in the entire world can understand it. Not even math students will get it! On the other hand, I have become familiarized with a lot of math theories that is being studied in the last 50 years, so I'm still glad I read this book. It's obvious Frenkel has a deep passion for his field. You have to be extremely passionate to devote years and years looking for discoveries and connections in things that seem unrelated. This is still pretty accessible and if you want to see math like you've never seen in the classroom, give it a shot. Definitely mind-expanding."
151,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67447577-joseph-schrock,4,"This book was tough reading for me. I'm a mathematical hobbyist -- not a professional mathematician. This book discussed lots of things concerning which I had zero knowledge. It dealt with groups, symmetries, topology, etc. All of those are (for the most part) beyond my level of training. I've gotten moderately far into elementary number theory -- dealing with modular arithmetic, encryption, and even some into quadratic reciprocity (for which I've not managed to master the proofs). Frenkel's book might be a good book for a professional mathematician, but laymen will find it tough going -- except for the biographical aspects of the book, which are very nicely written. As for myself, if I'd known how tough this book is, I would likely not have bought it. But then, I'm not a professional mathematician or mathematics student. "

Now this engages reader and encourages readers to hold on when Math part kicks in.I would suggest the book to second year undergraduates specially who are reading discrete mathematics for the first time.

This book is decidedly of the second group. The author interleaves with the difficult parts a memoir of growing up a prodigy in the USSR, facing discrimination and eventually escaping to a visiting position at Harvard despite not having finished his undergrad(!) He talks about his involvement in the Langlands Program, an attempt at a sort of Grand Unified Theory of Maths, and attempts to convey the beauty and excitement he finds in it. Starting with symmetry and groups, Frenkel rapidly progresses into the heart of contemporary mathematics: Lie algebras, Riemann surfaces, elliptic curves in the complex plane, n-branes, quantum field applications of theorised supersymmetries, and much more. I would lie if I claimed to have grasped it all, but I got a lot out of following the threads in each chapter as far as I could, stopping, rereading and Wikipedia-ing. This book works best as a subjective, impassioned introduction to what mathematicians work on all day, and what might make someone want to join them."

In that sense the book didn't provide optimal reading flow for me. I also felt that the couple last chapters did not really fit well with the rest of the book and felt a bit tacky.I would've given this 2 stars, or maybe even 1 star, if not for the first several chapters."

Frenkel is a mathematician, born in the U.S.S.R. and now at Berkeley, who is working on something called the ""Langlands Project"". He begins by discussing the fact that otherwise well-educated people who would never brag that they hated literature or art or music seem proud to say they ""hate math"", and admit they know nothing about it; and he suggests that the reason is the way it is taught. He uses the analogy, suppose you took a course in Art, and instead of showing you the works of Rembrandt and Van Gogh they spent the entire class teaching you to paint -- fences. Would you be interested in pursuing art? But this is the way that math is generally taught -- as a practical collection of tools for doing other (mostly boring) things. The ""masterpieces"" of math are never mentioned. He also points out that most of the math which is taught in high school and even the early years of college dates from the ancient Greeks or the early modern period -- current work is never mentioned; it's as if a physics course ended with the work of Galileo and Newton, and gave the impression that everything in physics was already discovered and all that was left was to use it for practical engineering. Then he goes on to talk about popular science writers, such as Stephen Hawking or Brian Greene, who present the exciting developments of contemporary work in physics for the layperson, and asks why there are so few if any popularizations of work at the frontiers of contemporary math. He warns of the political dangers of allowing a small elite to monopolize knowledge of mathematics in an age when all our lives depend more than ever before on applications of math, from the Internet to Wall Street; he suggests that a mathematically literate population would not be so easily taken in by the doubletalk of the bankers and politicians. That is the gap he is trying to fill with this book. The focus is on his own work on the Langlands Project, and like the physics books of Kip Thorne or Leonard Susskind, he includes much of his own experiences. In the first few chapters, he explains how he became interested in math as a high school student; how he was denied entry into the more prestigious schools because he was Jewish, and the official academic world in the era of the final decay of the Soviet bureaucracy was highly anti-Semitic; how he was privately mentored by some of the great Soviet mathematicians, who were opposed to anti-Semitism, including the legendary Israel Gelfand, who was himself Jewish; how he worked in private and more or less secretly on group theory, and sent his first papers abroad; how he was invited to Harvard in the first months of perestroika under Gorbachev, where he became a Visiting Professor before he had even become a grad student; and how he came in contact with the Langlands Project. After that, the book is largely a popular account of the Langlands Project itself. While popular physics books try to avoid math, a popular math book of course has to be about math, and I learned much from this book. At the beginning, his explanations are very clear, and make ideas like modulo arithmetic, finite fields, Lie groups and Riemann surfaces understandable (some of the very subjects I had trouble with in reading Penrose's The Road to Reality). Later on, the book becomes more difficult to follow and his explanations of vector spaces and representations were briefer and less clear; by the end he is mentioning things like fiber bundles and automorphic functions without any explanation at all. If we keep in mind the comparison to someone like Brian Greene, though, it is hard to fault this too much; no one expects to actually learn quantum theory or string theory from a popular science book, and we shouldn't expect to learn advanced math from a book like this -- what we want to learn is what in general it is about, what the questions are and what sort of research is going on, and he is very good at that. His observations that sets, functions and numbers have been left behind for categories, sheaves and vector spaces was interesting; something like the way classical physics gave way to quantum theory. Quantum theory and string theory are here, as the ""fourth column"" of the Langlands Program; the author has collaborated with physicist-mathematicians such as Edward Witten on the connections between the two fields. So what is the Langlands Program? Essentially, it is a program to discover patterns common to various seemingly unrelated branches of mathematics (and recently physics), in particular to relate group theory and curves over finite fields to subjects like harmonic analysis and Riemann surfaces. If you don't know what these things are -- that's evidence for his thesis. "
161,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86000064-stephanie,4,"I think I am too dumb for this book but I enjoyed what I could understand! It's clear Frenkel has a lot of infectious passion for his work, and I liked his explanations"
162,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42063497-christina,3,"Yes, most of the mathematics in this book is hard. Edward Frenkel's work is cutting-edge mathematical research, after all, with applications in quantum mechanics, so it's no walk in the park. I give him credit for even attempting to explain it to a lay audience. As he states in ""A Guide for the Reader"", you can skip the sections and chapters that deal with the math. I think most readers of this book will end up doing so at some point, mainly enjoying the biographical parts.Frenkel's point in writing this book, as he explains in the ""Preface"", is to share his love for mathematics with an audience who doesn't get to see much of its hidden beauty. He does this by taking the reader on the journey that led him to mathematics, starting with a friend of his father's who taught Frenkle about symmetries and braid groups when he was in his late teens. This sparked his lifelong passion for math, and we learn all about the obstacles thrown into his path by the Soviet system that made it next to impossible for a son of a Jew to study or work in research mathematics. Luckily, he was the right age to take advantage of Perestroika, and then the collapse of the Soviet Union, and was able to both finish his studies and find an academic position in the United States.We get introduced to the main project in Frankel's career, the Langlands Program, in chapter 8, ""Magic Numbers,"" where a lot of background is given. The Langlands Program, if finished, will link together several fields of mathematics that seem unrelated on the surface. This is difficult to do and pretty rare. The background leading up to this is wide-ranging, and Frenkle tries to simplify his explanations as much as possible, but this is where the abstract nature of advanced mathematics is probably going to confuse most of his audience. In a mere 15 pages, you get a high-level whirlwind tour of the Galois groups, how the Shimura-Taniyama-Weil conjecture was used to prove Fermat's Last Theorem, how this conjecture is a general result for finding the generating function of cubic equations (using the generating function of the Fibonacci numbers as an analogy), and how it is a special case of the Langlands Program. I had to read chapter 8 very carefully and slowly, but I got the gist of it, if not a deep understanding. By the next chapter, where he introduces Lie (pronounced ""lee"") groups and algebras, I admit I was lost.The remaining math sections left me feeling like Frenkel was Beethoven, explaining how he had composed his symphonies, while I was the novice student who had finished a basic course in music theory, and knew how to play ""Für Elise"" but not much else. While his enthusiasm for mathematics and his life's work are all obvious, I just cannot appreciate the depth or the details on the same level. I found this discouraging and more than a little frustrating, because I wanted to see the same beauty that he did. I did appreciate the journey he has taken to get to this point, and the real-life depiction of how mathematical research is actually done - sometimes painfully slowly. Perhaps after some years of study I will be able to appreciate the mathematical sections just as much as the biographical ones."
163,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5931241-jenny,2,"This author was a guest on the Colbert Report, which is when I first learned of his book. He described the concept so passionately, and he argued that mathematics has been so misunderstood because it isn't given its fair due in K-12 school curricula. Frenkel is disillusioned that the general masses don't appreciate math, and he set out to conquer our hearts with this book. He stated that this book was written specifically for people like me, laypeople who have never had the opportunity to give math a fair shake because all they learn are boring basic concepts in school and they never see the true beauty of it. He compared it to taking an art class in which you only get to paint a fence and are never actually shown the works of great artists. Fair enough, I thought. I'll give it a try.By chapter three, I realized that Edward Frenkel is a misguided genius who truly believes that laypeople could possibly understand what he is talking about. I don't sense that he is a self-righteous individual who wants to come across as ridiculously smart (he is, in fact, ridiculously smart). I think he really just doesn't get that trying to relate these concepts to people like me, who only made it through Calc A, cannot be done. Hence, large parts of the book left me absolutely lost. Even BJ, who was a math minor, said he wasn't keeping up and so he quit reading it. Consider this sentence: ""The idea of string theory is that by doing calculations in these sigma models and summing up the results over all possible Riemann surfaces E (that is, over all possible paths of the strings propagating in a fixed space-time S) we can reproduce the physics that we observe in space-time S."" Honestly, I wish this particular sentence, which I chose at random, was a stand-apart in terms of its difficulty, but the truth is that much of this book is written in this language with ten unfamiliar concepts thrown together in the same sentence, all with the assumption that we must understand what the heck he is talking about. The redeeming points of the book were the interspersed memoir portions, which were extremely interesting. Frenkel was born in the Soviet Union and endured intense antisemitism at practically every turn in his education, but still prevailed and eventually traveled to Harvard and then to UC-Berkeley with professorships. I very much loved hearing about his experiences growing up, in college, working with colleagues, and his personal excitement about solving mathematical problems. It was only that he felt the need to then delve INTO those problems with technical language that made this book a disappointment--along with the fact that I didn't feel it delivered what it originally promised.In the end, I walked away appreciating Edward Frenkel's personal story. However, I did NOT end up appreciating math anymore than I ever did before, which was precisely why I decided to read the book in the first place. Unless you're ready to skip some major portions or else you're a mathematician, I don't recommend this book to you. This book is truly written for mathematicians, not laypeople, as it was so described."
164,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28285354-ron,3,"Love and Math: The Heart of Hidden Reality by Edward FrenkelThis is the story of a young boy of 12 who loved quantum physics, but not math. When he learned that the quark was found by using math, he decided to study math. He grew up a 100 miles from Moscow and he was Jewish. He was a very bright student and when he finished public school, he went to Moscow to take the test to enter the Moscow State University but at that time MSU discriminated against the Jewish people and when Edward went to take the test, he was taken to a room by two of the testers and given an oral exam and the testers did not like the correct answers he gave to the questions, so he failed the entrance exam. Later one of the testers came to him and told him that he could get into Moscow Institute of Oil and Gas, where they also had a good applied mathematics school and even used some of the professors who taught at MSU. He was accepted to the Moscow Institute of Oil and Gas and in his second year there he solved a difficult problem and it was brought to the attention of one of the MSU top mathematician professors. He solved an even more advanced math problem that this professor gave him and he wrote his first juried math paper for the Journal of Mathematics. Soon, he received a three month invitation to learn at Harvard. He was on his way to becoming a top flight mathematician. He worked on the Langlands program to unify various branches of mathematics. Edward and other mathematicians worked to unify number theory and harmonic analysis. Frankel uses two irrational numbers to construct a system of hybrid numbers in which one term is rational and the other term is a rational multiple of the irrational numbers. These numbers are now constructed into a new numeral system called a “number field”, and they form a mathematical structure called the “Galois group” of the polynomial equation. An analysis of this Galois group can produce solutions of harmonic analysis (a more sophisticated version of the study of sines and cosines.) Frenkel and his group of mathematicians in the Langlands program are producing solutions that will tie other mathematical branches together. Edward presents these mathematical equations equal to oil paintings and sculptures exhibited in museums throughout the world. The book is well written and the explanations go a long way forward to knowing about the mathematical solutions presented. I believe you would need a bachelor of mathematics degree or equivalent in order to see the “Mona Lisa” Frenkel has presented here. "
165,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1856047-jonna-higgins-freese,5,"I can't say I understand The Langlands Program any more now than I did before, except that it has something to do with sheaves and making it possible to ""translate"" between different areas of mathematics. I also picked up that the mathematics has some real-world implications in terms of symmetry and quantum physics, which I'd already picked up on from reading _The God Particle._ Unlike many of the other reviewers, I enjoyed the way he narrated his own engagement with and love of mathematics -- before I could love math myself, I needed to understand how anyone could love it, and I felt he did a good job of showing what it's like to be a person who loves mathematics.There were several interesting quotes --Thoreau: ""We have heard about the poetry of mathematics, but very little of it has yet been sung."" (A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers, cited on p. 228 of L&M)p. 241: ""Albert Einstein wrote, 'Every one who is seriously involved in thepursuit of science becomes convinced that some spirit is manifest in the laws of the Universe -- a spirit vastly superior to that of man, and one in the face of which we with our modest powers must feel humble.' And Isaac Newton expressed his feelings this way: 'to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the seashore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.'""My dream is that one day we will all awaken to this hidden reality. We may then perhaps be able to set aside our differences and focus on the profound truths that unite us. Then, we will all be like children playing on the seashore, marveling at the dazzling beauty and harmony we discover, share, and cherish together.""And this is what I love about reading books about math and science whose content I can barely understand -- it puts my life into perspective. When I'm frustrated about a completely illogical decision at work, or asked to accomplish something without the tools to do so, or when I feel that my life is spent in entirely too much make-work that takes me away from my children, reading such books for a few minutes before bed each night puts things into a larger perspective, opens up the world so that I feel I have space to breathe again."
166,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91748031-hobart-mariner,3,"As a personal memoir, this book is a both good and a bit frustrating. As a lay introduction to the ideas behind general advanced mathematics, and in particular the Langlands program (and its ties to string and superstring theory), it is very good, if a little daunting toward the end.In the early parts, the author does a very fine job of describing the hideous antisemitism that he encountered in the Soviet Union of the 1980s and how it prevented a generation of young Jewish mathematicians from developing to their fullest. He does a good job of recounting the unfairness of the oral examinations that prevented him from attending the Moscow State University Mechanics and Mathematics Department. In particular, his losing admission over a farcically nitpicky definition of circle (""the set of all points equidistant from a fixed point"" instead of ""the set of points equidistant from a fixed point"") serves as an illustration of the utter absurdity of this system. Later on, in the United States, he and several other Russian-Jewish mathematicians are given an opportunity to get back at the antisemitic Rector of MSU and this provides a satisfying and compelling scene.The author also presents warm and personal sketches of the mentors who helped him both to learn mathematics and to escape the clutches of this oppressive system. The author, for one who showed such incredible ability so young, is admirably free of vanity regarding his career, constantly giving credit to his advisors, teachers, and fellow students. There are a few personal bits that could have used more fleshing out (in particular, when he meets Feigin's family, he mentions that he would come to become very close with them, but the reader doesn't really see this). I thought that the depiction of the life of the ""Kerosinka"" was very interesting, an applied math hub full of frustrated young pure mathematicians. I thought that Yakov Khurgin, the charismatic probabilist studying with physicians to ensure his own access to medical care, made a very sympathetic character. It was poignant when the author described leaving his paltry instructorship (obtained by Khurgin with some difficulty) at the Kerosinka behind to study at Harvard. After the author moves to the United States, the story becomes a bit less personal and instead becomes more of a purely popular scientific book. Of the first twelve chapters, several are completely given over to mathematical exposition (some without any mention of the author's personal history). Yet it felt as I read it that after the author moves to Cambridge in Chapter 13, the book became much less personal. This corresponds with the author's life becoming less contingent and unstable, and maybe as a consequence less interesting. He sketches a few scenes of adjusting to life in the United States (being overwhelmed by the choices at a supermarket, learning colloquial English by watching David Letterman, walking around in jeans with a Walkman). I can't find it now but later on he provides a single paragraph of personal history, including marriage, divorce, and moving his Russian family to the United States. I would have liked to see a bit more of this, even if it has limited bearing on the mathematical parts of the memoir. As a work of mathematical exposition for a lay audience this book is quite successful, particularly in the earlier parts. (Disclaimer: I'm an academic mathematician, although in a different field of math than the author's.) I've seen many, many descriptions of the notion of symmetry group meant for lay audiences and I think that the author's stands out in terms of clarity. His own charming initial encounter with group theory (a mathematician friend of the family showing him the links the subject has with particle physics) might not make it easier for everyone else to comprehend, but at least gives an idea that the subject has meaning outside of the abstractions of pure math. He does a very fine job explaining the notions of groups, braid groups, fundamental group, modular arithmetic, and the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. I was quite impressed with his ability to describe Galois theory in relatively low-tech terms (in particular, he employs a wonderfully evocative metaphor involving the wings of a butterfly). The scientific exposition later on (in particular the bits with supersymmetry and string theory) were a bit harder for me to digest, but that doesn't mean he didn't present them in very clear terms. The main mathematical focus of the book is the Langlands Program, which the author repeatedly refers to as a Grand Unified Theory of Math, a description that overstates things slightly (there are several major fields of mathematics that do not really fall under the umbrella of the Langlands Program). It is no surprise that the author, one of the Langlands Program's superstars, does an excellent job laying out the basic ideas behind this ambitious research program. There are good explanations of Galois theory (mentioned above) and a solid example of how modular forms tie in to the subject. A bit more said about the general idea of modular forms might have been useful, but it's possible that it would be too technical for most readers. The author perhaps overloads a metaphor concerning people in Europe and North America, but not to the detriment of the books readability. I do think that it's possible readers with a limited mathematical background will get a bit lost in these sections, because they discuss fairly airy connections between subjects that have only briefly been sketched. There is a very good discussion of Weil's ""Rosetta stone"" in Chapter 9 that provides a nice backbone for all of the Langlands Program discussion. The last chapter, which contains a description of the author's screenplay (The Two-Body Problem) and short film (Rites of Love and Math), felt a bit disconnected from the rest of the book. His description of the screenwriting process is interesting and gives him the opportunity to credit yet another mentor. When he discusses the film-making process he employs a reconstructed dialogue with a French director which seems a bit artificial (similar to several other dialogues in the book). The film, which features a mathematician writing a powerful formula on the body of a woman, seems half-baked in its concept, although its clear that it means quite a lot to the author. It's a bit hard to see how this artsy, somewhat pretentious production is the best way to make someone feel the importance of math, when the author himself has done a good job in his earlier chapters making the reader feel the urgency of his initial mathematical work. A short film about a young Jewish mathematician in the Soviet Union trying with all his energy to get into MSU, prove a theorem, break into a lecture hall, etc. would be much more compelling and get across the feeling of doing math much better, in my opinion. He leaves out any mention of the minor controversy that the film provoked among feminist circles, instead offering platitudes like ""it's all in the eye of the bholder."" This section is larded with quotations from Thoreau, Einstein, etc, and overall is a bit flabby and formless in comparison with the rest of the book. Sort of disappointing that he chose to end on this note. "
167,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11253338-andrew,3,"This book was much more enjoyable when I gave up trying to understand.The author is clearly knowledgeable about mathematics. He is also very very passionate.The difficulty lies in informing the rest of us about his passion. A Nobel Laureate in Physics claims this book is ""very readable."" Which is great news, except I am not a Nobel Laureate in the realm Frenkel's work deals with.This is the struggle he faces: Mathematics is far larger and deeper than most people encounter. We are taught from a young age that math is ugly and mostly esoteric. Trying to overcome that by bringing up ideas that mean absolutely nothing to those who have not studied Algebraic Symmetries, Modular Forms, and Reimannian Surfaces is not effective.HOWEVER, when I accepted that I didn't have a clue what he was talking about, and chose to pay attention to the links between those ideas (which was his purpose), life got easier.The purpose of this book isn't to teach the reader mathematics, but to show how various ideas in mathematics are related, to the surprise of the rest of us. Math is about exotic connections and powerful generalizations, not calculation. In the 17th Chapter, Dr. Frenkel writes ""But my point is not for you to learn them all. Rather, I want to indicate the logical connections between these objects and show the creative process of scientists studying them: what drives them, how they learn from each other, how the knowledge they acquire is used to advance our understanding of the key questions.""THAT should have been in the introduction, alongside the anecdote of drunks and fractions. It would have made the rest SO MUCH easier. If the reader begins with that idea, then the book is wonderful. Math is beautiful, not because it is useful, but because it is the art of the universe itself. A famous sculptor (I believe it was Michelangelo) once said that the statue was already in the marble, he just discovered it. Many mathematicians feel that they do not create math, they find the rules that were already there. This book does a great job demonstrating that concept. Provided you ignore the footnotes and don't try to understand the math he is using to present this idea."
168,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3016981-girish,3,"There is a wave of ""pop-math"" books aimed at the interested amateur, and Edward Frenkel's memoir/masturbatory ode to math is a whirlwind tour of his life and research interests. Frenkel tries to acclimate the reader to the mathematical castle in the sky by attempting to avoid jargon and using commonplace examples to elucidate mathematical concepts (e.g. the ""symmetrical circle group"" as an example of a group).My main complaint is that I don't know who this book is for. I got out of what I wanted (and expected) - an increased appreciation for the thought patterns around math, a birds eye view of the Langland's Program, some interesting succinct definitions of mathematical concepts, and some cool visualizations. The autobiographical tidbits were interesting, but for orthogonal reasons (one of my coworkers is Russian Jewish and that got me interested in Frenkel's story; not to mention just how wrong what happened to him was).You won't learn any math from this book. It's an interesting foray into the emotional connection to math, so even though one of Frenkel's explicit goals is to demystify the intricate edifice of theory that is the Langland's Program, I'd say he failed in that endeavor. I suppose for the right person who really thinks of mathematics as SAT-style word problems, then it might be incredibly interesting to learn that it's much more artistic, revelatory, and exploratory.I'll note that Frenkel makes a couple claims in this book. First, the implicit claim that mathematical discoveries should be elevated in stature and aesthetic to the pyramids or hanging gardens, and second, that pure mathematical research is valuable but that we can't always perceive the applications immediately. I love #1 and hope that happens. #2 requires a more nuanced look, especially if it's used as justification for any and all theoretical mathematical research. Most math research, is (while beautiful/curious/amazing) useless.Mathematics used to occupy the highest stage of the cultural aristocracy as late as the 1800s, I wonder if it's time for a cultural resurgence. The gods of social status are fickle, so who knows? Math may become cool. If that's to be, than a broader appreciation for its beauty is necessary. "
169,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1849937-yofish,3,"Really 3.5.Written by a mathematician whose stated aim is to get his readers to understand what math is *really* about (as opposed to what one learns in school). The guy has had an interesting life. He was born in the USSR, and couldn't get into the ""right"" college (MGU) for math because he's Jewish. But he's able to muddle through, thanks to the large population of Jewish (and non-Jewish) mathematicians in Moscow who are used to getting around this exact problem. He's a really good mathematician and gets published and so on; but then he graduates and has the same problem---he can't get into a graduate school in the USSR because he's Jewish. Fortunately, he's just exactly the right age, and perestroika is starting, so when he gets invited to Harvard, he can go. (And eventually when he's visiting professorship is up, Harvard lets him be demoted to graduate student so that he can get his Ph.D.) While he was giving the more biographical story, I was pretty interested. But remember that his stated purpose was to introduce his math (the Langlands Program) to the layman. I can't really say whether he succeeded, as I skimmed through most of it. Not that I couldn't have understood (probably)---after all, I am a mathematician. The thing is, though, that if I was interested in that particular math, I would have studied it in grad school. The writing is a little choppy, which is surely understandable as English is his second language. But the editing is pretty poor, too---there seemed to be several places where he repeated himself without saying ""as I mentioned before"" or something similar. That was a little weird. He also seemed a little full of himself at times. There was a particular story, during his first year at Harvard, where the head of the dept of MGU is invited to MIT. That was (apparently) controversial at the time, as he wasn't supposed to be much of a mathematician, and he apparently was overseeing the rejection of Jews. There's sort of a public confrontation between him and the author. It was an interesting story--I'm a little surprised that I hadn't heard it before, as it happened while I was in grad school, and it's the kind of thing I might have noticed."
170,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18370648-mishehu,3,"Author writes, ""...we, mathematicians, need to do a better job of unlocking the power and beauty of our subject to a wider audience."" Alas, he himself resoundingly fails to do so. 5 stars for the autobiographical material in this book. The author's personal story -- and his mathematical biography -- are quite interesting. 1.5 stars for the exposition of mathematical ideas. Whatever pretense the author may have to being a math popularizer, he has many miles to travel in developing his expository chops before he can count himself among those of his colleagues who do this sort of thing well. I recently finished reading the second of Brian Greene's masterful books on cosmology -- books that are pitched to a highly interested readership willing to put in a serious readerly effort. Occasionally, in his books, Greene elaborates certain ideas in footnotes that are expressly written for ""mathematically inclined readers."" Nearly all of Frenkel's math discussion (in both the text and the footnotes of the book in review) are, whatever anyone may claim to the contrary, pitched to mathematically inclined readers. A few chapters in and the going is pretty much impossible for the lay reader. The best I can say about Frenkel's skills as a pop math expositor is that he did manage to convey an impression of what his mathematical research is about, of why it matters, and of why it's fascinating/inspiring. So, though I understood very little of the book, I did get something out of it (not simply insights into the author's personal story). But the investment of my time was poorly paid. All that said, Frenkel writes well, and his work really IS quite fascinating. I hope he'll continue to develop his pop writing skills, and I hope that future editors/publishers of his (and other first time pop math/sci authors) will give some thought to the target audience of books like these before they let manuscripts go to press."
171,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24055618-noah,5," Non-fiction books generally explain something that is true, or at least true for the author, about a particular topic. They can range from stories about people’s lives to discoveries that have been made, as well as pure factual information. One might expect non-fiction books to be purely facts and not memoirs, but that isn’t always the case. What surprised me about the book Love and Math is that this book was laid out in a different format that what I would expect from most non-fiction books. It’s laid out more like a novel, with chapters and memoirs and such. Love and Math by Edward Frenkel is a great nonfiction book mainly focusing on the symmetry groups in math of SO(3) and SO(n). Love and Math starts by easing the reader into advanced mathematics with the use of diagrams and symmetry, then gets into some more advanced ideas such as symmetry groups for higher dimensions. Love and Math is part thoughtful memoir, and part math textbook. Edward Frenkel mixes these two things perfectly to make an enticing book that just makes you want to read more. One of the main things that helped make the book so good was that Edward Frenkel had such an amazing childhood, he met famous mathematicians, he published papers, and faced tragedies such as being persecuted because he was Jewish. Edward Frenkel is an accomplished mathematician who wants to inspire other people to become mathematicians. I think that Edward Frenkel did an awesome job of explaining advanced mathematical concepts. I would give this book five stars and recommend this book to anyone who doesn’t mind curling up somewhere for a few hours while expanding their mind and having fun."
172,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4922601-deborah-flores,5,"Very enjoyable! Some reviewers seemed uncomfortable with the neither-fish-nor-fowl feel - neither pure autobiography nor pure mathematics tome - but this approach worked well for me. Rather than simply describing the solution to a problem, the author takes the time to describe the thrill of finding an elegant solution to a problem on which you'd labored for weeks or months. Rather than just describing a mathematician's theories, the author provides sufficient details to get a feel for the mathematician as a person. I found this approach an effective way to help non-mathematicians connect to math and those who study it. I picked up this book because I was interested in Dr. Frenkel's experiences as a mathematician in the twilight years of the Soviet Union. Specifically, I wanted to learn more about the author's experiences with the harrowing, Kafkaesque Moscow State University (MGU) mathematics entrance examination, through which undesirable students (read: those of Jewish descent) were deliberately weeded out and denied admittance. This is exactly what happened to the author, and I was deeply impressed by his commitment to study math at any cost as well as his later willingness to speak out publicly against about these discriminatory policies. Bravo! It was also fascinating to read about how many Soviet mathematicians and others worked with and mentored students who had experienced discrimination, and how many of these students ended up immigrating to the West soon afterwards. As to mathematics, the author clearly loves what he does, and his love is infectious. While I didn't read the book primarily for this angle, I did gain a deeper appreciation of mathematics as well as the Langlands Program. Intriguing stuff! "
173,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5664087-john,3,"Edward Frenkel’s Love and Math joins a long list of mathematical memoirs. In the last two centuries many eminent mathematicians have attempted to describe what they do, why they do it and how they came to it. Without exception they fail the “what we do” test but often brilliantly succeed on why and how they came to mathematics. Mathematics does not admit casual observers. You have to do it to fully appreciate it and doing it at the levels Frenkel describes takes gifted minds years of hard work. “There are no royal roads to geometry.” Love and Math goes further than most in this genre. It doesn't flinch when a formula really helps and the end notes are detailed and reference laden enough to get you started on learning what’s really the deal with SO(3).The best part of the book deals with the author’s start in mathematics as a precious Russian teenager. Frenkel's father was Jewish and this created problems. The Soviet Union, in addition to being a murderous totalitarian state, was overtly anti-Semitic. Scholars of Jewish descent faced “extra” hurdles when it came to university admissions and securing jobs. Frenkel’s account of his MGU exam should be required reading for every leftist imbecile in the west. It clearly shows that secondary school mathematics was taught at levels far beyond the execrable Common Core, (affirmative action), standard now being pushed in the US and that bureaucrats can always find ways to exclude even the best of “undesirables.” Love and Math is an entertaining, enlightening and important book."
174,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8824504-leslie,3,"This one was between 3 and 3.5 stars.At the beginning of the novel the author states that he hopes to accomplish two things: first he hopes to convey his love of math and then he hopes to imbue this love into the reader. These are lofty goals. He is successful in the former but falls a bit short in the latter. The novel is part memoir and is is perhaps the most interesting section of the book. Frenkle's tale of overcoming the anti Semitic policy of the Soviet Union is incredibly moving. His love of mathematics is earnestly depicted and you root for his success in the face of adversity. The other parts of the novel focus on his contribution to the Langlands program and here I found that the quality varied. The math is certainly an important contribution but he only succeeded at making about half of it accessible to me. I will openly admit that my affinity for mathematics is limited to applied math. It is important for me to understand the context behind the concepts and unfortunately certain aspects where too abstract. I could not help but compare it to Hawking's works which successfully engaged my interest and made the esoteric aspects of quantum mechanics and physics accessible to the layperson. His works made me love physics and cosmology while this book only somewhat piqued my interest. However, I recommend the book for those interested in obtaining a peek into the mysterious world of mathematics. I believe it is an important field and completely agree with the author that it should be taught in a more engaging way. "
175,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51268208-akbar-gumbira,3,"This book is not for everyone.Through this book, the author (Edward Frenkel) tried to explain a lot of mathematical concepts in layman's terms. But no matter how hard he tried, it's just not for everyone. I have no background in mathematics or physics (as a degree) and I find it hard to understand many concepts told in the book. Though I still could follow some concepts such as generating function, fermat's little and last theorem, RSA, and most of the number theory part since I thought myself in high school some high level mathematics for olympiad. But when it comes to concepts such as Langlands program, Galois group, and the links to quantum duality, I just skim-read it.But we couldn't help it. Edward is a world-renowned and gifted mathematician. He's already working on unsolved mathematical problems since he's in college, had a patent in his 4th year in college (or 5th year I forgot exactly), and invited to Harvard in his early 20's. Things that are obvious to him, and perhaps that he also thinks to others, might not be that obvious to the readers.Apart from that, I enjoyed his personal story, telling the readers about anti-semitism in Soviet Union, his first time in Harvard (spending 45 minutes at the supermarket to just buy salt), how the project went to link quantum dualities and the Langlands program, his film-making story, and how he perceives mathematics in general.Oh I found many typos! I wonder if he's in a rush to publish it?"
176,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15546947-haydee-romero,0,"I picked up this book because love and math are two words I have never used in the same sentence. Math intimidates me but reading Frenkel’s introduction he made it clear that the goal and target audience was me! A person who fears the word math, “If you think that math is hard, that you won’t get it, if you are terrified by math but at the same time curious whether there is something worth knowing- then this book is for you.” Frenkel says that math is at the heart of love and his tone and acknowledgement of his audience made me comfortable starting the book. Frenkel did a great job at breaking down COMPLEX math equations and idea BUT it was not enough for me, personally. I would have to put the book down, reread the paragraph to grasp the concept. I would but I had to think about it... a lot. Frenkel did an amazing job of integrating his personal journey as a mathematician and the math equations he explained. It was clear throughout his book that he knew his audience were not mathematicians. Frenkel would define words that may have a different meaning in the math field. He would apply theories to concepts we may know about or explain what they are used for. I have learned and gained a much greater respect to the subject of math. I would use this book as an example of how keeping who your audience is when writing a piece makes a big difference and is so important. "
177,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1357119-david,4,"1. Frenkel and his friends would scale 20 foot walls in order to sneak into mathematics lectures - this increases my faith in humanity.2. The portrait of how Frenkel and his kindred spirits were able to find one another and prosper in the USSR is absolutely fascinating. He and his friends would tear through their official duties in no time and get real work done while operating within their largely informal and much less hierarchical intellectual network. This also increases my faith in humanity.3. On a less happy note, Frenkel's experience illuminates the weaknesses of the rigid (and far too common) approach to mathematical education. It is possible to reach some individuals even when mathematical concepts are taught as pure abstractions - you can reach people who focus intensely on discreet tasks and who follow instructions first and ask questions later. Others, however, learn through a much more context-driven approach. If you present them with a new abstract concept and fail to connect it to what they have learned before or demonstrate how it can be visualized or applied, they are going to struggle. Frenkel found wonderful mentors who helped him see math as an area to explore rather than an area where one duplicates rote instructions - I sure didn't find anyone like that, and I doubt many others do either."
178,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22906182-kat-steiner,3,"Argh, finally finished this book. Unsurprisingly, it does not work as an audiobook. Do not buy it from Audible.I think when I got it, I believed it was more of a book about mathematicians or a fictionalised autobiography, than a book about maths. It's sort of both, but there is a fair amount of actual maths (and significantly advanced maths, at that). And that's just impossible to make sense of while listening. Particularly as the narrator, Tony Craine, clearly has absolutely no idea what he is saying, so his emphasis is often totally off, or he reads things in a way that doesn't distinguish where brackets would be, so it's just impossible to follow no matter how hard you listen - there's not enough information conveyed.The story itself I really enjoyed - it was a fascinating account of education and anti-semitism in Soviet Russia, as well as great insight into the lives of professional mathematicians. I did a maths degree so I can't comment on how it would come across to the layman, but I found the actual maths a bit hard-going and uninteresting - these are difficult, complicated concepts that weren't very interesting when you can't get into either the nitty-gritty or appreciate the broader concepts.A bit of a mixed bag. Quite enjoyable in parts, but I'm glad to be done. Don't get the audiobook."
179,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10145524-charles-daney,5,"The love referred to is mainly for mathematics, though there is one chapter on the human-related form. The first chapters are about Frenkel's struggles to get a math education in the last years of the Soviet Union. He had to literally climb fences to get access to the best seminars and experts. Most of the book deals with his primary interest: an extremely esoteric, but important, area of current research, known as the ""Langlands Program"". I really enjoyed his presentation, since this is one of my main interests also, and this is the best ""nontechnical"" explanation I've ever seen of the subject. It made things a lot clearer for me. The basic idea is that there are very deep relationships among a number of mathematical concepts that on the surface seem quite unrelated. And besides that, there may be important applications to particle physics theory. It could turn out that a lot of why fundamental physics works the way it does is a result of mathematical relationships. Someday before too long (I hope), I can write about the Langlands Program on my math blog. It's related to stuff I've already written about there (number theory). I find that the best way to learn about new things is to write about them - as a process of explaining the subject to myself."
180,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7412717-suzie-shatarevyan,3,"Not exactly what I was expecting when I picked up this book. I've always loved math, but reading this book hasn't made me want to run and become a mathematician. Half the book reads like a memoir, which I didn't mind as I enjoy that genre, but like I said, not what I was expecting. Pure, 'non-practictal' math is impossible to grasp for the non mathematician and there's a lot of that in this book. Frenkel does try to explain using analogies, but that's not always possible. In one instance, when referring to a formula he wrote, he concedes that maybe only 10 or 12 people in the entire world can understand it. Not even math students will get it! On the other hand, I have become familiarized with a lot of math theories that is being studied in the last 50 years, so I'm still glad I read this book. It's obvious Frenkel has a deep passion for his field. You have to be extremely passionate to devote years and years looking for discoveries and connections in things that seem unrelated. This is still pretty accessible and if you want to see math like you've never seen in the classroom, give it a shot. Definitely mind-expanding."
181,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67447577-joseph-schrock,4,"This book was tough reading for me. I'm a mathematical hobbyist -- not a professional mathematician. This book discussed lots of things concerning which I had zero knowledge. It dealt with groups, symmetries, topology, etc. All of those are (for the most part) beyond my level of training. I've gotten moderately far into elementary number theory -- dealing with modular arithmetic, encryption, and even some into quadratic reciprocity (for which I've not managed to master the proofs). Frenkel's book might be a good book for a professional mathematician, but laymen will find it tough going -- except for the biographical aspects of the book, which are very nicely written. As for myself, if I'd known how tough this book is, I would likely not have bought it. But then, I'm not a professional mathematician or mathematics student. "
182,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30252254-shivam-agarwal,4,Simply amazing. This is the first Math book I have read which is written in the form of biography. Now this engages reader and encourages readers to hold on when Math part kicks in.I would suggest the book to second year undergraduates specially who are reading discrete mathematics for the first time. The works of author will give the idea about applications of the subject.
183,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7226831-josh-friedlander,3,"There are basically two ways to write popular books on difficult topics: cut and simplify to make it accessible to anyone, or just pour in details and hope that readers will move on despite not grasping all the fine points. This book is decidedly of the second group. The author interleaves with the difficult parts a memoir of growing up a prodigy in the USSR, facing discrimination and eventually escaping to a visiting position at Harvard despite not having finished his undergrad(!) He talks about his involvement in the Langlands Program, an attempt at a sort of Grand Unified Theory of Maths, and attempts to convey the beauty and excitement he finds in it. Starting with symmetry and groups, Frenkel rapidly progresses into the heart of contemporary mathematics: Lie algebras, Riemann surfaces, elliptic curves in the complex plane, n-branes, quantum field applications of theorised supersymmetries, and much more. I would lie if I claimed to have grasped it all, but I got a lot out of following the threads in each chapter as far as I could, stopping, rereading and Wikipedia-ing. This book works best as a subjective, impassioned introduction to what mathematicians work on all day, and what might make someone want to join them."

It was also interesting to learn how apparently closely related are math and the laws of nature.Unfortunately I did not particularly enjoy lengthy chapters on particular mathematical research and results – I felt it was inconsistent with the more lyric chapters. In that sense the book didn't provide optimal reading flow for me. I also felt that the couple last chapters did not really fit well with the rest of the book and felt a bit tacky.I would've given this 2 stars, or maybe even 1 star, if not for the first several chapters."
185,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27423393-andrew-derbak,2,"While I put down and picked up this book over time, it was mostly due to the confusion of the cover and description of the book and the story that was unfolding. At the end, I did enjoy reading the autobiographical parts and the maths that I could comprehend, but I would not recommend this book to just the average reader. I have a two star rating because even though it was enjoyable, the purpose of the book is very misleading. "

190,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30982871-james-f,4,"Edward Frenkel, Love and Math [2013] 306 pages [Kindle]I read this amazing book more or less by accident; I was testing the direct download link in the library catalogue and this is the book I happened to download to my Kindle. I started looking through it and the preface convinced me to read it. Frenkel is a mathematician, born in the U.S.S.R. and now at Berkeley, who is working on something called the ""Langlands Project"". He begins by discussing the fact that otherwise well-educated people who would never brag that they hated literature or art or music seem proud to say they ""hate math"", and admit they know nothing about it; and he suggests that the reason is the way it is taught. He uses the analogy, suppose you took a course in Art, and instead of showing you the works of Rembrandt and Van Gogh they spent the entire class teaching you to paint -- fences. Would you be interested in pursuing art? But this is the way that math is generally taught -- as a practical collection of tools for doing other (mostly boring) things. The ""masterpieces"" of math are never mentioned. He also points out that most of the math which is taught in high school and even the early years of college dates from the ancient Greeks or the early modern period -- current work is never mentioned; it's as if a physics course ended with the work of Galileo and Newton, and gave the impression that everything in physics was already discovered and all that was left was to use it for practical engineering. Then he goes on to talk about popular science writers, such as Stephen Hawking or Brian Greene, who present the exciting developments of contemporary work in physics for the layperson, and asks why there are so few if any popularizations of work at the frontiers of contemporary math. He warns of the political dangers of allowing a small elite to monopolize knowledge of mathematics in an age when all our lives depend more than ever before on applications of math, from the Internet to Wall Street; he suggests that a mathematically literate population would not be so easily taken in by the doubletalk of the bankers and politicians. That is the gap he is trying to fill with this book. The focus is on his own work on the Langlands Project, and like the physics books of Kip Thorne or Leonard Susskind, he includes much of his own experiences. In the first few chapters, he explains how he became interested in math as a high school student; how he was denied entry into the more prestigious schools because he was Jewish, and the official academic world in the era of the final decay of the Soviet bureaucracy was highly anti-Semitic; how he was privately mentored by some of the great Soviet mathematicians, who were opposed to anti-Semitism, including the legendary Israel Gelfand, who was himself Jewish; how he worked in private and more or less secretly on group theory, and sent his first papers abroad; how he was invited to Harvard in the first months of perestroika under Gorbachev, where he became a Visiting Professor before he had even become a grad student; and how he came in contact with the Langlands Project. After that, the book is largely a popular account of the Langlands Project itself. While popular physics books try to avoid math, a popular math book of course has to be about math, and I learned much from this book. At the beginning, his explanations are very clear, and make ideas like modulo arithmetic, finite fields, Lie groups and Riemann surfaces understandable (some of the very subjects I had trouble with in reading Penrose's The Road to Reality). Later on, the book becomes more difficult to follow and his explanations of vector spaces and representations were briefer and less clear; by the end he is mentioning things like fiber bundles and automorphic functions without any explanation at all. If we keep in mind the comparison to someone like Brian Greene, though, it is hard to fault this too much; no one expects to actually learn quantum theory or string theory from a popular science book, and we shouldn't expect to learn advanced math from a book like this -- what we want to learn is what in general it is about, what the questions are and what sort of research is going on, and he is very good at that. His observations that sets, functions and numbers have been left behind for categories, sheaves and vector spaces was interesting; something like the way classical physics gave way to quantum theory. Quantum theory and string theory are here, as the ""fourth column"" of the Langlands Program; the author has collaborated with physicist-mathematicians such as Edward Witten on the connections between the two fields. So what is the Langlands Program? Essentially, it is a program to discover patterns common to various seemingly unrelated branches of mathematics (and recently physics), in particular to relate group theory and curves over finite fields to subjects like harmonic analysis and Riemann surfaces. If you don't know what these things are -- that's evidence for his thesis. "
191,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86000064-stephanie,4,"I think I am too dumb for this book but I enjoyed what I could understand! It's clear Frenkel has a lot of infectious passion for his work, and I liked his explanations"
192,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42063497-christina,3,"Yes, most of the mathematics in this book is hard. Edward Frenkel's work is cutting-edge mathematical research, after all, with applications in quantum mechanics, so it's no walk in the park. I give him credit for even attempting to explain it to a lay audience. As he states in ""A Guide for the Reader"", you can skip the sections and chapters that deal with the math. I think most readers of this book will end up doing so at some point, mainly enjoying the biographical parts.Frenkel's point in writing this book, as he explains in the ""Preface"", is to share his love for mathematics with an audience who doesn't get to see much of its hidden beauty. He does this by taking the reader on the journey that led him to mathematics, starting with a friend of his father's who taught Frenkle about symmetries and braid groups when he was in his late teens. This sparked his lifelong passion for math, and we learn all about the obstacles thrown into his path by the Soviet system that made it next to impossible for a son of a Jew to study or work in research mathematics. Luckily, he was the right age to take advantage of Perestroika, and then the collapse of the Soviet Union, and was able to both finish his studies and find an academic position in the United States.We get introduced to the main project in Frankel's career, the Langlands Program, in chapter 8, ""Magic Numbers,"" where a lot of background is given. The Langlands Program, if finished, will link together several fields of mathematics that seem unrelated on the surface. This is difficult to do and pretty rare. The background leading up to this is wide-ranging, and Frenkle tries to simplify his explanations as much as possible, but this is where the abstract nature of advanced mathematics is probably going to confuse most of his audience. In a mere 15 pages, you get a high-level whirlwind tour of the Galois groups, how the Shimura-Taniyama-Weil conjecture was used to prove Fermat's Last Theorem, how this conjecture is a general result for finding the generating function of cubic equations (using the generating function of the Fibonacci numbers as an analogy), and how it is a special case of the Langlands Program. I had to read chapter 8 very carefully and slowly, but I got the gist of it, if not a deep understanding. By the next chapter, where he introduces Lie (pronounced ""lee"") groups and algebras, I admit I was lost.The remaining math sections left me feeling like Frenkel was Beethoven, explaining how he had composed his symphonies, while I was the novice student who had finished a basic course in music theory, and knew how to play ""Für Elise"" but not much else. While his enthusiasm for mathematics and his life's work are all obvious, I just cannot appreciate the depth or the details on the same level. I found this discouraging and more than a little frustrating, because I wanted to see the same beauty that he did. I did appreciate the journey he has taken to get to this point, and the real-life depiction of how mathematical research is actually done - sometimes painfully slowly. Perhaps after some years of study I will be able to appreciate the mathematical sections just as much as the biographical ones."
193,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5931241-jenny,2,"This author was a guest on the Colbert Report, which is when I first learned of his book. He described the concept so passionately, and he argued that mathematics has been so misunderstood because it isn't given its fair due in K-12 school curricula. Frenkel is disillusioned that the general masses don't appreciate math, and he set out to conquer our hearts with this book. He stated that this book was written specifically for people like me, laypeople who have never had the opportunity to give math a fair shake because all they learn are boring basic concepts in school and they never see the true beauty of it. He compared it to taking an art class in which you only get to paint a fence and are never actually shown the works of great artists. Fair enough, I thought. I'll give it a try.By chapter three, I realized that Edward Frenkel is a misguided genius who truly believes that laypeople could possibly understand what he is talking about. I don't sense that he is a self-righteous individual who wants to come across as ridiculously smart (he is, in fact, ridiculously smart). I think he really just doesn't get that trying to relate these concepts to people like me, who only made it through Calc A, cannot be done. Hence, large parts of the book left me absolutely lost. Even BJ, who was a math minor, said he wasn't keeping up and so he quit reading it. Consider this sentence: ""The idea of string theory is that by doing calculations in these sigma models and summing up the results over all possible Riemann surfaces E (that is, over all possible paths of the strings propagating in a fixed space-time S) we can reproduce the physics that we observe in space-time S."" Honestly, I wish this particular sentence, which I chose at random, was a stand-apart in terms of its difficulty, but the truth is that much of this book is written in this language with ten unfamiliar concepts thrown together in the same sentence, all with the assumption that we must understand what the heck he is talking about. The redeeming points of the book were the interspersed memoir portions, which were extremely interesting. Frenkel was born in the Soviet Union and endured intense antisemitism at practically every turn in his education, but still prevailed and eventually traveled to Harvard and then to UC-Berkeley with professorships. I very much loved hearing about his experiences growing up, in college, working with colleagues, and his personal excitement about solving mathematical problems. It was only that he felt the need to then delve INTO those problems with technical language that made this book a disappointment--along with the fact that I didn't feel it delivered what it originally promised.In the end, I walked away appreciating Edward Frenkel's personal story. However, I did NOT end up appreciating math anymore than I ever did before, which was precisely why I decided to read the book in the first place. Unless you're ready to skip some major portions or else you're a mathematician, I don't recommend this book to you. This book is truly written for mathematicians, not laypeople, as it was so described."
194,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28285354-ron,3,"Love and Math: The Heart of Hidden Reality by Edward FrenkelThis is the story of a young boy of 12 who loved quantum physics, but not math. When he learned that the quark was found by using math, he decided to study math. He grew up a 100 miles from Moscow and he was Jewish. He was a very bright student and when he finished public school, he went to Moscow to take the test to enter the Moscow State University but at that time MSU discriminated against the Jewish people and when Edward went to take the test, he was taken to a room by two of the testers and given an oral exam and the testers did not like the correct answers he gave to the questions, so he failed the entrance exam. Later one of the testers came to him and told him that he could get into Moscow Institute of Oil and Gas, where they also had a good applied mathematics school and even used some of the professors who taught at MSU. He was accepted to the Moscow Institute of Oil and Gas and in his second year there he solved a difficult problem and it was brought to the attention of one of the MSU top mathematician professors. He solved an even more advanced math problem that this professor gave him and he wrote his first juried math paper for the Journal of Mathematics. Soon, he received a three month invitation to learn at Harvard. He was on his way to becoming a top flight mathematician. He worked on the Langlands program to unify various branches of mathematics. Edward and other mathematicians worked to unify number theory and harmonic analysis. Frankel uses two irrational numbers to construct a system of hybrid numbers in which one term is rational and the other term is a rational multiple of the irrational numbers. These numbers are now constructed into a new numeral system called a “number field”, and they form a mathematical structure called the “Galois group” of the polynomial equation. An analysis of this Galois group can produce solutions of harmonic analysis (a more sophisticated version of the study of sines and cosines.) Frenkel and his group of mathematicians in the Langlands program are producing solutions that will tie other mathematical branches together. Edward presents these mathematical equations equal to oil paintings and sculptures exhibited in museums throughout the world. The book is well written and the explanations go a long way forward to knowing about the mathematical solutions presented. I believe you would need a bachelor of mathematics degree or equivalent in order to see the “Mona Lisa” Frenkel has presented here. "
195,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1856047-jonna-higgins-freese,5,"I can't say I understand The Langlands Program any more now than I did before, except that it has something to do with sheaves and making it possible to ""translate"" between different areas of mathematics. I also picked up that the mathematics has some real-world implications in terms of symmetry and quantum physics, which I'd already picked up on from reading _The God Particle._ Unlike many of the other reviewers, I enjoyed the way he narrated his own engagement with and love of mathematics -- before I could love math myself, I needed to understand how anyone could love it, and I felt he did a good job of showing what it's like to be a person who loves mathematics.There were several interesting quotes --Thoreau: ""We have heard about the poetry of mathematics, but very little of it has yet been sung."" (A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers, cited on p. 228 of L&M)p. 241: ""Albert Einstein wrote, 'Every one who is seriously involved in thepursuit of science becomes convinced that some spirit is manifest in the laws of the Universe -- a spirit vastly superior to that of man, and one in the face of which we with our modest powers must feel humble.' And Isaac Newton expressed his feelings this way: 'to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the seashore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.'""My dream is that one day we will all awaken to this hidden reality. We may then perhaps be able to set aside our differences and focus on the profound truths that unite us. Then, we will all be like children playing on the seashore, marveling at the dazzling beauty and harmony we discover, share, and cherish together.""And this is what I love about reading books about math and science whose content I can barely understand -- it puts my life into perspective. When I'm frustrated about a completely illogical decision at work, or asked to accomplish something without the tools to do so, or when I feel that my life is spent in entirely too much make-work that takes me away from my children, reading such books for a few minutes before bed each night puts things into a larger perspective, opens up the world so that I feel I have space to breathe again."
196,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91748031-hobart-mariner,3,"As a personal memoir, this book is a both good and a bit frustrating. As a lay introduction to the ideas behind general advanced mathematics, and in particular the Langlands program (and its ties to string and superstring theory), it is very good, if a little daunting toward the end.In the early parts, the author does a very fine job of describing the hideous antisemitism that he encountered in the Soviet Union of the 1980s and how it prevented a generation of young Jewish mathematicians from developing to their fullest. He does a good job of recounting the unfairness of the oral examinations that prevented him from attending the Moscow State University Mechanics and Mathematics Department. In particular, his losing admission over a farcically nitpicky definition of circle (""the set of all points equidistant from a fixed point"" instead of ""the set of points equidistant from a fixed point"") serves as an illustration of the utter absurdity of this system. Later on, in the United States, he and several other Russian-Jewish mathematicians are given an opportunity to get back at the antisemitic Rector of MSU and this provides a satisfying and compelling scene.The author also presents warm and personal sketches of the mentors who helped him both to learn mathematics and to escape the clutches of this oppressive system. The author, for one who showed such incredible ability so young, is admirably free of vanity regarding his career, constantly giving credit to his advisors, teachers, and fellow students. There are a few personal bits that could have used more fleshing out (in particular, when he meets Feigin's family, he mentions that he would come to become very close with them, but the reader doesn't really see this). I thought that the depiction of the life of the ""Kerosinka"" was very interesting, an applied math hub full of frustrated young pure mathematicians. I thought that Yakov Khurgin, the charismatic probabilist studying with physicians to ensure his own access to medical care, made a very sympathetic character. It was poignant when the author described leaving his paltry instructorship (obtained by Khurgin with some difficulty) at the Kerosinka behind to study at Harvard. After the author moves to the United States, the story becomes a bit less personal and instead becomes more of a purely popular scientific book. Of the first twelve chapters, several are completely given over to mathematical exposition (some without any mention of the author's personal history). Yet it felt as I read it that after the author moves to Cambridge in Chapter 13, the book became much less personal. This corresponds with the author's life becoming less contingent and unstable, and maybe as a consequence less interesting. He sketches a few scenes of adjusting to life in the United States (being overwhelmed by the choices at a supermarket, learning colloquial English by watching David Letterman, walking around in jeans with a Walkman). I can't find it now but later on he provides a single paragraph of personal history, including marriage, divorce, and moving his Russian family to the United States. I would have liked to see a bit more of this, even if it has limited bearing on the mathematical parts of the memoir. As a work of mathematical exposition for a lay audience this book is quite successful, particularly in the earlier parts. (Disclaimer: I'm an academic mathematician, although in a different field of math than the author's.) I've seen many, many descriptions of the notion of symmetry group meant for lay audiences and I think that the author's stands out in terms of clarity. His own charming initial encounter with group theory (a mathematician friend of the family showing him the links the subject has with particle physics) might not make it easier for everyone else to comprehend, but at least gives an idea that the subject has meaning outside of the abstractions of pure math. He does a very fine job explaining the notions of groups, braid groups, fundamental group, modular arithmetic, and the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. I was quite impressed with his ability to describe Galois theory in relatively low-tech terms (in particular, he employs a wonderfully evocative metaphor involving the wings of a butterfly). The scientific exposition later on (in particular the bits with supersymmetry and string theory) were a bit harder for me to digest, but that doesn't mean he didn't present them in very clear terms. The main mathematical focus of the book is the Langlands Program, which the author repeatedly refers to as a Grand Unified Theory of Math, a description that overstates things slightly (there are several major fields of mathematics that do not really fall under the umbrella of the Langlands Program). It is no surprise that the author, one of the Langlands Program's superstars, does an excellent job laying out the basic ideas behind this ambitious research program. There are good explanations of Galois theory (mentioned above) and a solid example of how modular forms tie in to the subject. A bit more said about the general idea of modular forms might have been useful, but it's possible that it would be too technical for most readers. The author perhaps overloads a metaphor concerning people in Europe and North America, but not to the detriment of the books readability. I do think that it's possible readers with a limited mathematical background will get a bit lost in these sections, because they discuss fairly airy connections between subjects that have only briefly been sketched. There is a very good discussion of Weil's ""Rosetta stone"" in Chapter 9 that provides a nice backbone for all of the Langlands Program discussion. The last chapter, which contains a description of the author's screenplay (The Two-Body Problem) and short film (Rites of Love and Math), felt a bit disconnected from the rest of the book. His description of the screenwriting process is interesting and gives him the opportunity to credit yet another mentor. When he discusses the film-making process he employs a reconstructed dialogue with a French director which seems a bit artificial (similar to several other dialogues in the book). The film, which features a mathematician writing a powerful formula on the body of a woman, seems half-baked in its concept, although its clear that it means quite a lot to the author. It's a bit hard to see how this artsy, somewhat pretentious production is the best way to make someone feel the importance of math, when the author himself has done a good job in his earlier chapters making the reader feel the urgency of his initial mathematical work. A short film about a young Jewish mathematician in the Soviet Union trying with all his energy to get into MSU, prove a theorem, break into a lecture hall, etc. would be much more compelling and get across the feeling of doing math much better, in my opinion. He leaves out any mention of the minor controversy that the film provoked among feminist circles, instead offering platitudes like ""it's all in the eye of the bholder."" This section is larded with quotations from Thoreau, Einstein, etc, and overall is a bit flabby and formless in comparison with the rest of the book. Sort of disappointing that he chose to end on this note. "
197,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11253338-andrew,3,"This book was much more enjoyable when I gave up trying to understand.The author is clearly knowledgeable about mathematics. He is also very very passionate.The difficulty lies in informing the rest of us about his passion. A Nobel Laureate in Physics claims this book is ""very readable."" Which is great news, except I am not a Nobel Laureate in the realm Frenkel's work deals with.This is the struggle he faces: Mathematics is far larger and deeper than most people encounter. We are taught from a young age that math is ugly and mostly esoteric. Trying to overcome that by bringing up ideas that mean absolutely nothing to those who have not studied Algebraic Symmetries, Modular Forms, and Reimannian Surfaces is not effective.HOWEVER, when I accepted that I didn't have a clue what he was talking about, and chose to pay attention to the links between those ideas (which was his purpose), life got easier.The purpose of this book isn't to teach the reader mathematics, but to show how various ideas in mathematics are related, to the surprise of the rest of us. Math is about exotic connections and powerful generalizations, not calculation. In the 17th Chapter, Dr. Frenkel writes ""But my point is not for you to learn them all. Rather, I want to indicate the logical connections between these objects and show the creative process of scientists studying them: what drives them, how they learn from each other, how the knowledge they acquire is used to advance our understanding of the key questions.""THAT should have been in the introduction, alongside the anecdote of drunks and fractions. It would have made the rest SO MUCH easier. If the reader begins with that idea, then the book is wonderful. Math is beautiful, not because it is useful, but because it is the art of the universe itself. A famous sculptor (I believe it was Michelangelo) once said that the statue was already in the marble, he just discovered it. Many mathematicians feel that they do not create math, they find the rules that were already there. This book does a great job demonstrating that concept. Provided you ignore the footnotes and don't try to understand the math he is using to present this idea."
198,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3016981-girish,3,"There is a wave of ""pop-math"" books aimed at the interested amateur, and Edward Frenkel's memoir/masturbatory ode to math is a whirlwind tour of his life and research interests. Frenkel tries to acclimate the reader to the mathematical castle in the sky by attempting to avoid jargon and using commonplace examples to elucidate mathematical concepts (e.g. the ""symmetrical circle group"" as an example of a group).My main complaint is that I don't know who this book is for. I got out of what I wanted (and expected) - an increased appreciation for the thought patterns around math, a birds eye view of the Langland's Program, some interesting succinct definitions of mathematical concepts, and some cool visualizations. The autobiographical tidbits were interesting, but for orthogonal reasons (one of my coworkers is Russian Jewish and that got me interested in Frenkel's story; not to mention just how wrong what happened to him was).You won't learn any math from this book. It's an interesting foray into the emotional connection to math, so even though one of Frenkel's explicit goals is to demystify the intricate edifice of theory that is the Langland's Program, I'd say he failed in that endeavor. I suppose for the right person who really thinks of mathematics as SAT-style word problems, then it might be incredibly interesting to learn that it's much more artistic, revelatory, and exploratory.I'll note that Frenkel makes a couple claims in this book. First, the implicit claim that mathematical discoveries should be elevated in stature and aesthetic to the pyramids or hanging gardens, and second, that pure mathematical research is valuable but that we can't always perceive the applications immediately. I love #1 and hope that happens. #2 requires a more nuanced look, especially if it's used as justification for any and all theoretical mathematical research. Most math research, is (while beautiful/curious/amazing) useless.Mathematics used to occupy the highest stage of the cultural aristocracy as late as the 1800s, I wonder if it's time for a cultural resurgence. The gods of social status are fickle, so who knows? Math may become cool. If that's to be, than a broader appreciation for its beauty is necessary. "
199,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1849937-yofish,3,"Really 3.5.Written by a mathematician whose stated aim is to get his readers to understand what math is *really* about (as opposed to what one learns in school). The guy has had an interesting life. He was born in the USSR, and couldn't get into the ""right"" college (MGU) for math because he's Jewish. But he's able to muddle through, thanks to the large population of Jewish (and non-Jewish) mathematicians in Moscow who are used to getting around this exact problem. He's a really good mathematician and gets published and so on; but then he graduates and has the same problem---he can't get into a graduate school in the USSR because he's Jewish. Fortunately, he's just exactly the right age, and perestroika is starting, so when he gets invited to Harvard, he can go. (And eventually when he's visiting professorship is up, Harvard lets him be demoted to graduate student so that he can get his Ph.D.) While he was giving the more biographical story, I was pretty interested. But remember that his stated purpose was to introduce his math (the Langlands Program) to the layman. I can't really say whether he succeeded, as I skimmed through most of it. Not that I couldn't have understood (probably)---after all, I am a mathematician. The thing is, though, that if I was interested in that particular math, I would have studied it in grad school. The writing is a little choppy, which is surely understandable as English is his second language. But the editing is pretty poor, too---there seemed to be several places where he repeated himself without saying ""as I mentioned before"" or something similar. That was a little weird. He also seemed a little full of himself at times. There was a particular story, during his first year at Harvard, where the head of the dept of MGU is invited to MIT. That was (apparently) controversial at the time, as he wasn't supposed to be much of a mathematician, and he apparently was overseeing the rejection of Jews. There's sort of a public confrontation between him and the author. It was an interesting story--I'm a little surprised that I hadn't heard it before, as it happened while I was in grad school, and it's the kind of thing I might have noticed."
200,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18370648-mishehu,3,"Author writes, ""...we, mathematicians, need to do a better job of unlocking the power and beauty of our subject to a wider audience."" Alas, he himself resoundingly fails to do so. 5 stars for the autobiographical material in this book. The author's personal story -- and his mathematical biography -- are quite interesting. 1.5 stars for the exposition of mathematical ideas. Whatever pretense the author may have to being a math popularizer, he has many miles to travel in developing his expository chops before he can count himself among those of his colleagues who do this sort of thing well. I recently finished reading the second of Brian Greene's masterful books on cosmology -- books that are pitched to a highly interested readership willing to put in a serious readerly effort. Occasionally, in his books, Greene elaborates certain ideas in footnotes that are expressly written for ""mathematically inclined readers."" Nearly all of Frenkel's math discussion (in both the text and the footnotes of the book in review) are, whatever anyone may claim to the contrary, pitched to mathematically inclined readers. A few chapters in and the going is pretty much impossible for the lay reader. The best I can say about Frenkel's skills as a pop math expositor is that he did manage to convey an impression of what his mathematical research is about, of why it matters, and of why it's fascinating/inspiring. So, though I understood very little of the book, I did get something out of it (not simply insights into the author's personal story). But the investment of my time was poorly paid. All that said, Frenkel writes well, and his work really IS quite fascinating. I hope he'll continue to develop his pop writing skills, and I hope that future editors/publishers of his (and other first time pop math/sci authors) will give some thought to the target audience of books like these before they let manuscripts go to press."
201,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24055618-noah,5," Non-fiction books generally explain something that is true, or at least true for the author, about a particular topic. They can range from stories about people’s lives to discoveries that have been made, as well as pure factual information. One might expect non-fiction books to be purely facts and not memoirs, but that isn’t always the case. What surprised me about the book Love and Math is that this book was laid out in a different format that what I would expect from most non-fiction books. It’s laid out more like a novel, with chapters and memoirs and such. Love and Math by Edward Frenkel is a great nonfiction book mainly focusing on the symmetry groups in math of SO(3) and SO(n). Love and Math starts by easing the reader into advanced mathematics with the use of diagrams and symmetry, then gets into some more advanced ideas such as symmetry groups for higher dimensions. Love and Math is part thoughtful memoir, and part math textbook. Edward Frenkel mixes these two things perfectly to make an enticing book that just makes you want to read more. One of the main things that helped make the book so good was that Edward Frenkel had such an amazing childhood, he met famous mathematicians, he published papers, and faced tragedies such as being persecuted because he was Jewish. Edward Frenkel is an accomplished mathematician who wants to inspire other people to become mathematicians. I think that Edward Frenkel did an awesome job of explaining advanced mathematical concepts. I would give this book five stars and recommend this book to anyone who doesn’t mind curling up somewhere for a few hours while expanding their mind and having fun."
202,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4922601-deborah-flores,5,"Very enjoyable! Some reviewers seemed uncomfortable with the neither-fish-nor-fowl feel - neither pure autobiography nor pure mathematics tome - but this approach worked well for me. Rather than simply describing the solution to a problem, the author takes the time to describe the thrill of finding an elegant solution to a problem on which you'd labored for weeks or months. Rather than just describing a mathematician's theories, the author provides sufficient details to get a feel for the mathematician as a person. I found this approach an effective way to help non-mathematicians connect to math and those who study it. I picked up this book because I was interested in Dr. Frenkel's experiences as a mathematician in the twilight years of the Soviet Union. Specifically, I wanted to learn more about the author's experiences with the harrowing, Kafkaesque Moscow State University (MGU) mathematics entrance examination, through which undesirable students (read: those of Jewish descent) were deliberately weeded out and denied admittance. This is exactly what happened to the author, and I was deeply impressed by his commitment to study math at any cost as well as his later willingness to speak out publicly against about these discriminatory policies. Bravo! It was also fascinating to read about how many Soviet mathematicians and others worked with and mentored students who had experienced discrimination, and how many of these students ended up immigrating to the West soon afterwards. As to mathematics, the author clearly loves what he does, and his love is infectious. While I didn't read the book primarily for this angle, I did gain a deeper appreciation of mathematics as well as the Langlands Program. Intriguing stuff! "
203,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5664087-john,3,"Edward Frenkel’s Love and Math joins a long list of mathematical memoirs. In the last two centuries many eminent mathematicians have attempted to describe what they do, why they do it and how they came to it. Without exception they fail the “what we do” test but often brilliantly succeed on why and how they came to mathematics. Mathematics does not admit casual observers. You have to do it to fully appreciate it and doing it at the levels Frenkel describes takes gifted minds years of hard work. “There are no royal roads to geometry.” Love and Math goes further than most in this genre. It doesn't flinch when a formula really helps and the end notes are detailed and reference laden enough to get you started on learning what’s really the deal with SO(3).The best part of the book deals with the author’s start in mathematics as a precious Russian teenager. Frenkel's father was Jewish and this created problems. The Soviet Union, in addition to being a murderous totalitarian state, was overtly anti-Semitic. Scholars of Jewish descent faced “extra” hurdles when it came to university admissions and securing jobs. Frenkel’s account of his MGU exam should be required reading for every leftist imbecile in the west. It clearly shows that secondary school mathematics was taught at levels far beyond the execrable Common Core, (affirmative action), standard now being pushed in the US and that bureaucrats can always find ways to exclude even the best of “undesirables.” Love and Math is an entertaining, enlightening and important book."
204,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8824504-leslie,3,"This one was between 3 and 3.5 stars.At the beginning of the novel the author states that he hopes to accomplish two things: first he hopes to convey his love of math and then he hopes to imbue this love into the reader. These are lofty goals. He is successful in the former but falls a bit short in the latter. The novel is part memoir and is is perhaps the most interesting section of the book. Frenkle's tale of overcoming the anti Semitic policy of the Soviet Union is incredibly moving. His love of mathematics is earnestly depicted and you root for his success in the face of adversity. The other parts of the novel focus on his contribution to the Langlands program and here I found that the quality varied. The math is certainly an important contribution but he only succeeded at making about half of it accessible to me. I will openly admit that my affinity for mathematics is limited to applied math. It is important for me to understand the context behind the concepts and unfortunately certain aspects where too abstract. I could not help but compare it to Hawking's works which successfully engaged my interest and made the esoteric aspects of quantum mechanics and physics accessible to the layperson. His works made me love physics and cosmology while this book only somewhat piqued my interest. However, I recommend the book for those interested in obtaining a peek into the mysterious world of mathematics. I believe it is an important field and completely agree with the author that it should be taught in a more engaging way. "
205,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51268208-akbar-gumbira,3,"This book is not for everyone.Through this book, the author (Edward Frenkel) tried to explain a lot of mathematical concepts in layman's terms. But no matter how hard he tried, it's just not for everyone. I have no background in mathematics or physics (as a degree) and I find it hard to understand many concepts told in the book. Though I still could follow some concepts such as generating function, fermat's little and last theorem, RSA, and most of the number theory part since I thought myself in high school some high level mathematics for olympiad. But when it comes to concepts such as Langlands program, Galois group, and the links to quantum duality, I just skim-read it.But we couldn't help it. Edward is a world-renowned and gifted mathematician. He's already working on unsolved mathematical problems since he's in college, had a patent in his 4th year in college (or 5th year I forgot exactly), and invited to Harvard in his early 20's. Things that are obvious to him, and perhaps that he also thinks to others, might not be that obvious to the readers.Apart from that, I enjoyed his personal story, telling the readers about anti-semitism in Soviet Union, his first time in Harvard (spending 45 minutes at the supermarket to just buy salt), how the project went to link quantum dualities and the Langlands program, his film-making story, and how he perceives mathematics in general.Oh I found many typos! I wonder if he's in a rush to publish it?"
206,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15546947-haydee-romero,0,"I picked up this book because love and math are two words I have never used in the same sentence. Math intimidates me but reading Frenkel’s introduction he made it clear that the goal and target audience was me! A person who fears the word math, “If you think that math is hard, that you won’t get it, if you are terrified by math but at the same time curious whether there is something worth knowing- then this book is for you.” Frenkel says that math is at the heart of love and his tone and acknowledgement of his audience made me comfortable starting the book. Frenkel did a great job at breaking down COMPLEX math equations and idea BUT it was not enough for me, personally. I would have to put the book down, reread the paragraph to grasp the concept. I would but I had to think about it... a lot. Frenkel did an amazing job of integrating his personal journey as a mathematician and the math equations he explained. It was clear throughout his book that he knew his audience were not mathematicians. Frenkel would define words that may have a different meaning in the math field. He would apply theories to concepts we may know about or explain what they are used for. I have learned and gained a much greater respect to the subject of math. I would use this book as an example of how keeping who your audience is when writing a piece makes a big difference and is so important. "
207,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1357119-david,4,"1. Frenkel and his friends would scale 20 foot walls in order to sneak into mathematics lectures - this increases my faith in humanity.2. The portrait of how Frenkel and his kindred spirits were able to find one another and prosper in the USSR is absolutely fascinating. He and his friends would tear through their official duties in no time and get real work done while operating within their largely informal and much less hierarchical intellectual network. This also increases my faith in humanity.3. On a less happy note, Frenkel's experience illuminates the weaknesses of the rigid (and far too common) approach to mathematical education. It is possible to reach some individuals even when mathematical concepts are taught as pure abstractions - you can reach people who focus intensely on discreet tasks and who follow instructions first and ask questions later. Others, however, learn through a much more context-driven approach. If you present them with a new abstract concept and fail to connect it to what they have learned before or demonstrate how it can be visualized or applied, they are going to struggle. Frenkel found wonderful mentors who helped him see math as an area to explore rather than an area where one duplicates rote instructions - I sure didn't find anyone like that, and I doubt many others do either."
208,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22906182-kat-steiner,3,"Argh, finally finished this book. Unsurprisingly, it does not work as an audiobook. Do not buy it from Audible.I think when I got it, I believed it was more of a book about mathematicians or a fictionalised autobiography, than a book about maths. It's sort of both, but there is a fair amount of actual maths (and significantly advanced maths, at that). And that's just impossible to make sense of while listening. Particularly as the narrator, Tony Craine, clearly has absolutely no idea what he is saying, so his emphasis is often totally off, or he reads things in a way that doesn't distinguish where brackets would be, so it's just impossible to follow no matter how hard you listen - there's not enough information conveyed.The story itself I really enjoyed - it was a fascinating account of education and anti-semitism in Soviet Russia, as well as great insight into the lives of professional mathematicians. I did a maths degree so I can't comment on how it would come across to the layman, but I found the actual maths a bit hard-going and uninteresting - these are difficult, complicated concepts that weren't very interesting when you can't get into either the nitty-gritty or appreciate the broader concepts.A bit of a mixed bag. Quite enjoyable in parts, but I'm glad to be done. Don't get the audiobook."
209,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10145524-charles-daney,5,"The love referred to is mainly for mathematics, though there is one chapter on the human-related form. The first chapters are about Frenkel's struggles to get a math education in the last years of the Soviet Union. He had to literally climb fences to get access to the best seminars and experts. Most of the book deals with his primary interest: an extremely esoteric, but important, area of current research, known as the ""Langlands Program"". I really enjoyed his presentation, since this is one of my main interests also, and this is the best ""nontechnical"" explanation I've ever seen of the subject. It made things a lot clearer for me. The basic idea is that there are very deep relationships among a number of mathematical concepts that on the surface seem quite unrelated. And besides that, there may be important applications to particle physics theory. It could turn out that a lot of why fundamental physics works the way it does is a result of mathematical relationships. Someday before too long (I hope), I can write about the Langlands Program on my math blog. It's related to stuff I've already written about there (number theory). I find that the best way to learn about new things is to write about them - as a process of explaining the subject to myself."
210,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7412717-suzie-shatarevyan,3,"Not exactly what I was expecting when I picked up this book. I've always loved math, but reading this book hasn't made me want to run and become a mathematician. Half the book reads like a memoir, which I didn't mind as I enjoy that genre, but like I said, not what I was expecting. Pure, 'non-practictal' math is impossible to grasp for the non mathematician and there's a lot of that in this book. Frenkel does try to explain using analogies, but that's not always possible. In one instance, when referring to a formula he wrote, he concedes that maybe only 10 or 12 people in the entire world can understand it. Not even math students will get it! On the other hand, I have become familiarized with a lot of math theories that is being studied in the last 50 years, so I'm still glad I read this book. It's obvious Frenkel has a deep passion for his field. You have to be extremely passionate to devote years and years looking for discoveries and connections in things that seem unrelated. This is still pretty accessible and if you want to see math like you've never seen in the classroom, give it a shot. Definitely mind-expanding."
211,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67447577-joseph-schrock,4,"This book was tough reading for me. I'm a mathematical hobbyist -- not a professional mathematician. This book discussed lots of things concerning which I had zero knowledge. It dealt with groups, symmetries, topology, etc. All of those are (for the most part) beyond my level of training. I've gotten moderately far into elementary number theory -- dealing with modular arithmetic, encryption, and even some into quadratic reciprocity (for which I've not managed to master the proofs). Frenkel's book might be a good book for a professional mathematician, but laymen will find it tough going -- except for the biographical aspects of the book, which are very nicely written. As for myself, if I'd known how tough this book is, I would likely not have bought it. But then, I'm not a professional mathematician or mathematics student. "
212,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30252254-shivam-agarwal,4,Simply amazing. This is the first Math book I have read which is written in the form of biography. Now this engages reader and encourages readers to hold on when Math part kicks in.I would suggest the book to second year undergraduates specially who are reading discrete mathematics for the first time. The works of author will give the idea about applications of the subject.
213,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7226831-josh-friedlander,3,"There are basically two ways to write popular books on difficult topics: cut and simplify to make it accessible to anyone, or just pour in details and hope that readers will move on despite not grasping all the fine points. This book is decidedly of the second group. The author interleaves with the difficult parts a memoir of growing up a prodigy in the USSR, facing discrimination and eventually escaping to a visiting position at Harvard despite not having finished his undergrad(!) He talks about his involvement in the Langlands Program, an attempt at a sort of Grand Unified Theory of Maths, and attempts to convey the beauty and excitement he finds in it. Starting with symmetry and groups, Frenkel rapidly progresses into the heart of contemporary mathematics: Lie algebras, Riemann surfaces, elliptic curves in the complex plane, n-branes, quantum field applications of theorised supersymmetries, and much more. I would lie if I claimed to have grasped it all, but I got a lot out of following the threads in each chapter as far as I could, stopping, rereading and Wikipedia-ing. This book works best as a subjective, impassioned introduction to what mathematicians work on all day, and what might make someone want to join them."

In that sense the book didn't provide optimal reading flow for me. I also felt that the couple last chapters did not really fit well with the rest of the book and felt a bit tacky.I would've given this 2 stars, or maybe even 1 star, if not for the first several chapters."

I have a two star rating because even though it was enjoyable, the purpose of the book is very misleading. "

219,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48778422-henk,3,I found Frenkel's story about his youth and education in the Soviet Union very well told and fascinating. I received the book as a present for my 73rd birthday and it made me take up my math books again. 
220,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30982871-james-f,4,"Edward Frenkel, Love and Math [2013] 306 pages [Kindle]I read this amazing book more or less by accident; I was testing the direct download link in the library catalogue and this is the book I happened to download to my Kindle. I started looking through it and the preface convinced me to read it. Frenkel is a mathematician, born in the U.S.S.R. and now at Berkeley, who is working on something called the ""Langlands Project"". He begins by discussing the fact that otherwise well-educated people who would never brag that they hated literature or art or music seem proud to say they ""hate math"", and admit they know nothing about it; and he suggests that the reason is the way it is taught. He uses the analogy, suppose you took a course in Art, and instead of showing you the works of Rembrandt and Van Gogh they spent the entire class teaching you to paint -- fences. Would you be interested in pursuing art? But this is the way that math is generally taught -- as a practical collection of tools for doing other (mostly boring) things. The ""masterpieces"" of math are never mentioned. He also points out that most of the math which is taught in high school and even the early years of college dates from the ancient Greeks or the early modern period -- current work is never mentioned; it's as if a physics course ended with the work of Galileo and Newton, and gave the impression that everything in physics was already discovered and all that was left was to use it for practical engineering. Then he goes on to talk about popular science writers, such as Stephen Hawking or Brian Greene, who present the exciting developments of contemporary work in physics for the layperson, and asks why there are so few if any popularizations of work at the frontiers of contemporary math. He warns of the political dangers of allowing a small elite to monopolize knowledge of mathematics in an age when all our lives depend more than ever before on applications of math, from the Internet to Wall Street; he suggests that a mathematically literate population would not be so easily taken in by the doubletalk of the bankers and politicians. That is the gap he is trying to fill with this book. The focus is on his own work on the Langlands Project, and like the physics books of Kip Thorne or Leonard Susskind, he includes much of his own experiences. In the first few chapters, he explains how he became interested in math as a high school student; how he was denied entry into the more prestigious schools because he was Jewish, and the official academic world in the era of the final decay of the Soviet bureaucracy was highly anti-Semitic; how he was privately mentored by some of the great Soviet mathematicians, who were opposed to anti-Semitism, including the legendary Israel Gelfand, who was himself Jewish; how he worked in private and more or less secretly on group theory, and sent his first papers abroad; how he was invited to Harvard in the first months of perestroika under Gorbachev, where he became a Visiting Professor before he had even become a grad student; and how he came in contact with the Langlands Project. After that, the book is largely a popular account of the Langlands Project itself. While popular physics books try to avoid math, a popular math book of course has to be about math, and I learned much from this book. At the beginning, his explanations are very clear, and make ideas like modulo arithmetic, finite fields, Lie groups and Riemann surfaces understandable (some of the very subjects I had trouble with in reading Penrose's The Road to Reality). Later on, the book becomes more difficult to follow and his explanations of vector spaces and representations were briefer and less clear; by the end he is mentioning things like fiber bundles and automorphic functions without any explanation at all. If we keep in mind the comparison to someone like Brian Greene, though, it is hard to fault this too much; no one expects to actually learn quantum theory or string theory from a popular science book, and we shouldn't expect to learn advanced math from a book like this -- what we want to learn is what in general it is about, what the questions are and what sort of research is going on, and he is very good at that. His observations that sets, functions and numbers have been left behind for categories, sheaves and vector spaces was interesting; something like the way classical physics gave way to quantum theory. Quantum theory and string theory are here, as the ""fourth column"" of the Langlands Program; the author has collaborated with physicist-mathematicians such as Edward Witten on the connections between the two fields. So what is the Langlands Program? Essentially, it is a program to discover patterns common to various seemingly unrelated branches of mathematics (and recently physics), in particular to relate group theory and curves over finite fields to subjects like harmonic analysis and Riemann surfaces. If you don't know what these things are -- that's evidence for his thesis. "
221,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86000064-stephanie,4,"I think I am too dumb for this book but I enjoyed what I could understand! It's clear Frenkel has a lot of infectious passion for his work, and I liked his explanations"
222,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42063497-christina,3,"Yes, most of the mathematics in this book is hard. Edward Frenkel's work is cutting-edge mathematical research, after all, with applications in quantum mechanics, so it's no walk in the park. I give him credit for even attempting to explain it to a lay audience. As he states in ""A Guide for the Reader"", you can skip the sections and chapters that deal with the math. I think most readers of this book will end up doing so at some point, mainly enjoying the biographical parts.Frenkel's point in writing this book, as he explains in the ""Preface"", is to share his love for mathematics with an audience who doesn't get to see much of its hidden beauty. He does this by taking the reader on the journey that led him to mathematics, starting with a friend of his father's who taught Frenkle about symmetries and braid groups when he was in his late teens. This sparked his lifelong passion for math, and we learn all about the obstacles thrown into his path by the Soviet system that made it next to impossible for a son of a Jew to study or work in research mathematics. Luckily, he was the right age to take advantage of Perestroika, and then the collapse of the Soviet Union, and was able to both finish his studies and find an academic position in the United States.We get introduced to the main project in Frankel's career, the Langlands Program, in chapter 8, ""Magic Numbers,"" where a lot of background is given. The Langlands Program, if finished, will link together several fields of mathematics that seem unrelated on the surface. This is difficult to do and pretty rare. The background leading up to this is wide-ranging, and Frenkle tries to simplify his explanations as much as possible, but this is where the abstract nature of advanced mathematics is probably going to confuse most of his audience. In a mere 15 pages, you get a high-level whirlwind tour of the Galois groups, how the Shimura-Taniyama-Weil conjecture was used to prove Fermat's Last Theorem, how this conjecture is a general result for finding the generating function of cubic equations (using the generating function of the Fibonacci numbers as an analogy), and how it is a special case of the Langlands Program. I had to read chapter 8 very carefully and slowly, but I got the gist of it, if not a deep understanding. By the next chapter, where he introduces Lie (pronounced ""lee"") groups and algebras, I admit I was lost.The remaining math sections left me feeling like Frenkel was Beethoven, explaining how he had composed his symphonies, while I was the novice student who had finished a basic course in music theory, and knew how to play ""Für Elise"" but not much else. While his enthusiasm for mathematics and his life's work are all obvious, I just cannot appreciate the depth or the details on the same level. I found this discouraging and more than a little frustrating, because I wanted to see the same beauty that he did. I did appreciate the journey he has taken to get to this point, and the real-life depiction of how mathematical research is actually done - sometimes painfully slowly. Perhaps after some years of study I will be able to appreciate the mathematical sections just as much as the biographical ones."
223,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5931241-jenny,2,"This author was a guest on the Colbert Report, which is when I first learned of his book. He described the concept so passionately, and he argued that mathematics has been so misunderstood because it isn't given its fair due in K-12 school curricula. Frenkel is disillusioned that the general masses don't appreciate math, and he set out to conquer our hearts with this book. He stated that this book was written specifically for people like me, laypeople who have never had the opportunity to give math a fair shake because all they learn are boring basic concepts in school and they never see the true beauty of it. He compared it to taking an art class in which you only get to paint a fence and are never actually shown the works of great artists. Fair enough, I thought. I'll give it a try.By chapter three, I realized that Edward Frenkel is a misguided genius who truly believes that laypeople could possibly understand what he is talking about. I don't sense that he is a self-righteous individual who wants to come across as ridiculously smart (he is, in fact, ridiculously smart). I think he really just doesn't get that trying to relate these concepts to people like me, who only made it through Calc A, cannot be done. Hence, large parts of the book left me absolutely lost. Even BJ, who was a math minor, said he wasn't keeping up and so he quit reading it. Consider this sentence: ""The idea of string theory is that by doing calculations in these sigma models and summing up the results over all possible Riemann surfaces E (that is, over all possible paths of the strings propagating in a fixed space-time S) we can reproduce the physics that we observe in space-time S."" Honestly, I wish this particular sentence, which I chose at random, was a stand-apart in terms of its difficulty, but the truth is that much of this book is written in this language with ten unfamiliar concepts thrown together in the same sentence, all with the assumption that we must understand what the heck he is talking about. The redeeming points of the book were the interspersed memoir portions, which were extremely interesting. Frenkel was born in the Soviet Union and endured intense antisemitism at practically every turn in his education, but still prevailed and eventually traveled to Harvard and then to UC-Berkeley with professorships. I very much loved hearing about his experiences growing up, in college, working with colleagues, and his personal excitement about solving mathematical problems. It was only that he felt the need to then delve INTO those problems with technical language that made this book a disappointment--along with the fact that I didn't feel it delivered what it originally promised.In the end, I walked away appreciating Edward Frenkel's personal story. However, I did NOT end up appreciating math anymore than I ever did before, which was precisely why I decided to read the book in the first place. Unless you're ready to skip some major portions or else you're a mathematician, I don't recommend this book to you. This book is truly written for mathematicians, not laypeople, as it was so described."
224,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28285354-ron,3,"Love and Math: The Heart of Hidden Reality by Edward FrenkelThis is the story of a young boy of 12 who loved quantum physics, but not math. When he learned that the quark was found by using math, he decided to study math. He grew up a 100 miles from Moscow and he was Jewish. He was a very bright student and when he finished public school, he went to Moscow to take the test to enter the Moscow State University but at that time MSU discriminated against the Jewish people and when Edward went to take the test, he was taken to a room by two of the testers and given an oral exam and the testers did not like the correct answers he gave to the questions, so he failed the entrance exam. Later one of the testers came to him and told him that he could get into Moscow Institute of Oil and Gas, where they also had a good applied mathematics school and even used some of the professors who taught at MSU. He was accepted to the Moscow Institute of Oil and Gas and in his second year there he solved a difficult problem and it was brought to the attention of one of the MSU top mathematician professors. He solved an even more advanced math problem that this professor gave him and he wrote his first juried math paper for the Journal of Mathematics. Soon, he received a three month invitation to learn at Harvard. He was on his way to becoming a top flight mathematician. He worked on the Langlands program to unify various branches of mathematics. Edward and other mathematicians worked to unify number theory and harmonic analysis. Frankel uses two irrational numbers to construct a system of hybrid numbers in which one term is rational and the other term is a rational multiple of the irrational numbers. These numbers are now constructed into a new numeral system called a “number field”, and they form a mathematical structure called the “Galois group” of the polynomial equation. An analysis of this Galois group can produce solutions of harmonic analysis (a more sophisticated version of the study of sines and cosines.) Frenkel and his group of mathematicians in the Langlands program are producing solutions that will tie other mathematical branches together. Edward presents these mathematical equations equal to oil paintings and sculptures exhibited in museums throughout the world. The book is well written and the explanations go a long way forward to knowing about the mathematical solutions presented. I believe you would need a bachelor of mathematics degree or equivalent in order to see the “Mona Lisa” Frenkel has presented here. "
225,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1856047-jonna-higgins-freese,5,"I can't say I understand The Langlands Program any more now than I did before, except that it has something to do with sheaves and making it possible to ""translate"" between different areas of mathematics. I also picked up that the mathematics has some real-world implications in terms of symmetry and quantum physics, which I'd already picked up on from reading _The God Particle._ Unlike many of the other reviewers, I enjoyed the way he narrated his own engagement with and love of mathematics -- before I could love math myself, I needed to understand how anyone could love it, and I felt he did a good job of showing what it's like to be a person who loves mathematics.There were several interesting quotes --Thoreau: ""We have heard about the poetry of mathematics, but very little of it has yet been sung."" (A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers, cited on p. 228 of L&M)p. 241: ""Albert Einstein wrote, 'Every one who is seriously involved in thepursuit of science becomes convinced that some spirit is manifest in the laws of the Universe -- a spirit vastly superior to that of man, and one in the face of which we with our modest powers must feel humble.' And Isaac Newton expressed his feelings this way: 'to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the seashore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.'""My dream is that one day we will all awaken to this hidden reality. We may then perhaps be able to set aside our differences and focus on the profound truths that unite us. Then, we will all be like children playing on the seashore, marveling at the dazzling beauty and harmony we discover, share, and cherish together.""And this is what I love about reading books about math and science whose content I can barely understand -- it puts my life into perspective. When I'm frustrated about a completely illogical decision at work, or asked to accomplish something without the tools to do so, or when I feel that my life is spent in entirely too much make-work that takes me away from my children, reading such books for a few minutes before bed each night puts things into a larger perspective, opens up the world so that I feel I have space to breathe again."
226,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91748031-hobart-mariner,3,"As a personal memoir, this book is a both good and a bit frustrating. As a lay introduction to the ideas behind general advanced mathematics, and in particular the Langlands program (and its ties to string and superstring theory), it is very good, if a little daunting toward the end.In the early parts, the author does a very fine job of describing the hideous antisemitism that he encountered in the Soviet Union of the 1980s and how it prevented a generation of young Jewish mathematicians from developing to their fullest. He does a good job of recounting the unfairness of the oral examinations that prevented him from attending the Moscow State University Mechanics and Mathematics Department. In particular, his losing admission over a farcically nitpicky definition of circle (""the set of all points equidistant from a fixed point"" instead of ""the set of points equidistant from a fixed point"") serves as an illustration of the utter absurdity of this system. Later on, in the United States, he and several other Russian-Jewish mathematicians are given an opportunity to get back at the antisemitic Rector of MSU and this provides a satisfying and compelling scene.The author also presents warm and personal sketches of the mentors who helped him both to learn mathematics and to escape the clutches of this oppressive system. The author, for one who showed such incredible ability so young, is admirably free of vanity regarding his career, constantly giving credit to his advisors, teachers, and fellow students. There are a few personal bits that could have used more fleshing out (in particular, when he meets Feigin's family, he mentions that he would come to become very close with them, but the reader doesn't really see this). I thought that the depiction of the life of the ""Kerosinka"" was very interesting, an applied math hub full of frustrated young pure mathematicians. I thought that Yakov Khurgin, the charismatic probabilist studying with physicians to ensure his own access to medical care, made a very sympathetic character. It was poignant when the author described leaving his paltry instructorship (obtained by Khurgin with some difficulty) at the Kerosinka behind to study at Harvard. After the author moves to the United States, the story becomes a bit less personal and instead becomes more of a purely popular scientific book. Of the first twelve chapters, several are completely given over to mathematical exposition (some without any mention of the author's personal history). Yet it felt as I read it that after the author moves to Cambridge in Chapter 13, the book became much less personal. This corresponds with the author's life becoming less contingent and unstable, and maybe as a consequence less interesting. He sketches a few scenes of adjusting to life in the United States (being overwhelmed by the choices at a supermarket, learning colloquial English by watching David Letterman, walking around in jeans with a Walkman). I can't find it now but later on he provides a single paragraph of personal history, including marriage, divorce, and moving his Russian family to the United States. I would have liked to see a bit more of this, even if it has limited bearing on the mathematical parts of the memoir. As a work of mathematical exposition for a lay audience this book is quite successful, particularly in the earlier parts. (Disclaimer: I'm an academic mathematician, although in a different field of math than the author's.) I've seen many, many descriptions of the notion of symmetry group meant for lay audiences and I think that the author's stands out in terms of clarity. His own charming initial encounter with group theory (a mathematician friend of the family showing him the links the subject has with particle physics) might not make it easier for everyone else to comprehend, but at least gives an idea that the subject has meaning outside of the abstractions of pure math. He does a very fine job explaining the notions of groups, braid groups, fundamental group, modular arithmetic, and the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. I was quite impressed with his ability to describe Galois theory in relatively low-tech terms (in particular, he employs a wonderfully evocative metaphor involving the wings of a butterfly). The scientific exposition later on (in particular the bits with supersymmetry and string theory) were a bit harder for me to digest, but that doesn't mean he didn't present them in very clear terms. The main mathematical focus of the book is the Langlands Program, which the author repeatedly refers to as a Grand Unified Theory of Math, a description that overstates things slightly (there are several major fields of mathematics that do not really fall under the umbrella of the Langlands Program). It is no surprise that the author, one of the Langlands Program's superstars, does an excellent job laying out the basic ideas behind this ambitious research program. There are good explanations of Galois theory (mentioned above) and a solid example of how modular forms tie in to the subject. A bit more said about the general idea of modular forms might have been useful, but it's possible that it would be too technical for most readers. The author perhaps overloads a metaphor concerning people in Europe and North America, but not to the detriment of the books readability. I do think that it's possible readers with a limited mathematical background will get a bit lost in these sections, because they discuss fairly airy connections between subjects that have only briefly been sketched. There is a very good discussion of Weil's ""Rosetta stone"" in Chapter 9 that provides a nice backbone for all of the Langlands Program discussion. The last chapter, which contains a description of the author's screenplay (The Two-Body Problem) and short film (Rites of Love and Math), felt a bit disconnected from the rest of the book. His description of the screenwriting process is interesting and gives him the opportunity to credit yet another mentor. When he discusses the film-making process he employs a reconstructed dialogue with a French director which seems a bit artificial (similar to several other dialogues in the book). The film, which features a mathematician writing a powerful formula on the body of a woman, seems half-baked in its concept, although its clear that it means quite a lot to the author. It's a bit hard to see how this artsy, somewhat pretentious production is the best way to make someone feel the importance of math, when the author himself has done a good job in his earlier chapters making the reader feel the urgency of his initial mathematical work. A short film about a young Jewish mathematician in the Soviet Union trying with all his energy to get into MSU, prove a theorem, break into a lecture hall, etc. would be much more compelling and get across the feeling of doing math much better, in my opinion. He leaves out any mention of the minor controversy that the film provoked among feminist circles, instead offering platitudes like ""it's all in the eye of the bholder."" This section is larded with quotations from Thoreau, Einstein, etc, and overall is a bit flabby and formless in comparison with the rest of the book. Sort of disappointing that he chose to end on this note. "
227,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11253338-andrew,3,"This book was much more enjoyable when I gave up trying to understand.The author is clearly knowledgeable about mathematics. He is also very very passionate.The difficulty lies in informing the rest of us about his passion. A Nobel Laureate in Physics claims this book is ""very readable."" Which is great news, except I am not a Nobel Laureate in the realm Frenkel's work deals with.This is the struggle he faces: Mathematics is far larger and deeper than most people encounter. We are taught from a young age that math is ugly and mostly esoteric. Trying to overcome that by bringing up ideas that mean absolutely nothing to those who have not studied Algebraic Symmetries, Modular Forms, and Reimannian Surfaces is not effective.HOWEVER, when I accepted that I didn't have a clue what he was talking about, and chose to pay attention to the links between those ideas (which was his purpose), life got easier.The purpose of this book isn't to teach the reader mathematics, but to show how various ideas in mathematics are related, to the surprise of the rest of us. Math is about exotic connections and powerful generalizations, not calculation. In the 17th Chapter, Dr. Frenkel writes ""But my point is not for you to learn them all. Rather, I want to indicate the logical connections between these objects and show the creative process of scientists studying them: what drives them, how they learn from each other, how the knowledge they acquire is used to advance our understanding of the key questions.""THAT should have been in the introduction, alongside the anecdote of drunks and fractions. It would have made the rest SO MUCH easier. If the reader begins with that idea, then the book is wonderful. Math is beautiful, not because it is useful, but because it is the art of the universe itself. A famous sculptor (I believe it was Michelangelo) once said that the statue was already in the marble, he just discovered it. Many mathematicians feel that they do not create math, they find the rules that were already there. This book does a great job demonstrating that concept. Provided you ignore the footnotes and don't try to understand the math he is using to present this idea."
228,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3016981-girish,3,"There is a wave of ""pop-math"" books aimed at the interested amateur, and Edward Frenkel's memoir/masturbatory ode to math is a whirlwind tour of his life and research interests. Frenkel tries to acclimate the reader to the mathematical castle in the sky by attempting to avoid jargon and using commonplace examples to elucidate mathematical concepts (e.g. the ""symmetrical circle group"" as an example of a group).My main complaint is that I don't know who this book is for. I got out of what I wanted (and expected) - an increased appreciation for the thought patterns around math, a birds eye view of the Langland's Program, some interesting succinct definitions of mathematical concepts, and some cool visualizations. The autobiographical tidbits were interesting, but for orthogonal reasons (one of my coworkers is Russian Jewish and that got me interested in Frenkel's story; not to mention just how wrong what happened to him was).You won't learn any math from this book. It's an interesting foray into the emotional connection to math, so even though one of Frenkel's explicit goals is to demystify the intricate edifice of theory that is the Langland's Program, I'd say he failed in that endeavor. I suppose for the right person who really thinks of mathematics as SAT-style word problems, then it might be incredibly interesting to learn that it's much more artistic, revelatory, and exploratory.I'll note that Frenkel makes a couple claims in this book. First, the implicit claim that mathematical discoveries should be elevated in stature and aesthetic to the pyramids or hanging gardens, and second, that pure mathematical research is valuable but that we can't always perceive the applications immediately. I love #1 and hope that happens. #2 requires a more nuanced look, especially if it's used as justification for any and all theoretical mathematical research. Most math research, is (while beautiful/curious/amazing) useless.Mathematics used to occupy the highest stage of the cultural aristocracy as late as the 1800s, I wonder if it's time for a cultural resurgence. The gods of social status are fickle, so who knows? Math may become cool. If that's to be, than a broader appreciation for its beauty is necessary. "
229,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1849937-yofish,3,"Really 3.5.Written by a mathematician whose stated aim is to get his readers to understand what math is *really* about (as opposed to what one learns in school). The guy has had an interesting life. He was born in the USSR, and couldn't get into the ""right"" college (MGU) for math because he's Jewish. But he's able to muddle through, thanks to the large population of Jewish (and non-Jewish) mathematicians in Moscow who are used to getting around this exact problem. He's a really good mathematician and gets published and so on; but then he graduates and has the same problem---he can't get into a graduate school in the USSR because he's Jewish. Fortunately, he's just exactly the right age, and perestroika is starting, so when he gets invited to Harvard, he can go. (And eventually when he's visiting professorship is up, Harvard lets him be demoted to graduate student so that he can get his Ph.D.) While he was giving the more biographical story, I was pretty interested. But remember that his stated purpose was to introduce his math (the Langlands Program) to the layman. I can't really say whether he succeeded, as I skimmed through most of it. Not that I couldn't have understood (probably)---after all, I am a mathematician. The thing is, though, that if I was interested in that particular math, I would have studied it in grad school. The writing is a little choppy, which is surely understandable as English is his second language. But the editing is pretty poor, too---there seemed to be several places where he repeated himself without saying ""as I mentioned before"" or something similar. That was a little weird. He also seemed a little full of himself at times. There was a particular story, during his first year at Harvard, where the head of the dept of MGU is invited to MIT. That was (apparently) controversial at the time, as he wasn't supposed to be much of a mathematician, and he apparently was overseeing the rejection of Jews. There's sort of a public confrontation between him and the author. It was an interesting story--I'm a little surprised that I hadn't heard it before, as it happened while I was in grad school, and it's the kind of thing I might have noticed."
230,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18370648-mishehu,3,"Author writes, ""...we, mathematicians, need to do a better job of unlocking the power and beauty of our subject to a wider audience."" Alas, he himself resoundingly fails to do so. 5 stars for the autobiographical material in this book. The author's personal story -- and his mathematical biography -- are quite interesting. 1.5 stars for the exposition of mathematical ideas. Whatever pretense the author may have to being a math popularizer, he has many miles to travel in developing his expository chops before he can count himself among those of his colleagues who do this sort of thing well. I recently finished reading the second of Brian Greene's masterful books on cosmology -- books that are pitched to a highly interested readership willing to put in a serious readerly effort. Occasionally, in his books, Greene elaborates certain ideas in footnotes that are expressly written for ""mathematically inclined readers."" Nearly all of Frenkel's math discussion (in both the text and the footnotes of the book in review) are, whatever anyone may claim to the contrary, pitched to mathematically inclined readers. A few chapters in and the going is pretty much impossible for the lay reader. The best I can say about Frenkel's skills as a pop math expositor is that he did manage to convey an impression of what his mathematical research is about, of why it matters, and of why it's fascinating/inspiring. So, though I understood very little of the book, I did get something out of it (not simply insights into the author's personal story). But the investment of my time was poorly paid. All that said, Frenkel writes well, and his work really IS quite fascinating. I hope he'll continue to develop his pop writing skills, and I hope that future editors/publishers of his (and other first time pop math/sci authors) will give some thought to the target audience of books like these before they let manuscripts go to press."
231,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24055618-noah,5," Non-fiction books generally explain something that is true, or at least true for the author, about a particular topic. They can range from stories about people’s lives to discoveries that have been made, as well as pure factual information. One might expect non-fiction books to be purely facts and not memoirs, but that isn’t always the case. What surprised me about the book Love and Math is that this book was laid out in a different format that what I would expect from most non-fiction books. It’s laid out more like a novel, with chapters and memoirs and such. Love and Math by Edward Frenkel is a great nonfiction book mainly focusing on the symmetry groups in math of SO(3) and SO(n). Love and Math starts by easing the reader into advanced mathematics with the use of diagrams and symmetry, then gets into some more advanced ideas such as symmetry groups for higher dimensions. Love and Math is part thoughtful memoir, and part math textbook. Edward Frenkel mixes these two things perfectly to make an enticing book that just makes you want to read more. One of the main things that helped make the book so good was that Edward Frenkel had such an amazing childhood, he met famous mathematicians, he published papers, and faced tragedies such as being persecuted because he was Jewish. Edward Frenkel is an accomplished mathematician who wants to inspire other people to become mathematicians. I think that Edward Frenkel did an awesome job of explaining advanced mathematical concepts. I would give this book five stars and recommend this book to anyone who doesn’t mind curling up somewhere for a few hours while expanding their mind and having fun."

Some reviewers seemed uncomfortable with the neither-fish-nor-fowl feel - neither pure autobiography nor pure mathematics tome - but this approach worked well for me. Rather than simply describing the solution to a problem, the author takes the time to describe the thrill of finding an elegant solution to a problem on which you'd labored for weeks or months. Rather than just describing a mathematician's theories, the author provides sufficient details to get a feel for the mathematician as a person. I found this approach an effective way to help non-mathematicians connect to math and those who study it. I picked up this book because I was interested in Dr. Frenkel's experiences as a mathematician in the twilight years of the Soviet Union. Specifically, I wanted to learn more about the author's experiences with the harrowing, Kafkaesque Moscow State University (MGU) mathematics entrance examination, through which undesirable students (read: those of Jewish descent) were deliberately weeded out and denied admittance. This is exactly what happened to the author, and I was deeply impressed by his commitment to study math at any cost as well as his later willingness to speak out publicly against about these discriminatory policies. Bravo! It was also fascinating to read about how many Soviet mathematicians and others worked with and mentored students who had experienced discrimination, and how many of these students ended up immigrating to the West soon afterwards. As to mathematics, the author clearly loves what he does, and his love is infectious. While I didn't read the book primarily for this angle, I did gain a deeper appreciation of mathematics as well as the Langlands Program. Intriguing stuff! "
233,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5664087-john,3,"Edward Frenkel’s Love and Math joins a long list of mathematical memoirs. In the last two centuries many eminent mathematicians have attempted to describe what they do, why they do it and how they came to it. Without exception they fail the “what we do” test but often brilliantly succeed on why and how they came to mathematics. Mathematics does not admit casual observers. You have to do it to fully appreciate it and doing it at the levels Frenkel describes takes gifted minds years of hard work. “There are no royal roads to geometry.” Love and Math goes further than most in this genre. It doesn't flinch when a formula really helps and the end notes are detailed and reference laden enough to get you started on learning what’s really the deal with SO(3).The best part of the book deals with the author’s start in mathematics as a precious Russian teenager. Frenkel's father was Jewish and this created problems. The Soviet Union, in addition to being a murderous totalitarian state, was overtly anti-Semitic. Scholars of Jewish descent faced “extra” hurdles when it came to university admissions and securing jobs. Frenkel’s account of his MGU exam should be required reading for every leftist imbecile in the west. It clearly shows that secondary school mathematics was taught at levels far beyond the execrable Common Core, (affirmative action), standard now being pushed in the US and that bureaucrats can always find ways to exclude even the best of “undesirables.” Love and Math is an entertaining, enlightening and important book."
234,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8824504-leslie,3,"This one was between 3 and 3.5 stars.At the beginning of the novel the author states that he hopes to accomplish two things: first he hopes to convey his love of math and then he hopes to imbue this love into the reader. These are lofty goals. He is successful in the former but falls a bit short in the latter. The novel is part memoir and is is perhaps the most interesting section of the book. Frenkle's tale of overcoming the anti Semitic policy of the Soviet Union is incredibly moving. His love of mathematics is earnestly depicted and you root for his success in the face of adversity. The other parts of the novel focus on his contribution to the Langlands program and here I found that the quality varied. The math is certainly an important contribution but he only succeeded at making about half of it accessible to me. I will openly admit that my affinity for mathematics is limited to applied math. It is important for me to understand the context behind the concepts and unfortunately certain aspects where too abstract. I could not help but compare it to Hawking's works which successfully engaged my interest and made the esoteric aspects of quantum mechanics and physics accessible to the layperson. His works made me love physics and cosmology while this book only somewhat piqued my interest. However, I recommend the book for those interested in obtaining a peek into the mysterious world of mathematics. I believe it is an important field and completely agree with the author that it should be taught in a more engaging way. "
235,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51268208-akbar-gumbira,3,"This book is not for everyone.Through this book, the author (Edward Frenkel) tried to explain a lot of mathematical concepts in layman's terms. But no matter how hard he tried, it's just not for everyone. I have no background in mathematics or physics (as a degree) and I find it hard to understand many concepts told in the book. Though I still could follow some concepts such as generating function, fermat's little and last theorem, RSA, and most of the number theory part since I thought myself in high school some high level mathematics for olympiad. But when it comes to concepts such as Langlands program, Galois group, and the links to quantum duality, I just skim-read it.But we couldn't help it. Edward is a world-renowned and gifted mathematician. He's already working on unsolved mathematical problems since he's in college, had a patent in his 4th year in college (or 5th year I forgot exactly), and invited to Harvard in his early 20's. Things that are obvious to him, and perhaps that he also thinks to others, might not be that obvious to the readers.Apart from that, I enjoyed his personal story, telling the readers about anti-semitism in Soviet Union, his first time in Harvard (spending 45 minutes at the supermarket to just buy salt), how the project went to link quantum dualities and the Langlands program, his film-making story, and how he perceives mathematics in general.Oh I found many typos! I wonder if he's in a rush to publish it?"
236,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15546947-haydee-romero,0,"I picked up this book because love and math are two words I have never used in the same sentence. Math intimidates me but reading Frenkel’s introduction he made it clear that the goal and target audience was me! A person who fears the word math, “If you think that math is hard, that you won’t get it, if you are terrified by math but at the same time curious whether there is something worth knowing- then this book is for you.” Frenkel says that math is at the heart of love and his tone and acknowledgement of his audience made me comfortable starting the book. Frenkel did a great job at breaking down COMPLEX math equations and idea BUT it was not enough for me, personally. I would have to put the book down, reread the paragraph to grasp the concept. I would but I had to think about it... a lot. Frenkel did an amazing job of integrating his personal journey as a mathematician and the math equations he explained. It was clear throughout his book that he knew his audience were not mathematicians. Frenkel would define words that may have a different meaning in the math field. He would apply theories to concepts we may know about or explain what they are used for. I have learned and gained a much greater respect to the subject of math. I would use this book as an example of how keeping who your audience is when writing a piece makes a big difference and is so important. "
237,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1357119-david,4,"1. Frenkel and his friends would scale 20 foot walls in order to sneak into mathematics lectures - this increases my faith in humanity.2. The portrait of how Frenkel and his kindred spirits were able to find one another and prosper in the USSR is absolutely fascinating. He and his friends would tear through their official duties in no time and get real work done while operating within their largely informal and much less hierarchical intellectual network. This also increases my faith in humanity.3. On a less happy note, Frenkel's experience illuminates the weaknesses of the rigid (and far too common) approach to mathematical education. It is possible to reach some individuals even when mathematical concepts are taught as pure abstractions - you can reach people who focus intensely on discreet tasks and who follow instructions first and ask questions later. Others, however, learn through a much more context-driven approach. If you present them with a new abstract concept and fail to connect it to what they have learned before or demonstrate how it can be visualized or applied, they are going to struggle. Frenkel found wonderful mentors who helped him see math as an area to explore rather than an area where one duplicates rote instructions - I sure didn't find anyone like that, and I doubt many others do either."
238,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22906182-kat-steiner,3,"Argh, finally finished this book. Unsurprisingly, it does not work as an audiobook. Do not buy it from Audible.I think when I got it, I believed it was more of a book about mathematicians or a fictionalised autobiography, than a book about maths. It's sort of both, but there is a fair amount of actual maths (and significantly advanced maths, at that). And that's just impossible to make sense of while listening. Particularly as the narrator, Tony Craine, clearly has absolutely no idea what he is saying, so his emphasis is often totally off, or he reads things in a way that doesn't distinguish where brackets would be, so it's just impossible to follow no matter how hard you listen - there's not enough information conveyed.The story itself I really enjoyed - it was a fascinating account of education and anti-semitism in Soviet Russia, as well as great insight into the lives of professional mathematicians. I did a maths degree so I can't comment on how it would come across to the layman, but I found the actual maths a bit hard-going and uninteresting - these are difficult, complicated concepts that weren't very interesting when you can't get into either the nitty-gritty or appreciate the broader concepts.A bit of a mixed bag. Quite enjoyable in parts, but I'm glad to be done. Don't get the audiobook."
239,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10145524-charles-daney,5,"The love referred to is mainly for mathematics, though there is one chapter on the human-related form. The first chapters are about Frenkel's struggles to get a math education in the last years of the Soviet Union. He had to literally climb fences to get access to the best seminars and experts. Most of the book deals with his primary interest: an extremely esoteric, but important, area of current research, known as the ""Langlands Program"". I really enjoyed his presentation, since this is one of my main interests also, and this is the best ""nontechnical"" explanation I've ever seen of the subject. It made things a lot clearer for me. The basic idea is that there are very deep relationships among a number of mathematical concepts that on the surface seem quite unrelated. And besides that, there may be important applications to particle physics theory. It could turn out that a lot of why fundamental physics works the way it does is a result of mathematical relationships. Someday before too long (I hope), I can write about the Langlands Program on my math blog. It's related to stuff I've already written about there (number theory). I find that the best way to learn about new things is to write about them - as a process of explaining the subject to myself."
240,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7412717-suzie-shatarevyan,3,"Not exactly what I was expecting when I picked up this book. I've always loved math, but reading this book hasn't made me want to run and become a mathematician. Half the book reads like a memoir, which I didn't mind as I enjoy that genre, but like I said, not what I was expecting. Pure, 'non-practictal' math is impossible to grasp for the non mathematician and there's a lot of that in this book. Frenkel does try to explain using analogies, but that's not always possible. In one instance, when referring to a formula he wrote, he concedes that maybe only 10 or 12 people in the entire world can understand it. Not even math students will get it! On the other hand, I have become familiarized with a lot of math theories that is being studied in the last 50 years, so I'm still glad I read this book. It's obvious Frenkel has a deep passion for his field. You have to be extremely passionate to devote years and years looking for discoveries and connections in things that seem unrelated. This is still pretty accessible and if you want to see math like you've never seen in the classroom, give it a shot. Definitely mind-expanding."
241,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67447577-joseph-schrock,4,"This book was tough reading for me. I'm a mathematical hobbyist -- not a professional mathematician. This book discussed lots of things concerning which I had zero knowledge. It dealt with groups, symmetries, topology, etc. All of those are (for the most part) beyond my level of training. I've gotten moderately far into elementary number theory -- dealing with modular arithmetic, encryption, and even some into quadratic reciprocity (for which I've not managed to master the proofs). Frenkel's book might be a good book for a professional mathematician, but laymen will find it tough going -- except for the biographical aspects of the book, which are very nicely written. As for myself, if I'd known how tough this book is, I would likely not have bought it. But then, I'm not a professional mathematician or mathematics student. "
242,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30252254-shivam-agarwal,4,Simply amazing. This is the first Math book I have read which is written in the form of biography. Now this engages reader and encourages readers to hold on when Math part kicks in.I would suggest the book to second year undergraduates specially who are reading discrete mathematics for the first time. The works of author will give the idea about applications of the subject.
243,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7226831-josh-friedlander,3,"There are basically two ways to write popular books on difficult topics: cut and simplify to make it accessible to anyone, or just pour in details and hope that readers will move on despite not grasping all the fine points. This book is decidedly of the second group. The author interleaves with the difficult parts a memoir of growing up a prodigy in the USSR, facing discrimination and eventually escaping to a visiting position at Harvard despite not having finished his undergrad(!) He talks about his involvement in the Langlands Program, an attempt at a sort of Grand Unified Theory of Maths, and attempts to convey the beauty and excitement he finds in it. Starting with symmetry and groups, Frenkel rapidly progresses into the heart of contemporary mathematics: Lie algebras, Riemann surfaces, elliptic curves in the complex plane, n-branes, quantum field applications of theorised supersymmetries, and much more. I would lie if I claimed to have grasped it all, but I got a lot out of following the threads in each chapter as far as I could, stopping, rereading and Wikipedia-ing. This book works best as a subjective, impassioned introduction to what mathematicians work on all day, and what might make someone want to join them."

It was also interesting to learn how apparently closely related are math and the laws of nature.Unfortunately I did not particularly enjoy lengthy chapters on particular mathematical research and results – I felt it was inconsistent with the more lyric chapters. In that sense the book didn't provide optimal reading flow for me. I also felt that the couple last chapters did not really fit well with the rest of the book and felt a bit tacky.I would've given this 2 stars, or maybe even 1 star, if not for the first several chapters."
245,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27423393-andrew-derbak,2,"While I put down and picked up this book over time, it was mostly due to the confusion of the cover and description of the book and the story that was unfolding. At the end, I did enjoy reading the autobiographical parts and the maths that I could comprehend, but I would not recommend this book to just the average reader. I have a two star rating because even though it was enjoyable, the purpose of the book is very misleading. "

250,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30982871-james-f,4,"Edward Frenkel, Love and Math [2013] 306 pages [Kindle]I read this amazing book more or less by accident; I was testing the direct download link in the library catalogue and this is the book I happened to download to my Kindle. I started looking through it and the preface convinced me to read it. Frenkel is a mathematician, born in the U.S.S.R. and now at Berkeley, who is working on something called the ""Langlands Project"". He begins by discussing the fact that otherwise well-educated people who would never brag that they hated literature or art or music seem proud to say they ""hate math"", and admit they know nothing about it; and he suggests that the reason is the way it is taught. He uses the analogy, suppose you took a course in Art, and instead of showing you the works of Rembrandt and Van Gogh they spent the entire class teaching you to paint -- fences. Would you be interested in pursuing art? But this is the way that math is generally taught -- as a practical collection of tools for doing other (mostly boring) things. The ""masterpieces"" of math are never mentioned. He also points out that most of the math which is taught in high school and even the early years of college dates from the ancient Greeks or the early modern period -- current work is never mentioned; it's as if a physics course ended with the work of Galileo and Newton, and gave the impression that everything in physics was already discovered and all that was left was to use it for practical engineering. Then he goes on to talk about popular science writers, such as Stephen Hawking or Brian Greene, who present the exciting developments of contemporary work in physics for the layperson, and asks why there are so few if any popularizations of work at the frontiers of contemporary math. He warns of the political dangers of allowing a small elite to monopolize knowledge of mathematics in an age when all our lives depend more than ever before on applications of math, from the Internet to Wall Street; he suggests that a mathematically literate population would not be so easily taken in by the doubletalk of the bankers and politicians. That is the gap he is trying to fill with this book. The focus is on his own work on the Langlands Project, and like the physics books of Kip Thorne or Leonard Susskind, he includes much of his own experiences. In the first few chapters, he explains how he became interested in math as a high school student; how he was denied entry into the more prestigious schools because he was Jewish, and the official academic world in the era of the final decay of the Soviet bureaucracy was highly anti-Semitic; how he was privately mentored by some of the great Soviet mathematicians, who were opposed to anti-Semitism, including the legendary Israel Gelfand, who was himself Jewish; how he worked in private and more or less secretly on group theory, and sent his first papers abroad; how he was invited to Harvard in the first months of perestroika under Gorbachev, where he became a Visiting Professor before he had even become a grad student; and how he came in contact with the Langlands Project. After that, the book is largely a popular account of the Langlands Project itself. While popular physics books try to avoid math, a popular math book of course has to be about math, and I learned much from this book. At the beginning, his explanations are very clear, and make ideas like modulo arithmetic, finite fields, Lie groups and Riemann surfaces understandable (some of the very subjects I had trouble with in reading Penrose's The Road to Reality). Later on, the book becomes more difficult to follow and his explanations of vector spaces and representations were briefer and less clear; by the end he is mentioning things like fiber bundles and automorphic functions without any explanation at all. If we keep in mind the comparison to someone like Brian Greene, though, it is hard to fault this too much; no one expects to actually learn quantum theory or string theory from a popular science book, and we shouldn't expect to learn advanced math from a book like this -- what we want to learn is what in general it is about, what the questions are and what sort of research is going on, and he is very good at that. His observations that sets, functions and numbers have been left behind for categories, sheaves and vector spaces was interesting; something like the way classical physics gave way to quantum theory. Quantum theory and string theory are here, as the ""fourth column"" of the Langlands Program; the author has collaborated with physicist-mathematicians such as Edward Witten on the connections between the two fields. So what is the Langlands Program? Essentially, it is a program to discover patterns common to various seemingly unrelated branches of mathematics (and recently physics), in particular to relate group theory and curves over finite fields to subjects like harmonic analysis and Riemann surfaces. If you don't know what these things are -- that's evidence for his thesis. "
251,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86000064-stephanie,4,"I think I am too dumb for this book but I enjoyed what I could understand! It's clear Frenkel has a lot of infectious passion for his work, and I liked his explanations"
252,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42063497-christina,3,"Yes, most of the mathematics in this book is hard. Edward Frenkel's work is cutting-edge mathematical research, after all, with applications in quantum mechanics, so it's no walk in the park. I give him credit for even attempting to explain it to a lay audience. As he states in ""A Guide for the Reader"", you can skip the sections and chapters that deal with the math. I think most readers of this book will end up doing so at some point, mainly enjoying the biographical parts.Frenkel's point in writing this book, as he explains in the ""Preface"", is to share his love for mathematics with an audience who doesn't get to see much of its hidden beauty. He does this by taking the reader on the journey that led him to mathematics, starting with a friend of his father's who taught Frenkle about symmetries and braid groups when he was in his late teens. This sparked his lifelong passion for math, and we learn all about the obstacles thrown into his path by the Soviet system that made it next to impossible for a son of a Jew to study or work in research mathematics. Luckily, he was the right age to take advantage of Perestroika, and then the collapse of the Soviet Union, and was able to both finish his studies and find an academic position in the United States.We get introduced to the main project in Frankel's career, the Langlands Program, in chapter 8, ""Magic Numbers,"" where a lot of background is given. The Langlands Program, if finished, will link together several fields of mathematics that seem unrelated on the surface. This is difficult to do and pretty rare. The background leading up to this is wide-ranging, and Frenkle tries to simplify his explanations as much as possible, but this is where the abstract nature of advanced mathematics is probably going to confuse most of his audience. In a mere 15 pages, you get a high-level whirlwind tour of the Galois groups, how the Shimura-Taniyama-Weil conjecture was used to prove Fermat's Last Theorem, how this conjecture is a general result for finding the generating function of cubic equations (using the generating function of the Fibonacci numbers as an analogy), and how it is a special case of the Langlands Program. I had to read chapter 8 very carefully and slowly, but I got the gist of it, if not a deep understanding. By the next chapter, where he introduces Lie (pronounced ""lee"") groups and algebras, I admit I was lost.The remaining math sections left me feeling like Frenkel was Beethoven, explaining how he had composed his symphonies, while I was the novice student who had finished a basic course in music theory, and knew how to play ""Für Elise"" but not much else. While his enthusiasm for mathematics and his life's work are all obvious, I just cannot appreciate the depth or the details on the same level. I found this discouraging and more than a little frustrating, because I wanted to see the same beauty that he did. I did appreciate the journey he has taken to get to this point, and the real-life depiction of how mathematical research is actually done - sometimes painfully slowly. Perhaps after some years of study I will be able to appreciate the mathematical sections just as much as the biographical ones."
253,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5931241-jenny,2,"This author was a guest on the Colbert Report, which is when I first learned of his book. He described the concept so passionately, and he argued that mathematics has been so misunderstood because it isn't given its fair due in K-12 school curricula. Frenkel is disillusioned that the general masses don't appreciate math, and he set out to conquer our hearts with this book. He stated that this book was written specifically for people like me, laypeople who have never had the opportunity to give math a fair shake because all they learn are boring basic concepts in school and they never see the true beauty of it. He compared it to taking an art class in which you only get to paint a fence and are never actually shown the works of great artists. Fair enough, I thought. I'll give it a try.By chapter three, I realized that Edward Frenkel is a misguided genius who truly believes that laypeople could possibly understand what he is talking about. I don't sense that he is a self-righteous individual who wants to come across as ridiculously smart (he is, in fact, ridiculously smart). I think he really just doesn't get that trying to relate these concepts to people like me, who only made it through Calc A, cannot be done. Hence, large parts of the book left me absolutely lost. Even BJ, who was a math minor, said he wasn't keeping up and so he quit reading it. Consider this sentence: ""The idea of string theory is that by doing calculations in these sigma models and summing up the results over all possible Riemann surfaces E (that is, over all possible paths of the strings propagating in a fixed space-time S) we can reproduce the physics that we observe in space-time S."" Honestly, I wish this particular sentence, which I chose at random, was a stand-apart in terms of its difficulty, but the truth is that much of this book is written in this language with ten unfamiliar concepts thrown together in the same sentence, all with the assumption that we must understand what the heck he is talking about. The redeeming points of the book were the interspersed memoir portions, which were extremely interesting. Frenkel was born in the Soviet Union and endured intense antisemitism at practically every turn in his education, but still prevailed and eventually traveled to Harvard and then to UC-Berkeley with professorships. I very much loved hearing about his experiences growing up, in college, working with colleagues, and his personal excitement about solving mathematical problems. It was only that he felt the need to then delve INTO those problems with technical language that made this book a disappointment--along with the fact that I didn't feel it delivered what it originally promised.In the end, I walked away appreciating Edward Frenkel's personal story. However, I did NOT end up appreciating math anymore than I ever did before, which was precisely why I decided to read the book in the first place. Unless you're ready to skip some major portions or else you're a mathematician, I don't recommend this book to you. This book is truly written for mathematicians, not laypeople, as it was so described."
254,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28285354-ron,3,"Love and Math: The Heart of Hidden Reality by Edward FrenkelThis is the story of a young boy of 12 who loved quantum physics, but not math. When he learned that the quark was found by using math, he decided to study math. He grew up a 100 miles from Moscow and he was Jewish. He was a very bright student and when he finished public school, he went to Moscow to take the test to enter the Moscow State University but at that time MSU discriminated against the Jewish people and when Edward went to take the test, he was taken to a room by two of the testers and given an oral exam and the testers did not like the correct answers he gave to the questions, so he failed the entrance exam. Later one of the testers came to him and told him that he could get into Moscow Institute of Oil and Gas, where they also had a good applied mathematics school and even used some of the professors who taught at MSU. He was accepted to the Moscow Institute of Oil and Gas and in his second year there he solved a difficult problem and it was brought to the attention of one of the MSU top mathematician professors. He solved an even more advanced math problem that this professor gave him and he wrote his first juried math paper for the Journal of Mathematics. Soon, he received a three month invitation to learn at Harvard. He was on his way to becoming a top flight mathematician. He worked on the Langlands program to unify various branches of mathematics. Edward and other mathematicians worked to unify number theory and harmonic analysis. Frankel uses two irrational numbers to construct a system of hybrid numbers in which one term is rational and the other term is a rational multiple of the irrational numbers. These numbers are now constructed into a new numeral system called a “number field”, and they form a mathematical structure called the “Galois group” of the polynomial equation. An analysis of this Galois group can produce solutions of harmonic analysis (a more sophisticated version of the study of sines and cosines.) Frenkel and his group of mathematicians in the Langlands program are producing solutions that will tie other mathematical branches together. Edward presents these mathematical equations equal to oil paintings and sculptures exhibited in museums throughout the world. The book is well written and the explanations go a long way forward to knowing about the mathematical solutions presented. I believe you would need a bachelor of mathematics degree or equivalent in order to see the “Mona Lisa” Frenkel has presented here. "
255,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1856047-jonna-higgins-freese,5,"I can't say I understand The Langlands Program any more now than I did before, except that it has something to do with sheaves and making it possible to ""translate"" between different areas of mathematics. I also picked up that the mathematics has some real-world implications in terms of symmetry and quantum physics, which I'd already picked up on from reading _The God Particle._ Unlike many of the other reviewers, I enjoyed the way he narrated his own engagement with and love of mathematics -- before I could love math myself, I needed to understand how anyone could love it, and I felt he did a good job of showing what it's like to be a person who loves mathematics.There were several interesting quotes --Thoreau: ""We have heard about the poetry of mathematics, but very little of it has yet been sung."" (A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers, cited on p. 228 of L&M)p. 241: ""Albert Einstein wrote, 'Every one who is seriously involved in thepursuit of science becomes convinced that some spirit is manifest in the laws of the Universe -- a spirit vastly superior to that of man, and one in the face of which we with our modest powers must feel humble.' And Isaac Newton expressed his feelings this way: 'to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the seashore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.'""My dream is that one day we will all awaken to this hidden reality. We may then perhaps be able to set aside our differences and focus on the profound truths that unite us. Then, we will all be like children playing on the seashore, marveling at the dazzling beauty and harmony we discover, share, and cherish together.""And this is what I love about reading books about math and science whose content I can barely understand -- it puts my life into perspective. When I'm frustrated about a completely illogical decision at work, or asked to accomplish something without the tools to do so, or when I feel that my life is spent in entirely too much make-work that takes me away from my children, reading such books for a few minutes before bed each night puts things into a larger perspective, opens up the world so that I feel I have space to breathe again."
256,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91748031-hobart-mariner,3,"As a personal memoir, this book is a both good and a bit frustrating. As a lay introduction to the ideas behind general advanced mathematics, and in particular the Langlands program (and its ties to string and superstring theory), it is very good, if a little daunting toward the end.In the early parts, the author does a very fine job of describing the hideous antisemitism that he encountered in the Soviet Union of the 1980s and how it prevented a generation of young Jewish mathematicians from developing to their fullest. He does a good job of recounting the unfairness of the oral examinations that prevented him from attending the Moscow State University Mechanics and Mathematics Department. In particular, his losing admission over a farcically nitpicky definition of circle (""the set of all points equidistant from a fixed point"" instead of ""the set of points equidistant from a fixed point"") serves as an illustration of the utter absurdity of this system. Later on, in the United States, he and several other Russian-Jewish mathematicians are given an opportunity to get back at the antisemitic Rector of MSU and this provides a satisfying and compelling scene.The author also presents warm and personal sketches of the mentors who helped him both to learn mathematics and to escape the clutches of this oppressive system. The author, for one who showed such incredible ability so young, is admirably free of vanity regarding his career, constantly giving credit to his advisors, teachers, and fellow students. There are a few personal bits that could have used more fleshing out (in particular, when he meets Feigin's family, he mentions that he would come to become very close with them, but the reader doesn't really see this). I thought that the depiction of the life of the ""Kerosinka"" was very interesting, an applied math hub full of frustrated young pure mathematicians. I thought that Yakov Khurgin, the charismatic probabilist studying with physicians to ensure his own access to medical care, made a very sympathetic character. It was poignant when the author described leaving his paltry instructorship (obtained by Khurgin with some difficulty) at the Kerosinka behind to study at Harvard. After the author moves to the United States, the story becomes a bit less personal and instead becomes more of a purely popular scientific book. Of the first twelve chapters, several are completely given over to mathematical exposition (some without any mention of the author's personal history). Yet it felt as I read it that after the author moves to Cambridge in Chapter 13, the book became much less personal. This corresponds with the author's life becoming less contingent and unstable, and maybe as a consequence less interesting. He sketches a few scenes of adjusting to life in the United States (being overwhelmed by the choices at a supermarket, learning colloquial English by watching David Letterman, walking around in jeans with a Walkman). I can't find it now but later on he provides a single paragraph of personal history, including marriage, divorce, and moving his Russian family to the United States. I would have liked to see a bit more of this, even if it has limited bearing on the mathematical parts of the memoir. As a work of mathematical exposition for a lay audience this book is quite successful, particularly in the earlier parts. (Disclaimer: I'm an academic mathematician, although in a different field of math than the author's.) I've seen many, many descriptions of the notion of symmetry group meant for lay audiences and I think that the author's stands out in terms of clarity. His own charming initial encounter with group theory (a mathematician friend of the family showing him the links the subject has with particle physics) might not make it easier for everyone else to comprehend, but at least gives an idea that the subject has meaning outside of the abstractions of pure math. He does a very fine job explaining the notions of groups, braid groups, fundamental group, modular arithmetic, and the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. I was quite impressed with his ability to describe Galois theory in relatively low-tech terms (in particular, he employs a wonderfully evocative metaphor involving the wings of a butterfly). The scientific exposition later on (in particular the bits with supersymmetry and string theory) were a bit harder for me to digest, but that doesn't mean he didn't present them in very clear terms. The main mathematical focus of the book is the Langlands Program, which the author repeatedly refers to as a Grand Unified Theory of Math, a description that overstates things slightly (there are several major fields of mathematics that do not really fall under the umbrella of the Langlands Program). It is no surprise that the author, one of the Langlands Program's superstars, does an excellent job laying out the basic ideas behind this ambitious research program. There are good explanations of Galois theory (mentioned above) and a solid example of how modular forms tie in to the subject. A bit more said about the general idea of modular forms might have been useful, but it's possible that it would be too technical for most readers. The author perhaps overloads a metaphor concerning people in Europe and North America, but not to the detriment of the books readability. I do think that it's possible readers with a limited mathematical background will get a bit lost in these sections, because they discuss fairly airy connections between subjects that have only briefly been sketched. There is a very good discussion of Weil's ""Rosetta stone"" in Chapter 9 that provides a nice backbone for all of the Langlands Program discussion. The last chapter, which contains a description of the author's screenplay (The Two-Body Problem) and short film (Rites of Love and Math), felt a bit disconnected from the rest of the book. His description of the screenwriting process is interesting and gives him the opportunity to credit yet another mentor. When he discusses the film-making process he employs a reconstructed dialogue with a French director which seems a bit artificial (similar to several other dialogues in the book). The film, which features a mathematician writing a powerful formula on the body of a woman, seems half-baked in its concept, although its clear that it means quite a lot to the author. It's a bit hard to see how this artsy, somewhat pretentious production is the best way to make someone feel the importance of math, when the author himself has done a good job in his earlier chapters making the reader feel the urgency of his initial mathematical work. A short film about a young Jewish mathematician in the Soviet Union trying with all his energy to get into MSU, prove a theorem, break into a lecture hall, etc. would be much more compelling and get across the feeling of doing math much better, in my opinion. He leaves out any mention of the minor controversy that the film provoked among feminist circles, instead offering platitudes like ""it's all in the eye of the bholder."" This section is larded with quotations from Thoreau, Einstein, etc, and overall is a bit flabby and formless in comparison with the rest of the book. Sort of disappointing that he chose to end on this note. "
257,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11253338-andrew,3,"This book was much more enjoyable when I gave up trying to understand.The author is clearly knowledgeable about mathematics. He is also very very passionate.The difficulty lies in informing the rest of us about his passion. A Nobel Laureate in Physics claims this book is ""very readable."" Which is great news, except I am not a Nobel Laureate in the realm Frenkel's work deals with.This is the struggle he faces: Mathematics is far larger and deeper than most people encounter. We are taught from a young age that math is ugly and mostly esoteric. Trying to overcome that by bringing up ideas that mean absolutely nothing to those who have not studied Algebraic Symmetries, Modular Forms, and Reimannian Surfaces is not effective.HOWEVER, when I accepted that I didn't have a clue what he was talking about, and chose to pay attention to the links between those ideas (which was his purpose), life got easier.The purpose of this book isn't to teach the reader mathematics, but to show how various ideas in mathematics are related, to the surprise of the rest of us. Math is about exotic connections and powerful generalizations, not calculation. In the 17th Chapter, Dr. Frenkel writes ""But my point is not for you to learn them all. Rather, I want to indicate the logical connections between these objects and show the creative process of scientists studying them: what drives them, how they learn from each other, how the knowledge they acquire is used to advance our understanding of the key questions.""THAT should have been in the introduction, alongside the anecdote of drunks and fractions. It would have made the rest SO MUCH easier. If the reader begins with that idea, then the book is wonderful. Math is beautiful, not because it is useful, but because it is the art of the universe itself. A famous sculptor (I believe it was Michelangelo) once said that the statue was already in the marble, he just discovered it. Many mathematicians feel that they do not create math, they find the rules that were already there. This book does a great job demonstrating that concept. Provided you ignore the footnotes and don't try to understand the math he is using to present this idea."
258,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3016981-girish,3,"There is a wave of ""pop-math"" books aimed at the interested amateur, and Edward Frenkel's memoir/masturbatory ode to math is a whirlwind tour of his life and research interests. Frenkel tries to acclimate the reader to the mathematical castle in the sky by attempting to avoid jargon and using commonplace examples to elucidate mathematical concepts (e.g. the ""symmetrical circle group"" as an example of a group).My main complaint is that I don't know who this book is for. I got out of what I wanted (and expected) - an increased appreciation for the thought patterns around math, a birds eye view of the Langland's Program, some interesting succinct definitions of mathematical concepts, and some cool visualizations. The autobiographical tidbits were interesting, but for orthogonal reasons (one of my coworkers is Russian Jewish and that got me interested in Frenkel's story; not to mention just how wrong what happened to him was).You won't learn any math from this book. It's an interesting foray into the emotional connection to math, so even though one of Frenkel's explicit goals is to demystify the intricate edifice of theory that is the Langland's Program, I'd say he failed in that endeavor. I suppose for the right person who really thinks of mathematics as SAT-style word problems, then it might be incredibly interesting to learn that it's much more artistic, revelatory, and exploratory.I'll note that Frenkel makes a couple claims in this book. First, the implicit claim that mathematical discoveries should be elevated in stature and aesthetic to the pyramids or hanging gardens, and second, that pure mathematical research is valuable but that we can't always perceive the applications immediately. I love #1 and hope that happens. #2 requires a more nuanced look, especially if it's used as justification for any and all theoretical mathematical research. Most math research, is (while beautiful/curious/amazing) useless.Mathematics used to occupy the highest stage of the cultural aristocracy as late as the 1800s, I wonder if it's time for a cultural resurgence. The gods of social status are fickle, so who knows? Math may become cool. If that's to be, than a broader appreciation for its beauty is necessary. "
259,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1849937-yofish,3,"Really 3.5.Written by a mathematician whose stated aim is to get his readers to understand what math is *really* about (as opposed to what one learns in school). The guy has had an interesting life. He was born in the USSR, and couldn't get into the ""right"" college (MGU) for math because he's Jewish. But he's able to muddle through, thanks to the large population of Jewish (and non-Jewish) mathematicians in Moscow who are used to getting around this exact problem. He's a really good mathematician and gets published and so on; but then he graduates and has the same problem---he can't get into a graduate school in the USSR because he's Jewish. Fortunately, he's just exactly the right age, and perestroika is starting, so when he gets invited to Harvard, he can go. (And eventually when he's visiting professorship is up, Harvard lets him be demoted to graduate student so that he can get his Ph.D.) While he was giving the more biographical story, I was pretty interested. But remember that his stated purpose was to introduce his math (the Langlands Program) to the layman. I can't really say whether he succeeded, as I skimmed through most of it. Not that I couldn't have understood (probably)---after all, I am a mathematician. The thing is, though, that if I was interested in that particular math, I would have studied it in grad school. The writing is a little choppy, which is surely understandable as English is his second language. But the editing is pretty poor, too---there seemed to be several places where he repeated himself without saying ""as I mentioned before"" or something similar. That was a little weird. He also seemed a little full of himself at times. There was a particular story, during his first year at Harvard, where the head of the dept of MGU is invited to MIT. That was (apparently) controversial at the time, as he wasn't supposed to be much of a mathematician, and he apparently was overseeing the rejection of Jews. There's sort of a public confrontation between him and the author. It was an interesting story--I'm a little surprised that I hadn't heard it before, as it happened while I was in grad school, and it's the kind of thing I might have noticed."
260,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18370648-mishehu,3,"Author writes, ""...we, mathematicians, need to do a better job of unlocking the power and beauty of our subject to a wider audience."" Alas, he himself resoundingly fails to do so. 5 stars for the autobiographical material in this book. The author's personal story -- and his mathematical biography -- are quite interesting. 1.5 stars for the exposition of mathematical ideas. Whatever pretense the author may have to being a math popularizer, he has many miles to travel in developing his expository chops before he can count himself among those of his colleagues who do this sort of thing well. I recently finished reading the second of Brian Greene's masterful books on cosmology -- books that are pitched to a highly interested readership willing to put in a serious readerly effort. Occasionally, in his books, Greene elaborates certain ideas in footnotes that are expressly written for ""mathematically inclined readers."" Nearly all of Frenkel's math discussion (in both the text and the footnotes of the book in review) are, whatever anyone may claim to the contrary, pitched to mathematically inclined readers. A few chapters in and the going is pretty much impossible for the lay reader. The best I can say about Frenkel's skills as a pop math expositor is that he did manage to convey an impression of what his mathematical research is about, of why it matters, and of why it's fascinating/inspiring. So, though I understood very little of the book, I did get something out of it (not simply insights into the author's personal story). But the investment of my time was poorly paid. All that said, Frenkel writes well, and his work really IS quite fascinating. I hope he'll continue to develop his pop writing skills, and I hope that future editors/publishers of his (and other first time pop math/sci authors) will give some thought to the target audience of books like these before they let manuscripts go to press."
261,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24055618-noah,5," Non-fiction books generally explain something that is true, or at least true for the author, about a particular topic. They can range from stories about people’s lives to discoveries that have been made, as well as pure factual information. One might expect non-fiction books to be purely facts and not memoirs, but that isn’t always the case. What surprised me about the book Love and Math is that this book was laid out in a different format that what I would expect from most non-fiction books. It’s laid out more like a novel, with chapters and memoirs and such. Love and Math by Edward Frenkel is a great nonfiction book mainly focusing on the symmetry groups in math of SO(3) and SO(n). Love and Math starts by easing the reader into advanced mathematics with the use of diagrams and symmetry, then gets into some more advanced ideas such as symmetry groups for higher dimensions. Love and Math is part thoughtful memoir, and part math textbook. Edward Frenkel mixes these two things perfectly to make an enticing book that just makes you want to read more. One of the main things that helped make the book so good was that Edward Frenkel had such an amazing childhood, he met famous mathematicians, he published papers, and faced tragedies such as being persecuted because he was Jewish. Edward Frenkel is an accomplished mathematician who wants to inspire other people to become mathematicians. I think that Edward Frenkel did an awesome job of explaining advanced mathematical concepts. I would give this book five stars and recommend this book to anyone who doesn’t mind curling up somewhere for a few hours while expanding their mind and having fun."
262,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4922601-deborah-flores,5,"Very enjoyable! Some reviewers seemed uncomfortable with the neither-fish-nor-fowl feel - neither pure autobiography nor pure mathematics tome - but this approach worked well for me. Rather than simply describing the solution to a problem, the author takes the time to describe the thrill of finding an elegant solution to a problem on which you'd labored for weeks or months. Rather than just describing a mathematician's theories, the author provides sufficient details to get a feel for the mathematician as a person. I found this approach an effective way to help non-mathematicians connect to math and those who study it. I picked up this book because I was interested in Dr. Frenkel's experiences as a mathematician in the twilight years of the Soviet Union. Specifically, I wanted to learn more about the author's experiences with the harrowing, Kafkaesque Moscow State University (MGU) mathematics entrance examination, through which undesirable students (read: those of Jewish descent) were deliberately weeded out and denied admittance. This is exactly what happened to the author, and I was deeply impressed by his commitment to study math at any cost as well as his later willingness to speak out publicly against about these discriminatory policies. Bravo! It was also fascinating to read about how many Soviet mathematicians and others worked with and mentored students who had experienced discrimination, and how many of these students ended up immigrating to the West soon afterwards. As to mathematics, the author clearly loves what he does, and his love is infectious. While I didn't read the book primarily for this angle, I did gain a deeper appreciation of mathematics as well as the Langlands Program. Intriguing stuff! "
263,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5664087-john,3,"Edward Frenkel’s Love and Math joins a long list of mathematical memoirs. In the last two centuries many eminent mathematicians have attempted to describe what they do, why they do it and how they came to it. Without exception they fail the “what we do” test but often brilliantly succeed on why and how they came to mathematics. Mathematics does not admit casual observers. You have to do it to fully appreciate it and doing it at the levels Frenkel describes takes gifted minds years of hard work. “There are no royal roads to geometry.” Love and Math goes further than most in this genre. It doesn't flinch when a formula really helps and the end notes are detailed and reference laden enough to get you started on learning what’s really the deal with SO(3).The best part of the book deals with the author’s start in mathematics as a precious Russian teenager. Frenkel's father was Jewish and this created problems. The Soviet Union, in addition to being a murderous totalitarian state, was overtly anti-Semitic. Scholars of Jewish descent faced “extra” hurdles when it came to university admissions and securing jobs. Frenkel’s account of his MGU exam should be required reading for every leftist imbecile in the west. It clearly shows that secondary school mathematics was taught at levels far beyond the execrable Common Core, (affirmative action), standard now being pushed in the US and that bureaucrats can always find ways to exclude even the best of “undesirables.” Love and Math is an entertaining, enlightening and important book."
264,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8824504-leslie,3,"This one was between 3 and 3.5 stars.At the beginning of the novel the author states that he hopes to accomplish two things: first he hopes to convey his love of math and then he hopes to imbue this love into the reader. These are lofty goals. He is successful in the former but falls a bit short in the latter. The novel is part memoir and is is perhaps the most interesting section of the book. Frenkle's tale of overcoming the anti Semitic policy of the Soviet Union is incredibly moving. His love of mathematics is earnestly depicted and you root for his success in the face of adversity. The other parts of the novel focus on his contribution to the Langlands program and here I found that the quality varied. The math is certainly an important contribution but he only succeeded at making about half of it accessible to me. I will openly admit that my affinity for mathematics is limited to applied math. It is important for me to understand the context behind the concepts and unfortunately certain aspects where too abstract. I could not help but compare it to Hawking's works which successfully engaged my interest and made the esoteric aspects of quantum mechanics and physics accessible to the layperson. His works made me love physics and cosmology while this book only somewhat piqued my interest. However, I recommend the book for those interested in obtaining a peek into the mysterious world of mathematics. I believe it is an important field and completely agree with the author that it should be taught in a more engaging way. "
265,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51268208-akbar-gumbira,3,"This book is not for everyone.Through this book, the author (Edward Frenkel) tried to explain a lot of mathematical concepts in layman's terms. But no matter how hard he tried, it's just not for everyone. I have no background in mathematics or physics (as a degree) and I find it hard to understand many concepts told in the book. Though I still could follow some concepts such as generating function, fermat's little and last theorem, RSA, and most of the number theory part since I thought myself in high school some high level mathematics for olympiad. But when it comes to concepts such as Langlands program, Galois group, and the links to quantum duality, I just skim-read it.But we couldn't help it. Edward is a world-renowned and gifted mathematician. He's already working on unsolved mathematical problems since he's in college, had a patent in his 4th year in college (or 5th year I forgot exactly), and invited to Harvard in his early 20's. Things that are obvious to him, and perhaps that he also thinks to others, might not be that obvious to the readers.Apart from that, I enjoyed his personal story, telling the readers about anti-semitism in Soviet Union, his first time in Harvard (spending 45 minutes at the supermarket to just buy salt), how the project went to link quantum dualities and the Langlands program, his film-making story, and how he perceives mathematics in general.Oh I found many typos! I wonder if he's in a rush to publish it?"
266,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15546947-haydee-romero,0,"I picked up this book because love and math are two words I have never used in the same sentence. Math intimidates me but reading Frenkel’s introduction he made it clear that the goal and target audience was me! A person who fears the word math, “If you think that math is hard, that you won’t get it, if you are terrified by math but at the same time curious whether there is something worth knowing- then this book is for you.” Frenkel says that math is at the heart of love and his tone and acknowledgement of his audience made me comfortable starting the book. Frenkel did a great job at breaking down COMPLEX math equations and idea BUT it was not enough for me, personally. I would have to put the book down, reread the paragraph to grasp the concept. I would but I had to think about it... a lot. Frenkel did an amazing job of integrating his personal journey as a mathematician and the math equations he explained. It was clear throughout his book that he knew his audience were not mathematicians. Frenkel would define words that may have a different meaning in the math field. He would apply theories to concepts we may know about or explain what they are used for. I have learned and gained a much greater respect to the subject of math. I would use this book as an example of how keeping who your audience is when writing a piece makes a big difference and is so important. "
267,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1357119-david,4,"1. Frenkel and his friends would scale 20 foot walls in order to sneak into mathematics lectures - this increases my faith in humanity.2. The portrait of how Frenkel and his kindred spirits were able to find one another and prosper in the USSR is absolutely fascinating. He and his friends would tear through their official duties in no time and get real work done while operating within their largely informal and much less hierarchical intellectual network. This also increases my faith in humanity.3. On a less happy note, Frenkel's experience illuminates the weaknesses of the rigid (and far too common) approach to mathematical education. It is possible to reach some individuals even when mathematical concepts are taught as pure abstractions - you can reach people who focus intensely on discreet tasks and who follow instructions first and ask questions later. Others, however, learn through a much more context-driven approach. If you present them with a new abstract concept and fail to connect it to what they have learned before or demonstrate how it can be visualized or applied, they are going to struggle. Frenkel found wonderful mentors who helped him see math as an area to explore rather than an area where one duplicates rote instructions - I sure didn't find anyone like that, and I doubt many others do either."
268,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22906182-kat-steiner,3,"Argh, finally finished this book. Unsurprisingly, it does not work as an audiobook. Do not buy it from Audible.I think when I got it, I believed it was more of a book about mathematicians or a fictionalised autobiography, than a book about maths. It's sort of both, but there is a fair amount of actual maths (and significantly advanced maths, at that). And that's just impossible to make sense of while listening. Particularly as the narrator, Tony Craine, clearly has absolutely no idea what he is saying, so his emphasis is often totally off, or he reads things in a way that doesn't distinguish where brackets would be, so it's just impossible to follow no matter how hard you listen - there's not enough information conveyed.The story itself I really enjoyed - it was a fascinating account of education and anti-semitism in Soviet Russia, as well as great insight into the lives of professional mathematicians. I did a maths degree so I can't comment on how it would come across to the layman, but I found the actual maths a bit hard-going and uninteresting - these are difficult, complicated concepts that weren't very interesting when you can't get into either the nitty-gritty or appreciate the broader concepts.A bit of a mixed bag. Quite enjoyable in parts, but I'm glad to be done. Don't get the audiobook."
269,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10145524-charles-daney,5,"The love referred to is mainly for mathematics, though there is one chapter on the human-related form. The first chapters are about Frenkel's struggles to get a math education in the last years of the Soviet Union. He had to literally climb fences to get access to the best seminars and experts. Most of the book deals with his primary interest: an extremely esoteric, but important, area of current research, known as the ""Langlands Program"". I really enjoyed his presentation, since this is one of my main interests also, and this is the best ""nontechnical"" explanation I've ever seen of the subject. It made things a lot clearer for me. The basic idea is that there are very deep relationships among a number of mathematical concepts that on the surface seem quite unrelated. And besides that, there may be important applications to particle physics theory. It could turn out that a lot of why fundamental physics works the way it does is a result of mathematical relationships. Someday before too long (I hope), I can write about the Langlands Program on my math blog. It's related to stuff I've already written about there (number theory). I find that the best way to learn about new things is to write about them - as a process of explaining the subject to myself."
270,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7412717-suzie-shatarevyan,3,"Not exactly what I was expecting when I picked up this book. I've always loved math, but reading this book hasn't made me want to run and become a mathematician. Half the book reads like a memoir, which I didn't mind as I enjoy that genre, but like I said, not what I was expecting. Pure, 'non-practictal' math is impossible to grasp for the non mathematician and there's a lot of that in this book. Frenkel does try to explain using analogies, but that's not always possible. In one instance, when referring to a formula he wrote, he concedes that maybe only 10 or 12 people in the entire world can understand it. Not even math students will get it! On the other hand, I have become familiarized with a lot of math theories that is being studied in the last 50 years, so I'm still glad I read this book. It's obvious Frenkel has a deep passion for his field. You have to be extremely passionate to devote years and years looking for discoveries and connections in things that seem unrelated. This is still pretty accessible and if you want to see math like you've never seen in the classroom, give it a shot. Definitely mind-expanding."
271,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67447577-joseph-schrock,4,"This book was tough reading for me. I'm a mathematical hobbyist -- not a professional mathematician. This book discussed lots of things concerning which I had zero knowledge. It dealt with groups, symmetries, topology, etc. All of those are (for the most part) beyond my level of training. I've gotten moderately far into elementary number theory -- dealing with modular arithmetic, encryption, and even some into quadratic reciprocity (for which I've not managed to master the proofs). Frenkel's book might be a good book for a professional mathematician, but laymen will find it tough going -- except for the biographical aspects of the book, which are very nicely written. As for myself, if I'd known how tough this book is, I would likely not have bought it. But then, I'm not a professional mathematician or mathematics student. "
272,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30252254-shivam-agarwal,4,Simply amazing. This is the first Math book I have read which is written in the form of biography. Now this engages reader and encourages readers to hold on when Math part kicks in.I would suggest the book to second year undergraduates specially who are reading discrete mathematics for the first time. The works of author will give the idea about applications of the subject.
273,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7226831-josh-friedlander,3,"There are basically two ways to write popular books on difficult topics: cut and simplify to make it accessible to anyone, or just pour in details and hope that readers will move on despite not grasping all the fine points. This book is decidedly of the second group. The author interleaves with the difficult parts a memoir of growing up a prodigy in the USSR, facing discrimination and eventually escaping to a visiting position at Harvard despite not having finished his undergrad(!) He talks about his involvement in the Langlands Program, an attempt at a sort of Grand Unified Theory of Maths, and attempts to convey the beauty and excitement he finds in it. Starting with symmetry and groups, Frenkel rapidly progresses into the heart of contemporary mathematics: Lie algebras, Riemann surfaces, elliptic curves in the complex plane, n-branes, quantum field applications of theorised supersymmetries, and much more. I would lie if I claimed to have grasped it all, but I got a lot out of following the threads in each chapter as far as I could, stopping, rereading and Wikipedia-ing. This book works best as a subjective, impassioned introduction to what mathematicians work on all day, and what might make someone want to join them."

It was also interesting to learn how apparently closely related are math and the laws of nature.Unfortunately I did not particularly enjoy lengthy chapters on particular mathematical research and results – I felt it was inconsistent with the more lyric chapters. In that sense the book didn't provide optimal reading flow for me. I also felt that the couple last chapters did not really fit well with the rest of the book and felt a bit tacky.I would've given this 2 stars, or maybe even 1 star, if not for the first several chapters."

At the end, I did enjoy reading the autobiographical parts and the maths that I could comprehend, but I would not recommend this book to just the average reader. I have a two star rating because even though it was enjoyable, the purpose of the book is very misleading. "

280,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30982871-james-f,4,"Edward Frenkel, Love and Math [2013] 306 pages [Kindle]I read this amazing book more or less by accident; I was testing the direct download link in the library catalogue and this is the book I happened to download to my Kindle. I started looking through it and the preface convinced me to read it. Frenkel is a mathematician, born in the U.S.S.R. and now at Berkeley, who is working on something called the ""Langlands Project"". He begins by discussing the fact that otherwise well-educated people who would never brag that they hated literature or art or music seem proud to say they ""hate math"", and admit they know nothing about it; and he suggests that the reason is the way it is taught. He uses the analogy, suppose you took a course in Art, and instead of showing you the works of Rembrandt and Van Gogh they spent the entire class teaching you to paint -- fences. Would you be interested in pursuing art? But this is the way that math is generally taught -- as a practical collection of tools for doing other (mostly boring) things. The ""masterpieces"" of math are never mentioned. He also points out that most of the math which is taught in high school and even the early years of college dates from the ancient Greeks or the early modern period -- current work is never mentioned; it's as if a physics course ended with the work of Galileo and Newton, and gave the impression that everything in physics was already discovered and all that was left was to use it for practical engineering. Then he goes on to talk about popular science writers, such as Stephen Hawking or Brian Greene, who present the exciting developments of contemporary work in physics for the layperson, and asks why there are so few if any popularizations of work at the frontiers of contemporary math. He warns of the political dangers of allowing a small elite to monopolize knowledge of mathematics in an age when all our lives depend more than ever before on applications of math, from the Internet to Wall Street; he suggests that a mathematically literate population would not be so easily taken in by the doubletalk of the bankers and politicians. That is the gap he is trying to fill with this book. The focus is on his own work on the Langlands Project, and like the physics books of Kip Thorne or Leonard Susskind, he includes much of his own experiences. In the first few chapters, he explains how he became interested in math as a high school student; how he was denied entry into the more prestigious schools because he was Jewish, and the official academic world in the era of the final decay of the Soviet bureaucracy was highly anti-Semitic; how he was privately mentored by some of the great Soviet mathematicians, who were opposed to anti-Semitism, including the legendary Israel Gelfand, who was himself Jewish; how he worked in private and more or less secretly on group theory, and sent his first papers abroad; how he was invited to Harvard in the first months of perestroika under Gorbachev, where he became a Visiting Professor before he had even become a grad student; and how he came in contact with the Langlands Project. After that, the book is largely a popular account of the Langlands Project itself. While popular physics books try to avoid math, a popular math book of course has to be about math, and I learned much from this book. At the beginning, his explanations are very clear, and make ideas like modulo arithmetic, finite fields, Lie groups and Riemann surfaces understandable (some of the very subjects I had trouble with in reading Penrose's The Road to Reality). Later on, the book becomes more difficult to follow and his explanations of vector spaces and representations were briefer and less clear; by the end he is mentioning things like fiber bundles and automorphic functions without any explanation at all. If we keep in mind the comparison to someone like Brian Greene, though, it is hard to fault this too much; no one expects to actually learn quantum theory or string theory from a popular science book, and we shouldn't expect to learn advanced math from a book like this -- what we want to learn is what in general it is about, what the questions are and what sort of research is going on, and he is very good at that. His observations that sets, functions and numbers have been left behind for categories, sheaves and vector spaces was interesting; something like the way classical physics gave way to quantum theory. Quantum theory and string theory are here, as the ""fourth column"" of the Langlands Program; the author has collaborated with physicist-mathematicians such as Edward Witten on the connections between the two fields. So what is the Langlands Program? Essentially, it is a program to discover patterns common to various seemingly unrelated branches of mathematics (and recently physics), in particular to relate group theory and curves over finite fields to subjects like harmonic analysis and Riemann surfaces. If you don't know what these things are -- that's evidence for his thesis. "
281,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86000064-stephanie,4,"I think I am too dumb for this book but I enjoyed what I could understand! It's clear Frenkel has a lot of infectious passion for his work, and I liked his explanations"
282,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42063497-christina,3,"Yes, most of the mathematics in this book is hard. Edward Frenkel's work is cutting-edge mathematical research, after all, with applications in quantum mechanics, so it's no walk in the park. I give him credit for even attempting to explain it to a lay audience. As he states in ""A Guide for the Reader"", you can skip the sections and chapters that deal with the math. I think most readers of this book will end up doing so at some point, mainly enjoying the biographical parts.Frenkel's point in writing this book, as he explains in the ""Preface"", is to share his love for mathematics with an audience who doesn't get to see much of its hidden beauty. He does this by taking the reader on the journey that led him to mathematics, starting with a friend of his father's who taught Frenkle about symmetries and braid groups when he was in his late teens. This sparked his lifelong passion for math, and we learn all about the obstacles thrown into his path by the Soviet system that made it next to impossible for a son of a Jew to study or work in research mathematics. Luckily, he was the right age to take advantage of Perestroika, and then the collapse of the Soviet Union, and was able to both finish his studies and find an academic position in the United States.We get introduced to the main project in Frankel's career, the Langlands Program, in chapter 8, ""Magic Numbers,"" where a lot of background is given. The Langlands Program, if finished, will link together several fields of mathematics that seem unrelated on the surface. This is difficult to do and pretty rare. The background leading up to this is wide-ranging, and Frenkle tries to simplify his explanations as much as possible, but this is where the abstract nature of advanced mathematics is probably going to confuse most of his audience. In a mere 15 pages, you get a high-level whirlwind tour of the Galois groups, how the Shimura-Taniyama-Weil conjecture was used to prove Fermat's Last Theorem, how this conjecture is a general result for finding the generating function of cubic equations (using the generating function of the Fibonacci numbers as an analogy), and how it is a special case of the Langlands Program. I had to read chapter 8 very carefully and slowly, but I got the gist of it, if not a deep understanding. By the next chapter, where he introduces Lie (pronounced ""lee"") groups and algebras, I admit I was lost.The remaining math sections left me feeling like Frenkel was Beethoven, explaining how he had composed his symphonies, while I was the novice student who had finished a basic course in music theory, and knew how to play ""Für Elise"" but not much else. While his enthusiasm for mathematics and his life's work are all obvious, I just cannot appreciate the depth or the details on the same level. I found this discouraging and more than a little frustrating, because I wanted to see the same beauty that he did. I did appreciate the journey he has taken to get to this point, and the real-life depiction of how mathematical research is actually done - sometimes painfully slowly. Perhaps after some years of study I will be able to appreciate the mathematical sections just as much as the biographical ones."
283,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5931241-jenny,2,"This author was a guest on the Colbert Report, which is when I first learned of his book. He described the concept so passionately, and he argued that mathematics has been so misunderstood because it isn't given its fair due in K-12 school curricula. Frenkel is disillusioned that the general masses don't appreciate math, and he set out to conquer our hearts with this book. He stated that this book was written specifically for people like me, laypeople who have never had the opportunity to give math a fair shake because all they learn are boring basic concepts in school and they never see the true beauty of it. He compared it to taking an art class in which you only get to paint a fence and are never actually shown the works of great artists. Fair enough, I thought. I'll give it a try.By chapter three, I realized that Edward Frenkel is a misguided genius who truly believes that laypeople could possibly understand what he is talking about. I don't sense that he is a self-righteous individual who wants to come across as ridiculously smart (he is, in fact, ridiculously smart). I think he really just doesn't get that trying to relate these concepts to people like me, who only made it through Calc A, cannot be done. Hence, large parts of the book left me absolutely lost. Even BJ, who was a math minor, said he wasn't keeping up and so he quit reading it. Consider this sentence: ""The idea of string theory is that by doing calculations in these sigma models and summing up the results over all possible Riemann surfaces E (that is, over all possible paths of the strings propagating in a fixed space-time S) we can reproduce the physics that we observe in space-time S."" Honestly, I wish this particular sentence, which I chose at random, was a stand-apart in terms of its difficulty, but the truth is that much of this book is written in this language with ten unfamiliar concepts thrown together in the same sentence, all with the assumption that we must understand what the heck he is talking about. The redeeming points of the book were the interspersed memoir portions, which were extremely interesting. Frenkel was born in the Soviet Union and endured intense antisemitism at practically every turn in his education, but still prevailed and eventually traveled to Harvard and then to UC-Berkeley with professorships. I very much loved hearing about his experiences growing up, in college, working with colleagues, and his personal excitement about solving mathematical problems. It was only that he felt the need to then delve INTO those problems with technical language that made this book a disappointment--along with the fact that I didn't feel it delivered what it originally promised.In the end, I walked away appreciating Edward Frenkel's personal story. However, I did NOT end up appreciating math anymore than I ever did before, which was precisely why I decided to read the book in the first place. Unless you're ready to skip some major portions or else you're a mathematician, I don't recommend this book to you. This book is truly written for mathematicians, not laypeople, as it was so described."
284,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28285354-ron,3,"Love and Math: The Heart of Hidden Reality by Edward FrenkelThis is the story of a young boy of 12 who loved quantum physics, but not math. When he learned that the quark was found by using math, he decided to study math. He grew up a 100 miles from Moscow and he was Jewish. He was a very bright student and when he finished public school, he went to Moscow to take the test to enter the Moscow State University but at that time MSU discriminated against the Jewish people and when Edward went to take the test, he was taken to a room by two of the testers and given an oral exam and the testers did not like the correct answers he gave to the questions, so he failed the entrance exam. Later one of the testers came to him and told him that he could get into Moscow Institute of Oil and Gas, where they also had a good applied mathematics school and even used some of the professors who taught at MSU. He was accepted to the Moscow Institute of Oil and Gas and in his second year there he solved a difficult problem and it was brought to the attention of one of the MSU top mathematician professors. He solved an even more advanced math problem that this professor gave him and he wrote his first juried math paper for the Journal of Mathematics. Soon, he received a three month invitation to learn at Harvard. He was on his way to becoming a top flight mathematician. He worked on the Langlands program to unify various branches of mathematics. Edward and other mathematicians worked to unify number theory and harmonic analysis. Frankel uses two irrational numbers to construct a system of hybrid numbers in which one term is rational and the other term is a rational multiple of the irrational numbers. These numbers are now constructed into a new numeral system called a “number field”, and they form a mathematical structure called the “Galois group” of the polynomial equation. An analysis of this Galois group can produce solutions of harmonic analysis (a more sophisticated version of the study of sines and cosines.) Frenkel and his group of mathematicians in the Langlands program are producing solutions that will tie other mathematical branches together. Edward presents these mathematical equations equal to oil paintings and sculptures exhibited in museums throughout the world. The book is well written and the explanations go a long way forward to knowing about the mathematical solutions presented. I believe you would need a bachelor of mathematics degree or equivalent in order to see the “Mona Lisa” Frenkel has presented here. "
285,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1856047-jonna-higgins-freese,5,"I can't say I understand The Langlands Program any more now than I did before, except that it has something to do with sheaves and making it possible to ""translate"" between different areas of mathematics. I also picked up that the mathematics has some real-world implications in terms of symmetry and quantum physics, which I'd already picked up on from reading _The God Particle._ Unlike many of the other reviewers, I enjoyed the way he narrated his own engagement with and love of mathematics -- before I could love math myself, I needed to understand how anyone could love it, and I felt he did a good job of showing what it's like to be a person who loves mathematics.There were several interesting quotes --Thoreau: ""We have heard about the poetry of mathematics, but very little of it has yet been sung."" (A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers, cited on p. 228 of L&M)p. 241: ""Albert Einstein wrote, 'Every one who is seriously involved in thepursuit of science becomes convinced that some spirit is manifest in the laws of the Universe -- a spirit vastly superior to that of man, and one in the face of which we with our modest powers must feel humble.' And Isaac Newton expressed his feelings this way: 'to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the seashore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.'""My dream is that one day we will all awaken to this hidden reality. We may then perhaps be able to set aside our differences and focus on the profound truths that unite us. Then, we will all be like children playing on the seashore, marveling at the dazzling beauty and harmony we discover, share, and cherish together.""And this is what I love about reading books about math and science whose content I can barely understand -- it puts my life into perspective. When I'm frustrated about a completely illogical decision at work, or asked to accomplish something without the tools to do so, or when I feel that my life is spent in entirely too much make-work that takes me away from my children, reading such books for a few minutes before bed each night puts things into a larger perspective, opens up the world so that I feel I have space to breathe again."
286,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91748031-hobart-mariner,3,"As a personal memoir, this book is a both good and a bit frustrating. As a lay introduction to the ideas behind general advanced mathematics, and in particular the Langlands program (and its ties to string and superstring theory), it is very good, if a little daunting toward the end.In the early parts, the author does a very fine job of describing the hideous antisemitism that he encountered in the Soviet Union of the 1980s and how it prevented a generation of young Jewish mathematicians from developing to their fullest. He does a good job of recounting the unfairness of the oral examinations that prevented him from attending the Moscow State University Mechanics and Mathematics Department. In particular, his losing admission over a farcically nitpicky definition of circle (""the set of all points equidistant from a fixed point"" instead of ""the set of points equidistant from a fixed point"") serves as an illustration of the utter absurdity of this system. Later on, in the United States, he and several other Russian-Jewish mathematicians are given an opportunity to get back at the antisemitic Rector of MSU and this provides a satisfying and compelling scene.The author also presents warm and personal sketches of the mentors who helped him both to learn mathematics and to escape the clutches of this oppressive system. The author, for one who showed such incredible ability so young, is admirably free of vanity regarding his career, constantly giving credit to his advisors, teachers, and fellow students. There are a few personal bits that could have used more fleshing out (in particular, when he meets Feigin's family, he mentions that he would come to become very close with them, but the reader doesn't really see this). I thought that the depiction of the life of the ""Kerosinka"" was very interesting, an applied math hub full of frustrated young pure mathematicians. I thought that Yakov Khurgin, the charismatic probabilist studying with physicians to ensure his own access to medical care, made a very sympathetic character. It was poignant when the author described leaving his paltry instructorship (obtained by Khurgin with some difficulty) at the Kerosinka behind to study at Harvard. After the author moves to the United States, the story becomes a bit less personal and instead becomes more of a purely popular scientific book. Of the first twelve chapters, several are completely given over to mathematical exposition (some without any mention of the author's personal history). Yet it felt as I read it that after the author moves to Cambridge in Chapter 13, the book became much less personal. This corresponds with the author's life becoming less contingent and unstable, and maybe as a consequence less interesting. He sketches a few scenes of adjusting to life in the United States (being overwhelmed by the choices at a supermarket, learning colloquial English by watching David Letterman, walking around in jeans with a Walkman). I can't find it now but later on he provides a single paragraph of personal history, including marriage, divorce, and moving his Russian family to the United States. I would have liked to see a bit more of this, even if it has limited bearing on the mathematical parts of the memoir. As a work of mathematical exposition for a lay audience this book is quite successful, particularly in the earlier parts. (Disclaimer: I'm an academic mathematician, although in a different field of math than the author's.) I've seen many, many descriptions of the notion of symmetry group meant for lay audiences and I think that the author's stands out in terms of clarity. His own charming initial encounter with group theory (a mathematician friend of the family showing him the links the subject has with particle physics) might not make it easier for everyone else to comprehend, but at least gives an idea that the subject has meaning outside of the abstractions of pure math. He does a very fine job explaining the notions of groups, braid groups, fundamental group, modular arithmetic, and the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. I was quite impressed with his ability to describe Galois theory in relatively low-tech terms (in particular, he employs a wonderfully evocative metaphor involving the wings of a butterfly). The scientific exposition later on (in particular the bits with supersymmetry and string theory) were a bit harder for me to digest, but that doesn't mean he didn't present them in very clear terms. The main mathematical focus of the book is the Langlands Program, which the author repeatedly refers to as a Grand Unified Theory of Math, a description that overstates things slightly (there are several major fields of mathematics that do not really fall under the umbrella of the Langlands Program). It is no surprise that the author, one of the Langlands Program's superstars, does an excellent job laying out the basic ideas behind this ambitious research program. There are good explanations of Galois theory (mentioned above) and a solid example of how modular forms tie in to the subject. A bit more said about the general idea of modular forms might have been useful, but it's possible that it would be too technical for most readers. The author perhaps overloads a metaphor concerning people in Europe and North America, but not to the detriment of the books readability. I do think that it's possible readers with a limited mathematical background will get a bit lost in these sections, because they discuss fairly airy connections between subjects that have only briefly been sketched. There is a very good discussion of Weil's ""Rosetta stone"" in Chapter 9 that provides a nice backbone for all of the Langlands Program discussion. The last chapter, which contains a description of the author's screenplay (The Two-Body Problem) and short film (Rites of Love and Math), felt a bit disconnected from the rest of the book. His description of the screenwriting process is interesting and gives him the opportunity to credit yet another mentor. When he discusses the film-making process he employs a reconstructed dialogue with a French director which seems a bit artificial (similar to several other dialogues in the book). The film, which features a mathematician writing a powerful formula on the body of a woman, seems half-baked in its concept, although its clear that it means quite a lot to the author. It's a bit hard to see how this artsy, somewhat pretentious production is the best way to make someone feel the importance of math, when the author himself has done a good job in his earlier chapters making the reader feel the urgency of his initial mathematical work. A short film about a young Jewish mathematician in the Soviet Union trying with all his energy to get into MSU, prove a theorem, break into a lecture hall, etc. would be much more compelling and get across the feeling of doing math much better, in my opinion. He leaves out any mention of the minor controversy that the film provoked among feminist circles, instead offering platitudes like ""it's all in the eye of the bholder."" This section is larded with quotations from Thoreau, Einstein, etc, and overall is a bit flabby and formless in comparison with the rest of the book. Sort of disappointing that he chose to end on this note. "
287,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11253338-andrew,3,"This book was much more enjoyable when I gave up trying to understand.The author is clearly knowledgeable about mathematics. He is also very very passionate.The difficulty lies in informing the rest of us about his passion. A Nobel Laureate in Physics claims this book is ""very readable."" Which is great news, except I am not a Nobel Laureate in the realm Frenkel's work deals with.This is the struggle he faces: Mathematics is far larger and deeper than most people encounter. We are taught from a young age that math is ugly and mostly esoteric. Trying to overcome that by bringing up ideas that mean absolutely nothing to those who have not studied Algebraic Symmetries, Modular Forms, and Reimannian Surfaces is not effective.HOWEVER, when I accepted that I didn't have a clue what he was talking about, and chose to pay attention to the links between those ideas (which was his purpose), life got easier.The purpose of this book isn't to teach the reader mathematics, but to show how various ideas in mathematics are related, to the surprise of the rest of us. Math is about exotic connections and powerful generalizations, not calculation. In the 17th Chapter, Dr. Frenkel writes ""But my point is not for you to learn them all. Rather, I want to indicate the logical connections between these objects and show the creative process of scientists studying them: what drives them, how they learn from each other, how the knowledge they acquire is used to advance our understanding of the key questions.""THAT should have been in the introduction, alongside the anecdote of drunks and fractions. It would have made the rest SO MUCH easier. If the reader begins with that idea, then the book is wonderful. Math is beautiful, not because it is useful, but because it is the art of the universe itself. A famous sculptor (I believe it was Michelangelo) once said that the statue was already in the marble, he just discovered it. Many mathematicians feel that they do not create math, they find the rules that were already there. This book does a great job demonstrating that concept. Provided you ignore the footnotes and don't try to understand the math he is using to present this idea."
288,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3016981-girish,3,"There is a wave of ""pop-math"" books aimed at the interested amateur, and Edward Frenkel's memoir/masturbatory ode to math is a whirlwind tour of his life and research interests. Frenkel tries to acclimate the reader to the mathematical castle in the sky by attempting to avoid jargon and using commonplace examples to elucidate mathematical concepts (e.g. the ""symmetrical circle group"" as an example of a group).My main complaint is that I don't know who this book is for. I got out of what I wanted (and expected) - an increased appreciation for the thought patterns around math, a birds eye view of the Langland's Program, some interesting succinct definitions of mathematical concepts, and some cool visualizations. The autobiographical tidbits were interesting, but for orthogonal reasons (one of my coworkers is Russian Jewish and that got me interested in Frenkel's story; not to mention just how wrong what happened to him was).You won't learn any math from this book. It's an interesting foray into the emotional connection to math, so even though one of Frenkel's explicit goals is to demystify the intricate edifice of theory that is the Langland's Program, I'd say he failed in that endeavor. I suppose for the right person who really thinks of mathematics as SAT-style word problems, then it might be incredibly interesting to learn that it's much more artistic, revelatory, and exploratory.I'll note that Frenkel makes a couple claims in this book. First, the implicit claim that mathematical discoveries should be elevated in stature and aesthetic to the pyramids or hanging gardens, and second, that pure mathematical research is valuable but that we can't always perceive the applications immediately. I love #1 and hope that happens. #2 requires a more nuanced look, especially if it's used as justification for any and all theoretical mathematical research. Most math research, is (while beautiful/curious/amazing) useless.Mathematics used to occupy the highest stage of the cultural aristocracy as late as the 1800s, I wonder if it's time for a cultural resurgence. The gods of social status are fickle, so who knows? Math may become cool. If that's to be, than a broader appreciation for its beauty is necessary. "
289,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1849937-yofish,3,"Really 3.5.Written by a mathematician whose stated aim is to get his readers to understand what math is *really* about (as opposed to what one learns in school). The guy has had an interesting life. He was born in the USSR, and couldn't get into the ""right"" college (MGU) for math because he's Jewish. But he's able to muddle through, thanks to the large population of Jewish (and non-Jewish) mathematicians in Moscow who are used to getting around this exact problem. He's a really good mathematician and gets published and so on; but then he graduates and has the same problem---he can't get into a graduate school in the USSR because he's Jewish. Fortunately, he's just exactly the right age, and perestroika is starting, so when he gets invited to Harvard, he can go. (And eventually when he's visiting professorship is up, Harvard lets him be demoted to graduate student so that he can get his Ph.D.) While he was giving the more biographical story, I was pretty interested. But remember that his stated purpose was to introduce his math (the Langlands Program) to the layman. I can't really say whether he succeeded, as I skimmed through most of it. Not that I couldn't have understood (probably)---after all, I am a mathematician. The thing is, though, that if I was interested in that particular math, I would have studied it in grad school. The writing is a little choppy, which is surely understandable as English is his second language. But the editing is pretty poor, too---there seemed to be several places where he repeated himself without saying ""as I mentioned before"" or something similar. That was a little weird. He also seemed a little full of himself at times. There was a particular story, during his first year at Harvard, where the head of the dept of MGU is invited to MIT. That was (apparently) controversial at the time, as he wasn't supposed to be much of a mathematician, and he apparently was overseeing the rejection of Jews. There's sort of a public confrontation between him and the author. It was an interesting story--I'm a little surprised that I hadn't heard it before, as it happened while I was in grad school, and it's the kind of thing I might have noticed."
290,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18370648-mishehu,3,"Author writes, ""...we, mathematicians, need to do a better job of unlocking the power and beauty of our subject to a wider audience."" Alas, he himself resoundingly fails to do so. 5 stars for the autobiographical material in this book. The author's personal story -- and his mathematical biography -- are quite interesting. 1.5 stars for the exposition of mathematical ideas. Whatever pretense the author may have to being a math popularizer, he has many miles to travel in developing his expository chops before he can count himself among those of his colleagues who do this sort of thing well. I recently finished reading the second of Brian Greene's masterful books on cosmology -- books that are pitched to a highly interested readership willing to put in a serious readerly effort. Occasionally, in his books, Greene elaborates certain ideas in footnotes that are expressly written for ""mathematically inclined readers."" Nearly all of Frenkel's math discussion (in both the text and the footnotes of the book in review) are, whatever anyone may claim to the contrary, pitched to mathematically inclined readers. A few chapters in and the going is pretty much impossible for the lay reader. The best I can say about Frenkel's skills as a pop math expositor is that he did manage to convey an impression of what his mathematical research is about, of why it matters, and of why it's fascinating/inspiring. So, though I understood very little of the book, I did get something out of it (not simply insights into the author's personal story). But the investment of my time was poorly paid. All that said, Frenkel writes well, and his work really IS quite fascinating. I hope he'll continue to develop his pop writing skills, and I hope that future editors/publishers of his (and other first time pop math/sci authors) will give some thought to the target audience of books like these before they let manuscripts go to press."
291,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24055618-noah,5," Non-fiction books generally explain something that is true, or at least true for the author, about a particular topic. They can range from stories about people’s lives to discoveries that have been made, as well as pure factual information. One might expect non-fiction books to be purely facts and not memoirs, but that isn’t always the case. What surprised me about the book Love and Math is that this book was laid out in a different format that what I would expect from most non-fiction books. It’s laid out more like a novel, with chapters and memoirs and such. Love and Math by Edward Frenkel is a great nonfiction book mainly focusing on the symmetry groups in math of SO(3) and SO(n). Love and Math starts by easing the reader into advanced mathematics with the use of diagrams and symmetry, then gets into some more advanced ideas such as symmetry groups for higher dimensions. Love and Math is part thoughtful memoir, and part math textbook. Edward Frenkel mixes these two things perfectly to make an enticing book that just makes you want to read more. One of the main things that helped make the book so good was that Edward Frenkel had such an amazing childhood, he met famous mathematicians, he published papers, and faced tragedies such as being persecuted because he was Jewish. Edward Frenkel is an accomplished mathematician who wants to inspire other people to become mathematicians. I think that Edward Frenkel did an awesome job of explaining advanced mathematical concepts. I would give this book five stars and recommend this book to anyone who doesn’t mind curling up somewhere for a few hours while expanding their mind and having fun."

Some reviewers seemed uncomfortable with the neither-fish-nor-fowl feel - neither pure autobiography nor pure mathematics tome - but this approach worked well for me. Rather than simply describing the solution to a problem, the author takes the time to describe the thrill of finding an elegant solution to a problem on which you'd labored for weeks or months. Rather than just describing a mathematician's theories, the author provides sufficient details to get a feel for the mathematician as a person. I found this approach an effective way to help non-mathematicians connect to math and those who study it. I picked up this book because I was interested in Dr. Frenkel's experiences as a mathematician in the twilight years of the Soviet Union. Specifically, I wanted to learn more about the author's experiences with the harrowing, Kafkaesque Moscow State University (MGU) mathematics entrance examination, through which undesirable students (read: those of Jewish descent) were deliberately weeded out and denied admittance. This is exactly what happened to the author, and I was deeply impressed by his commitment to study math at any cost as well as his later willingness to speak out publicly against about these discriminatory policies. Bravo! It was also fascinating to read about how many Soviet mathematicians and others worked with and mentored students who had experienced discrimination, and how many of these students ended up immigrating to the West soon afterwards. As to mathematics, the author clearly loves what he does, and his love is infectious. While I didn't read the book primarily for this angle, I did gain a deeper appreciation of mathematics as well as the Langlands Program. Intriguing stuff! "
293,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5664087-john,3,"Edward Frenkel’s Love and Math joins a long list of mathematical memoirs. In the last two centuries many eminent mathematicians have attempted to describe what they do, why they do it and how they came to it. Without exception they fail the “what we do” test but often brilliantly succeed on why and how they came to mathematics. Mathematics does not admit casual observers. You have to do it to fully appreciate it and doing it at the levels Frenkel describes takes gifted minds years of hard work. “There are no royal roads to geometry.” Love and Math goes further than most in this genre. It doesn't flinch when a formula really helps and the end notes are detailed and reference laden enough to get you started on learning what’s really the deal with SO(3).The best part of the book deals with the author’s start in mathematics as a precious Russian teenager. Frenkel's father was Jewish and this created problems. The Soviet Union, in addition to being a murderous totalitarian state, was overtly anti-Semitic. Scholars of Jewish descent faced “extra” hurdles when it came to university admissions and securing jobs. Frenkel’s account of his MGU exam should be required reading for every leftist imbecile in the west. It clearly shows that secondary school mathematics was taught at levels far beyond the execrable Common Core, (affirmative action), standard now being pushed in the US and that bureaucrats can always find ways to exclude even the best of “undesirables.” Love and Math is an entertaining, enlightening and important book."
294,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8824504-leslie,3,"This one was between 3 and 3.5 stars.At the beginning of the novel the author states that he hopes to accomplish two things: first he hopes to convey his love of math and then he hopes to imbue this love into the reader. These are lofty goals. He is successful in the former but falls a bit short in the latter. The novel is part memoir and is is perhaps the most interesting section of the book. Frenkle's tale of overcoming the anti Semitic policy of the Soviet Union is incredibly moving. His love of mathematics is earnestly depicted and you root for his success in the face of adversity. The other parts of the novel focus on his contribution to the Langlands program and here I found that the quality varied. The math is certainly an important contribution but he only succeeded at making about half of it accessible to me. I will openly admit that my affinity for mathematics is limited to applied math. It is important for me to understand the context behind the concepts and unfortunately certain aspects where too abstract. I could not help but compare it to Hawking's works which successfully engaged my interest and made the esoteric aspects of quantum mechanics and physics accessible to the layperson. His works made me love physics and cosmology while this book only somewhat piqued my interest. However, I recommend the book for those interested in obtaining a peek into the mysterious world of mathematics. I believe it is an important field and completely agree with the author that it should be taught in a more engaging way. "
295,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51268208-akbar-gumbira,3,"This book is not for everyone.Through this book, the author (Edward Frenkel) tried to explain a lot of mathematical concepts in layman's terms. But no matter how hard he tried, it's just not for everyone. I have no background in mathematics or physics (as a degree) and I find it hard to understand many concepts told in the book. Though I still could follow some concepts such as generating function, fermat's little and last theorem, RSA, and most of the number theory part since I thought myself in high school some high level mathematics for olympiad. But when it comes to concepts such as Langlands program, Galois group, and the links to quantum duality, I just skim-read it.But we couldn't help it. Edward is a world-renowned and gifted mathematician. He's already working on unsolved mathematical problems since he's in college, had a patent in his 4th year in college (or 5th year I forgot exactly), and invited to Harvard in his early 20's. Things that are obvious to him, and perhaps that he also thinks to others, might not be that obvious to the readers.Apart from that, I enjoyed his personal story, telling the readers about anti-semitism in Soviet Union, his first time in Harvard (spending 45 minutes at the supermarket to just buy salt), how the project went to link quantum dualities and the Langlands program, his film-making story, and how he perceives mathematics in general.Oh I found many typos! I wonder if he's in a rush to publish it?"
296,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15546947-haydee-romero,0,"I picked up this book because love and math are two words I have never used in the same sentence. Math intimidates me but reading Frenkel’s introduction he made it clear that the goal and target audience was me! A person who fears the word math, “If you think that math is hard, that you won’t get it, if you are terrified by math but at the same time curious whether there is something worth knowing- then this book is for you.” Frenkel says that math is at the heart of love and his tone and acknowledgement of his audience made me comfortable starting the book. Frenkel did a great job at breaking down COMPLEX math equations and idea BUT it was not enough for me, personally. I would have to put the book down, reread the paragraph to grasp the concept. I would but I had to think about it... a lot. Frenkel did an amazing job of integrating his personal journey as a mathematician and the math equations he explained. It was clear throughout his book that he knew his audience were not mathematicians. Frenkel would define words that may have a different meaning in the math field. He would apply theories to concepts we may know about or explain what they are used for. I have learned and gained a much greater respect to the subject of math. I would use this book as an example of how keeping who your audience is when writing a piece makes a big difference and is so important. "
297,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1357119-david,4,"1. Frenkel and his friends would scale 20 foot walls in order to sneak into mathematics lectures - this increases my faith in humanity.2. The portrait of how Frenkel and his kindred spirits were able to find one another and prosper in the USSR is absolutely fascinating. He and his friends would tear through their official duties in no time and get real work done while operating within their largely informal and much less hierarchical intellectual network. This also increases my faith in humanity.3. On a less happy note, Frenkel's experience illuminates the weaknesses of the rigid (and far too common) approach to mathematical education. It is possible to reach some individuals even when mathematical concepts are taught as pure abstractions - you can reach people who focus intensely on discreet tasks and who follow instructions first and ask questions later. Others, however, learn through a much more context-driven approach. If you present them with a new abstract concept and fail to connect it to what they have learned before or demonstrate how it can be visualized or applied, they are going to struggle. Frenkel found wonderful mentors who helped him see math as an area to explore rather than an area where one duplicates rote instructions - I sure didn't find anyone like that, and I doubt many others do either."
298,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22906182-kat-steiner,3,"Argh, finally finished this book. Unsurprisingly, it does not work as an audiobook. Do not buy it from Audible.I think when I got it, I believed it was more of a book about mathematicians or a fictionalised autobiography, than a book about maths. It's sort of both, but there is a fair amount of actual maths (and significantly advanced maths, at that). And that's just impossible to make sense of while listening. Particularly as the narrator, Tony Craine, clearly has absolutely no idea what he is saying, so his emphasis is often totally off, or he reads things in a way that doesn't distinguish where brackets would be, so it's just impossible to follow no matter how hard you listen - there's not enough information conveyed.The story itself I really enjoyed - it was a fascinating account of education and anti-semitism in Soviet Russia, as well as great insight into the lives of professional mathematicians. I did a maths degree so I can't comment on how it would come across to the layman, but I found the actual maths a bit hard-going and uninteresting - these are difficult, complicated concepts that weren't very interesting when you can't get into either the nitty-gritty or appreciate the broader concepts.A bit of a mixed bag. Quite enjoyable in parts, but I'm glad to be done. Don't get the audiobook."
299,0465050743,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10145524-charles-daney,5,"The love referred to is mainly for mathematics, though there is one chapter on the human-related form. The first chapters are about Frenkel's struggles to get a math education in the last years of the Soviet Union. He had to literally climb fences to get access to the best seminars and experts. Most of the book deals with his primary interest: an extremely esoteric, but important, area of current research, known as the ""Langlands Program"". I really enjoyed his presentation, since this is one of my main interests also, and this is the best ""nontechnical"" explanation I've ever seen of the subject. It made things a lot clearer for me. The basic idea is that there are very deep relationships among a number of mathematical concepts that on the surface seem quite unrelated. And besides that, there may be important applications to particle physics theory. It could turn out that a lot of why fundamental physics works the way it does is a result of mathematical relationships. Someday before too long (I hope), I can write about the Langlands Program on my math blog. It's related to stuff I've already written about there (number theory). I find that the best way to learn about new things is to write about them - as a process of explaining the subject to myself."
