0,0374122881,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,2,"I am in the middle of reading Spillover and am enjoying it much more than this book. Pandemic is more current for certain, but David Quammen, the Author of Spillover, is by far more scientifically literate. Shah spends an awful lot of time focused on paradigm shifts in science. She even seems to have a really good grasp of Thomas Kuhn's arguments; and yet, she failed to realize the science she researched for this book has been pushed out by the very methods Kuhn elucidated in book, in fact the very methods she, herself, wrote about in this very book. She seems to lack critical thinking skills when it comes to psychology studies, never questioning the methods. If someone said it was true, she seemed to not only accept it, despite glaring flaws in the methods for those studies, but used the bad studies to argue her opinion. The old way of viewing evolution, the selfish gene as driver of all evolution, is on its way out the door. Yet, she clings tightly to that paradigm. She is enamored with the good genes/sexy sons hypothesis, selfish gene dogma, David Buss style evolutionary psych (which amounts to ""just-so-stories). Her lack of adopting a progressive paradigm, considering her progressive subject matter was disappointing at best. I also didn't relate to her personal experience with the virus she and her son share. That detracted from the story for me. Even with the negatives, the subject matter is trilling. What she lacks in scientific understanding, she really makes up for with her history of various viruses. Absolutely fantastic. If you are only going to read one book about pandemics, let it be Spillover. But, if you are willing to read more than one book, because of the history she provides, this is definitely worthwhile. "
1,0374122881,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3123067-elizabeth-a,5,"I listened to the audiobook, which is narrated by the author.When we think about Pandemics, most of us think about them in a historical context, and there seems to be this strange belief that we'll be able to successfully deal with whatever pathogens come our way with the aid of the super duper drugs churned out by Big Pharma. Boy, oh boy, are we wrong. How the topics and events in this book are not the headline news every single night is something I simply do not understand. Well, I do understand, because it is much more entertaining to hear about an escaped monkey, than to address the microbes said monkey might be spreading about on it's jaunt. The topics covered in this book are a clear and present danger to all of us. Not those people over there, but all of us, and if we learn anything from history, it should be that microbes will find a way to become pathogens, and these in turn will find a way to spillover to humans. I know there are other highly reviewed books out there on this subject but if, like me, you are new to really diving into these topics this is a great place to start. It is easy to read and digest, and the author makes complex subjects accessible to a layperson. This book explores not just the life cycle of pathogens and the history of pandemics, but also explores how medicine, big pharma, global travel, population numbers, habitat and environmental destruction, cultural norms, etc., all affect and contribute to the problem.There are so many dots this book connected for me, and I learned about events that should have been major news stories that got little, if any, national coverage in the media. I found this a fascinating, educational, and terrifying read. I just picked up the ebook, and have not doubt that I will re-read it. I highly recommend this one."

Fui ler esperando mais do mesmo, depois de ter lido obras como Spillover: Animal Infections and the Next Human Pandemic e The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance, mas felizmente fui surpreendido. Sonia Shah traz um conteúdo bem atualizado e pertinente, discutindo os fatores que favorecem novas pandemias e grandes porquês com muito poder de explicação (a melhor parte). Nossa relação de nojo ou conivência com sujeira, que varia de acordo com a familiaridade, a maneira como reagimos a novas epidemias apontando culpados, grandes habitações e a grande circulação de pessoas, entre outros. Só pelos grandes fatores o livro já fale. Sem falar nas atualizações sobre o que aconteceu em relação à surtos recentes de Ebola e Cólera. Ajuda bastante a entender o problema atual de Zika, desde o que fez a doença circular à maneira como as pessoas reagiram até online."

4,0374122881,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1291915-lauren,5,"Why do some pathogens provoke yawns while others trigger panic? Is it too much faith in medicine? Is it first-world arrogance? Is it the difference between vector-borne pathogens versus airborne or blood-borne? All of the above?Shah manages to answer and analyze these kinds of questions while expertly retracing pandemics of the past centuries, and foretelling the ones of the future. Through her research and writing, it becomes clear how very delicate this balance is - the one that we created to shield ourselves from disease and pestilence. The re-emergence of diseases that have been dormant (or underreported) for decades is of particular interest. She specifically looks at cholera - a bacteria that never went away - but was fought back by modern sanitation and public works. However, the balance was thrown in Haiti after the earthquake of 2010, and it's epidemic status is now endemic. Vibrio cholarae - Cholera bacterium Cholera's fascinating - and devastating - history is retold here (also read in Johnson's The Ghost Map: ) with some new details and context. Shah also delves into the recent pandemics caused by zoonosis - infectious diseases in animals that have spilled over into human populations. These are familiar newsmakers in recent years: swine flu, West Nile, SARS. She travels to Guangzhou province of China, the birthplace of SARS and witnesses the very same (now illegal) trade at ""wet markets"" that made SARS a household world. She briefly traces the phenomenon of medical tourism - traveling to other countries for expensive medical treatments - and the unique risks involved with ""superbugs"" and antibiotic resistant strains of bacterial pathogens that are then brought back to the traveler's home country. She even shares her own family's reoccurring struggle with MRSA after a seemingly innocuous cut on her son's knee. The structure of the narrative is likely it's strongest point. Shah uses lenses for each chapter - ""Locomotion"", ""Filth"", ""Crowds"", etc. in which to view the pandemics. How was disease *helped* by locomotion and by crowds? With the wealth of historical data, early industrial New York is the case study. Booming industry, steady stream of immigrants from other countries, and from rural US areas, coming together in extremely close quarters (some of the statistics she states are mind-blowing - people packed in like sardines) and THIS is where pandemics bloomed. In the historical context (and still very much still today as we are seeing with unfolding details about Zika in Latin America) her lens of ""Corruption"" and its role in pandemics: the Manhattan Company and their active role in groundwater pollution and the cholera outbreaks of the 19th century.Collect Pond in lower Manhattan - Five Points slum Shah's final chapter is a call to action, but also to that of information and education.
The One Health movement... argues that human health is linked to the health of wildlife, livestock, and the ecosystem.
Modern farming and livestock conditions, both in the West and the East - comparable in so many ways to the tenements in developing world countries where disease is rife, and in NYC during the cholera outbreaks in the 19th century - could very well be the point of spillover to human populations. Yes, the book may scare you - wash your hands more, clean and disinfect open wounds, clean up after yourself and your pets (and then wash your hands again!) - but it is truly one of education and knowledge.

I strongly recommend it to everyone. I'm also going to try some of the books recommended below.The author does spend too much time on cholera history in the middle of the book- interesting but not the only focus of the book so it feels belabored. Power through it, it's worth it."
6,0374122881,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4739424-mal-warwick,5,"To judge from the over-the-top rhetoric on display among the Republican candidates in the 2016 Presidential primary campaign, many millions of Americans live in abject fear of immigration, terrorism, and having their guns taken away. It’s true there are genuine reasons to fear that our lives, our livelihoods, and our lifestyles might be disrupted in the foreseeable future. But they have nothing to do with immigration, terrorism, or hunting rifles.Any logical, clear-headed look at the world around us reveals that the true existential threats on the horizon include climate change, nuclear holocaust, pandemics, and, at a higher level of logical abstraction, rampant consumerism. However, the most immediate of these threats to our civilization appears to be contagious disease. In Pandemic, Sonia Shah’s superb new survey of the past, present, and future of infectious disease, spells this out with startling clarity. Just so it’s clear: she’s not writing about simple colds and mild flus, but about illnesses that might kill tens or hundreds of millions of people with little warning and with unpredictable consequences for the cohesion of society. The heart of the problem, as she explains, is that “epidemics grow exponentially while our ability to respond proceeds linearly, at best.”A balanced view of contagious diseaseThanks to alarmist reporting, Americans are terrified that hemorrhagic diseases such as Ebola will “break out” and kill us by the millions. Shah patiently explains that much more common diseases are far more likely to pose threats to us, influenza and cholera in particular. A series of unfortunate mutations in either one could fashion a disease that is not just virulent (contagious) but also highly lethal. Today, for example, influenza kills only a small proportion of its victims. We tend to regard it more as a nuisance for most of us, a threat only to those who are most vulnerable. However, the “Spanish flu” (the H1N1 virus) that broke out in the final days of World War I infected up to 500 million people (between a fifth and a third of the world’s population) and killed between 50 and 100 million. Epidemiologists live in fear that H1N1 or one of the countless other varieties of influenza incubating in Southern China could put on a repeat performance — or worse. Cholera poses a similar threat.Sanitation, Hippocratic medicine, and ChristianityOne of the most fascinating passages in Pandemic is Shah’s account of the role of Christianity in fostering infectious disease for more than a thousand years.History shows us that two thousand years ago the Romans piped clean drinking water to their cities through an elaborate system of aqueducts and made public baths available to one and all. Cleanliness was a virtue to them. That all began to change with the advent of Christianity a few centuries into the Common Era. Unlike the Jews and (later) the Muslims, Christian clergy disdained personal hygiene, associating it with Roman polytheism and viewing cleanliness as superstitious. It was common for Catholic priests and the Protestant pastors who succeeded them in some parts to discourage their flocks from bathing. For many centuries, the vast majority of people in Christian lands lived side-by-side with their animals atop pits filled with excrement and cooked with smelly water drawn from contaminated streams or wells.When disease struck, as it did with increasing frequency as population grew and gravitated toward the cities, the physicians who purported to combat it were in the thrall of the Hippocratic school of medicine, which attributed all disease to an imbalance in the four “humors” within the body and in external factors that exacerbated it. For example, cholera, which sickened hundreds of millions through the centuries and killed half of them, was blamed on the inhalation of what the ancient physician Galen termed “miasmas” (offensive smells). The nineteenth-century physicians who practiced medical “science” based on these beliefs “increased [cholera’s] death toll from 50 to 70 percent.” Though the germ theory of disease was first proposed in the sixteenth century, it wasn’t until three centuries later, on the cusp of the twentieth century, that practicing physicians began to accept the role of microorganisms in causing disease.Meanwhile, progress toward improved sanitation and the availability of clean drinking water was even slower. As Shah explains in chilling detail, the construction of London’s sewer system was not prompted because public health officials understood that water used for drinking and washing was dangerously contaminated. The reason they proposed the effort was that they thought it was essential to pipe all the smelly sewage into the Thames, the source of the city’s drinking water! Only in the twentieth century did it become common for municipalities to regard drinkable water as a necessity of life.Why is contagious disease more of a threat today than ever before?In Pandemic, Shah describes the role of contemporary trends in making the threat of epidemic disease greater than ever. Five stand out: climate change, continuing urbanization, ever more accessible global transportation, resistance to vaccines, and the encroachment of development on previously virgin lands, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, South and Southeast Asia, and the Amazon. The result is that an increasing number of unknown and unpredictable new tropical diseases is emerging and making their way into more and more crowded cities further and further north on the globe. All the while, diseases previously thought conquered, such as polio and measles, rise up in communities around the globe.About the authorThe daughter of Indian immigrants, Sonia Shah is an American investigative journalist who has reported from around the world, principally on corporate power and gender inequality. Pandemic is her sixth book. Though her parents are both physicians and she lives with a molecular biologist, it appears that the impetus for writing this book came from a painful personal experience with MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), which she contracted from her son. Shah describes her eye-opening experience at length in Pandemic."
7,0374122881,http://goodreads.com/user/show/623492-ayla,4,Like I’ve been saying people need to stop asking for antibiotics before they get test results back and when they do get prescribed they need to take all of it. Bacteria want to survive and they mutate eventually we won’t have anything to combat them. Scary.
8,0374122881,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15121981-anne-chappel,5,"I was fascinated by this 2016 published book. Obviously the extra frisson has to do with our current times, but still ... it's a wealth of information about the current state of pathogens that want to leap onto humans and do horrible things. The battle is constant. I am amazed by the complexities of our bodies, our cells, our skin that protects us. Likewise, I was caught up in the ways in which corruption has made pandemics worse - many times. And it continues. At one stage Shah says that the next pathogen is brewing in the wet markets of Asia: her description of these markets shows how appalling they are - both for their filth and for their treatment of animals - as are the factory farms of the West. (lets hope to god that the wet markets are soon to be shut down). I highly recommend this book and congratulate Shah on making is easy for a non-scientist to read."
9,0374122881,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34301653-tom-glaser,5,"If not for the COVID-19 crisis, I probably wouldn't have read Pandemic. But finding myself with extra time on my hands, I decided to engage with a longer-form exploration of the subject instead of the hourly updates on new infections and business closings pouring out of the media.This book is really interesting. It’s only 217 pages, but packed with information about pathogens, how they spread, and how they can be managed. If you found Sapiens interesting, you’ll find Pandemic worthwhile, too. Both books deal with important, complex challenges facing civilization, but are also very readable.It’s fascinating to learn how many centuries it took for germ theory to develop and then finally displace prevailing beliefs about contagion. Only in 1901, did the German chemist Max von Pettenkofer, a leading proponent of miasmatism, the belief that cholera was spread by poisonous clouds, finally admit defeat and shoot himself. Just a few years before, scientists like Robert Koch and Filippo Pacini, who reported a connection between feces-contaminated water and cholera, were widely denounced by the medical community.While the book explores cholera in more depth than other infectious diseases, it also covers malaria, MRSA, SARS, Ebola, Lyme, and others. The very first chapter, called The Jump, takes us to a wet market in Guangzhou where the author describes “a thirty-pound turtle in a white plastic bucket…in a puddle of grey water next to cages of ducks, ferrets, snakes and feral cats. Row after row of animals who’d rarely if ever encounter each other in the wild were here, breathing, urinating, defecating and eating next to each other.” That wet markets are a nexus of microbial amplification and mutation was known when the SARS virus – a coronavirus – emerged in 2003, but they survived that epidemic and have now engendered a much more serious one.Importantly, the book deals with corruption’s role in spreading infectious disease. The author explains how even international public health organizations like WHO have been captured by special interests. After being starved of funding by the major donor nations, they turned to private philanthropies, companies and NGOs for financing. These private entities have prioritized their own agendas, and by 2005, 91% of the voluntary contributions that make up three-quarters of the agency's budget were “earmarked for diseases that account for just 8 percent of global mortality.” Similarly, the FDA has been coopted by the pharmaceutical and livestock industries and does not aggressively police antibiotic use in livestock for growth promotion. The result is a crisis of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.There are tons of other interesting discussions about things like the advantages and disadvantages of sexual reproduction, the role of pathogens on the evolution of distinct cultural groups, the discovery of suicide genes, and Aaron Burr’s role in delivering contaminated water to NYC residents. And that’s just scratching the surface."
10,0374122881,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14046991-ben-rogers,4,Excellent book. But sad. Why sad?Because the signs were there with previous similar diseases. This could have probably all been prevented. But everything just repeated itself (for the most part). It's all accounted in this book. Interesting points about how the WHO handled things in the past too. Definitely check it out!4.5/5
11,0374122881,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3888591-brandi,4,"A thorough look into the history of pathogens' interactions with humans, and the different factors that affected how quickly, and how far, they spread. I love that Shah goes as far as to bring up the political, psychological, and ecological aspects, because those often get overlooked. For instance, many people would agree that Lyme disease is becoming more of a problem, but it's not always mentioned that it's partly because of the destruction of natural wildlife. (i.e., Deforestation ==> less otters ==> more ticks, because otters would usually help get rid of ticks in the environment ==> Lyme disease spreads.)This was a very approachable read. It's definitely a journalistic, and not an academic work. A few of the sources she used were rather outdated, and I felt like some of the concepts and studies she mentioned (such as in Chapter 9) weren't concrete enough to state as fact. I'd feel better if the book had been written by someone with more of a science background. But nevertheless, it was very compelling, and makes for a good introduction to infectious disease."
12,0374122881,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1647517-victor-sonkin,5,"The title says more or less all about it — and this is a striking and breathtaking account of epidemics worldwide, their past and (possible, scary, quite likely inevitable) future. A very good account."
13,0374122881,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39807134-savir-husain-khan,4,"A pandemic is a disease epidemic that has spread across a vast region, for instance, multiple continents, or worldwide.The Author explains how various viruses spread, and an epidemic that supposes to affect a specific region reached the level of the global pandemic.For example, SARS, a CORONA virus started in Guangzhou, China, in the year 2003. A victim arrived in a hospital. Doctors were unsure of the cause. The physician in charge traveled to Hong Kong, where he checked into a hotel and infected 12 more people, including a flight attendant. The flight attendant then traveled to Singapore before falling ill and checking herself into a hospital. Her physician was due to fly to New York, but he only made it to Frankfurt before succumbing to the disease. Other infected people traveled to Vietnam, Canada, and the United States. Within one day, SARS had spread to five continents.It's a well-researched book, The Author covered various virus outbreaks that hit the world in the last 100 to 200 years and how the society fought over these viruses."
14,0374122881,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3342841-maria,5,"Fascinating book about various past pandemics. Reading it during the current pandemic just made me realize how history repeats itself, from the emergence of the disease to the lack of government response; to the reaction of the people, who would rather blame an invisible enemy rather than changing their lifestyle in directions that could prevent future disasters; to the late WHO response and bad decision-making due to financial interests; to the unwillingness to take precaution measures for fear of disrupting economy (which has always been largely more affected by a longer lasting pandemic than a short but drastic measures) and many more. A must read for anyone who has hard time accepting the current situation and wants to learn how the humanity has dealt with such calamities before. "
15,0374122881,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41152953-elena-granger,4,"Several months ago I would not have picked this book to read. But times change and here I am writing a review.It was published in 2015 and already predicted the huge pandemic to happen in the future. A good book that gives you quite a solid understanding of what the pandemic actually is, why it happens sometimes and the greatest thing is that it always comes to an end.It gave me the strength and motivation to leave on even in isolation not being able to travel and the hope to get back to normal living someday in the future.Stay healthy, safe, at home till we all can get out without being afraid or feeling anxious."
16,0374122881,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11035504-courtney,5,"Ms. Shah did an excellent job discussing pandemics and how they happen. She highlighted many issues that currently exist and how it might impact us. She also covered a wide range of topics from ""wet markets"" in SE Asia to the recent cholera outbreak in Haiti. She did such a good job of writing this, that I'm actually looking at other things she has written (newspaper articles that is). I do admit she had picked a different disease besides Cholera as the central disease. I feel that cholera is a ""golden child"" among authors writing about diseases. "
17,0374122881,http://goodreads.com/user/show/102159719-reading-tam-ishly,3,I just wanted more details and in-depth writing. The first chapter started out good. Other than that most of the topics were like teasers.

19,0374122881,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7329074-michael-gerald,4,"A good supplement for anyone reading about infectious diseases and pandemics these days. Ms. Shah also has the sagacity to point out that most infectious disease outbreaks in history occurred in Western societies due to unhygienic habits, private greed, and scientific ignorance."
20,0374122881,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8291584-zora,4,"Interesting view of emerging pathogens by continually referring back to cholera and its history to compare it. The author is a clear writer, she did a lot of good research (including going to a wet market in China, which I wouldn't do for a million dollars, literally, as I have read a good deal about zoonosis and SARS), and I learned a heck of a lot about cholera.Take away: human nature hasn't changed since cholera was an epidemic in the U.S. and advances in science have been undermined by human behavior, in particular overpopulation and its downstream consequences, and omg it is awful what might happen!That is my main complaint here, that it seems a little scaremongery. (I began looking differently at the package of pork chops in my freezer as I read this and wondered if I'd ever find the courage to defrost them.) But then the author has MRSA, and I don't, so perhaps this explains our different levels of alarm. So far my incurable diseases aren't quite that gross."
21,0374122881,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3964636-matt,4,"Very well researched and informative. This book covers many aspects of epidemic tracking and prevention, including the history, politics, epidemiology, and genetics behind infectious diseases. Despite being written in 2016, this book was very aware of the threat posed by our current coronavirus pandemic. The causes and potential emergence of COVID-19 are discussed in detail in the book, along with multiple other global health threats which still loom in India, Africa, South America, and the United States.I don't know which I liked more - the discussions of genetic sequencing and environmental tracking that modern scientists use to understand and keep tabs on potential contagions, or the vivid descriptions of historic plagues and the effects on their populations. There was so much to learn from this book and I felt like I took a lot away. I definitely think this book is a very good read for anybody who is interested in science, medicine, or history."
22,0374122881,http://goodreads.com/user/show/312880-melissa,3,"Pretty good. I do like how Shah tried to organize the material into chapters according to the ways infectious diseases take advantage of human behaviors to spread into pandemics. However, that meant the narrative ping-ponged around between different diseases and often felt too disjointed for my taste. More distinction should have been made between the different modes of transmission of the different agents (she did cover cholera fairly extensively). I have a lot more ""insider baseball"" information packed into my head on this subject so can fill in detail better. (If you're interested in a real-time example of many ideas in this book, look up the news and medical articles surrounding the current health crisis surrounding Zika virus)"
23,0374122881,http://goodreads.com/user/show/376211-joanna-taylor-stone,5,Missed my calling as an epidemiologist for sure. Loved this and think it's important reading in the nearly post-antibiotic age in which we live.
24,0374122881,http://goodreads.com/user/show/852666-shan,4,"Terrifying! But I couldn't put it down -- tons of interesting history, thoughtful analysis, and musings on the future. "
25,0374122881,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5399361-kam,5,"I have been hospitalised thrice: twice for dengue, and once for typhoid. These events occurred about a year or two years apart, and all of them happened when I was in grade school. The first incident (dengue) happened when I was around eight or so, and the experience has left me with a deeply-ingrained, almost visceral, fear of hypodermic needles of any sort. This meant, of course, that the subsequent hospitalisation incidents were horrifying to me even if I was being treated at very good hospitals and received quality care every time. And yet, despite the traumatising circumstances I have just mentioned, I am utterly fascinated by both diseases - especially dengue, which, unlike typhoid, cannot be vaccinated against and, being viral in nature, cannot be cured with antibiotics. Some might call it masochism, but I call it curiosity, more so because either disease could have killed me had I not received appropriate treatment and care before either disease could reach their more devastating stages. This fascination extends to other diseases, like SARS and AIDS and Ebola: all of which are lethal, and all the more interesting to me because of that lethality. When news of the Ebola epidemic in West Africa made headlines in 2014, I kept an eye on it not because I was afraid the disease would make it to the Philippines, but because I was interested in learning about how such a deadly virus would spread, and more importantly, how it would be contained. I was also interested in the hysteria citizens of Western countries exhibited as the epidemic was ongoing, watching as the hysteria unearthed deep-seated racism and xenophobia even in more “enlightened” countries. The social aspect is as important and interesting to me as the medical side of things: after all, crises as large as the Ebola epidemic affect much more than just the bodies of the sick, but extend into the rest of society as well. I am doing the same thing this year, now that there is nothing but talk of the Zika virus in the international news. While Zika is not as graphic in its effects as Ebola, there are still some interesting overlaps in terms of how people have reacted to it (in particular, how the Western - specifically American - scientific establishment did not really attempt to formulate a vaccine for it until it appeared within their own borders, much like how there was no serious attempt to create a vaccine for Ebola until American aid workers started coming home sick with it). Similar, too, is the hysteria some Americans are exhibiting over the virus, with several conspiracy theories regarding its origins already making the rounds.In the end, it was Zika that led me to Sonia Shah’s book Pandemic: Tracking Contagions, from Cholera to Ebola and Beyond. Shah did an interview with NPR about the future of pandemics, and it encouraged me to pick up her book. Pandemic is divided into ten chapters, plus an introduction. In each chapter, Shah tells the story of the 19th century cholera pandemic that brought several major European and American cities to their knees with her own investigation into the nature of 21st century pandemics. From time to time, her narrative is interspersed with her own personal experience, ranging from recollections of visiting family in India to helping her son recover from a wound infected with MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: the poster child of drug-resistant bacteria). The goal is to understand how and why pandemics happen, and what humanity can do to stop them - or if not, at least mitigate their spread.The first thing the reader needs to realise about this book is that it is not for the squeamish, nor for the hypochondriacal. Shah does not hold back in describing the effects of some of the deadliest pandemics in the world; indeed, she opens her Introduction with the following excerpt:Cholera kills people fast. There’s no drawn-out sequence of progressive debility. The newly infected person feels fine at first. Then half a day passes ,and cholera has drained his or her body of its fluids, leaving a withered blue corpse.That’s why, even after being infected, you could, say, eat a decent breakfast at your hotel, of sunny-side-up eggs and tepid juice. You could drive over dusty, potholed roads to the airport. You’d feel perfectly well enough to withstand the long queues there. Even as the killer silently brewed in your gut, you’d push your bags through security, perhaps even pick up a croissant at the coffee shop and enjoy a brief respite in a cool molded-plastic chair at the gate before a crackly PA announced the boarding of your flight.It would be only after you’d shuffled down the plane’s aisles and found your lightly tattered upholstered seat that the stranger within would make itself known, in a deadly, explosive onslaught of excretion, and your trip overseas would be suddenly and cruelly curtailed. Without the benefit of modern medicine rapidly administer,d you’d be faced with a fifty-fifty chance of survival.I think the above selection makes it abundantly clear that, if the reader is of a rather nervous disposition, it might not be very wise to pick this book up unless they are absolutely certain of what they are about to get themselves into. I myself felt a touch nauseated in some parts of the book, and I like to think I have a rather strong stomach when it comes to these sorts of things.But why cholera? If an author of a book about pandemics wants to talk about historical pandemics with relevance to the contemporary world, why not the 1918 influenza - the one that probably killed more people than all the battles of World War I combined? After all, influenza is one of the greatest viral threats to the world, and many of Shah’s readers will likely remember the H1N1 flu pandemic that happened in 2009. Shah explains her decision to use the 19th century cholera pandemic as her historical point of comparison in the following excerpt:Cholera is one of only a handful of pathogens—including bubonic plague, influenza, smallpox, and HIV—that in modern times have been able to cause pandemics… Among them, it stands alone. Unlike the plague, smallpox, and influenza cholera’s emergence and spread were well documented from the beginning. Two centuries after it first emerged, it remains exceptionally potent, with an undiminished power to cause death and disruption… And unlike relative newcomers like HIV, cholera’s an old hand at pandemics. So far, it’s caused seven, the latest hitting Haiti in 2010.Today cholera is known primarily as a disease that affects impoverished countries, but that wasn’t always so. In the nineteenth century, cholera struck the most modern, prosperous cities in the world, killing rich and poor alike, from Paris and London to New York and New Orleans. … Over the course of the nineteenth century, cholera sickened hundreds of millions, killing more than half of its victims. It was one of the fastest-moving, most feared pathogens in the world.But Shah’s narrative of the history of cholera is mostly a frame for a more pressing concern: the current wave of pandemics that are occurring today. Sometimes it seems like not a year passes without some new disease breaking out into the world, with paranoia and hysteria following in its wake, and it can sometimes feel like humanity is helpless against these new biological threats. Shah, however, points out that history can show us the way:By telling the stories of new pathogens through the lens of a historical pandemic, I could show both how new pathogens emerge and spread, and how a pathogen that had used the same pathways had already caused a pandemic. The path from microbe to pandemic would be illuminated in the overlap, where two dim beams intersected.Shah succeeds admirably in the above goal. By taking apart the history of cholera, she shows the true complexity underlying a pandemic. It is not so straightforward as a pathogen becoming deadly enough and virulent enough to be a true safety concern, nor is it just about scientists conducting research in the field or in laboratories. Pandemics occur, she claims, through complex interactions of history, economics, politics, and culture. “Epidemics are sparked by social conditions as much as they are by introductions,” she states in Chapter 6, and that is quite true. Even a cursory look at the ongoing Zika outbreak shows how a good grasp of culture and societal conditions is key to not only predicting where Zika will show up next, but ultimately, how it might be contained, or even cured. The same applies to any future pathogens that may emerge in the future.Underpinning all of this is Shah’s writing. There is a sense of urgency in it that drives the book forward, though it must be noted that that urgency can also sound a little bit like sensationalism in some places; fortunately that does not happen very often. This is just a minor complaint on my part, though, as it does not really interfere overmuch with the rest of the bookOverall, Pandemic: Tracking Contagions, from Cholera to Ebola and Beyond is a book that more people should read, despite the discomfort it is bound to induce. By combining historical accounts, the latest scientific research, and her own personal experience, Shah is able to show a possible path that humanity can take in confronting the biological threats that lie just beyond the horizon. Taking a multidisciplinary approach to the study of disease is merely the first step, but it is, perhaps, the most important one, because it is only by understanding how humanity interacts with the world - both inside and outside our bodies - that we can begin to find a way to understand what makes a pandemic, and hopefully, stop them from happening. "
26,0374122881,http://goodreads.com/user/show/962663-karen,5,"Shah focuses on how human beings respond to contagions--from host behavior to the psychology and sociology that actually inhibits our ability to identify and fight epidemics / pandemics because people often overlook the science because of biases ranging from scientific frameworks to scapegoating. This is the forth book on pandemics that I've read since March of 2020. I like this one for its strong narrative arc. I think people from the humanities as well as from psychology and sociology would be interested in how this book looks at how human perception and behavior affects the responses to outbreaks. 1. Intro: Cholera's Child: A little about cholera, more about HIV/AIDs and a tiny bit about MRSA2. Locomotion: How contagions move from animals to humans through bats, pigs, insects, etc. Cholera, SARS, HIV, Ebola, Zika, West Nile virus, monkeypox, etc. 3. Filth: How it took humans way too long to separate waste from drinking water. 4. Crowds: How industrialization / urbanization led to various outbreaks. 5. Corruption: How politicians and business leaders throughout history put reputation and profit over health. 6. Blame: How scapegoating certain animals and people distracts from solving outbreaks through science. 7. The Cure: How scientists in the UK flatly refused evidence-based studies on the transmission of cholera through the GI track because of long-standing acceptance of a belief in transmission of disease through miasmas (vapors, gases). 8. The Revenge of the Sea: How global warming and increased hurricane activity are bringing more cholera (which originates in oceans) inland. 9. The Logic of Pandemics: Shah applies evolutionary biology theory to the evolution of contagions, arguing that life on earth moved from cloning reproduction to sexual reproduction as an evolutionary advantage against microscopic predators--who evolve to be better infectors, but each generation of humans shifts the playing field as a defense against the pathogens. 10. Tracking the Next Contagion: A discussion on how people can do a better job preparing for the next pandemic. (GAH!) "
27,0374122881,http://goodreads.com/user/show/976904-frances,4,"This book is obviously incredibly timely, and yet it is hard to believe it was published five years ago. For instance, ""Of all the new pathogens emerging today, novel influenza viruses like H5N1 are the ones that keep the most virologists up at night. If H5N1 or any other novel avian influenza evolved to transmit effectively between humans, the death toll would be swift and substantial.... A novel influenza virus that could spread as well as the seasonal flu with an even marginally higher mortality rate could level millions."" It also speaks of scapegoating and the fact that though you might expect the arrival of a deadly contagion would cause people to ""move even closer together, to clasp hands and stand shoulder to shoulder in the face of the intruder. Instead, epidemics of new disease often set in motion 'an inexorable collapse of morals and manners...' The discord is ""often focused with laser-like intensity on specificities groups of people...""""That may be why epidemics caused by novel pathogens so often lead to violent scapegoating. Because they're poorly understood and specialize in striking societies with weak and corrupt social institutions, such epidemics are especially adept at disrupting people's sense of control over their environment."" And having just read ""The Ghost Map"" about the 1854 cholera epidemic in London, this book puts it in to the larger historical context. So many interesting threads that just seem to resonate today. An easily accessible book for a non-scientist. "
28,0374122881,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19011225-kelsey,5,"In this book, Sonia Shah describes the story of cholera and shows how its emergence as a pandemic can serve as a framework for understanding how other microbes brought about diseases like Ebola, MRSA, and SARS. Although this book was published before the arrival of COVID-19, the framework is very much applicable to making sense of the current pandemic.I really liked how Shah brought each stage of the progression to life by including historical examples of how biological, social, political, and economic factors all play roles in the development of pandemics."
29,0374122881,http://goodreads.com/user/show/113610757-eab,4,"This book was published a few years ago...the author completely predicts the current pandemic and the causes of it. It is a fascinating and scary history of communicable diseases. Habitat loss, global warming, wet markets, lack of infrastructure, overuse of antibiotics, modes of travel....the list goes on. The author is a science writer and uses those skills to tell the story of cholera, ebola, SARS, etc as well as her own experience with MRSA. I have a clinical background as an RN so had no difficulty with the scientific elements but some readers may find that a bit of a challenge."

37,0374122881,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10194052-lelietje,3,"Decent read about the science, politics, and history of pandemics. Shah focuses primarily on cholera and ebola. The most interesting parts for me were how pathogens spread in history versus modern times and a small piece about ancient pathogens and their influence on the evolution of our DNA, a subject she just touches but definitely something I want to read more about. For a more comprehensive and educated account on this subject matter I recommend reading ‘Spillover’ by David Quammen."
38,0374122881,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6809917-tessa-in-north-florida,4,"Excellent read! Here's my review:Tessa’s Nonfiction Recommendation: Pandemic by Sonia ShahEven after reading lots of books on infectious disease, I’m still always interested in a new one. Shah’s newest book, Pandemic, covers new developments and old patterns clearly and factually—and it is, at times, ominous and chilling. The current status of contagions and public health which Shah exposes is riveting, with fascinating details and previously unknown conclusions (to me, at least).Shah loops the book’s history with the current day by tracing cholera’s two-hundred-year global attack from the Sunderbans, Bay of Bengal, in 1817 to Haiti after the 2010 earthquake. She traces the history of Manhattan from Native American fishing grounds to cholera-breeding slums to the creation of the Manhattan Water Company, which become today’s JP Morgan Chase & Co. Her own family’s battle with the nearly indestructible MRSA infection becomes another datum in the appalling recital, revealing more unsettling contemporary difficulties, mostly due to how little we know about this awful condition.The third chapter, Filth, is full of fantastic fecal facts. For instance, snuff was not always a tobacco product. Many in the 1700’s used powdered fecal matter in their noses, called poudrette. Martin Luther, in the 1500’s, took a spoonful of his own feces daily, for his health. (Before you get too critical, remember that some among us today think eating our baby’s placenta is healthy. And leeches are making their way back into medical practice, too, I hear.) The chapter Crowds makes the case that the world has changed radically in the manner livestock are handled, contributing hugely to the current problems of contagion genes reasorting themselves into new mutated forms that can infect more species, more efficiently, more often. I was convinced.Corruption examines the political influences and ramifications of disease outbreaks throughout history, and it is the most alarming factor of all. The current state of the UN’s World Health Organization as laid out here explains a lot about recent poor handling of outbreaks.""Between 1980 and 2000, the number of deaths pathogens caused in the US alone rose nearly 60 percent...Excluding HIV, …by 22 percent."" I’m still reading this excellent book, but I strongly recommend that every single adult, all citizens, read the chapter on Corruption. Our survival as a country, and as a species, may well depend on important changes in the handling of global disease. ~ Tessa May 2016 4 out of 5 starsPS--After finishing, I would caution that the ending is kinda lame, but the content up to that point continues to give new insight into the latest discoveries.""Experimentally ridding mice of their microbes altered their behavior in suggest ways, reducing both their anxiety responses and ability to perform tasks requiring memory; exposing one mouse to the microbes of another led it to behave in ways that mimic the other."" p. 198"
39,0374122881,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4461733-paperclippe,3,"Well that was a thousand different kinds of depressing.That's not the fault of the book. The book gives a nice overview of the spread of contagious disease and how we as a society handle it. Spoilers: we are horrible. Aaron Burr doubly so.I did have a few issues with the book. First of all, it was read by the author, and normally I really like that, and am willing to concede a few idiosyncrasies in that case. However, there were a couple words that Shah kept mispronouncing that were driving me up the wall. ""juh-NOME"" for genome; ""ex-CRET-uh"" for excreta, ""gin-NAY-uh"" (what???) for the nation of Guinea (has she never had a guinea pig?); and a few others that were just confounding and irritating, especially considering that Shah is a science journalist. I totally understand that there are some words you see in print and never hear them out loud so you go a long time thinking one thing is another, but if you're going to be reading your own audiobook, you might want to look into that. She also criticized the Bill & Melinda Gates foundation for trying to eradicate malaria instead of just controlling it; I realize that this may be the case, I'm no expert on malaria. But she failed to back up this criticism with any evidence and every time she brought up the topic of malaria again, I was left wondering. (Considering Shah has given a TED talk called, “Three Reasons We Still Haven’t Gotten Rid of Malaria,"" this really stuck out to me.) Lastly, she kind of used the words ""pandemic"" and ""epidemic"" interchangeably. I realize that there's a lot of wiggle-room between the usage of the two, but there were some instances where it felt like she they might just be synonyms. These would be minor issues wherein the discussion of disease was a small part of a larger text, but considering that that was the main gist of the book overall, I had a hard time distracting myself from these things.All that said, the anecdotes and evidence within ranged from hilarious to depression-inducing, and were well-presented and always engaging. It was a good overview of the subject with a strong focus on the cholera epidemics of the 1800s and 1900s (and their unfortunate reemergence of late), and if you just need something quick to read or listen to, this is good, but I would highly recommend ""Spillover"" by David Quammen for a slightly more in-depth discussion, especially of the zoonotic diseases that were brought up in ""Pandemic."""
40,0374122881,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10050737-lisa-eckstein,4,"This is a rare nonfiction read for me, but I was thinking about pandemics, because who doesn't, and I remembered hearing good things about this book when it came out earlier this year. It's packed with fascinating, terrifying details, presented in a highly readable narrative.The book examines the factors that lead to diseases spreading and considers how they came into play during past outbreaks, comparing long-ago and recent scenarios. Some of the facts bode poorly for the future, as when Shah explains that diseases are more likely than ever before to jump from other animals into humans, since habitat destruction and climate change push these populations closer together. In other areas, progress works in our favor, and I was glad to have the benefit of historical distance when reading the horror stories of periods when mistaken scientific beliefs made people more vulnerable to disease. I was astonished to learn about the influence of pathogens on human evolution, and I was amused to come across some surprise Hamilton content.My only disappointment was that the book didn't cover as much ground as I expected. I was under the impression there would be more speculation on future outbreaks, but that was less of a focus than I imagined. I was also surprised that certain famous pandemics, such as the bubonic plague and influenza in 1918, received little attention. I suppose Shah wanted to present less-explored material by focusing on cholera's long history and several diseases with twenty-first century outbreaks. So while I would have been happy for another hundred pages or so with those topics included, I enjoyed/feared all the information contained in this entertaining/horrific book."

Sonia Shah looks at both the history and what the future holds for us in regards to Pandemics the event that strikes fears into all,. The author uses the history of Cholera to thread all the chapter together as she covers how pandemics happen to the conditions that makes pathogens a mass killer. Each chapter builds the readers knowledge and scares you just a little bit more. As humans strived to improve their life and explore the world around them they also opened the gates for pathogens to follow and lay waste. If I could go back to being a young lad I would strive to become a Virologist. This topic fascinates me as much as it scares me. Sonia Shah has delivered a well-balanced and informative book. By exploring the history of Cholera she ties it in seamlessly to the modern day pathogens such as Ebola, SARS and Avian and Swine flu. I highly recommend this book to one and all......now where's that hand sanitizer?"

It felt more like the author really wanted to tell a history of Cholera epidemics (which would have been fine), but then awkwardly slapped on material about SARS, Ebola, and a few other epidemics just to take up more space or perhaps cover diseases that have more ""in your face"" media coverage. For those interested in epidemics/pandemics/infectious diseases I would recommend Spillover by David Quammen as an alternative. "

49,0374122881,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5881337-clay,4,"Published years before COVID-19 caught our attention, it takes a historical look on pandemics, starting with Cholera. That one started up from microcrustaceans in coastal lowlands of what is now Bangladesh. These caused no problems for humans until the British colonial regime moved a large labor force in for agriculture. Cholera morphed, started human to human transmission, and made it's way around the world. In Paris in 1832, for example, people would arrive looking normal for a dinner party, and die before the desert course. In New York at the same time, there were similar dire effects. The poor suffered the most, but now exclusively: James Jacob Astor's daughter died of it in New York. This and other pandemics were caused by a sweet spot of human to animal contact, advances in transportation, crowded cities making social distancing difficult, and filth. The book points out extensive evidence that a key factor was Christianity, which didn't have the ritualized handwashing and other requirements for cleanliness that Muslims, Hindus, and other devout people have. Cholera spread fast in Paris and New York, where residents dumped their shit on the street, and it got into the drinking water. Likewise, dog shit is a key enabler of disease, then and now.Further work would be helpful to better understand some of the points. For example, if Christianity was the problem leading to lack of cleanliness, what is the evidence that muslim/hindu settlements on the same scale as New York and Paris avoided Cholera and other pandemics? There are many echos of past pandemics in our current response to COVID-19 in the USA. First is the role of corruption. In the case of outbreaks of cholera in New York from 1832, an important factor was infected drinking water. A key reason was that the Manhattan Company, with support from Aaron Burr, took over control of water supply on false pretenses. Claiming to bring private investment and expertise to produce clean water, it in fact did just the opposite, prioritizing shortcuts and provision to a small minority that was inexpensive to serve, and putting most of the investment in profitable areas besides water. Behaving like some privatized water companies today, this venture, later to become JP Morgan Chase, was a key factor in cholera outbreaks until its water business was closed down in the 1850s.Indeed, private interests have trumped public interests, then and now. Quarantines had long been proven effective in Europe (the word comes from the Italian for forty days, after a lockdown in Venice during the bubonic plague), but business and their allied politicians often questioned them, and pushed responsibility for enforcing them to the local level, such as to port administrators. Many governments have actively suppressed information on raging pandemics to minimize economic damage, including China's government (SARS, 2002) the Italian government in 2012 (cholera).Another commonality is the use of scapegoats, notably immigrants and other vulnerable minorities. Then and now, frightened citizens believe false narratives and conspiracy theories, whether about Irish in New York during the 19th century (Cholera), or gay people (HIV AIDS), or Asian Canadians in Toronto during the 2003 SARS pandemic, or deer during US outbreak of lyme disease (actually comes from rodents), or health care workers during many different pandemics and vaccination campaigns(eg Guinea 2014 Ebola). Indeed, some analysts think that caste, racial and tribal categories originated from highly localized immune behaviors of different groups that led to rules limiting contact. With what we know today, even though scapegoated targets may have members with a role in disease transmission, the real cause is economic development, social and environmental conditions, transport networks, and government policies.What can be done? Earlier recognition of emerging pandemics is the main thing. Achieving this is complex, since there are so many moving parts that we need to get right. Biomedical solutions are not enough; we need to also address the social, political and economic factors, particularly in the poor countries where most pathogens originate. Whatever we may or may not do, pandemics have been with us since the dawn of humanity, and have likely be crucial in guiding our evolutionary progress and setbacks. Climate change will likely make them more frequent and virulent."
50,0374122881,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12785148-becky-b,3,"Sonia Shah takes a look at the development of some pathogens that have created pandemics, what conditions aid and hinder pandemics, and a case study of certain pathogens such as cholera and it's track around the globe, and finally what can be done to help prevent the next pandemic.Warning: Do not hand this to just anyone! You could totally freak some people out and create severe hypochondriacs if they aren't well grounded. Ok, now that the warning is out of the way...Sonia Shah did some things really well in this book. I appreciated her history of cholera and her investigation of what led up to scary situations like SARS and Swine Flu. Her family's personal war with MRSA was also fascinating. And the chapter on humans' tendency to find illogical scapegoats during a pandemic was eye opening. There were two things I wish she would have changed. First off, just cut out Chapter 9. It is called the Logic of Pathogens, but there's very little logical about it. Wild Speculation of Pathogens might be better, especially the part of the chapter where she states that pathogens and our genetic responses to them could be the basis of ethnic groups and caste divisions. Seriously! I couldn't believe her publisher let her put that in there. Congratulations on turning germophobes into xenophobes and giving people the ridiculous argument that their racial and social prejudice can be blamed on their genetics. Not is that bad, but the science is backwards. The pathogens you are exposed to and resistant to rely a whole lot more on your geographic location and social tendencies. Many people tend to hang out with those of the same culture because that is comfortable, and when you hang out you tend to get exposed to the same germs. So the similarity in immunity is not the cause of ethnic groups, it is the result of hanging out in ethnic groups. The school I work at would be a lovely case study to totally blow this theory out of the water. We're an international school. We have students and teachers here from all six inhabited continents. We're all exposed to the same germs and therefore should all have similar pathogens and resistance to them, and it has nothing to do with ethnicity. It's all about location. I found it especially ironic that Shah spends chapter 9 interpreting the world through the lense and activity of pathogens while ignoring the bigger picture and just a few chapters before that she calls out doctors for focusing on the microscopic causes of illness and ignoring the broader picture. So trust me, just skip chapter 9. Now to my 2nd issue, Shah points out the big problems with trying to prevent the next pandemic, and she's studying pandemics and those who work to fight them...AND SHE NEVER ONCE MENTIONS EPIDEMIOLOGISTS! Ok, I take that back. She casually mentions that she was with an epidemiologist or met one in certain places as she did research, but she never talks about what they do. She wants people who look at the microscopic and the big picture in looking for causes and solutions to pathogens, well, Ms Shah, you missed a whole field dedicated to just that. Never heard of an epidemiologist? That's ok, it isn't a very well known occupation. Here's how the US Bureau of Labor Statistics defines the job in their Occupational Outlook Handbook, ""Epidemiologists are public health professionals who investigate patterns and causes of disease and injury in humans. They seek to reduce the risk and occurrence of negative health outcomes through research, community education, and health policy."" Sounds like something a person writing about pandemics should have investigated and told you about, huh? It's a glaring admission in a book on modern pathogens and the fight against them. Her rallying cry shouldn't have just been to better report and more wisely fight current illnesses, for better handling of animals prone to carry viruses that can jump to humans, for better management of WHO and for the pharmaceutical companies to actually do research and make drugs to get people healthy not just their own gain. Those are well and good, but she should also be calling for more people to study and become epidemiologists. The field is small, hardly known, and yet, these are the specialists we really need more of. Epidemiologists are the ones best prepared to understand, deal with, and advise the public and leaders on these public health matters. I was shocked and disappointed she skipped over them, and it made me feel like the book was written with tunnel vision. She had her point that she wanted to make and didn't include anything that didn't fit. So though the book is interesting, and though she has many good points, I felt this failing bumped the book as a whole down to just ok. Let's go find a similar book written by an epidemiologist."
51,0374122881,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16105107-fadillah,5,"Another 5 stars rating book i read this year and another amazing non fiction female author i discovered this year. This book is very informative particularly on Cholera. Ebola, H1N1, MERS and SARS are covered in some chapters in this book but the main focus is cholera. At the end of the day, i learned so much about Cholera but what i truly grasped from this book is human beings are so irrational and never learn from their mistakes. Here's are the summary why i said so :1. China never learned from their pandemic history. They could have utilized what they have experienced with H5N1and SARS and turned it into a mechanism to stop any future pandemic. If only they managed their wildlife trade and wet markets, maybe covid19 can be detected in the early stage and prevention steps would have been deployed earlier. Unfortunately, here we are, in the middle of second wave of Covid19 that affected us globally.2. The credibility of World Health Organization (WHO) and lack of accountability. Previously, WHO funded by public financing from UN's Members. However, the skepticism arises and WHO turn to private finance. Majority of WHO decisions for the past 50 years has been done to suits the private enterprise agenda. ""Compromising"" happens and prompt response are being downplayed. This happened in 2014 in West Africa as WHO officials refused to acknowledge Ebola outbreak does not want to upset the investors and mining companies. As of now, the biggest contributor for WHO is Gates foundation ran by bill gates and His wife melinda gates. Bill gates maybe championing the global health campaign but there are no mechanisms that will hold him accountable for it.3. Human beings are the causes of it. We invade the undisturbed land (in the case of Cholera which was originally only resides in copepods in Sundharban), we eat things that we should not supposed to eat (wildlife markets in China), we tip off the balance scale of environment with our overpopulation (no proper sanitation with everything flowed back to the source of water that we ended up using and drinking it) , uncontrollable pollution (unhygienic practices of poultry farms) and unstoppable plundering of resources on this earth. On top of that, globalization made the world smaller and shrinking every day. Traveling by air, water and land was made easier by the technology and at the same time, aiding pathogens and microbes to further infected others. This was proven whereby Cholera outbreak in Haiti due to the Nepali workers who happened to be a carrier. 4. Climate change will be the death of humanity eventually. Pathogens and microbes usually does not thrive in a warm environment. We as Mammals have an added advantage over them as a warm blooded animals. Our immunity system combines with our warm blood as , the infection can be curb quickly. However, past years has proven that these pathogens quickly adapted and changes their nature to become more resistant. On top of that, there are pathogens that are resistant to antibiotics and making it hard to be cured.5. Malaysia was mentioned few times particularly on our own Nipah Virus Outbreak in the year of 1998-1999. Our government finally decided to listen to the scientist after wrongly deduced that it comes from mosquitos. Major infection happened to the pig farmers and Government taking a measure of culling almost a million pigs in order to stop the outbreak. It worked but it almost caused the pork industry in Malaysia to collapse. In this particular case, killing animals worked to stop the outbreak. However, most of the times, it did not. H1N1 outbreak in Egypt occured and Hosni Mubarak ordered pig farms were closed and all pigs ended up being killed. H1N1 maybe originally from Pig but it was human pathogens. Killing those pigs didnt stop the H1N1 in Egypt. One species of deers are blamed for being a host of tick and eventually caused lyme disease. US government allowed this deer species to hunted as to prevent the disease. Unfortunately, the tick picked the disease from Rodents not deer. The scapegoating issue in the blame chapter really showed the worst side of humanity.Overall, i would highly recommended this book if you really wanted to understand the past pandemics. You will be surprised to read that the treatment of health care workers received in certain countries didnt change back then and sure as hell it didnt change now. They were shunned and being called names and to the extreme measures, some are being killed. The author also shared how scientific community functioned back. Few scientist names has been cited to further celebrate their contribution in curing cholera. However, that was not the case back then. They were mocked and ostracized because they were considered an outsider (like John Snow) and does not have any connection with anyone. Again, a highly recommended book. If you love biology/science subjects, this is the book for you."

And the book blew me away!While I did notice some factual errors along the way, stuff that was either insufficiently researched or used for dramatic purposes, Pandemic was amazingly good. And terribly disgusting. If Barry took the high road of celebrating the heroes in the fight against pathogens, Shah writes so that every chapter destroyed more and more of my fate in humanity. By the end of the book I was rooting for a disease that just comes and kills us all to spare us the embarrassment of being human. I mean, the investigation starts with cholera and the undignified way in which it makes you involuntarily squirt every liquid you have until you look and feel like a desiccated corpse and if you don't die the chances are people will confuse you with a corpse and bury you alive. But then it got to the horrid conditions that existed before the 20th century even in New York, a place where the population density exceeded that of modern Tokyo five times and people would wallow in their own excrement thrown in the streets and infesting their water supply. Then it described an epidemic of cholera in such a hellish place; can't get any more disgusting, right? But wait, then there is a chapter on corruption and how financial interests caused the death of thousands just so some people can build a bank corporation like JPMorgan Chase, the biggest US bank today, built on literally feeding shit to people until they died. Diseases not allowed to come into the public eye for the sake of tourism and all that crap. Can it get worse? Yes, because once the disease is there, the blame game is on. The cause of the disease is not germs, the blame is not on a corrupt medical or political system, the fault lies solely on dirty immigrants, gays, minorities and if all else fails, the aid workers that are trying to help, but probably brought the contagion themselves on some sinister agenda.And then we get to the point where we learn our brilliant present is based just on the ignorance or indifference to present dangers or current super bug pandemics. After all the horror the book presents, the end result is but a whimper, business as usual, ineffective uninformed lethargic reactions to attacks that started decades ago and were completely ignored (pooh-poohed, to use Shah's expression, alarmingly suggestive of choleric excrement). The science is way better, the attitudes remain pre 19th century.I feel like The Great Influenza, Pandemic and I Contain Multitudes are three books that need to be read together, like a pack. Followed or perhaps preceded by Sapiens. I know, these are all books I've recently read and there are probably hundreds more that could join a list based on topic, but to me all of these stories clicked like puzzle pieces and opened my eyes to a complete picture.In conclusion, I highly recommend reading Pandemic. It's good for the people in the medical field, it's good for people that couldn't care less (they will after reading it), it's a must read."

You need to understand how outbreaks emerge and how they grow to catastrophic proportions.As we have learned about the oxymoron ie 'social distancing' and the book has explored the spread of pandemic takes place in crowded places and thrive in large crowds.Many people are attracted to the world’s large and vibrant cities. Since the beginning of the nineteenth century, New York City has been home to people from all over the world seeking work and a better life. But this hasn’t always turned out so well.Dramatic increases in the population meant people were forced to live in terrible conditions. And by 1850, the New York City slums were six times more crowded than modern-day Tokyo or Manhattan. These kinds of conditions led to two massive cholera outbreaks, one in 1832 and another in 1849.More recently, in 2014, several major West African cities struggled to contain a disastrous Ebola outbreak. And it is no coincidence that all of these outbreaks affected crowded areas the worst.Large crowds hold three advantages for pathogens.First, the more people there are, the more quickly germs can spread.Many pathogens travel through social contact, like shaking hands, so the more crowded a place is, the higher the rate of contact. Therefore, once a pathogen moves from a sparsely populated area to a crowded city, its transmission rate spikes.Second, pathogens can survive longer in large crowds.In densely populated cities, there are simply more people to infect, which means it takes longer for an epidemic to run its course.For example, prior to 2014, all Ebola outbreaks had occurred in smaller cities and lasted only a few months. But, as the 2014 outbreak hit overcrowded slums in West African cities, the rate of infections continued to grow even ten months after it began.Third, in crowds, pathogens are free to be aggressive.Under less crowded circumstances, pathogens can’t afford to be aggressive and kill their victims quickly. Otherwise, it wouldn’t be able infect other people. But, since germs can spread rapidly in crowded cities, pathogens can also get more aggressive and rapidly sicken and kill the infected.But it’s not just the crowds of modern city life that bears the spreading of disease. The book finds out how corrupt politicians also offer an advantage and extract profits out of such crisis. However, conspicuous by absence is the profit earning opportunity which pharmaceutical companies do not miss at such time of crises. The key message in the book contains that civilization has brought many new pathogens with it and researchers think that a new pandemic will emerge in the decades ahead with outbreak of Covid-19 has proved true the prediction of the author, albeit, within a decade. In order to survive this we need to be aware of the origins and causes of these new pathogens. Crowds, waste management and a lack of communication between different fields of medicine are only a few factors that contribute to the spreading of new diseases."

Example: biodiversity loss in NY, USA, lead to the West Nile virus outbreak in Queens in 1999.Climate change with Warner waters will get humans closer to creatures that cause us harm: bats, mosquitoes and ticks. Dengue now also reaches California USA but in the past this never happened.Red meat rich in sialic acid, there might be a link between consuming red meat and cancer. Our bodies see the red meat as foreign and fights it with inflammation.How science/governments can help to prevent pandemics: actively monitor hot spots (where wild habitat is being invaded in new ways, where crowded slumps are booming, factory farms are growing...).Institutes like Ali-Ka Xing intake and study samples periodically to look for potential pandemic-causing viruses: https://www.ualberta.ca/li-ka-shing-i...USAID emerging pandemic threats program, sentinel surveillance (https://www.who.int/immunization/moni...) and other active monitoring efforts can detect new pathogens and potential spillovers. For example: health map detected Ebola outbreak 9 days before than the WHO shared the news.Good ideas:Global pandemic insurance fund, Microbe mapping, weather surveillance to predice malaria outbreaks, active monitoring, people acting responsibly on the information provided.More on this thought - personal thoughts: People need to act on the information provided by active monitoring, wash properly and continuously hands, cover coughs and sneezes, do social distancing or self-quarantine if seek, etc..."

(p87) dun dun DUNNNNN""it's true that sometimes pathogens crash like a tidal wave, descending too quickly or harshly or cryptically for societies to understand what to do before it's too late. but in many cases, collective defenses of even the most crude sort--isolating the sick and warning each other of a disease's spread, say--can act like an underwater barrier, breaking the wave of death and destruction. "" (p97) "" cooperative strategies are especially important to defend ourselves against new pathogens because they don't necessarily require high-tech interventions or sophisticated understanding of the pathogen itself to be effective...larger, more formally organized societies can implement even more efficient containment strategies based on cooperative behaviors, like quarantines... many of the institutions of modern society, after all are designed to enhance our natural capacities for cooperation, by punishing noncooperators and encouraging the rest of us to pursue even relatively mundane collective actions, like paying taxes and getting flu shots."" (p98) she's predicted the mask debate of 2020!"" powerful private interests unfettered by public controls are like royalty. we've ceded control to them and now we must simply hope that they are good. our ability to mount a cooperative defense against the next pandemic depends on it."" (p119) ""extreme events do tend to bring people closer together...but that's not what tends to happen when pandemic-causing pathogens strike. unlike acts of war or catastrophic storms, pathogens don't built trust and facilitate cooperative defenses. on the contrary, they're more likely to breed suspicion and mistrust among us, destroying social bonds as surely as they destroy bodies."" (p119) "" today, when new pathogens emerge, there's no decades-long delay in figuring out how they spread. modern biomedicine quickly identifies new pathogens' modes of transmission...[which] allows preventive strategies to be promptly devised, like condoms in the case of HIV, or face masks in the case of SARS, or safe burials in the case of Ebola. (Of course, that doesn't mean those strategies can or will be implemented--HIV infected nearly 75 million people worldwide by 2014 despite the medical establishment's insights into how to prevent it by practicing safe sex.)""

Epidemiologist have long know and predicted more corona viruses will emerge due to increased and quickening environment growth and impacts of human activities, close proximity to enormous pig, cattle, poultry farms and continued use of Asian wet markets. Political leaders continue to prioritize commerce and national reputation over public health.Containing the disease called for a level of international cooperation, effective municipal governance, and social cohesion. Pathogens that spread through social contact are usually destined to be relatively mild. However Crowds allow even these pathogens to become killers.Human cooperation is, biologically speaking, a formidable thing. Most mammals cooperate with each other only when they’re related by blood. Not us. We cooperate more frequently, more intensively, and on a larger scale than any other species on Earth. However in a general sense, outbreak happens when sufficient numbers of individuals choose to pursue their own private interests rather than public ones.-Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA-H1N1-SARS, for severe acute respiratory syndrome-Vibrio cholerae(endemic)-West Nile Virus-Lyme Disease-New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1 (NDM-1)-highly pathogenic avian influenza” or HPAI.40H1N1 (1918 pandemic most nightmarish)H5N1-Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).-NDM-1 -malaria (endemic)More than 60 percent of our newly emerged pathogens originate in the furred and winged creatures around us.

Most—over 70 percent—come from wild animals.-microbes immortal ReassortmentUnder optimal conditions, microbes double their numbers every half hour. They never age. So long as there’s enough food around, they won’t die unless something kills them.** The genetic mutation that allowed people to survive leprosy, which is present in 70 percent of modern Europeans, is now associated with inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis."
57,0374122881,http://goodreads.com/user/show/930302-michelle,3,"I've had this book on my to-read shelf since February 2016. I'm not sure what made me decide to add it, but I know the current COVID-19 pandemic convinced me it was time to get around to reading it. Shah uses cholera as an example to trace the history of epidemics and pandemics, and to understand the primary drivers of potential future pathogens. It is fairly easy to read and understand, and of course a bit scary. There is a lot of good history in here, and she easily explains differing scientific paradigms. She also talks about why some pathogens raise concerns, while we have essentially gotten used to others, regardless of how deadly they may be. There were a number of quotes that jumped out at me, given what's currently going on:""When pandemics unfold, it's not just because peculiarly aggressive pathogens have exploited previously oblivious victims or because we've inadvertently provided them with ample transmission opportunities. It's also because our deeply rooted, highly nuanced capacity for cooperative action failed. In a general sense, this happens when sufficient numbers of individuals choose to pursue their own private interests rather than public ones.""""Political leaders continue to prioritize commerce and national reputation over public health."" ""Even when scientists devise new cures, we are not necessarily able to produce them at the right scale and at the right time. Drug development is slow and constrained by the economic concerns of the for-profit pharmaceutical industry.""Let's hope that current trends will reverse themselves and that people will start cooperating instead of thinking only of themselves. Let's also hope that the for-profit companies not only discover a vaccine, but find a way to disseminate it in a quick, cheap, and fair manner."
58,0374122881,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17999985-brendan,5,"4.5I stumbled onto this book at my local library and was quite surprised to find it had interesting reviews on Goodreads. The strength of the book is the final third, it has a great conclusion when comparing it to the earlier sections of the book. Sonia Shah has an interesting idea here and while it wasn't a complete home run, it is a book deserving a wider audience. This tends to link with my Journey of Man series, evolution basically and it connects quite well to everything I have read over 2018/2019. Pandemic is a solid investigation into Cholera to Ebola, something I knew little about. The book is quite sluggish in the early part and tends to flip around with the contagions. Some of these are more interesting than others, but it all leads to a great grand finale. Sonia is in her element when painting a wider picture and exploring fresh ideas and concepts. The gene linkage to past disease was extremely interesting and I hope this is explored further down the line. The shackles of anti biotics and how they are now control by the rich foundations was a nice side bar and another section I was eager to learn more about. Why the 4.5?The book is good and with a strong beginning, this could have easily crept into the 5 club. The long story driven contagions takes up the better section of the book. I liked this, but some of the New York seemed to be similar and lost my interest. I'm eager to explore the independent sections of this book. Like the JFK Warren Commission, I wanted the right questions to be asked in the end. Strong investigation work and some free flowing research points kept me engaged. I recommend this, but if you know a little about Cholera, this will tread similar ground. "
59,0374122881,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19245561-abhineet-singh,5,"What a fascinating book. I started reading this book during the ongoing ""Great Lockdown"" of the Covid-19 pandemic, with the curiosity to make better sense of things going on in the world. But I was so wrong. I should have read this book a long time ago.The author beautifully explains the way microbes have come to rule over lives. Wrong! While the prevalent notion is that the microbes have recently started playing an important role in our lives, the fact is that the microbes have always had played a pivotal role in the lives of homo sapiens. Right from our evolution, to our bodily mechanisms, our food habits, our cultural habits, as well as our political outlook, xenophobic tendencies, etc. Even the way we reproduce (Sexually, and not by cloning ourselves) and the inevitability of death, microbes have played a more important role than we could have ever imagined.The role of personal and societal hygiene, food habits, and the inability of the old school of medicine (Hipprocatic school) and their role in aiding/mitigating the disease spread have been lucidly explained in the book. The role of WHO has been rightly questioned (as seen clearly by their response to the Corona virus), and so has been the response of various governments to the WHO's disease surveillance mechanism (Italy's secret cholera epidemic, India's response to NDM-1).The Logic of pandemics is probably the most important chapter I have read in my life. It explains the role of microbes and their ferocious, destructive power. It provides a glimpse of the role of sexual reproduction and death in our lives. It explains the role of evolution and the role these microbes have played in them.I will recommend this book to everyone."
