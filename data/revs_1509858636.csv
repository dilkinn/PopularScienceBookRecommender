“So I told them the truth: the hours are terrible, the pay is terrible, the conditions are terrible; you’re underappreciated, unsupported, disrespected and frequently physically endangered. But there’s no better job in the world.”
I devoured this book in a single sitting. It is rare to find a book that can make you laugh and cry in equal measure-- especially, I think, a nonfiction book --but this one managed it just fine.It's very British, with references to British TV shows I'm pretty sure the rest of the world has never heard of, so bear that in mind if you are a non-Brit thinking of reading this. But it is essentially a publication of the diaries Adam Kay kept while he was a junior doctor working for the NHS. It is a funny, moving portrait of a service that underpays, undervalues, and overworks its doctors, and yet, despite all of this, it is a love letter to universal healthcare.Kay shares his experiences training as an obstetrician-gynecologist, from the gory stories that made me cringe, to the devastating loss of patients, to the destruction of his personal relationships due to the long hours and last-minute demands. It sounds like a nightmare, but he keeps a good humour throughout. Some parts of it are genuinely very funny. Some parts are genuinely revolting.It exposes a lot that is wrong with the NHS, but never loses sight of how truly important it is. It wasn't until I came to live in California that I really understood how fortunate we were. I had lived in a bubble where healthcare was taken for granted as a human right and no one was ever told they couldn't be made better because they were too poor. The realization that some countries allowed people to die preventable deaths shook me to my core. It still does.It bothers Adam Kay, too. He finishes his hilarious and touching tales with a direct plea to the government and to us to take the NHS and its doctors seriously. To respect it and them. To not take the work done for granted. Such a powerful and important read wrapped up in a highly-entertaining package.Facebook | Instagram"

It was a mostly irreverent look at the early years of being a junior doctor, then an obstetrician, until something catastrophic happens to a patient and the author turned from medicine to writing comedy. It was an excellent read, one good anecdote after another and rather than a review I'd like to summarise two. One concerns herbal medicine and the other the very serious topic of spousal abuse and how the hospital dealt with it in pregnant women.1. Herbal A woman had come to the hospital with a bleeding from her vagina problem. When the doctor told her it was the result of the Chinese herb she had been dosing herself with she said, ""I thought it was just herbal how can it be that bad for you?"" The doctor said that apricot stones had cyanide in, the death cap mushroom is often fatal, Nature does not equal safe and that there was a plant in his garden where if you simply sat under it for ten minutes you'd be dead.Later the author asked the doctor what plant that was. He replied, ""Water lily."" Ah so...2. Abuse. The hospital had a system to help women admit to abuse, which was difficult as their partners often accompanied them to ante-natal visits. In the toilets they had a sign saying 'if you want to discuss any concerns about violence at home, put a red sticker on the front of your notes,' and there were sheets of red dot stickers in every cubicle.So the doctor saw a woman with a few red stickers on the front of her notes. It was very difficult to get the husband to leave the room. He tried, the midwife tried, the consultant tried and eventually they got her alone. The woman just clammed up, scared and confused and would admit to nothing. Eventually they established that the red dots were artistic decoration by her two year old child when they went to the toilet together.I think Ockham's Razor applies here!5 stars for being a great read and exposing the very emotional side of being a doctor and not just the practice of medicine._____________________________________________More anecdotes  from when I was reading the book.This is so funny. This 20 year old student goes to the doctor to request an abortion following condom failure. Turns out that she and her boyfriend didn't have much money so they turned the just-used condom inside out for round two! _______I knew I was going to read this book when I read, ""A NOTE REGARDING FOOTNOTESRead the fucking footnotes.""Laughed out loud.And then one of the first sentences, ""I grew up in a Jewish family (although they were mostly in it for the food)... it's really got to be a good book with such louche writing."

I remember when I was a teenager, I would call her at her work to ask if she could get so and so from the store and sometimes she would respond with, ''I can't today, love, I'm too tired. I can barely keep my eyes open. I'll go tomorrow.'' I would be so annoyed when she would say that, not understanding the kind of pressure she was under at work (and just being a selfish brat). I'm so sorry, mom..."
3,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21679362-ruby-granger,5,SUCH an important book. Anyone who does not work in the NHS should be obliged to read this.
4,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28602001-emma,4,"A genuinely funny collection of stories from a former doctor; some so horrifying, surprising, or amusing that I had those hard-to-breathe-while-laughing moments, immediately making Audible clips and sending them to all my friends. It's not for the squeamish, be prepared for lots of blood, births, bad language, and assorted 'implements' stuck in places they really shouldn't be. Rarely have I been so impressed (if that’s the right word) by the willingness of individuals to achieve a memorable sex life by inserting objects into orifices and then having to go to A&E to have them removed. There are, of course, also very sad stories, including the one that led the author to decide he had to leave. It would have been wrong to focus solely on the laughs, denying the inevitable traumas, near misses, and deaths, some of which may have been prevented by having a properly run, well staffed, less overworked team of doctors. If nothing else, you leave the book with the understanding that the NHS is barely getting by. This is the very reason Kay wrote the book, as rebuttal of the politicians' portrayal of junior doctors as money grabbing and lazy, but only in the final section does he address this directly. Instead, he shows you a doctor and other staff worked to the very edge of their ability to cope. It's eye opening and I left it feeling even more grateful for this amazing resource we have. One we need to protect. In mixing comedy and reality, Kay has found an effective way to show us some truths while making us laugh so hard we have to hold back tears. It's the best kind of learning."
5,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69932312-sara,5,"This book had me laughing hysterically one minute and desperately trying not to cry the next. It was heart warming, hilarious and devastating all at once.Easy 5*s "
6,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4159922-diane-s,4,"I so needed this book. Of course in the states we don't have National Health, but many of the snippets of humor are universal. Irreverent humor, spread around. If you are easily offended this book is probably not one you want to read. The many things people can put in their bodies, unreal. Some of the stories are cringe worthy, some unbelievable, but things these young doctors encounter.The ending though was serious and includes a letter to the National Health service, explaining the many changes that need to be enacted to keep doctors from making mistakes. Too long hours, burnout, trying to do too much with too little. So, the tone does change, but up to them it is narrates by the author himself in a modular tone. I enjoyed this and agree with the changes he would like to see. These changes would benefit all doctors, no matter where they practice."
7,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1170391-sara,4,"I loved this. In part funny and heartwarming, yet also utterly heartbreaking and disillusioned. I think this strikes a particular cord with me at the moment as the author was an obs & gynae doctor, and I’ve recently spent time myself as an inpatient on such a ward. This is the first book in a while where I’ve read passages out to my husband while laughing out loud one minute and then had to hold back tears the next. It’s a full on rollercoaster of emotions that also seems to very accurately describe what it’s like to work as front line staff for the NHS. I should know, I do it everyday too, and we all have our stories to tell that encompass the best and worst of British medical care. It’s one of my favourite things about the job, hearing stories from everyone about ‘that time a patient shoved a remote control up their rectum’ or ‘remember that night shift a woman faked passing out’. I think it’s what binds and bonds you all together. The camaraderie. Told with a liberal dose sarcasm and self deprecating humour, the author manages to walk that tightrope between friend, colleague and reliable narrator to a finely tuned ‘T’. My admiration for other healthcare professionals is limitless, and will continue to be so. It’s really the awful and gut wrenching stories interspersed throughout (especially the last chapters) that make you realise how much pressure and guilt our doctors are under. And for little pay might I add. Day after day, night after night they fight to provide the best level of care they can without succumbing to sleep deprivation, depression or worse. There’s a lot of emotion here, a lot of anger and sadness that’s so hard to see, yet is oh so common in the increasingly frequent demoralised NHS worker.It’s a very bittersweet read, that I devoured in one day, and I’m sorry it’s over. It’s one of the best memoirs of this kind I’ve read in a long time and I loved following Adam Kay on his journey through life as a junior doctor. "
8,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74034800-lucy-langford,4,"4****Today crossed the line from everyday patient idiocy to me checking around the room for hidden cameras. After a lengthy discussion with a patient’s husband about how absolutely no condoms fit him, I establish he’s pulling them right down over his balls. Extremely witty and funny!! I fully appreciated the use of Harry Potter aliases.This gives a realistic picture of what it is like to work for the NHS as a junior doctor and jut trying to make your way up the ranks. It is a sad state the way these doctors and nurses are treated by those who employ them, and of course how they are treated by politicians: no breaks, back-to-back shifts, being under immense pressure, not going home, not getting a proper salary etc. The reality of their job is painful as well as the consequences of their job (examples: no social life, difficulty maintaining relationships, increased mental health issues among hospital staff).Adam Kay worked in the obs and gyn department so had many a funny story to tell, but also had the sadder stories to tell as well. While he is no longer a doctor due to a case he had that completely changed the person he was, he has also found that those still in the profession were also desperately wanting to get out of it at times due to the treatment they receive. While many stay in the profession to reach the level of consultant and enjoy the helping of others, the continuous cuts to NHS services and the treatment of those who maintain this service is completely unfair. It is another call to rally that the doctors in the NHS are under-funded, under immense pressure, suffer from unfair treatment (see above with regards to salary, rest, etc)... which leads to mishaps when dealing with patients (this can lead to many mistakes and negligence and suing when dealing with patients) and severe mental health problems. Adam Kay also reveals the immense stress he was under and how this causes him to have a really high increase in heart pressure when working. The British Journal of Psychiatry, 2009, showed that young female doctors in the UK are two and a half times more likely than other women to kill themselves."
9,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2752994-dem,1," A series of supposedly funny anecdotes that felt more like a podcast than a novel.   Adam Kay was a junior doctor from 2004 until 2010, before a devastating experience on a ward caused him to reconsider his future. He kept a diary throughout his training, and This Is Going to Hurt intersperses tales from the front line of the NHS with reflections on the current crisis. . This is one of those books that I keep getting asked about ""Did you read This Is Going to Hurt: Secret Diaries of a Junior Doctor and when I answer NO! I am told I have missed out the most amazing book and ""you have to read This Is Going to Hurt: Secret Diaries of a Junior Doctor and now I can confirm I have read it and YES...... It did hurt!I really didnt like the book, it felt contrived and cynical and to be honest full of moaning. I listened to this one on audio and the book was narrated by the author. He spoke quite fast and I I didn’t enjoy the experience.I read 30% and felt that was pretty much as much as I could take. While I didn't enjoy it, it has rave reviews and this review is just my reaction to the book."
10,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6449756-sonja-arlow,5,"I am going to be in so much trouble when my sister finds out I gave this book to my niece as this is probably not a very appropriate book for a 17-year-old. But she is determined to become a doctor and she needs to know it’s not just about rockstar surgeries and making buckets of money. It is the most insane working hours, thankless work with crap pay.The diary entries follow Adam’s ascend through the ranks, from a junior doctor to becoming a consultant, specialising in gynaecology or “brats and twats” I learned more about giving birth than I ever EVER wanted to. The writing style is not geared towards making you feel a deep connection with Adam however towards the end my heart really went out to him and is the reason I rounded up to a full 4 stars.The format took a while to get used to as some diary entries were so short they felt like Doctor Doctor jokes, but once I got used to it I could not stop reading.This was really entertaining, in fact at times I had to literally wipe away tears of laughter. But there were a few stories where I felt the author went over the line, where someone should have told him to leave it out of this collection. These made up only about 10% of the book so it was easy to forgive. I also found the footnotes explaining medical procedures very interesting and not as intrusive as footnotes normally tend to be.But this was not just all laughs, there were quite a few very touching stories that brought me back to reality, this is not a book full of fictitious jokes, it’s a book full of real people with serious medical problems. The overall impression I was left with was how utterly grueling the process of becoming a doctor really is, how the NHS is setup to grind the doctors down even further, getting to know the human (warts and all) behind the white coat and how much a thank you from a patient means.If you have an interest in medical memoirs and want a good laugh, then give this a try."
11,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84682051-abby-sowden,1,"This was a DNF for me, as a nurse working in the emergency room, I can relate to a lot of the references in this book, especially the dark humour - that’s how we healthcare professionals get through the stress of work. However, I could not stand Kay’s obnoxious views on the struggles doctors deal with day to day, yes being a doctor is relentless, stressful and brings little reward, however he seemed to me to be completely disrespectful of other healthcare professionals and actually quite insulting of midwives in particular. Yes doctors have a difficult time, but so does everyone who works for the NHS, from receptionists, to radiographers, to porters - doctors absolutely do not have the hardest time as he would like you to believe, and it’s not all about them!"
12,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27078093-alice-lippart,4,Funny and devastating. Not for the squeamish.

Who am I???This book is special since it is an insight to the medical field. I read this as a medical student but I am reviewing it as a doctor now.🌟 The book had a shaky start and I was not impressed which I actually foresaw. I just didn’t expect that the author’s style is for me from the start but things were going in the right direction and I was intrigued so I continued to give it a chance.🌟 I didn’t know that the author was a Gynecologist and funny coincidence is that I read this one while preparing for my Gyne exam. I am mentioning this because I want to point out that Adam was apparently an excellent doctor and that the book was scientifically very accurate.🌟 The humor may have made a difficult topic easier to approach but it was not always funny nor it was always appropriate. I just wish that the book had a more serious tone at some points.🌟 I like that this showed how doctors and the medical workers in general suffer, it showed how there is a problem with the system. What I am going to say is that we doctors are human!! It may sound stupid but really people do think of doctors as robots who should function on 100% all the time, not have any negative emotions!When I got really sick earlier this year, the first response I was getting from like 99% of the people around me is “You are a doctor, you should not get sick”. I am pretty sure it is all in good spirits and meant as a kind of a joke but people really want that from us!🌟 I am ending with a quote that I loved and that sums our mission in life as doctors. I think Adam said it perfectly:  “So I told them the truth: the hours are terrible, the pay is terrible, the conditions are terrible; you’re underappreciated, unsupported, disrespected and frequently physically endangered. But there’s no better job in the world.” 🌟 Prescription: For all people in general and for medical workers specially. I already recommended this to my close friends/ colleagues!"
15,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91520258-jack-edwards,5,"One of the most beautiful, heart-wrenching, hilarious books I will ever have the pleasure of reading. Adam Kay's style of writing is immaculate - so dry yet dripping with witticisms and hysterical anecdotes. I genuinely had to ration my reading of this because I couldn't put it down. I highly recommend this book, and wish it could be dished out as prescribed reading (if you'll pardon the pun)."
16,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52343138-lauren,1,"*Unpopular opinion*This was a DNF for me. I went into this book not really knowing what to expect so it probably shouldn't come as a complete surprise then that I didn't finish it. I think this book sums up why I never went into Medicine and in order to survive in the medical world, you need to detach yourself from some pretty horrific things.Kay describes mortality in a very glib way which I suppose is accurate coming from a Doctor who deals with death on a regular basis. To me though life is more sacred than that and someone's relative/loved one who has just died is briefly commented upon and then overshadowed by something which is crude and vulgar. Having read the first section of the book, life is deemed as cheap which is something I am not comfortable with (since I have a morbid fear of death) so I didn't appreciate this aspect.Furthermore, there are too many crude references for my liking. Kay focuses far too much on the 'downstairs' , and I'm not sure whether he finds some of these witty but they fall far short of the mark for me. I am not impressed by routine mentions of the word 'ringpiece' - ugh, or how medical professionals refer to Obs and Gynae aka 'brats and twats'. Again, to me this reads as really juvenile and immature humour - cheap laughs from those who don't actually have a GSOH. Although, it doesn't surprise me in the least. Since I liaise with this sector of people, my levels of respect for them have really plummeted. I didn't enjoy this book at all. The humour just wasn't funny, the way it was written sounded like the author was trying way too hard to impress the reader at times - I just couldn't gel with it. 1 star."
17,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25398561-andr-oliveira,3,"This book was just fine.Adam Kay tells us some stories about being a doctor in a hospital, some are really funny, some are tragic. He tackles some NHS problems as well and how they can make a difference between a good or a bad treatment.Some context: My girlfriend is a nurse so some of the stories or situations were not new to me and for me, it's normal that I felt bored reading some of the stories.That being said: this book is important. It shows how working in a hospital is like, the stress they go through, the patience they need, the hard work they do. Don't dismiss them or don't dismiss when they fight for better work conditions!"
18,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28323108-a-rather-bookish,4,"This book was an amazing insight into the life of a former Doctor. It is set out in the format of a diary, which made for easy reading. I found some of the diary entries so utterly horrifying and surprising, I was sitting there thinking, what the hell? Put it this way, there was a tremendous amount of talk on people inserting extremely weird and wonderful objects up their vaginas to improve their sex lives. Yes, I was cringing.This book was written light heartedly, and a great deal of it was actually hilarious. Apart from all the laughs this doctor endured over the years, there were a lot of tears. I think it would be false just to include all the happy and uplifting stories, and leave out the sorrow. It was one particular sad and heartbreaking event that causes this Doctor to decide to leave medicine. Of course, I won't spoil the reason for any readers, so I'll let others discover that for themselves. The sad thing about this book for me, is the stone cold reality of if the NHS was adequately staffed, many near misses, wrong diagnosing and even deaths could definitely be avoided. I've had contact with many doctors, and I've felt messes around, passed from pillar to post while they try to figure out what was the matter with me. I've also had contact with some amazing doctors, that have literally saved my life. Many politicians label junior doctors as money grabbing and rather lazy, but after reading this, you'll realise that certainly isn't the case. The author has caused me to see things from an alternative perspective, and for that I'm glad to have had a sneak peek into his world. "

Summary
 This is a memoir of Adam Kay’s life on NHS front line. This book has the potential to make you smile due to Kay’s hilarious writing and also make you cry due to some of the unfortunate events mentioned.
Some interesting topics discussed in this book 
Adam Kay was able to discuss almost all the crucial things in Medicine in the short memoir directly or indirectly. If we read between the lines, we can clearly see the Butterfly effect prevalent in Medicine. 

It discusses many important topics like Medical economics, Mental health problems and Addictions
My favourite lines from this book 

“A great doctor must have a huge heart and a distended aorta through which pumps a vast lake of compassion and human kindness.” 

Verdict 
 4/5. This was one of the top five Medical Memoirs I was fortunate enough to read."

21,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61150031-lo-o-neill,5,"“3am attendance at labour ward triage. Patient RO is 25 years old and 30 weeks into her first pregnancy. She complains of a large number of painless spots on her tongue. Diagnosis: taste buds.”I realised that I was going to love this book when I read the dedication and introduction, Kay’s brand of humour is right up my street; who doesn’t love a book whose dedication reads:“To James:for his wavering supporting. And to me:without whom this book would not have been possible"".Then on to introduction explaining that due to patients often remembering the date that their baby was born, the dates in the book have been changed, furthermore to protect the identity of the people in the stories he changed the names to those of Harry Potter characters (replacing one legal nightmare with another). I decided to draw inferences from which Harry Potter character names he used, so when Dr Carrow appeared, I can’t say that my hopes were high for them being a positive person.  “A patient named their baby after me today. After I delivered the baby I said, “Adam’s a good name”. The parents agreed. I say “Adam’s a good name” after every single baby I deliver – this was the first time anyone’s ever said yes. The ¬senior house officer asks how many ¬babies I’ve delivered. I estimated 1,200. He then says on average nine of every 1,200 babies born in the UK would be called Adam. I’ve genuinely put off eight sets of parents from naming their child after me.”One of the things that Kay has managed to do very successfully in this book is give reader a glimpse of the lives of doctors and staff in the NHS. His style of writing is open, hilarious and accessible, the reader is left with the feeling that they would like Kay if they ever met him. As a result he managed something that I had not previously experienced; he humanised doctors. Which I know sounds weird because theoretically I know that they are just people but there is something that makes us as a society forget that they are people capable of honest mistakes, emotions and the ability to catch the flu (or food poisoning!). “So I told them the truth: the hours are terrible, the pay is terrible, the conditions are terrible; you’re underappreciated, unsupported, disrespected and frequently physically endangered. But there’s no better job in the world.” “Bleeped awake at 3AM from my first half hour shut-eye in three shifts to prescribe a sleeping pill to a patient whose sleep is evidently much more important than mine. My powers are greater than I realised; I arrive on the ward to find the patient is asleep.”Alongside the incredible humour there are moments that are hard to read. Whether it was about how as a Junior Doctor Kay was so over worked that he fell asleep in his car woke up and went straight into another shift, or how a young female Junior Doctor overdosed, or the devastating reason that he walked away from medicine. One lunchtime when I was reading this book, the little voice in the back of my head reminded me that this was real, and, for a brief moment I felt my heart constrict and stutter. It really drove it home and all I wanted to do was go to my nearest hospital and make sure that all the Junior Doctors were ok: did they need a drink, had they eaten anything, did they need someone to talk to. “I should have had counselling — in fact, my hospital should have arranged it. But there’s a mutual code of silence that keeps help from those who need it most.”There is no way that I could give this anything less than 5 stars because as soon as I finished it I wanted to read it all over again. *****Original Review*****I am going to need a minute before reviewing this one but a quick summary would be eye-opening, hilarious, devastating and fuck Jeremy Hunt. 
5 stars
 and I will be recommending this to everyone that I speak to because I am shook."

But there’s no better job in the world.”A first-hand account of life as a junior doctor in all its joy, pain, sacrifice and maddening bureaucracy.A really eye-opening read that provides insight into what it's really like to work for the NHS. My mother has been a nurse for 30+ years and from her I know how hard it can be, but this just makes me appreciate those on the frontline even more.At the same time, I have never laughed so much or so hard at a book before. The stories and encounters Kay describes are often absolutely hilarious. I was constantly retelling the stories to those around me, as so many left me flabbergasted and needing to discuss with someone!! I would recommend the audiobook in particular as Kay delivers the punchlines so perfectly.Then once you get to the devastating experience on a ward that caused Kay to reconsider his future... it becomes heartbreaking. We need more support for those who face such a tough job every single day, I know I myself couldn't do it. This book was fantastic. 4.5 stars."
23,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41609617-james,4,"‘This is Going to Hurt’ (2017) is essentially Adam Kay’s account of his time as a junior doctor in the UK’s National Health Service. ‘This is Going to Hurt’ is by turns, funny, moving, revealing, heartening and shocking. Kay has given us a very human account of life in the NHS in the role of a junior doctor and brings into sharp focus the absurdly long shifts and the super-human demands that are imposed and expected of doctors and many other health professionals in the NHS. It’s an account that also brings home the very personal, life changing costs of unbelievably long shift lengths (doctors in the UK NHS sign an opt out of the European Working Time Directive – meaning they are routinely expected to work shifts of practically unworkable length) as well as how the personal and professional impact of the daily ‘successes’ and ‘failures’ is felt by those in the firing line.Quite clearly the daily demands of the job of junior doctor in the NHS are inordinately massive – and if it is a ‘job’, then it is one like no other. It is clear from Kay’s book that those embarking on this career path are certainly not in in for the money.Kay’s book is a best seller in the UK and it is easy to see why. So very many of us in the UK are quite rightly, passionately proud and protective of our wonderful institution that is the NHS (now 70 years old). Whilst at the same time, many of us are significantly concerned about the health, future and even the continued existence of our NHS. ‘This is Going to Hurt’ gives us a true, whilst disturbing picture from at least one doctor’s perspective and is written in a very light, accessible, episodic (diary entries) and engaging way. Clearly adept at this sort of writing – Kay is now a script writer/editor for TV comedy.‘This is Going to Hurt’ is a well put together, suitably humorous, respectful whilst irreverent account. It is a book that confirms many of our worst fears concerning life in the cash starved NHS. Importantly Kay provides us with the very human face to at least one NHS doctor – one amongst the 1 million plus health professionals and other employees of the NHS, who are generally faceless to the patient as a service user. Kay I think prompts us to stop and consider what it is like for those working in the NHS and to remember that they too are human and have lives just like us (although perhaps differently lived).‘This is Going to Hurt’ is well written and entertaining and at the same time makes and alludes to critically important points concerning the current state and future of the NHS – as well as the deeply worrying possibility of life in the UK without the NHS in its present form and the privatised alternative. If for this reason alone, Kay’s book should be read by as wide as possible audience – it is perhaps deceptively an important account and an important book and needs to be read. Ultimately it is about a health service of which the UK is quite rightly proud – of which many outside the UK are understandably envious of and which is sadly and consistently under threat from political ideologists within the UK. We should be proud of our NHS and we should be prepared to fight for its future.Long Live The National Health Service. "

The sense of humour worked well, balanced with the horrors of Kay's job.An Xmas present from my sis. She said, ""You won't regret quitting medicine after reading this.""She knows I don't, really, though reading this I wondered if I would.I think people assume I regret quitting medicine more than I do, which is, not at all. It had ""not for me"" all over it, and I've never experienced such an immense relief since leaving. My body was like, ""Yeees, shut this shit down! Let's do anything else with the next... everything of our life!""I made it a year and a half at St Andrews then switched to Chemical Engineering at Strathclyde, spending the intervening months folding schoolwear in a shop so I knew that anything at uni would be worth it eventually.If this is even the first time you're reading that I ever studied medicine, it's because while I value your literary opinion immensely, I don't wake up giving a fuck how clever you think I am! (Okay it does come up in Saxual Healing, but it was relevant. A bit ;) )A friend asked me about it when I met him in Greece this summer. I said, ""It was never something I was supposed to be, so I don't think about it at all.""Maybe an equivalent is, ""Was it difficult coming out?"" Maybe, but it was less tough than staying in.Anyway, I met some other people on that holiday, and it clicked.""So you live in Norway,"" a man said. ""What was Norway before they had oil? They were farmers! Fishermen! You know, we here in Greece are hoping to discover new oil reserves. And as a banker I work with many of the same companies as you anyway.""""Sure, sure,"" I said.Why say, ""Despite your weird attempted 'historical own', the guys I work with sure don't catch their own fish anymore!"" or, ""That stable oil price will help you guys secure energy independence after your exploration efforts definitely lead to reserves. Oil is the, uh, future..."" I didn't engage, though. I was on holiday and didn't know the guy. (And I also wasn't drunk.)No one SHOULD have to justify themselves to others, but that's not how most people let the world work. Kay isn't bothering to justify himself and openly pokes fun at the idea that anyone could pick a suitable career at a young age, or that the criteria for acceptance for careers even make sense. But this is mainly a clarion call to action against the current conditions for junior doctors and perhaps a deeply reassuring text to those people who feel inadequate because they're not doctors.Wow what a sacrifice it is. I sure wasn't able to make it."
25,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19126246-kaitlin,4,"This is a non-fiction read all about the NHS and the way that the system works. It's told in a diary format from the years when Adam Kay was a junior doctor and was part of the system. We see how the NHS has been struggling as time goes on to keep up the standards and staff levels, and we see the strain it can take on a doctor. We also get to see the way that Adam Kay dealt with many of the tests on his own time and relationships.However, at the heart of this story it's all about humour and anecdotes and we get a real look at some of the truly silly and down-right mad things that people do to end up in A & E. We also get to follow some of the stories which were quite embarrassing/funny or down-right painful (hence the title) and I found there were plenty of LOL moments in the book.There's a bit of a shocking ending, and that topped this off as a 4.5*s read for me. I really would recommend this one, and I enjoyed it immensely! "
26,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca,4,"Kay practiced medicine for six years before leaving to write comedy for TV. These occasional diary entries spanning 2004 to 2010 are very funny indeed. He specialized in obstetrics and gynecology (“brats and twats”), and some of the humor is rather puerile but stays just the right side of tasteful. Although he plays his experience for laughs, he can be serious, too, showing how overworked and underappreciated young doctors can be – especially thanks to recent NHS policy. The incident that led to him leaving medicine is particularly wrenching. Still, if you think of all the lives he saved and new lives he ushered into the world during six years of practice, he can be so proud of his achievements.Favorite entry:“Tuesday, 21 October 2006Moral maze. In the labour ward dressing rooms after a long shift. I’m leaving at 10 p.m. rather than 8 p.m. thanks to a major obstetric haemorrhage ending up back in theatre. I’m meant to be going to a Halloween party, but now I don’t have time to go home and pick up my costume. However, I am currently dressed in scrubs and splattered head to toe in blood. Would it be so wrong?”"

This book is a collection of numerous diary entries that gives the reader a strong and revealing insight into life as a junior doctor. I am forever in awe of healthcare professionals and the emotional rollercoaster they must face daily. I know life as a doctor must be tough and exhausting, but these detailed and personal accounts really highlight just how intense it can be. The NHS staff are both remarkably valuable and tremendously underpaid. ""97-hour weeks. Life and death decisions. A constant tsunami of bodily fluids. And the hospital parking meter earns more than you.""Adam Kay genuinely made me both laugh and cry in his writing. Some entries were wonderfully witty whilst others were heartbreakingly sad. I highly recommend this book… except for those who are squeamish. There are some explicit and gruesome descriptions that my boyfriend did not particularly appreciate me sharing with him! I am not easily grossed out by much so some parts that are considered rather revolting, I found widely interesting and educational. Eye-opening, funny and important - an enjoyable read!"
28,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20015365-may,4,"As a medical student, this book was of a special interest to me. I already know very well that working as a doctor is going to be physically exhausting and mentally taxing; however, reading about it from the perspective of someone with a first-hand experience is a different matter altogether. That being said, This is Going to Hurt was a funny, entertaining read. I also learned a few things about gynaecology as a bonus. The final chapter was especially poignant, and I don't think I'll be able to forget it any time soon."
29,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56146790-whitney,4,"Overall: I loved this one and laughed so many times I lost count. I loved it so much that I read it in a day but it would be a great book to read and put down and come back to often 4/5 or 7.5/10Summary: “The difference is obviously the whole ‘life and death’ thing, which is what separates this job from all others, and makes it so unfathomable to people on the outside.” A collection of diary entries from a junior doctor working in labor and delivery. Some stories are hysterical, some are heartbreaking, but this gives you a great look into what it is like to be a doctor. Highly recommend to anyone interested in medicine or looking for a fun and entertaining read. “So I told them the truth: the hours are terrible, the pay is terrible, the conditions are terrible; you’re underappreciated, unsupported, disrespected and frequently physically endangered. But there’s no better job in the world.” The Good: This book is hysterical and I was laughing through the majority of it. The author has a very dry sense of humor (which I love and found a strength) but some may be uncomfortable with it. It does a great job at helping you understand what doctors got through on a regular basis and it definitely made me empathize with him. “This morning I delivered little baby Sayton – pronounced Satan, as in King of the Underworld.” The Bad: Not much to say here but some may find this offensive. Lots of discussion on genitalia, surgery, blood, sex, and other medical-related themes.Favorite Quotes:“I’m as big a fan of recycling as the next man, but if you turn a used condom inside out and put it back on for round two, it’s probably not going to be that effective.” Today crossed the line from everyday patient idiocy to me checking around the room for hidden cameras. After a lengthy discussion with a patient’s husband about how absolutely no condoms fit him, I establish he’s pulling them right down over his balls. "
30,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1076079-karen,4,"In this book, set in the UK, it is apparent that undergoing medical training under their National Health System reaps huge emotional rewards (I can do great good), but little else in the way of monetary or personal rewards (I most likely will have to work the day of my own wedding/child's Christening/best friend's funeral). Adam Kay's diaries are quite fun and funny, loaded with a unique brand of dark humor I enjoy. Then as long days, derision, and under-staffing take their toll on him, the book finally takes on a more serious tone and it's really sad how it works out for him and some of his colleagues. I would love to see an American doctor compare his or her experiences with Adam's as I'm sure there are similarities. I do believe UK (junior) doctors struggle with the long hours and low pay a lot longer than in the U.S.A really good book that I recommend."

I am so supportive of the NHS and it’s workers in this country, this book is proof of the amazing work doctors and nurses do for us every single day that a lot of us take for granted.I’ve said it a million times before, but I find comedy in books really hard to connect with and I rarely laugh out loud at books. To begin with, I thought the humour in this one felt a bit forced and I was sure I wasn’t going to enjoy this as much as I’d hoped but soon enough I began really enjoying the humour and found myself outwardly laughing at some of Kay’s anecdotes. I even read some of the passages out loud to Matt, now that’s praise!The writing in this book is really well done. It’s full of wit, sarcasm, and self-deprecating humour while also being filled with some controversial and powerful moments. Told in diary form entry this is a really easy book to speed through, even when it comes to some of the harder hitting moments.Call me heartless, but unlike a lot of others who’ve read this book, I didn’t find myself on the edge of, or even in, tears. There is definitely a fair share of upsetting entries, so be warned but it didn’t hit me as hard as it did others.Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this short read. It light-heartedly highlighted the ever-growing struggles of NHS workers while offering a humorous outlook of working as a junior doctor. I can also tell you this has put me off having kids for life!"

I could write a review from the point of view of a medical student/medical intern, who has also been a patient for years, but I’m not sure if I’m up for that right now. Let me know if you would be interested in seeing that in the future though."
33,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58158333-allen,4,"A funny, excoriating memoir about a ""junior"" ob/gyn physician who is ""nervous in the service"" -- not the military, but Britain's National Health Service during recent years of budget retrenchment, 2004 to 2010. Adam Kay and his colleagues had to deal with weirdly ineffectual decisions coming down the chain-of-command that are spun to send spuriously comforting political messages to the ""folks at home"" rather than merely save money at all costs. When a volunteer translator renders the Punjabi word indicating a chronic bleeder into ""hermaphrodite"" rather than ""hemophiliac,"" it's funny but potentially deadly. When an NHS decision from on high takes away the doctors' sleeping cots, remember that your next deliverer of a C-section may have been on his/her feet for 18 hours. God forbid those lazy malingerers should try to stay alert and refreshed! Adam Kay's writing style is funny, but we can see the humor and patience wearing thin when a hemorrhaging patient splashed blood on his scrubs, pants, expensive CK boxers and manhood underneath. The pay these young physicians received for their herculean efforts is usually pitifully small, and once again the invisible bureaucracy seems to have them in their sights--when the docs switch from the Nike type of trainer (athletic) shoes to the much cheaper Crocs, the brass ban use of Crocs but offer no clothing allowances. It's at this point Kay begins to wonder whether the joy of delivering baby after healthy baby really compensates for the occasional heartbreaking failure, the ridiculous hours, low pay, bureaucratic turgidity that ignores success but comes down hard on trivial infractions, and above all the inability to schedule a social life when everyone seems to be slotted in as backup for everyone else. That last problem really hits the fan when time off the author had been promised for a two-week overseas vacation is nullified by a weekend of duty right in the middle. Nobody's fault, but there's no going AWOL. A couple of notes about the language in this highly entertaining memoir with a high ""can't-put-it-down"" quotient: typically, Kay uses the common four-letter term instead of ""manhood"" above; Yanks who object to profanity may find the use and frequency of it in this book disconcerting. British slang is freely applied, too, but I forgive him all this for his scrupulousness in footnoting medical terms (which he very much intends to be read), so we readers can understand what references like ""trans-vaginal probe"" and ""pre-eclampsia"" and the convoluted acronym ""TAH BSO"" all mean. We readers know from the introduction to this powerful book that Adam Kay eventually left the National Health Service for a turn at comedy. While the National Health Service does not (yet) subject its patients to American-style five- and six-figure bills, we have to wonder about the priorities of any society that rewards gag-writing for telly so much more handsomely than saving the lives of mothers and fetuses. This shocking (but very funny) black-humored account remains a brisk seller on both sides of the Atlantic. Update: August 31, 2018"
34,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36511432-paul,4,"First off I was given a wonderful hard copy of this book by the publisher Little, Brown Spark for an honest review.Secondly, I have to say I hope I never end up in an english hospital.This book is a diary and it reads like one. There is no real plot or climax or discovery. We are told from the beginning that the health system in the UK is wonderfully free for all but extremely flawed and most medical staff are overworked to the point of gross negligence. So what we are left with in reading these daily diary entries are the proof. The entries are mostly written with a sarcastic punch line each one a story within itself. Each entry is well written. Sometimes humorous. Mostly sarcastic. However it is also shocking, disheartening and sad as well. 3 1/2 to 4 stars."

He also added helpful footnotes to explain any medical terms not familiar with readers.His fascinating account of his life as a doctor was painfully honest, heart-warming and many times hilarious. He explains in great detail his many experiences (including some that made my stomach turn) and the struggles he endured until he got to the point when he made the heart breaking decision to leave his devoted career. Adam's understandable departure from medicine is a great loss to his community and humanity. There are too few doctors with his wit, personality, compassion and devotion.I highly recommend this captivating read!Thank you to NetGalley, author Adam Kay and Little, Brown and Company for an arc of this novel in exchange for my honest review."
36,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7951847-caro-the-helmet-lady,5,Don't get mislead by the seemingly light tone of this book - the author knows when to laugh and get a bit silly and when to be serious and he gives a lot of food for thoughts on the healthcare systems - it seems like in most places in the world they have problems that are too similar... A must read for young idealistic med students.
37,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4074594-kiki,5,"I'm supposed to be taking a break from social media right now, so I'll just say this: I feel better, more whole, more comforted, and more hopeful after reading this book. It's visceral, funny, and so poignant; what a memoir should be, real commentary on real life. It's unpretentious, as if Adam Kay had come round for a chat and we got to talking about his time as a junior doctor. It's heartbreaking, a love letter to the people who make the NHS such a precious institution, and a retort to those who have bruised it. This is what a memoir should be. An elegy, a time capsule. It's a look at a life we so rarely see, but that we should all work to better understand. One of the best books I've read in a long time. Thanks, Adam. "
38,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4908095-ray,5,"An excellent book which portrays the life of a junior doctor with honesty and humour. Picked up at the airport and polished off within the day.There were numerous laugh out loud moments which I suspect may have disturbed the people around me in the airport. Many of these involved, ahem, ""introduced objects"" which sadly shows you my level. And there was me thinking that the TV remote control was just for switching channels.Well worth a read."
39,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17465866-anni,5,"The Best MedicineWell, you may not die laughing, but I was certainly in stitches and convulsed with hysterics, not to mention emotionally distraught, reading this diary of a junior doctor‘s training in the NHS. Apart from the side-splitting humour, it is an excoriating account of the manifold administration deficiencies throughout the National Health Service, once the jewel in the crown of Britain’s welfare society. The author decided to specialise in ‘obs & gynae’ (known in the medical world as ‘brats and - something I can't repeat here beginning with ‘t’) because you end up with twice as many patients, unlike in geriatrics, and it's a tragi-comedy from there on.You will never look at your hospital doctor the same way after reading this, but I would recommend you do so, rather than turn up in A &E if you can possibly avoid it."

Painfully sad? Excellent validation that I made the right choice in not becoming a doctor? Honestly, all of the above. With candor and a never-ending stream of (often dark) humor, this collection of journal entries by a former medical resident paints a vivid picture of all parts of the medical profession: the funny, the bizarre, the awful, the heartwarming, the disgusting, the personal.First, a brief disclaimer: the original version of this book was published in 2017 in the UK. After its wild success, and comments that it resonated with doctors in other countries as well, who had copies imported from across the pond (or across the globe), someone had the fantastic idea to make a US version of it. You know, change some of the British-isms to American vernacular, add some more context for bits about the British government and health system, and so on. So while this is an ARC for a book releasing in December, it has been around for a while, just in a different form.As is often the case with nonfiction, a summary won’t do you much good here. Basically, Adam Kay decided he wanted to go into medicine somewhat arbitrarily while in high school, because, you know, we expect kids to know what they want to do with the rest of their lives already even when their brains aren’t fully formed yet. Common sense, right? He elected to go into obstetrics and gynecology, having heard that this was the easiest branch to go into. Over his years as a house officer and/or registrar (the UK version of what Americans call a resident and/or intern), he kept a journal of all the goings-on at his place of work. This book is a compilation of those journal entries.Right off the bat, in case I haven’t made it clear enough yet, this book is, in many places, laugh-out-loud hilarious. I had to be careful about reading it in public sometimes for fear that I would burst out in a stupid grin or an actual snort of laughter. Even as he describes his experiences going to hell and back (which is almost a literal definition; he did once deliver a baby named “Sayton,” pronounced like Satan), he manages to infuse all but the most serious moments with snark and self-awareness of the sheer insanity of it all. SCBU (pronounced “Scaboo”) is the Special Care Baby Unit; NICU is the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit; PICU is the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit; and PIKACHU is a type of Pokémon.Seriously, patients do dumb stuff. Objectively, we know this to be true, but you don’t really understand it until you are reading about the doctors who see it all: the things people put up various orifices (a Kinder egg with a wedding ring inside, placed inside a certain part of female anatomy?), the absurd questions they ask, the stupid things they do just to prove a point (yes, there was a literal dick-in-a-fan incident)…it’s hard to comprehend just how insane doctors must think people are until you really see it all in one place. Especially when that one place is narrated by an incredulous physician who peppers the whole thing with footnotes both clarifying points and adding his own opinions.If you describe a grandparent as being old-fashioned, it’s a euphemism for “casually racist.” In a hospital setting, it means “unsupportive.” You’re on your own.That’s not to say that this book is all “hardy-har-har-let’s-laugh-at-medical-nonsense,” though. What makes this book really work, and what keeps it from being a nonstop stream of jokes without real substance, is its recognition of the flaws inherent in the British medical system. To my understanding, many of these flaws are pervasive in medical systems across the globe, too, so this isn’t overly Anglo-centric. The hours are awful, with long shifts that don’t allow for enough sleep. You’re expected to stay for extra hours past the end of your shift if needed, and you don’t get paid overtime for that. Heck, the pay isn’t even that good to begin with. Requesting a day off is rarely going to actually work, as you can (and probably will) still be called in at the last minute.I told a patient that his MRI wouldn’t be until next week and he threatened to break both my legs. My first thought was Well, it’ll be a couple weeks off work. I was this close to offering him a baseball bat.These shortcomings mean that being a doctor, while you are in theory helping people, is likely to cause you personal harm in the process. Kay missed major events in both his own life and his friends’ lives because of his work schedule. It wreaked havoc on his relationships, both personal and romantic. While the stories in this book are not focused much on his outside life, his jabs at the system and comments here and there about his personal problems weave an underlying narrative of a man who, like so many others in his profession, is being drained by a job that asks too much. We like to think of doctors as being selfless, noble, well-paid, and respected, but in reality, they’re no better off than most of us–and, in many case, actually have it worse.I should have had counseling–in fact, my hospital should have arranged it. But there’s a mutual code of silence that keeps help from those who need it most.And as if the job isn’t enough, another recurring theme throughout the book is when his personal life and career would overlap. Apparently, being a doctor means your friends think you are the person to call and ask about any medical problem they have, never mind that you may specialize in only one area that has literally nothing to do with their issue. Sketchy consultations? Check. Awkward surgery? Been there, done that. Recognized by former patients in public? Yup. Again, it’s a very strange juxtaposition that you don’t often see in other careers, and even the tamer stories in this book are nothing short of eye-opening and revelatory.Quick note: the ending of the book is actually very sad, culminating with the event that made Kay decide to leave medicine and move on to a completely different job (writing comedy, which is what he does now!), and you can probably guess what sort of story that is. Poignant, upsetting, and illuminating the disastrous toll that the medical profession can take on the mental health of practitioners. Though, to be fair, you can tell even from the skillful narration of this book, with pitch-perfect jokes on every page, that humor is more of a strong suit for Kay than medicine ever was. So why not a full five stars? As much as I enjoyed the humor in this book, there were a few moments where I felt like maybe the author took it a little too far. For instance, there was one joke about how being a doctor is more stressful than piloting a plane when a terrorist tries to take over, and there were several sex-related jokes that were more uncomfortable than humorous to me. (That said, there were also quite a few on the same topic that were still incredibly funny, but some missed the mark. I guess that’s going to be the case in most comedy–not every joke is for everyone.)Still, I strongly recommend this one. It makes you laugh, and it makes you think. It is the medical equivalent of the “Don’t Be a Lawyer” song from Crazy Ex-Girlfriend–which is definitely a good thing. And if you're considering going into medicine, this will help make sure you go into it clear-eyed and wholly disillusioned, because yes: this job is going to hurt, in more ways than one.TRIGGER/CONTENT WARNINGS: death of a child, death of a parent, lots of blood, lots of genital-related content (all in a medical context, of course), side character with depressionThank you to the publisher, Little, Brown Spark, for providing me with an eARC of this book via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review!"

I am a fan of medical memoirs, so it was right up my street.Adam writes with wit and humour, and even in the worst of situations this levity really makes a difference to the narrative. Doctors see people on the worst days of their lives, but we also see them on the worst days of theirs, even if we don’t realise it. We don’t know what they are going through, but Adam has given an insightful look into his life as a Junior Doctor and just how much it impacted him.I think what I enjoyed the most was the almost conversational aspect of the book. It’s written in diary entries from his time in hospitals, so they are often brief, but some of the entries are very powerful. Others really made me feel for him as his own personal life suffered at the hands of working absolutely crazy hours and nobody could understand why he was missing important events outside of work.I really enjoyed This Is Going To Hurt, even though enjoy seems like the wrong word considering the subject matter, but you know what I mean. Adam Kay has a way with words, and it made this a really easy read. Tough subjects obviously, but he made it more relatable with his affable writing manner.If you enjoy glimpse into the medical profession, and a little humour with your non-fiction the you should most certainly add this one to your list!Recommended!"

It's kinda nice to know that somebody else has been there, done that, got the T-shirt and got it stained by blood almost immediately. Relationship breakdown? Check. Missing out on weddings/birthday parties/funerals because you had to be in work? Check. Developing a scathing, sarcastic sense of humour in order to deal with the death, tragedy and pain that constantly surrounds you? Also check.For those who are not medical professionals, I would highly recommend reading it. It sheds a light on a reality that some might not know exists: what goes on behind the scenes and what happens to your doctor on a day-to-day basis (spoiler alert: it ain't all good).

48,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8378502-barney,2,"I was expecting I'd enjoy this book but I ended up really disliking it. It starts off well with a few funny anecdotes but after a while I realised a lot of them are at the expense of the patient themselves. Yes I am the fun police, and I know humour is a way of coping, but there's something about the thought of a group of doctors chuckling about the time a dementia patient sexually assaulted another patient - and then a group of readers reading that and also chuckling - which doesn't sit well with me.Also we can all agree that doctors deserve absolutely every penny they get and are entitled to far more than they're being paid currently. But there's nothing like someone pre-financial crash describing themselves as poor while also having just bought an apartment and a trip to the Mauritius which just aaaargh really gets under my skin.I couldn't finish the book in the end. I was about half way through and fading fast, only to come across an vignette about the doctor being called in to deliver a new-born 'mid-wank', which ends with him completing the procedure ""still erect"". It was genuinely the most horrifying sentence I have ever read.So yeah, 2 stars but mostly because (even though the book isn't really political itself) its popularity in the UK has contributed to conversations about how hard junior doctors work and how valuable their contributions are to the NHS."

Usually the highest they get is 4.5 which is usually rounded down to 4 as I save the 5 star ratings for truly incredible books or ones that really had a profound effect on me. This book deserves every single star. Hilarious and heartbreaking all at once, it highlights the importance of the NHS which we should all be fighting to protect and make better. Can not recommend this book highly enough! Full review to come."

This seems to be a long list of disconnected anecdotes, nothing more, and I'm finding reading former doctor Adam Kay's views on both his patients and colleagues downright upsetting. It's not funny to me at all. I understand that doctors have a hard time (and lets be honest, everyone else working for the NHS currently), that they are nowhere near rewarded enough in a really thankless job, and, yes, I understand that humour is perhaps a coping mechanism in such a stressful job. I'm happy that this book has apparently shed light on the horrific, stressful conditions overworked and poorly recognised medical professionals are working under in the NHS, but personally I cannot read another page of this. I understand he was unhappy in this job and perhaps writing these ""diaries"" was a coping mechanism, but I think... I want to keep the illusion alive that most doctors and other medical professionals would never have such crude and obnoxious thoughts about their patients. Other people have felt very differently about this book (I guess you have to be ok with his very dark sense of humour?), so maybe my extreme reaction is unusual and I'm a little sensitive to this topic, but personally I have no desire to force myself to keep reading something that has made me feel so low."

Dr. Adam Kay does inflict the pain from the many expletives and black humor that erupts all over his readers in this this magnificently crafted detail of being a doctor working for the NHS. Kay offers some true literary therapy when he retells a case of something rather wet happening to a patient’s father and having been put on the spot to explain it to his daughter (with a straight face). We are let into the reality of death rates on the rise when all junior doctors change hospitals and this transition may result in deaths on “Wednesday.” “…I leave them to deal with rectal bleed.…a seventy-year-old lady’s alcohol consumption…notes. I’ve established that wine is her poison. Me: ‘And how much wine do you drink per day, would you say? Patient: ‘bout three bottles on a good day.’ Me: ‘OK . . . And on a bad day?’ Patient: ‘On a bad day I only manage one.”—-Adam Kay, MD""The cadence at times can be chaotic. Commendable that the plasterer who called his wife’s cervical dilation to be exactly 6 cm---and Dr. Kay verifies such. From the mommy to be who presented him with a nine-page birth plan---as if it were the panacea to a novel way to a proper birth. Sadly, she had to part with it due to the epidural that was to be in this pregnant mommy’s new plan. Kay recalls the time he delivered “Satan” out of a woman (as if it were a bane of accomplishment) and wonders had the parents thought of how this name could go down in kindergarten or grade school? Technology found its way into A & E as Adam observes his patient “Facetiming” during a smear. Adam explains the task of finding the womb lacking a little one and instead the finding was just “distended loops of bowel. Sad.Laughter is definitely the progeny from Kay’s utterly sardonic quips that needs no assistance or catalyst to flow. The perils of universal healthcare are evidenced here, and we develop a newfound respect for the prestige and elegance of American medicine and its spotless hospitals, U.S. News Best lists and the cucumber water stations. Deserving mention too are the fresh out of the dryer gowns, on the spot education in E.R. by nurses and tactile care from tall blue-eyed physicians in matching scrubs that smell nothing like these NHS doctors. Five stars indeed. Must read for the curious and those who question things (often). ---Der Titel impliziert viel. Dr. Adam Kay verursacht den Schmerz durch die vielen Sprengsätze und den schwarzen Humor, die überall in seinen Lesern ausbrechen, in diesem großartig gestalteten Detail, ein Arzt zu sein, der für das NHS arbeitet. Kay bietet eine echte literarische Therapie an, wenn er einen Fall von etwas ziemlich Nassem nacherzählt, das dem Vater eines Patienten passiert und an Ort und Stelle gebracht wurde, um es seiner Tochter zu erklären (mit ernstem Gesicht). Wir werden in die Realität der steigenden Sterblichkeitsraten hineingelassen, wenn alle Juniorärzte die Krankenhäuser wechseln und dieser Übergang am „Mittwoch“ zu Todesfällen führen kann.""... Ich überlasse es ihnen, sich mit Rektalblutung zu befassen. ... Alkoholkonsum einer siebzigjährigen Frau ... Notizen. Ich habe festgestellt, dass Wein ihr Gift ist.

Lobenswert, dass der Stuckateur, der die Zervixdilatation seiner Frau als genau 6 cm bezeichnete, und Dr. Kay dies bestätigt. Von der Mutter, die ihm einen neunseitigen Geburtsplan vorlegte - als wäre es das Allheilmittel für einen neuartigen Weg zu einer richtigen Geburt. Leider musste sie sich aufgrund des Epidurals, das im neuen Plan dieser schwangeren Mutter enthalten sein sollte, davon trennen. Kay erinnert sich an die Zeit, als er einer Frau „Satan“ entließ (als wäre es ein Fluch der Leistung), und fragte sich, ob die Eltern darüber nachgedacht hatten, wie dieser Name im Kindergarten oder in der Grundschule untergehen könnte. Die Technologie fand ihren Weg in A & E, als Adam seinen Patienten während eines Abstrichs beim „Facetiming“ beobachtet. Adam erklärt die Aufgabe, den Mutterleib zu finden, dem ein kleiner fehlt, und stattdessen war der Befund nur „ausgedehnte Darmschleifen. Traurig.Lachen ist definitiv die Nachkommenschaft von Kays absolut sardonischen Sprüchen, die keine Unterstützung oder Katalysator benötigen, um zu fließen. Die Gefahren der allgemeinen Gesundheitsversorgung werden hier deutlich, und wir entwickeln einen neu entdeckten Respekt für das Prestige und die Eleganz der amerikanischen Medizin und ihrer makellosen Krankenhäuser, der Bestlisten der US-Nachrichten und der Gurkenwasserstationen. Erwähnenswert sind auch die frisch aus den Trocknerkleidern stammenden, vor Ort in E. R. durchgeführten Schulungen durch Krankenschwestern sowie Ratschläge und taktile Betreuung durch große blauäugige Experten in passenden Peelings, die nicht nach diesen NHS-Ärzten riechen.

55,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5114433-liz-janet,3,"Interview with author that brought the book to my attention: https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_co...For years I have been watching news comedy shows from the U.K., mostly Mock the Week and Russell Howard’s Good News, and in every series the panel has to dispel the opinions of some member of the conservative government about how the NHS is a cancer and the portrayal of Junior Doctors as money-grabbing and undeserving people who only seek their own wealth. This book is a more direct answer to those politicians who believe they can blatantly lie on television in order to support their budget cuts, told in the diary entries of one of the doctors during his training.Adam Kay takes on the issue with the most amount of British humour he could possibly muster, considering he had some pretty idiotic people pop into hospital, ( including a couple who turned a condom inside out and obviously got pregnant, which isn’t even the worst one) and the evident fact his and his colleagues hard work was being undermined by bureaucrats who would never understand all the work the doctors actually do.“Patient too drowsy to assess.”I pop in. The patient is dead.But the book is not only the comical experience of an overworked man, but an observation on class and the wealth of the state and their influence on the well-being of the population, a remark on the demands these doctors were expected to fulfill, and how all these lead to the detriment of the doctor’s personal lives. A MUST READ!"
56,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80638935-hp-saucerer,4,"In This is Going to Hurt, Adam Kay provides a no-holds-barred account of his time on the front line of the NHS. Through a series of diary entries we begin to see how, under the weight of the huge responsibility placed upon them - with minimal supervision and little pastoral support - doctors are working themselves to exhaustion, crumbling under the strain of an excessive and unmanageable workload. The book reveals a (darker) lesser-known side to the NHS, a service that so many depend on and yet take for granted. I was astonished by the sheer and blatant ineptitude of hospitals when it comes to caring for their staff. How could this be? But then is this really that surprising, given that the junior doctor dispute a few years ago served as a reminder of how little the government value those who are willing to devote most of their working lives to serving the public. (Okay, down from the soap box and back to the actual book)Whilst many of the accounts Kay recalls so candidly are hilarious (the dance floor pessary/pram wheel confusion was a personal favourite), others are horrifying and absolutely heartbreaking. I did find one or two accounts disrespectful and even disparaging; at times Kay appears to be looking for cheap laughs, and here the humour becomes base and a tad infantile. On the whole though, this is a must-read that perfectly captures both the pain and joy of working in close proximity to despair, disease and death every day. Brilliant."

58,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66513638-gtf,5,"'This Is Going To Hurt"" is a brilliant memoir of Adam Kay's career as a junior doctor. The book spares no details with regard to every aspect of the job; it contains some very graphic accounts of unusual injuries and illnesses that he has come across during his time in medicine, and it also details what it's really like to work for the UK's healthcare system. In addition to its plethora of explicit details, Kay clears up a lot of the misconceptions that people tend to have about doctors, such as doctors being excellent problem solvers, when in fact they are often just following procedures, and junior doctors earning hefty salaries, when in fact they are being paid less than minimum wage for years. ""This Is Going to Hurt"" is an interesting fusion of misery and humor. Although Kay didn't feel human anymore towards the end of his career in medicine, he still managed to see the funny side to some of his experiences in his grueling medical career."
59,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9582364-andrea,4,"This book by Adam Kay came to my attention in an episode of the Diving In podcast, where it was described as laugh-out-loud funny; the kind of book you want to read during a pandemic. I decided to go audio, which is still pretty new to me, and was delighted to find that the author is the narrator. Although it had some dark and/or poignant moments, it delivered the laughs while at the same time opening my eyes to the world of obgyn and the problems of the NHS (UK universal health service). On one hand I think it's a shame that Adam Kay is no longer a doctor, but on the other hand, I think he makes an excellent writer/comedian."
60,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1076079-karen,4,"In this book, set in the UK, it is apparent that undergoing medical training under their National Health System reaps huge emotional rewards (I can do great good), but little else in the way of monetary or personal rewards (I most likely will have to work the day of my own wedding/child's Christening/best friend's funeral). Adam Kay's diaries are quite fun and funny, loaded with a unique brand of dark humor I enjoy. Then as long days, derision, and under-staffing take their toll on him, the book finally takes on a more serious tone and it's really sad how it works out for him and some of his colleagues. I would love to see an American doctor compare his or her experiences with Adam's as I'm sure there are similarities. I do believe UK (junior) doctors struggle with the long hours and low pay a lot longer than in the U.S.A really good book that I recommend."

I am so supportive of the NHS and it’s workers in this country, this book is proof of the amazing work doctors and nurses do for us every single day that a lot of us take for granted.I’ve said it a million times before, but I find comedy in books really hard to connect with and I rarely laugh out loud at books. To begin with, I thought the humour in this one felt a bit forced and I was sure I wasn’t going to enjoy this as much as I’d hoped but soon enough I began really enjoying the humour and found myself outwardly laughing at some of Kay’s anecdotes. I even read some of the passages out loud to Matt, now that’s praise!The writing in this book is really well done. It’s full of wit, sarcasm, and self-deprecating humour while also being filled with some controversial and powerful moments. Told in diary form entry this is a really easy book to speed through, even when it comes to some of the harder hitting moments.Call me heartless, but unlike a lot of others who’ve read this book, I didn’t find myself on the edge of, or even in, tears. There is definitely a fair share of upsetting entries, so be warned but it didn’t hit me as hard as it did others.Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this short read. It light-heartedly highlighted the ever-growing struggles of NHS workers while offering a humorous outlook of working as a junior doctor. I can also tell you this has put me off having kids for life!"

Let me know if you would be interested in seeing that in the future though."
63,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58158333-allen,4,"A funny, excoriating memoir about a ""junior"" ob/gyn physician who is ""nervous in the service"" -- not the military, but Britain's National Health Service during recent years of budget retrenchment, 2004 to 2010. Adam Kay and his colleagues had to deal with weirdly ineffectual decisions coming down the chain-of-command that are spun to send spuriously comforting political messages to the ""folks at home"" rather than merely save money at all costs. When a volunteer translator renders the Punjabi word indicating a chronic bleeder into ""hermaphrodite"" rather than ""hemophiliac,"" it's funny but potentially deadly. When an NHS decision from on high takes away the doctors' sleeping cots, remember that your next deliverer of a C-section may have been on his/her feet for 18 hours. God forbid those lazy malingerers should try to stay alert and refreshed! Adam Kay's writing style is funny, but we can see the humor and patience wearing thin when a hemorrhaging patient splashed blood on his scrubs, pants, expensive CK boxers and manhood underneath. The pay these young physicians received for their herculean efforts is usually pitifully small, and once again the invisible bureaucracy seems to have them in their sights--when the docs switch from the Nike type of trainer (athletic) shoes to the much cheaper Crocs, the brass ban use of Crocs but offer no clothing allowances. It's at this point Kay begins to wonder whether the joy of delivering baby after healthy baby really compensates for the occasional heartbreaking failure, the ridiculous hours, low pay, bureaucratic turgidity that ignores success but comes down hard on trivial infractions, and above all the inability to schedule a social life when everyone seems to be slotted in as backup for everyone else. That last problem really hits the fan when time off the author had been promised for a two-week overseas vacation is nullified by a weekend of duty right in the middle. Nobody's fault, but there's no going AWOL. A couple of notes about the language in this highly entertaining memoir with a high ""can't-put-it-down"" quotient: typically, Kay uses the common four-letter term instead of ""manhood"" above; Yanks who object to profanity may find the use and frequency of it in this book disconcerting. British slang is freely applied, too, but I forgive him all this for his scrupulousness in footnoting medical terms (which he very much intends to be read), so we readers can understand what references like ""trans-vaginal probe"" and ""pre-eclampsia"" and the convoluted acronym ""TAH BSO"" all mean. We readers know from the introduction to this powerful book that Adam Kay eventually left the National Health Service for a turn at comedy. While the National Health Service does not (yet) subject its patients to American-style five- and six-figure bills, we have to wonder about the priorities of any society that rewards gag-writing for telly so much more handsomely than saving the lives of mothers and fetuses. This shocking (but very funny) black-humored account remains a brisk seller on both sides of the Atlantic. Update: August 31, 2018"

There is no real plot or climax or discovery. We are told from the beginning that the health system in the UK is wonderfully free for all but extremely flawed and most medical staff are overworked to the point of gross negligence. So what we are left with in reading these daily diary entries are the proof. The entries are mostly written with a sarcastic punch line each one a story within itself. Each entry is well written. Sometimes humorous. Mostly sarcastic. However it is also shocking, disheartening and sad as well. 3 1/2 to 4 stars."

He also added helpful footnotes to explain any medical terms not familiar with readers.His fascinating account of his life as a doctor was painfully honest, heart-warming and many times hilarious. He explains in great detail his many experiences (including some that made my stomach turn) and the struggles he endured until he got to the point when he made the heart breaking decision to leave his devoted career. Adam's understandable departure from medicine is a great loss to his community and humanity. There are too few doctors with his wit, personality, compassion and devotion.I highly recommend this captivating read!Thank you to NetGalley, author Adam Kay and Little, Brown and Company for an arc of this novel in exchange for my honest review."

It's visceral, funny, and so poignant; what a memoir should be, real commentary on real life. It's unpretentious, as if Adam Kay had come round for a chat and we got to talking about his time as a junior doctor. It's heartbreaking, a love letter to the people who make the NHS such a precious institution, and a retort to those who have bruised it. This is what a memoir should be. An elegy, a time capsule. It's a look at a life we so rarely see, but that we should all work to better understand. One of the best books I've read in a long time. Thanks, Adam. "

Apart from the side-splitting humour, it is an excoriating account of the manifold administration deficiencies throughout the National Health Service, once the jewel in the crown of Britain’s welfare society. The author decided to specialise in ‘obs & gynae’ (known in the medical world as ‘brats and - something I can't repeat here beginning with ‘t’) because you end up with twice as many patients, unlike in geriatrics, and it's a tragi-comedy from there on.You will never look at your hospital doctor the same way after reading this, but I would recommend you do so, rather than turn up in A &E if you can possibly avoid it."

Painfully sad? Excellent validation that I made the right choice in not becoming a doctor? Honestly, all of the above. With candor and a never-ending stream of (often dark) humor, this collection of journal entries by a former medical resident paints a vivid picture of all parts of the medical profession: the funny, the bizarre, the awful, the heartwarming, the disgusting, the personal.First, a brief disclaimer: the original version of this book was published in 2017 in the UK. After its wild success, and comments that it resonated with doctors in other countries as well, who had copies imported from across the pond (or across the globe), someone had the fantastic idea to make a US version of it. You know, change some of the British-isms to American vernacular, add some more context for bits about the British government and health system, and so on. So while this is an ARC for a book releasing in December, it has been around for a while, just in a different form.As is often the case with nonfiction, a summary won’t do you much good here. Basically, Adam Kay decided he wanted to go into medicine somewhat arbitrarily while in high school, because, you know, we expect kids to know what they want to do with the rest of their lives already even when their brains aren’t fully formed yet. Common sense, right? He elected to go into obstetrics and gynecology, having heard that this was the easiest branch to go into. Over his years as a house officer and/or registrar (the UK version of what Americans call a resident and/or intern), he kept a journal of all the goings-on at his place of work. This book is a compilation of those journal entries.Right off the bat, in case I haven’t made it clear enough yet, this book is, in many places, laugh-out-loud hilarious. I had to be careful about reading it in public sometimes for fear that I would burst out in a stupid grin or an actual snort of laughter. Even as he describes his experiences going to hell and back (which is almost a literal definition; he did once deliver a baby named “Sayton,” pronounced like Satan), he manages to infuse all but the most serious moments with snark and self-awareness of the sheer insanity of it all. SCBU (pronounced “Scaboo”) is the Special Care Baby Unit; NICU is the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit; PICU is the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit; and PIKACHU is a type of Pokémon.Seriously, patients do dumb stuff. Objectively, we know this to be true, but you don’t really understand it until you are reading about the doctors who see it all: the things people put up various orifices (a Kinder egg with a wedding ring inside, placed inside a certain part of female anatomy?), the absurd questions they ask, the stupid things they do just to prove a point (yes, there was a literal dick-in-a-fan incident)…it’s hard to comprehend just how insane doctors must think people are until you really see it all in one place. Especially when that one place is narrated by an incredulous physician who peppers the whole thing with footnotes both clarifying points and adding his own opinions.If you describe a grandparent as being old-fashioned, it’s a euphemism for “casually racist.” In a hospital setting, it means “unsupportive.” You’re on your own.That’s not to say that this book is all “hardy-har-har-let’s-laugh-at-medical-nonsense,” though. What makes this book really work, and what keeps it from being a nonstop stream of jokes without real substance, is its recognition of the flaws inherent in the British medical system. To my understanding, many of these flaws are pervasive in medical systems across the globe, too, so this isn’t overly Anglo-centric. The hours are awful, with long shifts that don’t allow for enough sleep. You’re expected to stay for extra hours past the end of your shift if needed, and you don’t get paid overtime for that. Heck, the pay isn’t even that good to begin with. Requesting a day off is rarely going to actually work, as you can (and probably will) still be called in at the last minute.I told a patient that his MRI wouldn’t be until next week and he threatened to break both my legs. My first thought was Well, it’ll be a couple weeks off work. I was this close to offering him a baseball bat.These shortcomings mean that being a doctor, while you are in theory helping people, is likely to cause you personal harm in the process. Kay missed major events in both his own life and his friends’ lives because of his work schedule. It wreaked havoc on his relationships, both personal and romantic. While the stories in this book are not focused much on his outside life, his jabs at the system and comments here and there about his personal problems weave an underlying narrative of a man who, like so many others in his profession, is being drained by a job that asks too much. We like to think of doctors as being selfless, noble, well-paid, and respected, but in reality, they’re no better off than most of us–and, in many case, actually have it worse.I should have had counseling–in fact, my hospital should have arranged it. But there’s a mutual code of silence that keeps help from those who need it most.And as if the job isn’t enough, another recurring theme throughout the book is when his personal life and career would overlap. Apparently, being a doctor means your friends think you are the person to call and ask about any medical problem they have, never mind that you may specialize in only one area that has literally nothing to do with their issue. Sketchy consultations? Check. Awkward surgery? Been there, done that. Recognized by former patients in public? Yup. Again, it’s a very strange juxtaposition that you don’t often see in other careers, and even the tamer stories in this book are nothing short of eye-opening and revelatory.Quick note: the ending of the book is actually very sad, culminating with the event that made Kay decide to leave medicine and move on to a completely different job (writing comedy, which is what he does now!), and you can probably guess what sort of story that is. Poignant, upsetting, and illuminating the disastrous toll that the medical profession can take on the mental health of practitioners. Though, to be fair, you can tell even from the skillful narration of this book, with pitch-perfect jokes on every page, that humor is more of a strong suit for Kay than medicine ever was. So why not a full five stars? As much as I enjoyed the humor in this book, there were a few moments where I felt like maybe the author took it a little too far. For instance, there was one joke about how being a doctor is more stressful than piloting a plane when a terrorist tries to take over, and there were several sex-related jokes that were more uncomfortable than humorous to me. (That said, there were also quite a few on the same topic that were still incredibly funny, but some missed the mark. I guess that’s going to be the case in most comedy–not every joke is for everyone.)Still, I strongly recommend this one. It makes you laugh, and it makes you think. It is the medical equivalent of the “Don’t Be a Lawyer” song from Crazy Ex-Girlfriend–which is definitely a good thing. And if you're considering going into medicine, this will help make sure you go into it clear-eyed and wholly disillusioned, because yes: this job is going to hurt, in more ways than one.TRIGGER/CONTENT WARNINGS: death of a child, death of a parent, lots of blood, lots of genital-related content (all in a medical context, of course), side character with depressionThank you to the publisher, Little, Brown Spark, for providing me with an eARC of this book via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review!"

I am a fan of medical memoirs, so it was right up my street.Adam writes with wit and humour, and even in the worst of situations this levity really makes a difference to the narrative. Doctors see people on the worst days of their lives, but we also see them on the worst days of theirs, even if we don’t realise it. We don’t know what they are going through, but Adam has given an insightful look into his life as a Junior Doctor and just how much it impacted him.I think what I enjoyed the most was the almost conversational aspect of the book. It’s written in diary entries from his time in hospitals, so they are often brief, but some of the entries are very powerful. Others really made me feel for him as his own personal life suffered at the hands of working absolutely crazy hours and nobody could understand why he was missing important events outside of work.I really enjoyed This Is Going To Hurt, even though enjoy seems like the wrong word considering the subject matter, but you know what I mean. Adam Kay has a way with words, and it made this a really easy read. Tough subjects obviously, but he made it more relatable with his affable writing manner.If you enjoy glimpse into the medical profession, and a little humour with your non-fiction the you should most certainly add this one to your list!Recommended!"
74,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10887793-julie,5,"This is the second book I read this year that I wish I had written (and, had I kept a diary, I probably could have - except the horrific penis-related injury I treated was not a de-gloving, but a fracture).I'm a *junior* doctor, and his stories of life, death and everything in between just sound so reassuringly familiar. It's kinda nice to know that somebody else has been there, done that, got the T-shirt and got it stained by blood almost immediately. Relationship breakdown? Check. Missing out on weddings/birthday parties/funerals because you had to be in work? Check. Developing a scathing, sarcastic sense of humour in order to deal with the death, tragedy and pain that constantly surrounds you? Also check.For those who are not medical professionals, I would highly recommend reading it. It sheds a light on a reality that some might not know exists: what goes on behind the scenes and what happens to your doctor on a day-to-day basis (spoiler alert: it ain't all good). And, honestly, we probably need more people to read it if we want to save the NHS."

It starts off well with a few funny anecdotes but after a while I realised a lot of them are at the expense of the patient themselves. Yes I am the fun police, and I know humour is a way of coping, but there's something about the thought of a group of doctors chuckling about the time a dementia patient sexually assaulted another patient - and then a group of readers reading that and also chuckling - which doesn't sit well with me.Also we can all agree that doctors deserve absolutely every penny they get and are entitled to far more than they're being paid currently. But there's nothing like someone pre-financial crash describing themselves as poor while also having just bought an apartment and a trip to the Mauritius which just aaaargh really gets under my skin.I couldn't finish the book in the end. I was about half way through and fading fast, only to come across an vignette about the doctor being called in to deliver a new-born 'mid-wank', which ends with him completing the procedure ""still erect"". It was genuinely the most horrifying sentence I have ever read.So yeah, 2 stars but mostly because (even though the book isn't really political itself) its popularity in the UK has contributed to conversations about how hard junior doctors work and how valuable their contributions are to the NHS."

This seems to be a long list of disconnected anecdotes, nothing more, and I'm finding reading former doctor Adam Kay's views on both his patients and colleagues downright upsetting. It's not funny to me at all. I understand that doctors have a hard time (and lets be honest, everyone else working for the NHS currently), that they are nowhere near rewarded enough in a really thankless job, and, yes, I understand that humour is perhaps a coping mechanism in such a stressful job. I'm happy that this book has apparently shed light on the horrific, stressful conditions overworked and poorly recognised medical professionals are working under in the NHS, but personally I cannot read another page of this. I understand he was unhappy in this job and perhaps writing these ""diaries"" was a coping mechanism, but I think... I want to keep the illusion alive that most doctors and other medical professionals would never have such crude and obnoxious thoughts about their patients. Other people have felt very differently about this book (I guess you have to be ok with his very dark sense of humour?), so maybe my extreme reaction is unusual and I'm a little sensitive to this topic, but personally I have no desire to force myself to keep reading something that has made me feel so low."

Dr. Adam Kay does inflict the pain from the many expletives and black humor that erupts all over his readers in this this magnificently crafted detail of being a doctor working for the NHS. Kay offers some true literary therapy when he retells a case of something rather wet happening to a patient’s father and having been put on the spot to explain it to his daughter (with a straight face). We are let into the reality of death rates on the rise when all junior doctors change hospitals and this transition may result in deaths on “Wednesday.” “…I leave them to deal with rectal bleed.…a seventy-year-old lady’s alcohol consumption…notes. I’ve established that wine is her poison. Me: ‘And how much wine do you drink per day, would you say? Patient: ‘bout three bottles on a good day.’ Me: ‘OK . . . And on a bad day?’ Patient: ‘On a bad day I only manage one.”—-Adam Kay, MD""The cadence at times can be chaotic. Commendable that the plasterer who called his wife’s cervical dilation to be exactly 6 cm---and Dr. Kay verifies such. From the mommy to be who presented him with a nine-page birth plan---as if it were the panacea to a novel way to a proper birth. Sadly, she had to part with it due to the epidural that was to be in this pregnant mommy’s new plan. Kay recalls the time he delivered “Satan” out of a woman (as if it were a bane of accomplishment) and wonders had the parents thought of how this name could go down in kindergarten or grade school? Technology found its way into A & E as Adam observes his patient “Facetiming” during a smear. Adam explains the task of finding the womb lacking a little one and instead the finding was just “distended loops of bowel. Sad.Laughter is definitely the progeny from Kay’s utterly sardonic quips that needs no assistance or catalyst to flow. The perils of universal healthcare are evidenced here, and we develop a newfound respect for the prestige and elegance of American medicine and its spotless hospitals, U.S. News Best lists and the cucumber water stations. Deserving mention too are the fresh out of the dryer gowns, on the spot education in E.R. by nurses and tactile care from tall blue-eyed physicians in matching scrubs that smell nothing like these NHS doctors. Five stars indeed. Must read for the curious and those who question things (often). ---Der Titel impliziert viel. Dr. Adam Kay verursacht den Schmerz durch die vielen Sprengsätze und den schwarzen Humor, die überall in seinen Lesern ausbrechen, in diesem großartig gestalteten Detail, ein Arzt zu sein, der für das NHS arbeitet. Kay bietet eine echte literarische Therapie an, wenn er einen Fall von etwas ziemlich Nassem nacherzählt, das dem Vater eines Patienten passiert und an Ort und Stelle gebracht wurde, um es seiner Tochter zu erklären (mit ernstem Gesicht). Wir werden in die Realität der steigenden Sterblichkeitsraten hineingelassen, wenn alle Juniorärzte die Krankenhäuser wechseln und dieser Übergang am „Mittwoch“ zu Todesfällen führen kann.""...

Lobenswert, dass der Stuckateur, der die Zervixdilatation seiner Frau als genau 6 cm bezeichnete, und Dr. Kay dies bestätigt. Von der Mutter, die ihm einen neunseitigen Geburtsplan vorlegte - als wäre es das Allheilmittel für einen neuartigen Weg zu einer richtigen Geburt. Leider musste sie sich aufgrund des Epidurals, das im neuen Plan dieser schwangeren Mutter enthalten sein sollte, davon trennen. Kay erinnert sich an die Zeit, als er einer Frau „Satan“ entließ (als wäre es ein Fluch der Leistung), und fragte sich, ob die Eltern darüber nachgedacht hatten, wie dieser Name im Kindergarten oder in der Grundschule untergehen könnte. Die Technologie fand ihren Weg in A & E, als Adam seinen Patienten während eines Abstrichs beim „Facetiming“ beobachtet. Adam erklärt die Aufgabe, den Mutterleib zu finden, dem ein kleiner fehlt, und stattdessen war der Befund nur „ausgedehnte Darmschleifen. Traurig.Lachen ist definitiv die Nachkommenschaft von Kays absolut sardonischen Sprüchen, die keine Unterstützung oder Katalysator benötigen, um zu fließen. Die Gefahren der allgemeinen Gesundheitsversorgung werden hier deutlich, und wir entwickeln einen neu entdeckten Respekt für das Prestige und die Eleganz der amerikanischen Medizin und ihrer makellosen Krankenhäuser, der Bestlisten der US-Nachrichten und der Gurkenwasserstationen. Erwähnenswert sind auch die frisch aus den Trocknerkleidern stammenden, vor Ort in E. R. durchgeführten Schulungen durch Krankenschwestern sowie Ratschläge und taktile Betreuung durch große blauäugige Experten in passenden Peelings, die nicht nach diesen NHS-Ärzten riechen.

85,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5114433-liz-janet,3,"Interview with author that brought the book to my attention: https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_co...For years I have been watching news comedy shows from the U.K., mostly Mock the Week and Russell Howard’s Good News, and in every series the panel has to dispel the opinions of some member of the conservative government about how the NHS is a cancer and the portrayal of Junior Doctors as money-grabbing and undeserving people who only seek their own wealth. This book is a more direct answer to those politicians who believe they can blatantly lie on television in order to support their budget cuts, told in the diary entries of one of the doctors during his training.Adam Kay takes on the issue with the most amount of British humour he could possibly muster, considering he had some pretty idiotic people pop into hospital, ( including a couple who turned a condom inside out and obviously got pregnant, which isn’t even the worst one) and the evident fact his and his colleagues hard work was being undermined by bureaucrats who would never understand all the work the doctors actually do.“Patient too drowsy to assess.”I pop in. The patient is dead.But the book is not only the comical experience of an overworked man, but an observation on class and the wealth of the state and their influence on the well-being of the population, a remark on the demands these doctors were expected to fulfill, and how all these lead to the detriment of the doctor’s personal lives. A MUST READ!"
86,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80638935-hp-saucerer,4,"In This is Going to Hurt, Adam Kay provides a no-holds-barred account of his time on the front line of the NHS. Through a series of diary entries we begin to see how, under the weight of the huge responsibility placed upon them - with minimal supervision and little pastoral support - doctors are working themselves to exhaustion, crumbling under the strain of an excessive and unmanageable workload. The book reveals a (darker) lesser-known side to the NHS, a service that so many depend on and yet take for granted. I was astonished by the sheer and blatant ineptitude of hospitals when it comes to caring for their staff. How could this be? But then is this really that surprising, given that the junior doctor dispute a few years ago served as a reminder of how little the government value those who are willing to devote most of their working lives to serving the public. (Okay, down from the soap box and back to the actual book)Whilst many of the accounts Kay recalls so candidly are hilarious (the dance floor pessary/pram wheel confusion was a personal favourite), others are horrifying and absolutely heartbreaking. I did find one or two accounts disrespectful and even disparaging; at times Kay appears to be looking for cheap laughs, and here the humour becomes base and a tad infantile. On the whole though, this is a must-read that perfectly captures both the pain and joy of working in close proximity to despair, disease and death every day. Brilliant."

88,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66513638-gtf,5,"'This Is Going To Hurt"" is a brilliant memoir of Adam Kay's career as a junior doctor. The book spares no details with regard to every aspect of the job; it contains some very graphic accounts of unusual injuries and illnesses that he has come across during his time in medicine, and it also details what it's really like to work for the UK's healthcare system. In addition to its plethora of explicit details, Kay clears up a lot of the misconceptions that people tend to have about doctors, such as doctors being excellent problem solvers, when in fact they are often just following procedures, and junior doctors earning hefty salaries, when in fact they are being paid less than minimum wage for years. ""This Is Going to Hurt"" is an interesting fusion of misery and humor. Although Kay didn't feel human anymore towards the end of his career in medicine, he still managed to see the funny side to some of his experiences in his grueling medical career."
89,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9582364-andrea,4,"This book by Adam Kay came to my attention in an episode of the Diving In podcast, where it was described as laugh-out-loud funny; the kind of book you want to read during a pandemic. I decided to go audio, which is still pretty new to me, and was delighted to find that the author is the narrator. Although it had some dark and/or poignant moments, it delivered the laughs while at the same time opening my eyes to the world of obgyn and the problems of the NHS (UK universal health service). On one hand I think it's a shame that Adam Kay is no longer a doctor, but on the other hand, I think he makes an excellent writer/comedian."
90,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1076079-karen,4,"In this book, set in the UK, it is apparent that undergoing medical training under their National Health System reaps huge emotional rewards (I can do great good), but little else in the way of monetary or personal rewards (I most likely will have to work the day of my own wedding/child's Christening/best friend's funeral). Adam Kay's diaries are quite fun and funny, loaded with a unique brand of dark humor I enjoy. Then as long days, derision, and under-staffing take their toll on him, the book finally takes on a more serious tone and it's really sad how it works out for him and some of his colleagues. I would love to see an American doctor compare his or her experiences with Adam's as I'm sure there are similarities. I do believe UK (junior) doctors struggle with the long hours and low pay a lot longer than in the U.S.A really good book that I recommend."

I am so supportive of the NHS and it’s workers in this country, this book is proof of the amazing work doctors and nurses do for us every single day that a lot of us take for granted.I’ve said it a million times before, but I find comedy in books really hard to connect with and I rarely laugh out loud at books. To begin with, I thought the humour in this one felt a bit forced and I was sure I wasn’t going to enjoy this as much as I’d hoped but soon enough I began really enjoying the humour and found myself outwardly laughing at some of Kay’s anecdotes. I even read some of the passages out loud to Matt, now that’s praise!The writing in this book is really well done. It’s full of wit, sarcasm, and self-deprecating humour while also being filled with some controversial and powerful moments. Told in diary form entry this is a really easy book to speed through, even when it comes to some of the harder hitting moments.Call me heartless, but unlike a lot of others who’ve read this book, I didn’t find myself on the edge of, or even in, tears. There is definitely a fair share of upsetting entries, so be warned but it didn’t hit me as hard as it did others.Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this short read. It light-heartedly highlighted the ever-growing struggles of NHS workers while offering a humorous outlook of working as a junior doctor.

93,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58158333-allen,4,"A funny, excoriating memoir about a ""junior"" ob/gyn physician who is ""nervous in the service"" -- not the military, but Britain's National Health Service during recent years of budget retrenchment, 2004 to 2010. Adam Kay and his colleagues had to deal with weirdly ineffectual decisions coming down the chain-of-command that are spun to send spuriously comforting political messages to the ""folks at home"" rather than merely save money at all costs. When a volunteer translator renders the Punjabi word indicating a chronic bleeder into ""hermaphrodite"" rather than ""hemophiliac,"" it's funny but potentially deadly. When an NHS decision from on high takes away the doctors' sleeping cots, remember that your next deliverer of a C-section may have been on his/her feet for 18 hours. God forbid those lazy malingerers should try to stay alert and refreshed! Adam Kay's writing style is funny, but we can see the humor and patience wearing thin when a hemorrhaging patient splashed blood on his scrubs, pants, expensive CK boxers and manhood underneath. The pay these young physicians received for their herculean efforts is usually pitifully small, and once again the invisible bureaucracy seems to have them in their sights--when the docs switch from the Nike type of trainer (athletic) shoes to the much cheaper Crocs, the brass ban use of Crocs but offer no clothing allowances. It's at this point Kay begins to wonder whether the joy of delivering baby after healthy baby really compensates for the occasional heartbreaking failure, the ridiculous hours, low pay, bureaucratic turgidity that ignores success but comes down hard on trivial infractions, and above all the inability to schedule a social life when everyone seems to be slotted in as backup for everyone else. That last problem really hits the fan when time off the author had been promised for a two-week overseas vacation is nullified by a weekend of duty right in the middle. Nobody's fault, but there's no going AWOL. A couple of notes about the language in this highly entertaining memoir with a high ""can't-put-it-down"" quotient: typically, Kay uses the common four-letter term instead of ""manhood"" above; Yanks who object to profanity may find the use and frequency of it in this book disconcerting. British slang is freely applied, too, but I forgive him all this for his scrupulousness in footnoting medical terms (which he very much intends to be read), so we readers can understand what references like ""trans-vaginal probe"" and ""pre-eclampsia"" and the convoluted acronym ""TAH BSO"" all mean. We readers know from the introduction to this powerful book that Adam Kay eventually left the National Health Service for a turn at comedy. While the National Health Service does not (yet) subject its patients to American-style five- and six-figure bills, we have to wonder about the priorities of any society that rewards gag-writing for telly so much more handsomely than saving the lives of mothers and fetuses. This shocking (but very funny) black-humored account remains a brisk seller on both sides of the Atlantic. Update: August 31, 2018"

There is no real plot or climax or discovery. We are told from the beginning that the health system in the UK is wonderfully free for all but extremely flawed and most medical staff are overworked to the point of gross negligence. So what we are left with in reading these daily diary entries are the proof. The entries are mostly written with a sarcastic punch line each one a story within itself. Each entry is well written. Sometimes humorous. Mostly sarcastic. However it is also shocking, disheartening and sad as well. 3 1/2 to 4 stars."

He also added helpful footnotes to explain any medical terms not familiar with readers.His fascinating account of his life as a doctor was painfully honest, heart-warming and many times hilarious. He explains in great detail his many experiences (including some that made my stomach turn) and the struggles he endured until he got to the point when he made the heart breaking decision to leave his devoted career. Adam's understandable departure from medicine is a great loss to his community and humanity. There are too few doctors with his wit, personality, compassion and devotion.I highly recommend this captivating read!Thank you to NetGalley, author Adam Kay and Little, Brown and Company for an arc of this novel in exchange for my honest review."

It's visceral, funny, and so poignant; what a memoir should be, real commentary on real life. It's unpretentious, as if Adam Kay had come round for a chat and we got to talking about his time as a junior doctor. It's heartbreaking, a love letter to the people who make the NHS such a precious institution, and a retort to those who have bruised it. This is what a memoir should be. An elegy, a time capsule. It's a look at a life we so rarely see, but that we should all work to better understand. One of the best books I've read in a long time. Thanks, Adam. "

Apart from the side-splitting humour, it is an excoriating account of the manifold administration deficiencies throughout the National Health Service, once the jewel in the crown of Britain’s welfare society. The author decided to specialise in ‘obs & gynae’ (known in the medical world as ‘brats and - something I can't repeat here beginning with ‘t’) because you end up with twice as many patients, unlike in geriatrics, and it's a tragi-comedy from there on.You will never look at your hospital doctor the same way after reading this, but I would recommend you do so, rather than turn up in A &E if you can possibly avoid it."

Painfully sad? Excellent validation that I made the right choice in not becoming a doctor? Honestly, all of the above. With candor and a never-ending stream of (often dark) humor, this collection of journal entries by a former medical resident paints a vivid picture of all parts of the medical profession: the funny, the bizarre, the awful, the heartwarming, the disgusting, the personal.First, a brief disclaimer: the original version of this book was published in 2017 in the UK. After its wild success, and comments that it resonated with doctors in other countries as well, who had copies imported from across the pond (or across the globe), someone had the fantastic idea to make a US version of it. You know, change some of the British-isms to American vernacular, add some more context for bits about the British government and health system, and so on. So while this is an ARC for a book releasing in December, it has been around for a while, just in a different form.As is often the case with nonfiction, a summary won’t do you much good here. Basically, Adam Kay decided he wanted to go into medicine somewhat arbitrarily while in high school, because, you know, we expect kids to know what they want to do with the rest of their lives already even when their brains aren’t fully formed yet. Common sense, right? He elected to go into obstetrics and gynecology, having heard that this was the easiest branch to go into. Over his years as a house officer and/or registrar (the UK version of what Americans call a resident and/or intern), he kept a journal of all the goings-on at his place of work. This book is a compilation of those journal entries.Right off the bat, in case I haven’t made it clear enough yet, this book is, in many places, laugh-out-loud hilarious. I had to be careful about reading it in public sometimes for fear that I would burst out in a stupid grin or an actual snort of laughter. Even as he describes his experiences going to hell and back (which is almost a literal definition; he did once deliver a baby named “Sayton,” pronounced like Satan), he manages to infuse all but the most serious moments with snark and self-awareness of the sheer insanity of it all. SCBU (pronounced “Scaboo”) is the Special Care Baby Unit; NICU is the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit; PICU is the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit; and PIKACHU is a type of Pokémon.Seriously, patients do dumb stuff. Objectively, we know this to be true, but you don’t really understand it until you are reading about the doctors who see it all: the things people put up various orifices (a Kinder egg with a wedding ring inside, placed inside a certain part of female anatomy?), the absurd questions they ask, the stupid things they do just to prove a point (yes, there was a literal dick-in-a-fan incident)…it’s hard to comprehend just how insane doctors must think people are until you really see it all in one place. Especially when that one place is narrated by an incredulous physician who peppers the whole thing with footnotes both clarifying points and adding his own opinions.If you describe a grandparent as being old-fashioned, it’s a euphemism for “casually racist.” In a hospital setting, it means “unsupportive.” You’re on your own.That’s not to say that this book is all “hardy-har-har-let’s-laugh-at-medical-nonsense,” though. What makes this book really work, and what keeps it from being a nonstop stream of jokes without real substance, is its recognition of the flaws inherent in the British medical system. To my understanding, many of these flaws are pervasive in medical systems across the globe, too, so this isn’t overly Anglo-centric. The hours are awful, with long shifts that don’t allow for enough sleep. You’re expected to stay for extra hours past the end of your shift if needed, and you don’t get paid overtime for that. Heck, the pay isn’t even that good to begin with. Requesting a day off is rarely going to actually work, as you can (and probably will) still be called in at the last minute.I told a patient that his MRI wouldn’t be until next week and he threatened to break both my legs. My first thought was Well, it’ll be a couple weeks off work. I was this close to offering him a baseball bat.These shortcomings mean that being a doctor, while you are in theory helping people, is likely to cause you personal harm in the process. Kay missed major events in both his own life and his friends’ lives because of his work schedule. It wreaked havoc on his relationships, both personal and romantic. While the stories in this book are not focused much on his outside life, his jabs at the system and comments here and there about his personal problems weave an underlying narrative of a man who, like so many others in his profession, is being drained by a job that asks too much. We like to think of doctors as being selfless, noble, well-paid, and respected, but in reality, they’re no better off than most of us–and, in many case, actually have it worse.I should have had counseling–in fact, my hospital should have arranged it. But there’s a mutual code of silence that keeps help from those who need it most.And as if the job isn’t enough, another recurring theme throughout the book is when his personal life and career would overlap. Apparently, being a doctor means your friends think you are the person to call and ask about any medical problem they have, never mind that you may specialize in only one area that has literally nothing to do with their issue. Sketchy consultations? Check. Awkward surgery? Been there, done that. Recognized by former patients in public? Yup. Again, it’s a very strange juxtaposition that you don’t often see in other careers, and even the tamer stories in this book are nothing short of eye-opening and revelatory.Quick note: the ending of the book is actually very sad, culminating with the event that made Kay decide to leave medicine and move on to a completely different job (writing comedy, which is what he does now!), and you can probably guess what sort of story that is. Poignant, upsetting, and illuminating the disastrous toll that the medical profession can take on the mental health of practitioners. Though, to be fair, you can tell even from the skillful narration of this book, with pitch-perfect jokes on every page, that humor is more of a strong suit for Kay than medicine ever was. So why not a full five stars? As much as I enjoyed the humor in this book, there were a few moments where I felt like maybe the author took it a little too far. For instance, there was one joke about how being a doctor is more stressful than piloting a plane when a terrorist tries to take over, and there were several sex-related jokes that were more uncomfortable than humorous to me. (That said, there were also quite a few on the same topic that were still incredibly funny, but some missed the mark. I guess that’s going to be the case in most comedy–not every joke is for everyone.)Still, I strongly recommend this one. It makes you laugh, and it makes you think. It is the medical equivalent of the “Don’t Be a Lawyer” song from Crazy Ex-Girlfriend–which is definitely a good thing. And if you're considering going into medicine, this will help make sure you go into it clear-eyed and wholly disillusioned, because yes: this job is going to hurt, in more ways than one.TRIGGER/CONTENT WARNINGS: death of a child, death of a parent, lots of blood, lots of genital-related content (all in a medical context, of course), side character with depressionThank you to the publisher, Little, Brown Spark, for providing me with an eARC of this book via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review!"

I am a fan of medical memoirs, so it was right up my street.Adam writes with wit and humour, and even in the worst of situations this levity really makes a difference to the narrative. Doctors see people on the worst days of their lives, but we also see them on the worst days of theirs, even if we don’t realise it. We don’t know what they are going through, but Adam has given an insightful look into his life as a Junior Doctor and just how much it impacted him.I think what I enjoyed the most was the almost conversational aspect of the book. It’s written in diary entries from his time in hospitals, so they are often brief, but some of the entries are very powerful. Others really made me feel for him as his own personal life suffered at the hands of working absolutely crazy hours and nobody could understand why he was missing important events outside of work.I really enjoyed This Is Going To Hurt, even though enjoy seems like the wrong word considering the subject matter, but you know what I mean. Adam Kay has a way with words, and it made this a really easy read. Tough subjects obviously, but he made it more relatable with his affable writing manner.If you enjoy glimpse into the medical profession, and a little humour with your non-fiction the you should most certainly add this one to your list!Recommended!"
104,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10887793-julie,5,"This is the second book I read this year that I wish I had written (and, had I kept a diary, I probably could have - except the horrific penis-related injury I treated was not a de-gloving, but a fracture).I'm a *junior* doctor, and his stories of life, death and everything in between just sound so reassuringly familiar. It's kinda nice to know that somebody else has been there, done that, got the T-shirt and got it stained by blood almost immediately. Relationship breakdown? Check. Missing out on weddings/birthday parties/funerals because you had to be in work? Check. Developing a scathing, sarcastic sense of humour in order to deal with the death, tragedy and pain that constantly surrounds you? Also check.For those who are not medical professionals, I would highly recommend reading it. It sheds a light on a reality that some might not know exists: what goes on behind the scenes and what happens to your doctor on a day-to-day basis (spoiler alert: it ain't all good). And, honestly, we probably need more people to read it if we want to save the NHS."

108,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8378502-barney,2,"I was expecting I'd enjoy this book but I ended up really disliking it. It starts off well with a few funny anecdotes but after a while I realised a lot of them are at the expense of the patient themselves. Yes I am the fun police, and I know humour is a way of coping, but there's something about the thought of a group of doctors chuckling about the time a dementia patient sexually assaulted another patient - and then a group of readers reading that and also chuckling - which doesn't sit well with me.Also we can all agree that doctors deserve absolutely every penny they get and are entitled to far more than they're being paid currently. But there's nothing like someone pre-financial crash describing themselves as poor while also having just bought an apartment and a trip to the Mauritius which just aaaargh really gets under my skin.I couldn't finish the book in the end. I was about half way through and fading fast, only to come across an vignette about the doctor being called in to deliver a new-born 'mid-wank', which ends with him completing the procedure ""still erect"". It was genuinely the most horrifying sentence I have ever read.So yeah, 2 stars but mostly because (even though the book isn't really political itself) its popularity in the UK has contributed to conversations about how hard junior doctors work and how valuable their contributions are to the NHS."

Usually the highest they get is 4.5 which is usually rounded down to 4 as I save the 5 star ratings for truly incredible books or ones that really had a profound effect on me. This book deserves every single star. Hilarious and heartbreaking all at once, it highlights the importance of the NHS which we should all be fighting to protect and make better.

This seems to be a long list of disconnected anecdotes, nothing more, and I'm finding reading former doctor Adam Kay's views on both his patients and colleagues downright upsetting. It's not funny to me at all. I understand that doctors have a hard time (and lets be honest, everyone else working for the NHS currently), that they are nowhere near rewarded enough in a really thankless job, and, yes, I understand that humour is perhaps a coping mechanism in such a stressful job. I'm happy that this book has apparently shed light on the horrific, stressful conditions overworked and poorly recognised medical professionals are working under in the NHS, but personally I cannot read another page of this. I understand he was unhappy in this job and perhaps writing these ""diaries"" was a coping mechanism, but I think... I want to keep the illusion alive that most doctors and other medical professionals would never have such crude and obnoxious thoughts about their patients. Other people have felt very differently about this book (I guess you have to be ok with his very dark sense of humour?), so maybe my extreme reaction is unusual and I'm a little sensitive to this topic, but personally I have no desire to force myself to keep reading something that has made me feel so low."

Dr. Adam Kay does inflict the pain from the many expletives and black humor that erupts all over his readers in this this magnificently crafted detail of being a doctor working for the NHS. Kay offers some true literary therapy when he retells a case of something rather wet happening to a patient’s father and having been put on the spot to explain it to his daughter (with a straight face). We are let into the reality of death rates on the rise when all junior doctors change hospitals and this transition may result in deaths on “Wednesday.” “…I leave them to deal with rectal bleed.…a seventy-year-old lady’s alcohol consumption…notes. I’ve established that wine is her poison. Me: ‘And how much wine do you drink per day, would you say? Patient: ‘bout three bottles on a good day.’ Me: ‘OK . . . And on a bad day?’ Patient: ‘On a bad day I only manage one.”—-Adam Kay, MD""The cadence at times can be chaotic. Commendable that the plasterer who called his wife’s cervical dilation to be exactly 6 cm---and Dr. Kay verifies such. From the mommy to be who presented him with a nine-page birth plan---as if it were the panacea to a novel way to a proper birth. Sadly, she had to part with it due to the epidural that was to be in this pregnant mommy’s new plan. Kay recalls the time he delivered “Satan” out of a woman (as if it were a bane of accomplishment) and wonders had the parents thought of how this name could go down in kindergarten or grade school? Technology found its way into A & E as Adam observes his patient “Facetiming” during a smear. Adam explains the task of finding the womb lacking a little one and instead the finding was just “distended loops of bowel. Sad.Laughter is definitely the progeny from Kay’s utterly sardonic quips that needs no assistance or catalyst to flow. The perils of universal healthcare are evidenced here, and we develop a newfound respect for the prestige and elegance of American medicine and its spotless hospitals, U.S. News Best lists and the cucumber water stations. Deserving mention too are the fresh out of the dryer gowns, on the spot education in E.R. by nurses and tactile care from tall blue-eyed physicians in matching scrubs that smell nothing like these NHS doctors. Five stars indeed. Must read for the curious and those who question things (often). ---Der Titel impliziert viel. Dr. Adam Kay verursacht den Schmerz durch die vielen Sprengsätze und den schwarzen Humor, die überall in seinen Lesern ausbrechen, in diesem großartig gestalteten Detail, ein Arzt zu sein, der für das NHS arbeitet. Kay bietet eine echte literarische Therapie an, wenn er einen Fall von etwas ziemlich Nassem nacherzählt, das dem Vater eines Patienten passiert und an Ort und Stelle gebracht wurde, um es seiner Tochter zu erklären (mit ernstem Gesicht). Wir werden in die Realität der steigenden Sterblichkeitsraten hineingelassen, wenn alle Juniorärzte die Krankenhäuser wechseln und dieser Übergang am „Mittwoch“ zu Todesfällen führen kann.""...

Von der Mutter, die ihm einen neunseitigen Geburtsplan vorlegte - als wäre es das Allheilmittel für einen neuartigen Weg zu einer richtigen Geburt. Leider musste sie sich aufgrund des Epidurals, das im neuen Plan dieser schwangeren Mutter enthalten sein sollte, davon trennen. Kay erinnert sich an die Zeit, als er einer Frau „Satan“ entließ (als wäre es ein Fluch der Leistung), und fragte sich, ob die Eltern darüber nachgedacht hatten, wie dieser Name im Kindergarten oder in der Grundschule untergehen könnte. Die Technologie fand ihren Weg in A & E, als Adam seinen Patienten während eines Abstrichs beim „Facetiming“ beobachtet. Adam erklärt die Aufgabe, den Mutterleib zu finden, dem ein kleiner fehlt, und stattdessen war der Befund nur „ausgedehnte Darmschleifen. Traurig.Lachen ist definitiv die Nachkommenschaft von Kays absolut sardonischen Sprüchen, die keine Unterstützung oder Katalysator benötigen, um zu fließen. Die Gefahren der allgemeinen Gesundheitsversorgung werden hier deutlich, und wir entwickeln einen neu entdeckten Respekt für das Prestige und die Eleganz der amerikanischen Medizin und ihrer makellosen Krankenhäuser, der Bestlisten der US-Nachrichten und der Gurkenwasserstationen. Erwähnenswert sind auch die frisch aus den Trocknerkleidern stammenden, vor Ort in E.

115,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5114433-liz-janet,3,"Interview with author that brought the book to my attention: https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_co...For years I have been watching news comedy shows from the U.K., mostly Mock the Week and Russell Howard’s Good News, and in every series the panel has to dispel the opinions of some member of the conservative government about how the NHS is a cancer and the portrayal of Junior Doctors as money-grabbing and undeserving people who only seek their own wealth. This book is a more direct answer to those politicians who believe they can blatantly lie on television in order to support their budget cuts, told in the diary entries of one of the doctors during his training.Adam Kay takes on the issue with the most amount of British humour he could possibly muster, considering he had some pretty idiotic people pop into hospital, ( including a couple who turned a condom inside out and obviously got pregnant, which isn’t even the worst one) and the evident fact his and his colleagues hard work was being undermined by bureaucrats who would never understand all the work the doctors actually do.“Patient too drowsy to assess.”I pop in. The patient is dead.But the book is not only the comical experience of an overworked man, but an observation on class and the wealth of the state and their influence on the well-being of the population, a remark on the demands these doctors were expected to fulfill, and how all these lead to the detriment of the doctor’s personal lives. A MUST READ!"
116,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80638935-hp-saucerer,4,"In This is Going to Hurt, Adam Kay provides a no-holds-barred account of his time on the front line of the NHS. Through a series of diary entries we begin to see how, under the weight of the huge responsibility placed upon them - with minimal supervision and little pastoral support - doctors are working themselves to exhaustion, crumbling under the strain of an excessive and unmanageable workload. The book reveals a (darker) lesser-known side to the NHS, a service that so many depend on and yet take for granted. I was astonished by the sheer and blatant ineptitude of hospitals when it comes to caring for their staff. How could this be? But then is this really that surprising, given that the junior doctor dispute a few years ago served as a reminder of how little the government value those who are willing to devote most of their working lives to serving the public. (Okay, down from the soap box and back to the actual book)Whilst many of the accounts Kay recalls so candidly are hilarious (the dance floor pessary/pram wheel confusion was a personal favourite), others are horrifying and absolutely heartbreaking. I did find one or two accounts disrespectful and even disparaging; at times Kay appears to be looking for cheap laughs, and here the humour becomes base and a tad infantile. On the whole though, this is a must-read that perfectly captures both the pain and joy of working in close proximity to despair, disease and death every day. Brilliant."

118,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66513638-gtf,5,"'This Is Going To Hurt"" is a brilliant memoir of Adam Kay's career as a junior doctor. The book spares no details with regard to every aspect of the job; it contains some very graphic accounts of unusual injuries and illnesses that he has come across during his time in medicine, and it also details what it's really like to work for the UK's healthcare system. In addition to its plethora of explicit details, Kay clears up a lot of the misconceptions that people tend to have about doctors, such as doctors being excellent problem solvers, when in fact they are often just following procedures, and junior doctors earning hefty salaries, when in fact they are being paid less than minimum wage for years. ""This Is Going to Hurt"" is an interesting fusion of misery and humor. Although Kay didn't feel human anymore towards the end of his career in medicine, he still managed to see the funny side to some of his experiences in his grueling medical career."
119,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9582364-andrea,4,"This book by Adam Kay came to my attention in an episode of the Diving In podcast, where it was described as laugh-out-loud funny; the kind of book you want to read during a pandemic. I decided to go audio, which is still pretty new to me, and was delighted to find that the author is the narrator. Although it had some dark and/or poignant moments, it delivered the laughs while at the same time opening my eyes to the world of obgyn and the problems of the NHS (UK universal health service). On one hand I think it's a shame that Adam Kay is no longer a doctor, but on the other hand, I think he makes an excellent writer/comedian."

Adam Kay's diaries are quite fun and funny, loaded with a unique brand of dark humor I enjoy. Then as long days, derision, and under-staffing take their toll on him, the book finally takes on a more serious tone and it's really sad how it works out for him and some of his colleagues. I would love to see an American doctor compare his or her experiences with Adam's as I'm sure there are similarities. I do believe UK (junior) doctors struggle with the long hours and low pay a lot longer than in the U.S.A really good book that I recommend."

I am so supportive of the NHS and it’s workers in this country, this book is proof of the amazing work doctors and nurses do for us every single day that a lot of us take for granted.I’ve said it a million times before, but I find comedy in books really hard to connect with and I rarely laugh out loud at books. To begin with, I thought the humour in this one felt a bit forced and I was sure I wasn’t going to enjoy this as much as I’d hoped but soon enough I began really enjoying the humour and found myself outwardly laughing at some of Kay’s anecdotes. I even read some of the passages out loud to Matt, now that’s praise!The writing in this book is really well done. It’s full of wit, sarcasm, and self-deprecating humour while also being filled with some controversial and powerful moments. Told in diary form entry this is a really easy book to speed through, even when it comes to some of the harder hitting moments.Call me heartless, but unlike a lot of others who’ve read this book, I didn’t find myself on the edge of, or even in, tears. There is definitely a fair share of upsetting entries, so be warned but it didn’t hit me as hard as it did others.Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this short read. It light-heartedly highlighted the ever-growing struggles of NHS workers while offering a humorous outlook of working as a junior doctor.

123,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58158333-allen,4,"A funny, excoriating memoir about a ""junior"" ob/gyn physician who is ""nervous in the service"" -- not the military, but Britain's National Health Service during recent years of budget retrenchment, 2004 to 2010. Adam Kay and his colleagues had to deal with weirdly ineffectual decisions coming down the chain-of-command that are spun to send spuriously comforting political messages to the ""folks at home"" rather than merely save money at all costs. When a volunteer translator renders the Punjabi word indicating a chronic bleeder into ""hermaphrodite"" rather than ""hemophiliac,"" it's funny but potentially deadly. When an NHS decision from on high takes away the doctors' sleeping cots, remember that your next deliverer of a C-section may have been on his/her feet for 18 hours. God forbid those lazy malingerers should try to stay alert and refreshed! Adam Kay's writing style is funny, but we can see the humor and patience wearing thin when a hemorrhaging patient splashed blood on his scrubs, pants, expensive CK boxers and manhood underneath. The pay these young physicians received for their herculean efforts is usually pitifully small, and once again the invisible bureaucracy seems to have them in their sights--when the docs switch from the Nike type of trainer (athletic) shoes to the much cheaper Crocs, the brass ban use of Crocs but offer no clothing allowances. It's at this point Kay begins to wonder whether the joy of delivering baby after healthy baby really compensates for the occasional heartbreaking failure, the ridiculous hours, low pay, bureaucratic turgidity that ignores success but comes down hard on trivial infractions, and above all the inability to schedule a social life when everyone seems to be slotted in as backup for everyone else. That last problem really hits the fan when time off the author had been promised for a two-week overseas vacation is nullified by a weekend of duty right in the middle. Nobody's fault, but there's no going AWOL. A couple of notes about the language in this highly entertaining memoir with a high ""can't-put-it-down"" quotient: typically, Kay uses the common four-letter term instead of ""manhood"" above; Yanks who object to profanity may find the use and frequency of it in this book disconcerting. British slang is freely applied, too, but I forgive him all this for his scrupulousness in footnoting medical terms (which he very much intends to be read), so we readers can understand what references like ""trans-vaginal probe"" and ""pre-eclampsia"" and the convoluted acronym ""TAH BSO"" all mean. We readers know from the introduction to this powerful book that Adam Kay eventually left the National Health Service for a turn at comedy. While the National Health Service does not (yet) subject its patients to American-style five- and six-figure bills, we have to wonder about the priorities of any society that rewards gag-writing for telly so much more handsomely than saving the lives of mothers and fetuses. This shocking (but very funny) black-humored account remains a brisk seller on both sides of the Atlantic. Update: August 31, 2018"

There is no real plot or climax or discovery. We are told from the beginning that the health system in the UK is wonderfully free for all but extremely flawed and most medical staff are overworked to the point of gross negligence. So what we are left with in reading these daily diary entries are the proof. The entries are mostly written with a sarcastic punch line each one a story within itself. Each entry is well written. Sometimes humorous. Mostly sarcastic. However it is also shocking, disheartening and sad as well. 3 1/2 to 4 stars."

He also added helpful footnotes to explain any medical terms not familiar with readers.His fascinating account of his life as a doctor was painfully honest, heart-warming and many times hilarious. He explains in great detail his many experiences (including some that made my stomach turn) and the struggles he endured until he got to the point when he made the heart breaking decision to leave his devoted career. Adam's understandable departure from medicine is a great loss to his community and humanity. There are too few doctors with his wit, personality, compassion and devotion.I highly recommend this captivating read!Thank you to NetGalley, author Adam Kay and Little, Brown and Company for an arc of this novel in exchange for my honest review."

127,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4074594-kiki,5,"I'm supposed to be taking a break from social media right now, so I'll just say this: I feel better, more whole, more comforted, and more hopeful after reading this book. It's visceral, funny, and so poignant; what a memoir should be, real commentary on real life. It's unpretentious, as if Adam Kay had come round for a chat and we got to talking about his time as a junior doctor. It's heartbreaking, a love letter to the people who make the NHS such a precious institution, and a retort to those who have bruised it. This is what a memoir should be. An elegy, a time capsule. It's a look at a life we so rarely see, but that we should all work to better understand. One of the best books I've read in a long time. Thanks, Adam. "

Picked up at the airport and polished off within the day.There were numerous laugh out loud moments which I suspect may have disturbed the people around me in the airport. Many of these involved, ahem, ""introduced objects"" which sadly shows you my level. And there was me thinking that the TV remote control was just for switching channels.Well worth a read."
129,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17465866-anni,5,"The Best MedicineWell, you may not die laughing, but I was certainly in stitches and convulsed with hysterics, not to mention emotionally distraught, reading this diary of a junior doctor‘s training in the NHS. Apart from the side-splitting humour, it is an excoriating account of the manifold administration deficiencies throughout the National Health Service, once the jewel in the crown of Britain’s welfare society. The author decided to specialise in ‘obs & gynae’ (known in the medical world as ‘brats and - something I can't repeat here beginning with ‘t’) because you end up with twice as many patients, unlike in geriatrics, and it's a tragi-comedy from there on.You will never look at your hospital doctor the same way after reading this, but I would recommend you do so, rather than turn up in A &E if you can possibly avoid it."

I worked in the emergency services myself and I get it. But some of the things he says about old people and those suffering embarrassing illnesses are quite hurtful.”I watched my elderly father pass away in hospital and to think that the medical staff may have been making insensitive remarks behind his back, is particularly hurtful.I gave up on this book at about 85%. It did not get any better. It was juvenile and patronising."

Painfully sad? Excellent validation that I made the right choice in not becoming a doctor? Honestly, all of the above. With candor and a never-ending stream of (often dark) humor, this collection of journal entries by a former medical resident paints a vivid picture of all parts of the medical profession: the funny, the bizarre, the awful, the heartwarming, the disgusting, the personal.First, a brief disclaimer: the original version of this book was published in 2017 in the UK. After its wild success, and comments that it resonated with doctors in other countries as well, who had copies imported from across the pond (or across the globe), someone had the fantastic idea to make a US version of it. You know, change some of the British-isms to American vernacular, add some more context for bits about the British government and health system, and so on. So while this is an ARC for a book releasing in December, it has been around for a while, just in a different form.As is often the case with nonfiction, a summary won’t do you much good here. Basically, Adam Kay decided he wanted to go into medicine somewhat arbitrarily while in high school, because, you know, we expect kids to know what they want to do with the rest of their lives already even when their brains aren’t fully formed yet. Common sense, right? He elected to go into obstetrics and gynecology, having heard that this was the easiest branch to go into. Over his years as a house officer and/or registrar (the UK version of what Americans call a resident and/or intern), he kept a journal of all the goings-on at his place of work. This book is a compilation of those journal entries.Right off the bat, in case I haven’t made it clear enough yet, this book is, in many places, laugh-out-loud hilarious. I had to be careful about reading it in public sometimes for fear that I would burst out in a stupid grin or an actual snort of laughter. Even as he describes his experiences going to hell and back (which is almost a literal definition; he did once deliver a baby named “Sayton,” pronounced like Satan), he manages to infuse all but the most serious moments with snark and self-awareness of the sheer insanity of it all. SCBU (pronounced “Scaboo”) is the Special Care Baby Unit; NICU is the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit; PICU is the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit; and PIKACHU is a type of Pokémon.Seriously, patients do dumb stuff. Objectively, we know this to be true, but you don’t really understand it until you are reading about the doctors who see it all: the things people put up various orifices (a Kinder egg with a wedding ring inside, placed inside a certain part of female anatomy?), the absurd questions they ask, the stupid things they do just to prove a point (yes, there was a literal dick-in-a-fan incident)…it’s hard to comprehend just how insane doctors must think people are until you really see it all in one place. Especially when that one place is narrated by an incredulous physician who peppers the whole thing with footnotes both clarifying points and adding his own opinions.If you describe a grandparent as being old-fashioned, it’s a euphemism for “casually racist.” In a hospital setting, it means “unsupportive.” You’re on your own.That’s not to say that this book is all “hardy-har-har-let’s-laugh-at-medical-nonsense,” though. What makes this book really work, and what keeps it from being a nonstop stream of jokes without real substance, is its recognition of the flaws inherent in the British medical system. To my understanding, many of these flaws are pervasive in medical systems across the globe, too, so this isn’t overly Anglo-centric. The hours are awful, with long shifts that don’t allow for enough sleep. You’re expected to stay for extra hours past the end of your shift if needed, and you don’t get paid overtime for that. Heck, the pay isn’t even that good to begin with. Requesting a day off is rarely going to actually work, as you can (and probably will) still be called in at the last minute.I told a patient that his MRI wouldn’t be until next week and he threatened to break both my legs. My first thought was Well, it’ll be a couple weeks off work. I was this close to offering him a baseball bat.These shortcomings mean that being a doctor, while you are in theory helping people, is likely to cause you personal harm in the process. Kay missed major events in both his own life and his friends’ lives because of his work schedule. It wreaked havoc on his relationships, both personal and romantic. While the stories in this book are not focused much on his outside life, his jabs at the system and comments here and there about his personal problems weave an underlying narrative of a man who, like so many others in his profession, is being drained by a job that asks too much. We like to think of doctors as being selfless, noble, well-paid, and respected, but in reality, they’re no better off than most of us–and, in many case, actually have it worse.I should have had counseling–in fact, my hospital should have arranged it. But there’s a mutual code of silence that keeps help from those who need it most.And as if the job isn’t enough, another recurring theme throughout the book is when his personal life and career would overlap. Apparently, being a doctor means your friends think you are the person to call and ask about any medical problem they have, never mind that you may specialize in only one area that has literally nothing to do with their issue. Sketchy consultations? Check. Awkward surgery? Been there, done that. Recognized by former patients in public? Yup. Again, it’s a very strange juxtaposition that you don’t often see in other careers, and even the tamer stories in this book are nothing short of eye-opening and revelatory.Quick note: the ending of the book is actually very sad, culminating with the event that made Kay decide to leave medicine and move on to a completely different job (writing comedy, which is what he does now!), and you can probably guess what sort of story that is. Poignant, upsetting, and illuminating the disastrous toll that the medical profession can take on the mental health of practitioners. Though, to be fair, you can tell even from the skillful narration of this book, with pitch-perfect jokes on every page, that humor is more of a strong suit for Kay than medicine ever was. So why not a full five stars? As much as I enjoyed the humor in this book, there were a few moments where I felt like maybe the author took it a little too far. For instance, there was one joke about how being a doctor is more stressful than piloting a plane when a terrorist tries to take over, and there were several sex-related jokes that were more uncomfortable than humorous to me. (That said, there were also quite a few on the same topic that were still incredibly funny, but some missed the mark. I guess that’s going to be the case in most comedy–not every joke is for everyone.)Still, I strongly recommend this one. It makes you laugh, and it makes you think. It is the medical equivalent of the “Don’t Be a Lawyer” song from Crazy Ex-Girlfriend–which is definitely a good thing. And if you're considering going into medicine, this will help make sure you go into it clear-eyed and wholly disillusioned, because yes: this job is going to hurt, in more ways than one.TRIGGER/CONTENT WARNINGS: death of a child, death of a parent, lots of blood, lots of genital-related content (all in a medical context, of course), side character with depressionThank you to the publisher, Little, Brown Spark, for providing me with an eARC of this book via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review!"
133,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9841866-kate-bibliophile-book-club,4,"Not being in the UK, I can’t pass comment on the NHS or any of that, but I had seen plenty of chat about Adam’s book so I loaned it from the library to see what it was like. I am a fan of medical memoirs, so it was right up my street.Adam writes with wit and humour, and even in the worst of situations this levity really makes a difference to the narrative. Doctors see people on the worst days of their lives, but we also see them on the worst days of theirs, even if we don’t realise it. We don’t know what they are going through, but Adam has given an insightful look into his life as a Junior Doctor and just how much it impacted him.I think what I enjoyed the most was the almost conversational aspect of the book. It’s written in diary entries from his time in hospitals, so they are often brief, but some of the entries are very powerful. Others really made me feel for him as his own personal life suffered at the hands of working absolutely crazy hours and nobody could understand why he was missing important events outside of work.I really enjoyed This Is Going To Hurt, even though enjoy seems like the wrong word considering the subject matter, but you know what I mean. Adam Kay has a way with words, and it made this a really easy read. Tough subjects obviously, but he made it more relatable with his affable writing manner.If you enjoy glimpse into the medical profession, and a little humour with your non-fiction the you should most certainly add this one to your list!Recommended!"
134,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10887793-julie,5,"This is the second book I read this year that I wish I had written (and, had I kept a diary, I probably could have - except the horrific penis-related injury I treated was not a de-gloving, but a fracture).I'm a *junior* doctor, and his stories of life, death and everything in between just sound so reassuringly familiar. It's kinda nice to know that somebody else has been there, done that, got the T-shirt and got it stained by blood almost immediately. Relationship breakdown? Check. Missing out on weddings/birthday parties/funerals because you had to be in work? Check. Developing a scathing, sarcastic sense of humour in order to deal with the death, tragedy and pain that constantly surrounds you? Also check.For those who are not medical professionals, I would highly recommend reading it. It sheds a light on a reality that some might not know exists: what goes on behind the scenes and what happens to your doctor on a day-to-day basis (spoiler alert: it ain't all good). And, honestly, we probably need more people to read it if we want to save the NHS."

138,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8378502-barney,2,"I was expecting I'd enjoy this book but I ended up really disliking it. It starts off well with a few funny anecdotes but after a while I realised a lot of them are at the expense of the patient themselves. Yes I am the fun police, and I know humour is a way of coping, but there's something about the thought of a group of doctors chuckling about the time a dementia patient sexually assaulted another patient - and then a group of readers reading that and also chuckling - which doesn't sit well with me.Also we can all agree that doctors deserve absolutely every penny they get and are entitled to far more than they're being paid currently. But there's nothing like someone pre-financial crash describing themselves as poor while also having just bought an apartment and a trip to the Mauritius which just aaaargh really gets under my skin.I couldn't finish the book in the end. I was about half way through and fading fast, only to come across an vignette about the doctor being called in to deliver a new-born 'mid-wank', which ends with him completing the procedure ""still erect"". It was genuinely the most horrifying sentence I have ever read.So yeah, 2 stars but mostly because (even though the book isn't really political itself) its popularity in the UK has contributed to conversations about how hard junior doctors work and how valuable their contributions are to the NHS."

This seems to be a long list of disconnected anecdotes, nothing more, and I'm finding reading former doctor Adam Kay's views on both his patients and colleagues downright upsetting. It's not funny to me at all. I understand that doctors have a hard time (and lets be honest, everyone else working for the NHS currently), that they are nowhere near rewarded enough in a really thankless job, and, yes, I understand that humour is perhaps a coping mechanism in such a stressful job. I'm happy that this book has apparently shed light on the horrific, stressful conditions overworked and poorly recognised medical professionals are working under in the NHS, but personally I cannot read another page of this. I understand he was unhappy in this job and perhaps writing these ""diaries"" was a coping mechanism, but I think... I want to keep the illusion alive that most doctors and other medical professionals would never have such crude and obnoxious thoughts about their patients. Other people have felt very differently about this book (I guess you have to be ok with his very dark sense of humour?), so maybe my extreme reaction is unusual and I'm a little sensitive to this topic, but personally I have no desire to force myself to keep reading something that has made me feel so low."

Dr. Adam Kay does inflict the pain from the many expletives and black humor that erupts all over his readers in this this magnificently crafted detail of being a doctor working for the NHS. Kay offers some true literary therapy when he retells a case of something rather wet happening to a patient’s father and having been put on the spot to explain it to his daughter (with a straight face). We are let into the reality of death rates on the rise when all junior doctors change hospitals and this transition may result in deaths on “Wednesday.” “…I leave them to deal with rectal bleed.…a seventy-year-old lady’s alcohol consumption…notes. I’ve established that wine is her poison. Me: ‘And how much wine do you drink per day, would you say? Patient: ‘bout three bottles on a good day.’ Me: ‘OK . . . And on a bad day?’ Patient: ‘On a bad day I only manage one.”—-Adam Kay, MD""The cadence at times can be chaotic. Commendable that the plasterer who called his wife’s cervical dilation to be exactly 6 cm---and Dr. Kay verifies such. From the mommy to be who presented him with a nine-page birth plan---as if it were the panacea to a novel way to a proper birth. Sadly, she had to part with it due to the epidural that was to be in this pregnant mommy’s new plan. Kay recalls the time he delivered “Satan” out of a woman (as if it were a bane of accomplishment) and wonders had the parents thought of how this name could go down in kindergarten or grade school? Technology found its way into A & E as Adam observes his patient “Facetiming” during a smear. Adam explains the task of finding the womb lacking a little one and instead the finding was just “distended loops of bowel. Sad.Laughter is definitely the progeny from Kay’s utterly sardonic quips that needs no assistance or catalyst to flow. The perils of universal healthcare are evidenced here, and we develop a newfound respect for the prestige and elegance of American medicine and its spotless hospitals, U.S. News Best lists and the cucumber water stations. Deserving mention too are the fresh out of the dryer gowns, on the spot education in E.R. by nurses and tactile care from tall blue-eyed physicians in matching scrubs that smell nothing like these NHS doctors. Five stars indeed. Must read for the curious and those who question things (often). ---Der Titel impliziert viel. Dr. Adam Kay verursacht den Schmerz durch die vielen Sprengsätze und den schwarzen Humor, die überall in seinen Lesern ausbrechen, in diesem großartig gestalteten Detail, ein Arzt zu sein, der für das NHS arbeitet.

Leider musste sie sich aufgrund des Epidurals, das im neuen Plan dieser schwangeren Mutter enthalten sein sollte, davon trennen.

145,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5114433-liz-janet,3,"Interview with author that brought the book to my attention: https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_co...For years I have been watching news comedy shows from the U.K., mostly Mock the Week and Russell Howard’s Good News, and in every series the panel has to dispel the opinions of some member of the conservative government about how the NHS is a cancer and the portrayal of Junior Doctors as money-grabbing and undeserving people who only seek their own wealth. This book is a more direct answer to those politicians who believe they can blatantly lie on television in order to support their budget cuts, told in the diary entries of one of the doctors during his training.Adam Kay takes on the issue with the most amount of British humour he could possibly muster, considering he had some pretty idiotic people pop into hospital, ( including a couple who turned a condom inside out and obviously got pregnant, which isn’t even the worst one) and the evident fact his and his colleagues hard work was being undermined by bureaucrats who would never understand all the work the doctors actually do.“Patient too drowsy to assess.”I pop in. The patient is dead.But the book is not only the comical experience of an overworked man, but an observation on class and the wealth of the state and their influence on the well-being of the population, a remark on the demands these doctors were expected to fulfill, and how all these lead to the detriment of the doctor’s personal lives. A MUST READ!"
146,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80638935-hp-saucerer,4,"In This is Going to Hurt, Adam Kay provides a no-holds-barred account of his time on the front line of the NHS. Through a series of diary entries we begin to see how, under the weight of the huge responsibility placed upon them - with minimal supervision and little pastoral support - doctors are working themselves to exhaustion, crumbling under the strain of an excessive and unmanageable workload. The book reveals a (darker) lesser-known side to the NHS, a service that so many depend on and yet take for granted. I was astonished by the sheer and blatant ineptitude of hospitals when it comes to caring for their staff. How could this be? But then is this really that surprising, given that the junior doctor dispute a few years ago served as a reminder of how little the government value those who are willing to devote most of their working lives to serving the public. (Okay, down from the soap box and back to the actual book)Whilst many of the accounts Kay recalls so candidly are hilarious (the dance floor pessary/pram wheel confusion was a personal favourite), others are horrifying and absolutely heartbreaking. I did find one or two accounts disrespectful and even disparaging; at times Kay appears to be looking for cheap laughs, and here the humour becomes base and a tad infantile. On the whole though, this is a must-read that perfectly captures both the pain and joy of working in close proximity to despair, disease and death every day. Brilliant."

The book spares no details with regard to every aspect of the job; it contains some very graphic accounts of unusual injuries and illnesses that he has come across during his time in medicine, and it also details what it's really like to work for the UK's healthcare system. In addition to its plethora of explicit details, Kay clears up a lot of the misconceptions that people tend to have about doctors, such as doctors being excellent problem solvers, when in fact they are often just following procedures, and junior doctors earning hefty salaries, when in fact they are being paid less than minimum wage for years. ""This Is Going to Hurt"" is an interesting fusion of misery and humor. Although Kay didn't feel human anymore towards the end of his career in medicine, he still managed to see the funny side to some of his experiences in his grueling medical career."
149,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9582364-andrea,4,"This book by Adam Kay came to my attention in an episode of the Diving In podcast, where it was described as laugh-out-loud funny; the kind of book you want to read during a pandemic. I decided to go audio, which is still pretty new to me, and was delighted to find that the author is the narrator. Although it had some dark and/or poignant moments, it delivered the laughs while at the same time opening my eyes to the world of obgyn and the problems of the NHS (UK universal health service). On one hand I think it's a shame that Adam Kay is no longer a doctor, but on the other hand, I think he makes an excellent writer/comedian."

Adam Kay's diaries are quite fun and funny, loaded with a unique brand of dark humor I enjoy. Then as long days, derision, and under-staffing take their toll on him, the book finally takes on a more serious tone and it's really sad how it works out for him and some of his colleagues. I would love to see an American doctor compare his or her experiences with Adam's as I'm sure there are similarities. I do believe UK (junior) doctors struggle with the long hours and low pay a lot longer than in the U.S.A really good book that I recommend."

I am so supportive of the NHS and it’s workers in this country, this book is proof of the amazing work doctors and nurses do for us every single day that a lot of us take for granted.I’ve said it a million times before, but I find comedy in books really hard to connect with and I rarely laugh out loud at books. To begin with, I thought the humour in this one felt a bit forced and I was sure I wasn’t going to enjoy this as much as I’d hoped but soon enough I began really enjoying the humour and found myself outwardly laughing at some of Kay’s anecdotes. I even read some of the passages out loud to Matt, now that’s praise!The writing in this book is really well done. It’s full of wit, sarcasm, and self-deprecating humour while also being filled with some controversial and powerful moments. Told in diary form entry this is a really easy book to speed through, even when it comes to some of the harder hitting moments.Call me heartless, but unlike a lot of others who’ve read this book, I didn’t find myself on the edge of, or even in, tears. There is definitely a fair share of upsetting entries, so be warned but it didn’t hit me as hard as it did others.Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this short read. It light-heartedly highlighted the ever-growing struggles of NHS workers while offering a humorous outlook of working as a junior doctor.

Adam Kay and his colleagues had to deal with weirdly ineffectual decisions coming down the chain-of-command that are spun to send spuriously comforting political messages to the ""folks at home"" rather than merely save money at all costs. When a volunteer translator renders the Punjabi word indicating a chronic bleeder into ""hermaphrodite"" rather than ""hemophiliac,"" it's funny but potentially deadly. When an NHS decision from on high takes away the doctors' sleeping cots, remember that your next deliverer of a C-section may have been on his/her feet for 18 hours. God forbid those lazy malingerers should try to stay alert and refreshed! Adam Kay's writing style is funny, but we can see the humor and patience wearing thin when a hemorrhaging patient splashed blood on his scrubs, pants, expensive CK boxers and manhood underneath. The pay these young physicians received for their herculean efforts is usually pitifully small, and once again the invisible bureaucracy seems to have them in their sights--when the docs switch from the Nike type of trainer (athletic) shoes to the much cheaper Crocs, the brass ban use of Crocs but offer no clothing allowances. It's at this point Kay begins to wonder whether the joy of delivering baby after healthy baby really compensates for the occasional heartbreaking failure, the ridiculous hours, low pay, bureaucratic turgidity that ignores success but comes down hard on trivial infractions, and above all the inability to schedule a social life when everyone seems to be slotted in as backup for everyone else. That last problem really hits the fan when time off the author had been promised for a two-week overseas vacation is nullified by a weekend of duty right in the middle. Nobody's fault, but there's no going AWOL. A couple of notes about the language in this highly entertaining memoir with a high ""can't-put-it-down"" quotient: typically, Kay uses the common four-letter term instead of ""manhood"" above; Yanks who object to profanity may find the use and frequency of it in this book disconcerting. British slang is freely applied, too, but I forgive him all this for his scrupulousness in footnoting medical terms (which he very much intends to be read), so we readers can understand what references like ""trans-vaginal probe"" and ""pre-eclampsia"" and the convoluted acronym ""TAH BSO"" all mean. We readers know from the introduction to this powerful book that Adam Kay eventually left the National Health Service for a turn at comedy. While the National Health Service does not (yet) subject its patients to American-style five- and six-figure bills, we have to wonder about the priorities of any society that rewards gag-writing for telly so much more handsomely than saving the lives of mothers and fetuses. This shocking (but very funny) black-humored account remains a brisk seller on both sides of the Atlantic. Update: August 31, 2018"

There is no real plot or climax or discovery. We are told from the beginning that the health system in the UK is wonderfully free for all but extremely flawed and most medical staff are overworked to the point of gross negligence. So what we are left with in reading these daily diary entries are the proof. The entries are mostly written with a sarcastic punch line each one a story within itself. Each entry is well written. Sometimes humorous. Mostly sarcastic. However it is also shocking, disheartening and sad as well. 3 1/2 to 4 stars."

He also added helpful footnotes to explain any medical terms not familiar with readers.His fascinating account of his life as a doctor was painfully honest, heart-warming and many times hilarious. He explains in great detail his many experiences (including some that made my stomach turn) and the struggles he endured until he got to the point when he made the heart breaking decision to leave his devoted career. Adam's understandable departure from medicine is a great loss to his community and humanity. There are too few doctors with his wit, personality, compassion and devotion.I highly recommend this captivating read!Thank you to NetGalley, author Adam Kay and Little, Brown and Company for an arc of this novel in exchange for my honest review."

It's visceral, funny, and so poignant; what a memoir should be, real commentary on real life. It's unpretentious, as if Adam Kay had come round for a chat and we got to talking about his time as a junior doctor. It's heartbreaking, a love letter to the people who make the NHS such a precious institution, and a retort to those who have bruised it. This is what a memoir should be. An elegy, a time capsule. It's a look at a life we so rarely see, but that we should all work to better understand. One of the best books I've read in a long time. Thanks, Adam. "

Apart from the side-splitting humour, it is an excoriating account of the manifold administration deficiencies throughout the National Health Service, once the jewel in the crown of Britain’s welfare society. The author decided to specialise in ‘obs & gynae’ (known in the medical world as ‘brats and - something I can't repeat here beginning with ‘t’) because you end up with twice as many patients, unlike in geriatrics, and it's a tragi-comedy from there on.You will never look at your hospital doctor the same way after reading this, but I would recommend you do so, rather than turn up in A &E if you can possibly avoid it."

Painfully sad? Excellent validation that I made the right choice in not becoming a doctor? Honestly, all of the above. With candor and a never-ending stream of (often dark) humor, this collection of journal entries by a former medical resident paints a vivid picture of all parts of the medical profession: the funny, the bizarre, the awful, the heartwarming, the disgusting, the personal.First, a brief disclaimer: the original version of this book was published in 2017 in the UK. After its wild success, and comments that it resonated with doctors in other countries as well, who had copies imported from across the pond (or across the globe), someone had the fantastic idea to make a US version of it. You know, change some of the British-isms to American vernacular, add some more context for bits about the British government and health system, and so on. So while this is an ARC for a book releasing in December, it has been around for a while, just in a different form.As is often the case with nonfiction, a summary won’t do you much good here. Basically, Adam Kay decided he wanted to go into medicine somewhat arbitrarily while in high school, because, you know, we expect kids to know what they want to do with the rest of their lives already even when their brains aren’t fully formed yet. Common sense, right? He elected to go into obstetrics and gynecology, having heard that this was the easiest branch to go into. Over his years as a house officer and/or registrar (the UK version of what Americans call a resident and/or intern), he kept a journal of all the goings-on at his place of work. This book is a compilation of those journal entries.Right off the bat, in case I haven’t made it clear enough yet, this book is, in many places, laugh-out-loud hilarious. I had to be careful about reading it in public sometimes for fear that I would burst out in a stupid grin or an actual snort of laughter. Even as he describes his experiences going to hell and back (which is almost a literal definition; he did once deliver a baby named “Sayton,” pronounced like Satan), he manages to infuse all but the most serious moments with snark and self-awareness of the sheer insanity of it all. SCBU (pronounced “Scaboo”) is the Special Care Baby Unit; NICU is the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit; PICU is the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit; and PIKACHU is a type of Pokémon.Seriously, patients do dumb stuff. Objectively, we know this to be true, but you don’t really understand it until you are reading about the doctors who see it all: the things people put up various orifices (a Kinder egg with a wedding ring inside, placed inside a certain part of female anatomy?), the absurd questions they ask, the stupid things they do just to prove a point (yes, there was a literal dick-in-a-fan incident)…it’s hard to comprehend just how insane doctors must think people are until you really see it all in one place. Especially when that one place is narrated by an incredulous physician who peppers the whole thing with footnotes both clarifying points and adding his own opinions.If you describe a grandparent as being old-fashioned, it’s a euphemism for “casually racist.” In a hospital setting, it means “unsupportive.” You’re on your own.That’s not to say that this book is all “hardy-har-har-let’s-laugh-at-medical-nonsense,” though. What makes this book really work, and what keeps it from being a nonstop stream of jokes without real substance, is its recognition of the flaws inherent in the British medical system. To my understanding, many of these flaws are pervasive in medical systems across the globe, too, so this isn’t overly Anglo-centric. The hours are awful, with long shifts that don’t allow for enough sleep. You’re expected to stay for extra hours past the end of your shift if needed, and you don’t get paid overtime for that. Heck, the pay isn’t even that good to begin with. Requesting a day off is rarely going to actually work, as you can (and probably will) still be called in at the last minute.I told a patient that his MRI wouldn’t be until next week and he threatened to break both my legs. My first thought was Well, it’ll be a couple weeks off work. I was this close to offering him a baseball bat.These shortcomings mean that being a doctor, while you are in theory helping people, is likely to cause you personal harm in the process. Kay missed major events in both his own life and his friends’ lives because of his work schedule. It wreaked havoc on his relationships, both personal and romantic. While the stories in this book are not focused much on his outside life, his jabs at the system and comments here and there about his personal problems weave an underlying narrative of a man who, like so many others in his profession, is being drained by a job that asks too much. We like to think of doctors as being selfless, noble, well-paid, and respected, but in reality, they’re no better off than most of us–and, in many case, actually have it worse.I should have had counseling–in fact, my hospital should have arranged it. But there’s a mutual code of silence that keeps help from those who need it most.And as if the job isn’t enough, another recurring theme throughout the book is when his personal life and career would overlap. Apparently, being a doctor means your friends think you are the person to call and ask about any medical problem they have, never mind that you may specialize in only one area that has literally nothing to do with their issue. Sketchy consultations? Check. Awkward surgery? Been there, done that. Recognized by former patients in public? Yup. Again, it’s a very strange juxtaposition that you don’t often see in other careers, and even the tamer stories in this book are nothing short of eye-opening and revelatory.Quick note: the ending of the book is actually very sad, culminating with the event that made Kay decide to leave medicine and move on to a completely different job (writing comedy, which is what he does now!), and you can probably guess what sort of story that is. Poignant, upsetting, and illuminating the disastrous toll that the medical profession can take on the mental health of practitioners. Though, to be fair, you can tell even from the skillful narration of this book, with pitch-perfect jokes on every page, that humor is more of a strong suit for Kay than medicine ever was. So why not a full five stars? As much as I enjoyed the humor in this book, there were a few moments where I felt like maybe the author took it a little too far. For instance, there was one joke about how being a doctor is more stressful than piloting a plane when a terrorist tries to take over, and there were several sex-related jokes that were more uncomfortable than humorous to me. (That said, there were also quite a few on the same topic that were still incredibly funny, but some missed the mark. I guess that’s going to be the case in most comedy–not every joke is for everyone.)Still, I strongly recommend this one. It makes you laugh, and it makes you think. It is the medical equivalent of the “Don’t Be a Lawyer” song from Crazy Ex-Girlfriend–which is definitely a good thing. And if you're considering going into medicine, this will help make sure you go into it clear-eyed and wholly disillusioned, because yes: this job is going to hurt, in more ways than one.TRIGGER/CONTENT WARNINGS: death of a child, death of a parent, lots of blood, lots of genital-related content (all in a medical context, of course), side character with depressionThank you to the publisher, Little, Brown Spark, for providing me with an eARC of this book via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review!"

I am a fan of medical memoirs, so it was right up my street.Adam writes with wit and humour, and even in the worst of situations this levity really makes a difference to the narrative. Doctors see people on the worst days of their lives, but we also see them on the worst days of theirs, even if we don’t realise it. We don’t know what they are going through, but Adam has given an insightful look into his life as a Junior Doctor and just how much it impacted him.I think what I enjoyed the most was the almost conversational aspect of the book. It’s written in diary entries from his time in hospitals, so they are often brief, but some of the entries are very powerful. Others really made me feel for him as his own personal life suffered at the hands of working absolutely crazy hours and nobody could understand why he was missing important events outside of work.I really enjoyed This Is Going To Hurt, even though enjoy seems like the wrong word considering the subject matter, but you know what I mean. Adam Kay has a way with words, and it made this a really easy read. Tough subjects obviously, but he made it more relatable with his affable writing manner.If you enjoy glimpse into the medical profession, and a little humour with your non-fiction the you should most certainly add this one to your list!Recommended!"
164,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10887793-julie,5,"This is the second book I read this year that I wish I had written (and, had I kept a diary, I probably could have - except the horrific penis-related injury I treated was not a de-gloving, but a fracture).I'm a *junior* doctor, and his stories of life, death and everything in between just sound so reassuringly familiar. It's kinda nice to know that somebody else has been there, done that, got the T-shirt and got it stained by blood almost immediately. Relationship breakdown? Check. Missing out on weddings/birthday parties/funerals because you had to be in work? Check. Developing a scathing, sarcastic sense of humour in order to deal with the death, tragedy and pain that constantly surrounds you? Also check.For those who are not medical professionals, I would highly recommend reading it. It sheds a light on a reality that some might not know exists: what goes on behind the scenes and what happens to your doctor on a day-to-day basis (spoiler alert: it ain't all good). And, honestly, we probably need more people to read it if we want to save the NHS."

It starts off well with a few funny anecdotes but after a while I realised a lot of them are at the expense of the patient themselves. Yes I am the fun police, and I know humour is a way of coping, but there's something about the thought of a group of doctors chuckling about the time a dementia patient sexually assaulted another patient - and then a group of readers reading that and also chuckling - which doesn't sit well with me.Also we can all agree that doctors deserve absolutely every penny they get and are entitled to far more than they're being paid currently. But there's nothing like someone pre-financial crash describing themselves as poor while also having just bought an apartment and a trip to the Mauritius which just aaaargh really gets under my skin.I couldn't finish the book in the end. I was about half way through and fading fast, only to come across an vignette about the doctor being called in to deliver a new-born 'mid-wank', which ends with him completing the procedure ""still erect"". It was genuinely the most horrifying sentence I have ever read.So yeah, 2 stars but mostly because (even though the book isn't really political itself) its popularity in the UK has contributed to conversations about how hard junior doctors work and how valuable their contributions are to the NHS."

This seems to be a long list of disconnected anecdotes, nothing more, and I'm finding reading former doctor Adam Kay's views on both his patients and colleagues downright upsetting. It's not funny to me at all. I understand that doctors have a hard time (and lets be honest, everyone else working for the NHS currently), that they are nowhere near rewarded enough in a really thankless job, and, yes, I understand that humour is perhaps a coping mechanism in such a stressful job. I'm happy that this book has apparently shed light on the horrific, stressful conditions overworked and poorly recognised medical professionals are working under in the NHS, but personally I cannot read another page of this. I understand he was unhappy in this job and perhaps writing these ""diaries"" was a coping mechanism, but I think... I want to keep the illusion alive that most doctors and other medical professionals would never have such crude and obnoxious thoughts about their patients. Other people have felt very differently about this book (I guess you have to be ok with his very dark sense of humour?), so maybe my extreme reaction is unusual and I'm a little sensitive to this topic, but personally I have no desire to force myself to keep reading something that has made me feel so low."

Kay offers some true literary therapy when he retells a case of something rather wet happening to a patient’s father and having been put on the spot to explain it to his daughter (with a straight face). We are let into the reality of death rates on the rise when all junior doctors change hospitals and this transition may result in deaths on “Wednesday.” “…I leave them to deal with rectal bleed.…a seventy-year-old lady’s alcohol consumption…notes. I’ve established that wine is her poison. Me: ‘And how much wine do you drink per day, would you say? Patient: ‘bout three bottles on a good day.’ Me: ‘OK . . .

Commendable that the plasterer who called his wife’s cervical dilation to be exactly 6 cm---and Dr. Kay verifies such. From the mommy to be who presented him with a nine-page birth plan---as if it were the panacea to a novel way to a proper birth. Sadly, she had to part with it due to the epidural that was to be in this pregnant mommy’s new plan. Kay recalls the time he delivered “Satan” out of a woman (as if it were a bane of accomplishment) and wonders had the parents thought of how this name could go down in kindergarten or grade school? Technology found its way into A & E as Adam observes his patient “Facetiming” during a smear. Adam explains the task of finding the womb lacking a little one and instead the finding was just “distended loops of bowel. Sad.Laughter is definitely the progeny from Kay’s utterly sardonic quips that needs no assistance or catalyst to flow. The perils of universal healthcare are evidenced here, and we develop a newfound respect for the prestige and elegance of American medicine and its spotless hospitals, U.S. News Best lists and the cucumber water stations. Deserving mention too are the fresh out of the dryer gowns, on the spot education in E.R. by nurses and tactile care from tall blue-eyed physicians in matching scrubs that smell nothing like these NHS doctors.

175,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5114433-liz-janet,3,"Interview with author that brought the book to my attention: https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_co...For years I have been watching news comedy shows from the U.K., mostly Mock the Week and Russell Howard’s Good News, and in every series the panel has to dispel the opinions of some member of the conservative government about how the NHS is a cancer and the portrayal of Junior Doctors as money-grabbing and undeserving people who only seek their own wealth. This book is a more direct answer to those politicians who believe they can blatantly lie on television in order to support their budget cuts, told in the diary entries of one of the doctors during his training.Adam Kay takes on the issue with the most amount of British humour he could possibly muster, considering he had some pretty idiotic people pop into hospital, ( including a couple who turned a condom inside out and obviously got pregnant, which isn’t even the worst one) and the evident fact his and his colleagues hard work was being undermined by bureaucrats who would never understand all the work the doctors actually do.“Patient too drowsy to assess.”I pop in. The patient is dead.But the book is not only the comical experience of an overworked man, but an observation on class and the wealth of the state and their influence on the well-being of the population, a remark on the demands these doctors were expected to fulfill, and how all these lead to the detriment of the doctor’s personal lives. A MUST READ!"
176,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80638935-hp-saucerer,4,"In This is Going to Hurt, Adam Kay provides a no-holds-barred account of his time on the front line of the NHS. Through a series of diary entries we begin to see how, under the weight of the huge responsibility placed upon them - with minimal supervision and little pastoral support - doctors are working themselves to exhaustion, crumbling under the strain of an excessive and unmanageable workload. The book reveals a (darker) lesser-known side to the NHS, a service that so many depend on and yet take for granted. I was astonished by the sheer and blatant ineptitude of hospitals when it comes to caring for their staff. How could this be? But then is this really that surprising, given that the junior doctor dispute a few years ago served as a reminder of how little the government value those who are willing to devote most of their working lives to serving the public. (Okay, down from the soap box and back to the actual book)Whilst many of the accounts Kay recalls so candidly are hilarious (the dance floor pessary/pram wheel confusion was a personal favourite), others are horrifying and absolutely heartbreaking. I did find one or two accounts disrespectful and even disparaging; at times Kay appears to be looking for cheap laughs, and here the humour becomes base and a tad infantile. On the whole though, this is a must-read that perfectly captures both the pain and joy of working in close proximity to despair, disease and death every day. Brilliant."

In addition to its plethora of explicit details, Kay clears up a lot of the misconceptions that people tend to have about doctors, such as doctors being excellent problem solvers, when in fact they are often just following procedures, and junior doctors earning hefty salaries, when in fact they are being paid less than minimum wage for years. ""This Is Going to Hurt"" is an interesting fusion of misery and humor. Although Kay didn't feel human anymore towards the end of his career in medicine, he still managed to see the funny side to some of his experiences in his grueling medical career."
179,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9582364-andrea,4,"This book by Adam Kay came to my attention in an episode of the Diving In podcast, where it was described as laugh-out-loud funny; the kind of book you want to read during a pandemic. I decided to go audio, which is still pretty new to me, and was delighted to find that the author is the narrator. Although it had some dark and/or poignant moments, it delivered the laughs while at the same time opening my eyes to the world of obgyn and the problems of the NHS (UK universal health service). On one hand I think it's a shame that Adam Kay is no longer a doctor, but on the other hand, I think he makes an excellent writer/comedian."
180,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1076079-karen,4,"In this book, set in the UK, it is apparent that undergoing medical training under their National Health System reaps huge emotional rewards (I can do great good), but little else in the way of monetary or personal rewards (I most likely will have to work the day of my own wedding/child's Christening/best friend's funeral). Adam Kay's diaries are quite fun and funny, loaded with a unique brand of dark humor I enjoy. Then as long days, derision, and under-staffing take their toll on him, the book finally takes on a more serious tone and it's really sad how it works out for him and some of his colleagues. I would love to see an American doctor compare his or her experiences with Adam's as I'm sure there are similarities. I do believe UK (junior) doctors struggle with the long hours and low pay a lot longer than in the U.S.A really good book that I recommend."
181,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37830213-zuky-the-bookbum,5,"I’ve never read a book quite like This is Going to Hurt! It was equal parts hilarious, saddening, and eye-opening. I am so supportive of the NHS and it’s workers in this country, this book is proof of the amazing work doctors and nurses do for us every single day that a lot of us take for granted.I’ve said it a million times before, but I find comedy in books really hard to connect with and I rarely laugh out loud at books. To begin with, I thought the humour in this one felt a bit forced and I was sure I wasn’t going to enjoy this as much as I’d hoped but soon enough I began really enjoying the humour and found myself outwardly laughing at some of Kay’s anecdotes. I even read some of the passages out loud to Matt, now that’s praise!The writing in this book is really well done. It’s full of wit, sarcasm, and self-deprecating humour while also being filled with some controversial and powerful moments. Told in diary form entry this is a really easy book to speed through, even when it comes to some of the harder hitting moments.Call me heartless, but unlike a lot of others who’ve read this book, I didn’t find myself on the edge of, or even in, tears. There is definitely a fair share of upsetting entries, so be warned but it didn’t hit me as hard as it did others.Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this short read. It light-heartedly highlighted the ever-growing struggles of NHS workers while offering a humorous outlook of working as a junior doctor. I can also tell you this has put me off having kids for life!"
182,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71792610-renee-godding,5,"4.5/5 starsThis book meant more to me than I was expecting, mostly because of how painfully relatable this when it comes to the reality of the medical profession. I could write a review from the point of view of a medical student/medical intern, who has also been a patient for years, but I’m not sure if I’m up for that right now. Let me know if you would be interested in seeing that in the future though."
183,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58158333-allen,4,"A funny, excoriating memoir about a ""junior"" ob/gyn physician who is ""nervous in the service"" -- not the military, but Britain's National Health Service during recent years of budget retrenchment, 2004 to 2010. Adam Kay and his colleagues had to deal with weirdly ineffectual decisions coming down the chain-of-command that are spun to send spuriously comforting political messages to the ""folks at home"" rather than merely save money at all costs. When a volunteer translator renders the Punjabi word indicating a chronic bleeder into ""hermaphrodite"" rather than ""hemophiliac,"" it's funny but potentially deadly. When an NHS decision from on high takes away the doctors' sleeping cots, remember that your next deliverer of a C-section may have been on his/her feet for 18 hours. God forbid those lazy malingerers should try to stay alert and refreshed! Adam Kay's writing style is funny, but we can see the humor and patience wearing thin when a hemorrhaging patient splashed blood on his scrubs, pants, expensive CK boxers and manhood underneath. The pay these young physicians received for their herculean efforts is usually pitifully small, and once again the invisible bureaucracy seems to have them in their sights--when the docs switch from the Nike type of trainer (athletic) shoes to the much cheaper Crocs, the brass ban use of Crocs but offer no clothing allowances. It's at this point Kay begins to wonder whether the joy of delivering baby after healthy baby really compensates for the occasional heartbreaking failure, the ridiculous hours, low pay, bureaucratic turgidity that ignores success but comes down hard on trivial infractions, and above all the inability to schedule a social life when everyone seems to be slotted in as backup for everyone else. That last problem really hits the fan when time off the author had been promised for a two-week overseas vacation is nullified by a weekend of duty right in the middle. Nobody's fault, but there's no going AWOL. A couple of notes about the language in this highly entertaining memoir with a high ""can't-put-it-down"" quotient: typically, Kay uses the common four-letter term instead of ""manhood"" above; Yanks who object to profanity may find the use and frequency of it in this book disconcerting. British slang is freely applied, too, but I forgive him all this for his scrupulousness in footnoting medical terms (which he very much intends to be read), so we readers can understand what references like ""trans-vaginal probe"" and ""pre-eclampsia"" and the convoluted acronym ""TAH BSO"" all mean. We readers know from the introduction to this powerful book that Adam Kay eventually left the National Health Service for a turn at comedy. While the National Health Service does not (yet) subject its patients to American-style five- and six-figure bills, we have to wonder about the priorities of any society that rewards gag-writing for telly so much more handsomely than saving the lives of mothers and fetuses. This shocking (but very funny) black-humored account remains a brisk seller on both sides of the Atlantic. Update: August 31, 2018"
184,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36511432-paul,4,"First off I was given a wonderful hard copy of this book by the publisher Little, Brown Spark for an honest review.Secondly, I have to say I hope I never end up in an english hospital.This book is a diary and it reads like one. There is no real plot or climax or discovery. We are told from the beginning that the health system in the UK is wonderfully free for all but extremely flawed and most medical staff are overworked to the point of gross negligence. So what we are left with in reading these daily diary entries are the proof. The entries are mostly written with a sarcastic punch line each one a story within itself. Each entry is well written. Sometimes humorous. Mostly sarcastic. However it is also shocking, disheartening and sad as well. 3 1/2 to 4 stars."
185,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1418580-wendy,5,"After reading ""This Is Going To Hurt: Secret Diaries of a Junior Doctor"" by Adam Kay I have a newfound respect for doctors and nurses.Adam Kay was a junior doctor from 2004 until 2010 and this is the diary he kept throughout his training. He also added helpful footnotes to explain any medical terms not familiar with readers.His fascinating account of his life as a doctor was painfully honest, heart-warming and many times hilarious. He explains in great detail his many experiences (including some that made my stomach turn) and the struggles he endured until he got to the point when he made the heart breaking decision to leave his devoted career. Adam's understandable departure from medicine is a great loss to his community and humanity. There are too few doctors with his wit, personality, compassion and devotion.I highly recommend this captivating read!Thank you to NetGalley, author Adam Kay and Little, Brown and Company for an arc of this novel in exchange for my honest review."
186,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7951847-caro-the-helmet-lady,5,Don't get mislead by the seemingly light tone of this book - the author knows when to laugh and get a bit silly and when to be serious and he gives a lot of food for thoughts on the healthcare systems - it seems like in most places in the world they have problems that are too similar... A must read for young idealistic med students.
187,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4074594-kiki,5,"I'm supposed to be taking a break from social media right now, so I'll just say this: I feel better, more whole, more comforted, and more hopeful after reading this book. It's visceral, funny, and so poignant; what a memoir should be, real commentary on real life. It's unpretentious, as if Adam Kay had come round for a chat and we got to talking about his time as a junior doctor. It's heartbreaking, a love letter to the people who make the NHS such a precious institution, and a retort to those who have bruised it. This is what a memoir should be. An elegy, a time capsule. It's a look at a life we so rarely see, but that we should all work to better understand. One of the best books I've read in a long time. Thanks, Adam. "

Picked up at the airport and polished off within the day.There were numerous laugh out loud moments which I suspect may have disturbed the people around me in the airport. Many of these involved, ahem, ""introduced objects"" which sadly shows you my level. And there was me thinking that the TV remote control was just for switching channels.Well worth a read."
189,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17465866-anni,5,"The Best MedicineWell, you may not die laughing, but I was certainly in stitches and convulsed with hysterics, not to mention emotionally distraught, reading this diary of a junior doctor‘s training in the NHS. Apart from the side-splitting humour, it is an excoriating account of the manifold administration deficiencies throughout the National Health Service, once the jewel in the crown of Britain’s welfare society. The author decided to specialise in ‘obs & gynae’ (known in the medical world as ‘brats and - something I can't repeat here beginning with ‘t’) because you end up with twice as many patients, unlike in geriatrics, and it's a tragi-comedy from there on.You will never look at your hospital doctor the same way after reading this, but I would recommend you do so, rather than turn up in A &E if you can possibly avoid it."

Painfully sad? Excellent validation that I made the right choice in not becoming a doctor? Honestly, all of the above. With candor and a never-ending stream of (often dark) humor, this collection of journal entries by a former medical resident paints a vivid picture of all parts of the medical profession: the funny, the bizarre, the awful, the heartwarming, the disgusting, the personal.First, a brief disclaimer: the original version of this book was published in 2017 in the UK. After its wild success, and comments that it resonated with doctors in other countries as well, who had copies imported from across the pond (or across the globe), someone had the fantastic idea to make a US version of it. You know, change some of the British-isms to American vernacular, add some more context for bits about the British government and health system, and so on. So while this is an ARC for a book releasing in December, it has been around for a while, just in a different form.As is often the case with nonfiction, a summary won’t do you much good here. Basically, Adam Kay decided he wanted to go into medicine somewhat arbitrarily while in high school, because, you know, we expect kids to know what they want to do with the rest of their lives already even when their brains aren’t fully formed yet. Common sense, right? He elected to go into obstetrics and gynecology, having heard that this was the easiest branch to go into. Over his years as a house officer and/or registrar (the UK version of what Americans call a resident and/or intern), he kept a journal of all the goings-on at his place of work. This book is a compilation of those journal entries.Right off the bat, in case I haven’t made it clear enough yet, this book is, in many places, laugh-out-loud hilarious. I had to be careful about reading it in public sometimes for fear that I would burst out in a stupid grin or an actual snort of laughter. Even as he describes his experiences going to hell and back (which is almost a literal definition; he did once deliver a baby named “Sayton,” pronounced like Satan), he manages to infuse all but the most serious moments with snark and self-awareness of the sheer insanity of it all. SCBU (pronounced “Scaboo”) is the Special Care Baby Unit; NICU is the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit; PICU is the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit; and PIKACHU is a type of Pokémon.Seriously, patients do dumb stuff. Objectively, we know this to be true, but you don’t really understand it until you are reading about the doctors who see it all: the things people put up various orifices (a Kinder egg with a wedding ring inside, placed inside a certain part of female anatomy?), the absurd questions they ask, the stupid things they do just to prove a point (yes, there was a literal dick-in-a-fan incident)…it’s hard to comprehend just how insane doctors must think people are until you really see it all in one place. Especially when that one place is narrated by an incredulous physician who peppers the whole thing with footnotes both clarifying points and adding his own opinions.If you describe a grandparent as being old-fashioned, it’s a euphemism for “casually racist.” In a hospital setting, it means “unsupportive.” You’re on your own.That’s not to say that this book is all “hardy-har-har-let’s-laugh-at-medical-nonsense,” though. What makes this book really work, and what keeps it from being a nonstop stream of jokes without real substance, is its recognition of the flaws inherent in the British medical system. To my understanding, many of these flaws are pervasive in medical systems across the globe, too, so this isn’t overly Anglo-centric. The hours are awful, with long shifts that don’t allow for enough sleep. You’re expected to stay for extra hours past the end of your shift if needed, and you don’t get paid overtime for that. Heck, the pay isn’t even that good to begin with. Requesting a day off is rarely going to actually work, as you can (and probably will) still be called in at the last minute.I told a patient that his MRI wouldn’t be until next week and he threatened to break both my legs. My first thought was Well, it’ll be a couple weeks off work. I was this close to offering him a baseball bat.These shortcomings mean that being a doctor, while you are in theory helping people, is likely to cause you personal harm in the process. Kay missed major events in both his own life and his friends’ lives because of his work schedule. It wreaked havoc on his relationships, both personal and romantic. While the stories in this book are not focused much on his outside life, his jabs at the system and comments here and there about his personal problems weave an underlying narrative of a man who, like so many others in his profession, is being drained by a job that asks too much. We like to think of doctors as being selfless, noble, well-paid, and respected, but in reality, they’re no better off than most of us–and, in many case, actually have it worse.I should have had counseling–in fact, my hospital should have arranged it. But there’s a mutual code of silence that keeps help from those who need it most.And as if the job isn’t enough, another recurring theme throughout the book is when his personal life and career would overlap. Apparently, being a doctor means your friends think you are the person to call and ask about any medical problem they have, never mind that you may specialize in only one area that has literally nothing to do with their issue. Sketchy consultations? Check. Awkward surgery? Been there, done that. Recognized by former patients in public? Yup. Again, it’s a very strange juxtaposition that you don’t often see in other careers, and even the tamer stories in this book are nothing short of eye-opening and revelatory.Quick note: the ending of the book is actually very sad, culminating with the event that made Kay decide to leave medicine and move on to a completely different job (writing comedy, which is what he does now!), and you can probably guess what sort of story that is. Poignant, upsetting, and illuminating the disastrous toll that the medical profession can take on the mental health of practitioners. Though, to be fair, you can tell even from the skillful narration of this book, with pitch-perfect jokes on every page, that humor is more of a strong suit for Kay than medicine ever was. So why not a full five stars? As much as I enjoyed the humor in this book, there were a few moments where I felt like maybe the author took it a little too far. For instance, there was one joke about how being a doctor is more stressful than piloting a plane when a terrorist tries to take over, and there were several sex-related jokes that were more uncomfortable than humorous to me. (That said, there were also quite a few on the same topic that were still incredibly funny, but some missed the mark. I guess that’s going to be the case in most comedy–not every joke is for everyone.)Still, I strongly recommend this one. It makes you laugh, and it makes you think. It is the medical equivalent of the “Don’t Be a Lawyer” song from Crazy Ex-Girlfriend–which is definitely a good thing. And if you're considering going into medicine, this will help make sure you go into it clear-eyed and wholly disillusioned, because yes: this job is going to hurt, in more ways than one.TRIGGER/CONTENT WARNINGS: death of a child, death of a parent, lots of blood, lots of genital-related content (all in a medical context, of course), side character with depressionThank you to the publisher, Little, Brown Spark, for providing me with an eARC of this book via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review!"

I am a fan of medical memoirs, so it was right up my street.Adam writes with wit and humour, and even in the worst of situations this levity really makes a difference to the narrative. Doctors see people on the worst days of their lives, but we also see them on the worst days of theirs, even if we don’t realise it. We don’t know what they are going through, but Adam has given an insightful look into his life as a Junior Doctor and just how much it impacted him.I think what I enjoyed the most was the almost conversational aspect of the book. It’s written in diary entries from his time in hospitals, so they are often brief, but some of the entries are very powerful. Others really made me feel for him as his own personal life suffered at the hands of working absolutely crazy hours and nobody could understand why he was missing important events outside of work.I really enjoyed This Is Going To Hurt, even though enjoy seems like the wrong word considering the subject matter, but you know what I mean. Adam Kay has a way with words, and it made this a really easy read. Tough subjects obviously, but he made it more relatable with his affable writing manner.If you enjoy glimpse into the medical profession, and a little humour with your non-fiction the you should most certainly add this one to your list!Recommended!"

It's kinda nice to know that somebody else has been there, done that, got the T-shirt and got it stained by blood almost immediately. Relationship breakdown? Check. Missing out on weddings/birthday parties/funerals because you had to be in work? Check. Developing a scathing, sarcastic sense of humour in order to deal with the death, tragedy and pain that constantly surrounds you? Also check.For those who are not medical professionals, I would highly recommend reading it. It sheds a light on a reality that some might not know exists: what goes on behind the scenes and what happens to your doctor on a day-to-day basis (spoiler alert: it ain't all good). And, honestly, we probably need more people to read it if we want to save the NHS."

It starts off well with a few funny anecdotes but after a while I realised a lot of them are at the expense of the patient themselves. Yes I am the fun police, and I know humour is a way of coping, but there's something about the thought of a group of doctors chuckling about the time a dementia patient sexually assaulted another patient - and then a group of readers reading that and also chuckling - which doesn't sit well with me.Also we can all agree that doctors deserve absolutely every penny they get and are entitled to far more than they're being paid currently. But there's nothing like someone pre-financial crash describing themselves as poor while also having just bought an apartment and a trip to the Mauritius which just aaaargh really gets under my skin.I couldn't finish the book in the end. I was about half way through and fading fast, only to come across an vignette about the doctor being called in to deliver a new-born 'mid-wank', which ends with him completing the procedure ""still erect"". It was genuinely the most horrifying sentence I have ever read.So yeah, 2 stars but mostly because (even though the book isn't really political itself) its popularity in the UK has contributed to conversations about how hard junior doctors work and how valuable their contributions are to the NHS."

This seems to be a long list of disconnected anecdotes, nothing more, and I'm finding reading former doctor Adam Kay's views on both his patients and colleagues downright upsetting. It's not funny to me at all. I understand that doctors have a hard time (and lets be honest, everyone else working for the NHS currently), that they are nowhere near rewarded enough in a really thankless job, and, yes, I understand that humour is perhaps a coping mechanism in such a stressful job. I'm happy that this book has apparently shed light on the horrific, stressful conditions overworked and poorly recognised medical professionals are working under in the NHS, but personally I cannot read another page of this. I understand he was unhappy in this job and perhaps writing these ""diaries"" was a coping mechanism, but I think... I want to keep the illusion alive that most doctors and other medical professionals would never have such crude and obnoxious thoughts about their patients. Other people have felt very differently about this book (I guess you have to be ok with his very dark sense of humour?), so maybe my extreme reaction is unusual and I'm a little sensitive to this topic, but personally I have no desire to force myself to keep reading something that has made me feel so low."

Dr. Adam Kay does inflict the pain from the many expletives and black humor that erupts all over his readers in this this magnificently crafted detail of being a doctor working for the NHS. Kay offers some true literary therapy when he retells a case of something rather wet happening to a patient’s father and having been put on the spot to explain it to his daughter (with a straight face). We are let into the reality of death rates on the rise when all junior doctors change hospitals and this transition may result in deaths on “Wednesday.” “…I leave them to deal with rectal bleed.…a seventy-year-old lady’s alcohol consumption…notes. I’ve established that wine is her poison. Me: ‘And how much wine do you drink per day, would you say? Patient: ‘bout three bottles on a good day.’ Me: ‘OK . . .

Commendable that the plasterer who called his wife’s cervical dilation to be exactly 6 cm---and Dr. Kay verifies such. From the mommy to be who presented him with a nine-page birth plan---as if it were the panacea to a novel way to a proper birth. Sadly, she had to part with it due to the epidural that was to be in this pregnant mommy’s new plan. Kay recalls the time he delivered “Satan” out of a woman (as if it were a bane of accomplishment) and wonders had the parents thought of how this name could go down in kindergarten or grade school? Technology found its way into A & E as Adam observes his patient “Facetiming” during a smear. Adam explains the task of finding the womb lacking a little one and instead the finding was just “distended loops of bowel. Sad.Laughter is definitely the progeny from Kay’s utterly sardonic quips that needs no assistance or catalyst to flow. The perils of universal healthcare are evidenced here, and we develop a newfound respect for the prestige and elegance of American medicine and its spotless hospitals, U.S. News Best lists and the cucumber water stations. Deserving mention too are the fresh out of the dryer gowns, on the spot education in E.R. by nurses and tactile care from tall blue-eyed physicians in matching scrubs that smell nothing like these NHS doctors.

Kay erinnert sich an die Zeit, als er einer Frau „Satan“ entließ (als wäre es ein Fluch der Leistung), und fragte sich, ob die Eltern darüber nachgedacht hatten, wie dieser Name im Kindergarten oder in der Grundschule untergehen könnte. Die Technologie fand ihren Weg in A & E, als Adam seinen Patienten während eines Abstrichs beim „Facetiming“ beobachtet. Adam erklärt die Aufgabe, den Mutterleib zu finden, dem ein kleiner fehlt, und stattdessen war der Befund nur „ausgedehnte Darmschleifen. Traurig.Lachen ist definitiv die Nachkommenschaft von Kays absolut sardonischen Sprüchen, die keine Unterstützung oder Katalysator benötigen, um zu fließen. Die Gefahren der allgemeinen Gesundheitsversorgung werden hier deutlich, und wir entwickeln einen neu entdeckten Respekt für das Prestige und die Eleganz der amerikanischen Medizin und ihrer makellosen Krankenhäuser, der Bestlisten der US-Nachrichten und der Gurkenwasserstationen. Erwähnenswert sind auch die frisch aus den Trocknerkleidern stammenden, vor Ort in E. R. durchgeführten Schulungen durch Krankenschwestern sowie Ratschläge und taktile Betreuung durch große blauäugige Experten in passenden Peelings, die nicht nach diesen NHS-Ärzten riechen. Fünf Sterne in der Tat. Muss für Neugierige und diejenigen lesen, die Dinge (oft) hinterfragen."
205,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5114433-liz-janet,3,"Interview with author that brought the book to my attention: https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_co...For years I have been watching news comedy shows from the U.K., mostly Mock the Week and Russell Howard’s Good News, and in every series the panel has to dispel the opinions of some member of the conservative government about how the NHS is a cancer and the portrayal of Junior Doctors as money-grabbing and undeserving people who only seek their own wealth. This book is a more direct answer to those politicians who believe they can blatantly lie on television in order to support their budget cuts, told in the diary entries of one of the doctors during his training.Adam Kay takes on the issue with the most amount of British humour he could possibly muster, considering he had some pretty idiotic people pop into hospital, ( including a couple who turned a condom inside out and obviously got pregnant, which isn’t even the worst one) and the evident fact his and his colleagues hard work was being undermined by bureaucrats who would never understand all the work the doctors actually do.“Patient too drowsy to assess.”I pop in. The patient is dead.But the book is not only the comical experience of an overworked man, but an observation on class and the wealth of the state and their influence on the well-being of the population, a remark on the demands these doctors were expected to fulfill, and how all these lead to the detriment of the doctor’s personal lives. A MUST READ!"
206,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80638935-hp-saucerer,4,"In This is Going to Hurt, Adam Kay provides a no-holds-barred account of his time on the front line of the NHS. Through a series of diary entries we begin to see how, under the weight of the huge responsibility placed upon them - with minimal supervision and little pastoral support - doctors are working themselves to exhaustion, crumbling under the strain of an excessive and unmanageable workload. The book reveals a (darker) lesser-known side to the NHS, a service that so many depend on and yet take for granted. I was astonished by the sheer and blatant ineptitude of hospitals when it comes to caring for their staff. How could this be? But then is this really that surprising, given that the junior doctor dispute a few years ago served as a reminder of how little the government value those who are willing to devote most of their working lives to serving the public. (Okay, down from the soap box and back to the actual book)Whilst many of the accounts Kay recalls so candidly are hilarious (the dance floor pessary/pram wheel confusion was a personal favourite), others are horrifying and absolutely heartbreaking. I did find one or two accounts disrespectful and even disparaging; at times Kay appears to be looking for cheap laughs, and here the humour becomes base and a tad infantile. On the whole though, this is a must-read that perfectly captures both the pain and joy of working in close proximity to despair, disease and death every day. Brilliant."

208,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66513638-gtf,5,"'This Is Going To Hurt"" is a brilliant memoir of Adam Kay's career as a junior doctor. The book spares no details with regard to every aspect of the job; it contains some very graphic accounts of unusual injuries and illnesses that he has come across during his time in medicine, and it also details what it's really like to work for the UK's healthcare system. In addition to its plethora of explicit details, Kay clears up a lot of the misconceptions that people tend to have about doctors, such as doctors being excellent problem solvers, when in fact they are often just following procedures, and junior doctors earning hefty salaries, when in fact they are being paid less than minimum wage for years. ""This Is Going to Hurt"" is an interesting fusion of misery and humor. Although Kay didn't feel human anymore towards the end of his career in medicine, he still managed to see the funny side to some of his experiences in his grueling medical career."
209,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9582364-andrea,4,"This book by Adam Kay came to my attention in an episode of the Diving In podcast, where it was described as laugh-out-loud funny; the kind of book you want to read during a pandemic. I decided to go audio, which is still pretty new to me, and was delighted to find that the author is the narrator. Although it had some dark and/or poignant moments, it delivered the laughs while at the same time opening my eyes to the world of obgyn and the problems of the NHS (UK universal health service). On one hand I think it's a shame that Adam Kay is no longer a doctor, but on the other hand, I think he makes an excellent writer/comedian."
210,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1076079-karen,4,"In this book, set in the UK, it is apparent that undergoing medical training under their National Health System reaps huge emotional rewards (I can do great good), but little else in the way of monetary or personal rewards (I most likely will have to work the day of my own wedding/child's Christening/best friend's funeral). Adam Kay's diaries are quite fun and funny, loaded with a unique brand of dark humor I enjoy. Then as long days, derision, and under-staffing take their toll on him, the book finally takes on a more serious tone and it's really sad how it works out for him and some of his colleagues. I would love to see an American doctor compare his or her experiences with Adam's as I'm sure there are similarities. I do believe UK (junior) doctors struggle with the long hours and low pay a lot longer than in the U.S.A really good book that I recommend."

I am so supportive of the NHS and it’s workers in this country, this book is proof of the amazing work doctors and nurses do for us every single day that a lot of us take for granted.I’ve said it a million times before, but I find comedy in books really hard to connect with and I rarely laugh out loud at books. To begin with, I thought the humour in this one felt a bit forced and I was sure I wasn’t going to enjoy this as much as I’d hoped but soon enough I began really enjoying the humour and found myself outwardly laughing at some of Kay’s anecdotes. I even read some of the passages out loud to Matt, now that’s praise!The writing in this book is really well done. It’s full of wit, sarcasm, and self-deprecating humour while also being filled with some controversial and powerful moments. Told in diary form entry this is a really easy book to speed through, even when it comes to some of the harder hitting moments.Call me heartless, but unlike a lot of others who’ve read this book, I didn’t find myself on the edge of, or even in, tears. There is definitely a fair share of upsetting entries, so be warned but it didn’t hit me as hard as it did others.Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this short read. It light-heartedly highlighted the ever-growing struggles of NHS workers while offering a humorous outlook of working as a junior doctor. I can also tell you this has put me off having kids for life!"

Let me know if you would be interested in seeing that in the future though."
213,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58158333-allen,4,"A funny, excoriating memoir about a ""junior"" ob/gyn physician who is ""nervous in the service"" -- not the military, but Britain's National Health Service during recent years of budget retrenchment, 2004 to 2010. Adam Kay and his colleagues had to deal with weirdly ineffectual decisions coming down the chain-of-command that are spun to send spuriously comforting political messages to the ""folks at home"" rather than merely save money at all costs. When a volunteer translator renders the Punjabi word indicating a chronic bleeder into ""hermaphrodite"" rather than ""hemophiliac,"" it's funny but potentially deadly. When an NHS decision from on high takes away the doctors' sleeping cots, remember that your next deliverer of a C-section may have been on his/her feet for 18 hours. God forbid those lazy malingerers should try to stay alert and refreshed! Adam Kay's writing style is funny, but we can see the humor and patience wearing thin when a hemorrhaging patient splashed blood on his scrubs, pants, expensive CK boxers and manhood underneath. The pay these young physicians received for their herculean efforts is usually pitifully small, and once again the invisible bureaucracy seems to have them in their sights--when the docs switch from the Nike type of trainer (athletic) shoes to the much cheaper Crocs, the brass ban use of Crocs but offer no clothing allowances. It's at this point Kay begins to wonder whether the joy of delivering baby after healthy baby really compensates for the occasional heartbreaking failure, the ridiculous hours, low pay, bureaucratic turgidity that ignores success but comes down hard on trivial infractions, and above all the inability to schedule a social life when everyone seems to be slotted in as backup for everyone else. That last problem really hits the fan when time off the author had been promised for a two-week overseas vacation is nullified by a weekend of duty right in the middle. Nobody's fault, but there's no going AWOL. A couple of notes about the language in this highly entertaining memoir with a high ""can't-put-it-down"" quotient: typically, Kay uses the common four-letter term instead of ""manhood"" above; Yanks who object to profanity may find the use and frequency of it in this book disconcerting. British slang is freely applied, too, but I forgive him all this for his scrupulousness in footnoting medical terms (which he very much intends to be read), so we readers can understand what references like ""trans-vaginal probe"" and ""pre-eclampsia"" and the convoluted acronym ""TAH BSO"" all mean. We readers know from the introduction to this powerful book that Adam Kay eventually left the National Health Service for a turn at comedy. While the National Health Service does not (yet) subject its patients to American-style five- and six-figure bills, we have to wonder about the priorities of any society that rewards gag-writing for telly so much more handsomely than saving the lives of mothers and fetuses. This shocking (but very funny) black-humored account remains a brisk seller on both sides of the Atlantic. Update: August 31, 2018"

There is no real plot or climax or discovery. We are told from the beginning that the health system in the UK is wonderfully free for all but extremely flawed and most medical staff are overworked to the point of gross negligence. So what we are left with in reading these daily diary entries are the proof. The entries are mostly written with a sarcastic punch line each one a story within itself. Each entry is well written. Sometimes humorous. Mostly sarcastic. However it is also shocking, disheartening and sad as well. 3 1/2 to 4 stars."

He also added helpful footnotes to explain any medical terms not familiar with readers.His fascinating account of his life as a doctor was painfully honest, heart-warming and many times hilarious. He explains in great detail his many experiences (including some that made my stomach turn) and the struggles he endured until he got to the point when he made the heart breaking decision to leave his devoted career. Adam's understandable departure from medicine is a great loss to his community and humanity. There are too few doctors with his wit, personality, compassion and devotion.I highly recommend this captivating read!Thank you to NetGalley, author Adam Kay and Little, Brown and Company for an arc of this novel in exchange for my honest review."

A must read for young idealistic med students.
217,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4074594-kiki,5,"I'm supposed to be taking a break from social media right now, so I'll just say this: I feel better, more whole, more comforted, and more hopeful after reading this book. It's visceral, funny, and so poignant; what a memoir should be, real commentary on real life. It's unpretentious, as if Adam Kay had come round for a chat and we got to talking about his time as a junior doctor. It's heartbreaking, a love letter to the people who make the NHS such a precious institution, and a retort to those who have bruised it. This is what a memoir should be. An elegy, a time capsule. It's a look at a life we so rarely see, but that we should all work to better understand. One of the best books I've read in a long time. Thanks, Adam. "

Apart from the side-splitting humour, it is an excoriating account of the manifold administration deficiencies throughout the National Health Service, once the jewel in the crown of Britain’s welfare society. The author decided to specialise in ‘obs & gynae’ (known in the medical world as ‘brats and - something I can't repeat here beginning with ‘t’) because you end up with twice as many patients, unlike in geriatrics, and it's a tragi-comedy from there on.You will never look at your hospital doctor the same way after reading this, but I would recommend you do so, rather than turn up in A &E if you can possibly avoid it."

Painfully sad? Excellent validation that I made the right choice in not becoming a doctor? Honestly, all of the above. With candor and a never-ending stream of (often dark) humor, this collection of journal entries by a former medical resident paints a vivid picture of all parts of the medical profession: the funny, the bizarre, the awful, the heartwarming, the disgusting, the personal.First, a brief disclaimer: the original version of this book was published in 2017 in the UK. After its wild success, and comments that it resonated with doctors in other countries as well, who had copies imported from across the pond (or across the globe), someone had the fantastic idea to make a US version of it. You know, change some of the British-isms to American vernacular, add some more context for bits about the British government and health system, and so on. So while this is an ARC for a book releasing in December, it has been around for a while, just in a different form.As is often the case with nonfiction, a summary won’t do you much good here. Basically, Adam Kay decided he wanted to go into medicine somewhat arbitrarily while in high school, because, you know, we expect kids to know what they want to do with the rest of their lives already even when their brains aren’t fully formed yet. Common sense, right? He elected to go into obstetrics and gynecology, having heard that this was the easiest branch to go into. Over his years as a house officer and/or registrar (the UK version of what Americans call a resident and/or intern), he kept a journal of all the goings-on at his place of work. This book is a compilation of those journal entries.Right off the bat, in case I haven’t made it clear enough yet, this book is, in many places, laugh-out-loud hilarious. I had to be careful about reading it in public sometimes for fear that I would burst out in a stupid grin or an actual snort of laughter. Even as he describes his experiences going to hell and back (which is almost a literal definition; he did once deliver a baby named “Sayton,” pronounced like Satan), he manages to infuse all but the most serious moments with snark and self-awareness of the sheer insanity of it all. SCBU (pronounced “Scaboo”) is the Special Care Baby Unit; NICU is the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit; PICU is the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit; and PIKACHU is a type of Pokémon.Seriously, patients do dumb stuff. Objectively, we know this to be true, but you don’t really understand it until you are reading about the doctors who see it all: the things people put up various orifices (a Kinder egg with a wedding ring inside, placed inside a certain part of female anatomy?), the absurd questions they ask, the stupid things they do just to prove a point (yes, there was a literal dick-in-a-fan incident)…it’s hard to comprehend just how insane doctors must think people are until you really see it all in one place. Especially when that one place is narrated by an incredulous physician who peppers the whole thing with footnotes both clarifying points and adding his own opinions.If you describe a grandparent as being old-fashioned, it’s a euphemism for “casually racist.” In a hospital setting, it means “unsupportive.” You’re on your own.That’s not to say that this book is all “hardy-har-har-let’s-laugh-at-medical-nonsense,” though. What makes this book really work, and what keeps it from being a nonstop stream of jokes without real substance, is its recognition of the flaws inherent in the British medical system. To my understanding, many of these flaws are pervasive in medical systems across the globe, too, so this isn’t overly Anglo-centric. The hours are awful, with long shifts that don’t allow for enough sleep. You’re expected to stay for extra hours past the end of your shift if needed, and you don’t get paid overtime for that. Heck, the pay isn’t even that good to begin with. Requesting a day off is rarely going to actually work, as you can (and probably will) still be called in at the last minute.I told a patient that his MRI wouldn’t be until next week and he threatened to break both my legs. My first thought was Well, it’ll be a couple weeks off work. I was this close to offering him a baseball bat.These shortcomings mean that being a doctor, while you are in theory helping people, is likely to cause you personal harm in the process. Kay missed major events in both his own life and his friends’ lives because of his work schedule. It wreaked havoc on his relationships, both personal and romantic. While the stories in this book are not focused much on his outside life, his jabs at the system and comments here and there about his personal problems weave an underlying narrative of a man who, like so many others in his profession, is being drained by a job that asks too much. We like to think of doctors as being selfless, noble, well-paid, and respected, but in reality, they’re no better off than most of us–and, in many case, actually have it worse.I should have had counseling–in fact, my hospital should have arranged it. But there’s a mutual code of silence that keeps help from those who need it most.And as if the job isn’t enough, another recurring theme throughout the book is when his personal life and career would overlap. Apparently, being a doctor means your friends think you are the person to call and ask about any medical problem they have, never mind that you may specialize in only one area that has literally nothing to do with their issue. Sketchy consultations? Check. Awkward surgery? Been there, done that. Recognized by former patients in public? Yup. Again, it’s a very strange juxtaposition that you don’t often see in other careers, and even the tamer stories in this book are nothing short of eye-opening and revelatory.Quick note: the ending of the book is actually very sad, culminating with the event that made Kay decide to leave medicine and move on to a completely different job (writing comedy, which is what he does now!), and you can probably guess what sort of story that is. Poignant, upsetting, and illuminating the disastrous toll that the medical profession can take on the mental health of practitioners. Though, to be fair, you can tell even from the skillful narration of this book, with pitch-perfect jokes on every page, that humor is more of a strong suit for Kay than medicine ever was. So why not a full five stars? As much as I enjoyed the humor in this book, there were a few moments where I felt like maybe the author took it a little too far. For instance, there was one joke about how being a doctor is more stressful than piloting a plane when a terrorist tries to take over, and there were several sex-related jokes that were more uncomfortable than humorous to me. (That said, there were also quite a few on the same topic that were still incredibly funny, but some missed the mark. I guess that’s going to be the case in most comedy–not every joke is for everyone.)Still, I strongly recommend this one. It makes you laugh, and it makes you think. It is the medical equivalent of the “Don’t Be a Lawyer” song from Crazy Ex-Girlfriend–which is definitely a good thing. And if you're considering going into medicine, this will help make sure you go into it clear-eyed and wholly disillusioned, because yes: this job is going to hurt, in more ways than one.TRIGGER/CONTENT WARNINGS: death of a child, death of a parent, lots of blood, lots of genital-related content (all in a medical context, of course), side character with depressionThank you to the publisher, Little, Brown Spark, for providing me with an eARC of this book via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review!"

I am a fan of medical memoirs, so it was right up my street.Adam writes with wit and humour, and even in the worst of situations this levity really makes a difference to the narrative. Doctors see people on the worst days of their lives, but we also see them on the worst days of theirs, even if we don’t realise it. We don’t know what they are going through, but Adam has given an insightful look into his life as a Junior Doctor and just how much it impacted him.I think what I enjoyed the most was the almost conversational aspect of the book. It’s written in diary entries from his time in hospitals, so they are often brief, but some of the entries are very powerful. Others really made me feel for him as his own personal life suffered at the hands of working absolutely crazy hours and nobody could understand why he was missing important events outside of work.I really enjoyed This Is Going To Hurt, even though enjoy seems like the wrong word considering the subject matter, but you know what I mean. Adam Kay has a way with words, and it made this a really easy read. Tough subjects obviously, but he made it more relatable with his affable writing manner.If you enjoy glimpse into the medical profession, and a little humour with your non-fiction the you should most certainly add this one to your list!Recommended!"

It's kinda nice to know that somebody else has been there, done that, got the T-shirt and got it stained by blood almost immediately. Relationship breakdown? Check. Missing out on weddings/birthday parties/funerals because you had to be in work? Check. Developing a scathing, sarcastic sense of humour in order to deal with the death, tragedy and pain that constantly surrounds you? Also check.For those who are not medical professionals, I would highly recommend reading it. It sheds a light on a reality that some might not know exists: what goes on behind the scenes and what happens to your doctor on a day-to-day basis (spoiler alert: it ain't all good).

It starts off well with a few funny anecdotes but after a while I realised a lot of them are at the expense of the patient themselves. Yes I am the fun police, and I know humour is a way of coping, but there's something about the thought of a group of doctors chuckling about the time a dementia patient sexually assaulted another patient - and then a group of readers reading that and also chuckling - which doesn't sit well with me.Also we can all agree that doctors deserve absolutely every penny they get and are entitled to far more than they're being paid currently. But there's nothing like someone pre-financial crash describing themselves as poor while also having just bought an apartment and a trip to the Mauritius which just aaaargh really gets under my skin.I couldn't finish the book in the end. I was about half way through and fading fast, only to come across an vignette about the doctor being called in to deliver a new-born 'mid-wank', which ends with him completing the procedure ""still erect"". It was genuinely the most horrifying sentence I have ever read.So yeah, 2 stars but mostly because (even though the book isn't really political itself) its popularity in the UK has contributed to conversations about how hard junior doctors work and how valuable their contributions are to the NHS."

This seems to be a long list of disconnected anecdotes, nothing more, and I'm finding reading former doctor Adam Kay's views on both his patients and colleagues downright upsetting. It's not funny to me at all. I understand that doctors have a hard time (and lets be honest, everyone else working for the NHS currently), that they are nowhere near rewarded enough in a really thankless job, and, yes, I understand that humour is perhaps a coping mechanism in such a stressful job. I'm happy that this book has apparently shed light on the horrific, stressful conditions overworked and poorly recognised medical professionals are working under in the NHS, but personally I cannot read another page of this. I understand he was unhappy in this job and perhaps writing these ""diaries"" was a coping mechanism, but I think... I want to keep the illusion alive that most doctors and other medical professionals would never have such crude and obnoxious thoughts about their patients. Other people have felt very differently about this book (I guess you have to be ok with his very dark sense of humour?), so maybe my extreme reaction is unusual and I'm a little sensitive to this topic, but personally I have no desire to force myself to keep reading something that has made me feel so low."

234,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24882791-india-m-clamp,5,"The title implies much. Dr. Adam Kay does inflict the pain from the many expletives and black humor that erupts all over his readers in this this magnificently crafted detail of being a doctor working for the NHS. Kay offers some true literary therapy when he retells a case of something rather wet happening to a patient’s father and having been put on the spot to explain it to his daughter (with a straight face). We are let into the reality of death rates on the rise when all junior doctors change hospitals and this transition may result in deaths on “Wednesday.” “…I leave them to deal with rectal bleed.…a seventy-year-old lady’s alcohol consumption…notes. I’ve established that wine is her poison. Me: ‘And how much wine do you drink per day, would you say? Patient: ‘bout three bottles on a good day.’ Me: ‘OK . . . And on a bad day?’ Patient: ‘On a bad day I only manage one.”—-Adam Kay, MD""The cadence at times can be chaotic. Commendable that the plasterer who called his wife’s cervical dilation to be exactly 6 cm---and Dr. Kay verifies such. From the mommy to be who presented him with a nine-page birth plan---as if it were the panacea to a novel way to a proper birth. Sadly, she had to part with it due to the epidural that was to be in this pregnant mommy’s new plan. Kay recalls the time he delivered “Satan” out of a woman (as if it were a bane of accomplishment) and wonders had the parents thought of how this name could go down in kindergarten or grade school? Technology found its way into A & E as Adam observes his patient “Facetiming” during a smear. Adam explains the task of finding the womb lacking a little one and instead the finding was just “distended loops of bowel. Sad.Laughter is definitely the progeny from Kay’s utterly sardonic quips that needs no assistance or catalyst to flow. The perils of universal healthcare are evidenced here, and we develop a newfound respect for the prestige and elegance of American medicine and its spotless hospitals, U.S. News Best lists and the cucumber water stations. Deserving mention too are the fresh out of the dryer gowns, on the spot education in E.R. by nurses and tactile care from tall blue-eyed physicians in matching scrubs that smell nothing like these NHS doctors. Five stars indeed. Must read for the curious and those who question things (often). ---Der Titel impliziert viel. Dr. Adam Kay verursacht den Schmerz durch die vielen Sprengsätze und den schwarzen Humor, die überall in seinen Lesern ausbrechen, in diesem großartig gestalteten Detail, ein Arzt zu sein, der für das NHS arbeitet. Kay bietet eine echte literarische Therapie an, wenn er einen Fall von etwas ziemlich Nassem nacherzählt, das dem Vater eines Patienten passiert und an Ort und Stelle gebracht wurde, um es seiner Tochter zu erklären (mit ernstem Gesicht). Wir werden in die Realität der steigenden Sterblichkeitsraten hineingelassen, wenn alle Juniorärzte die Krankenhäuser wechseln und dieser Übergang am „Mittwoch“ zu Todesfällen führen kann.""... Ich überlasse es ihnen, sich mit Rektalblutung zu befassen. ... Alkoholkonsum einer siebzigjährigen Frau ... Notizen. Ich habe festgestellt, dass Wein ihr Gift ist. Ich: „Und wie viel Wein trinkst du pro Tag, würdest du sagen? Patient: ""Etwa drei Flaschen an einem guten Tag."" Ich: ""OK. . . Und an einem schlechten Tag? ""Patient:"" An einem schlechten Tag schaffe ich nur einen. ""- Adam Kay, MDDie Trittfrequenz kann manchmal chaotisch sein. Lobenswert, dass der Stuckateur, der die Zervixdilatation seiner Frau als genau 6 cm bezeichnete, und Dr. Kay dies bestätigt. Von der Mutter, die ihm einen neunseitigen Geburtsplan vorlegte - als wäre es das Allheilmittel für einen neuartigen Weg zu einer richtigen Geburt. Leider musste sie sich aufgrund des Epidurals, das im neuen Plan dieser schwangeren Mutter enthalten sein sollte, davon trennen. Kay erinnert sich an die Zeit, als er einer Frau „Satan“ entließ (als wäre es ein Fluch der Leistung), und fragte sich, ob die Eltern darüber nachgedacht hatten, wie dieser Name im Kindergarten oder in der Grundschule untergehen könnte. Die Technologie fand ihren Weg in A & E, als Adam seinen Patienten während eines Abstrichs beim „Facetiming“ beobachtet. Adam erklärt die Aufgabe, den Mutterleib zu finden, dem ein kleiner fehlt, und stattdessen war der Befund nur „ausgedehnte Darmschleifen. Traurig.Lachen ist definitiv die Nachkommenschaft von Kays absolut sardonischen Sprüchen, die keine Unterstützung oder Katalysator benötigen, um zu fließen. Die Gefahren der allgemeinen Gesundheitsversorgung werden hier deutlich, und wir entwickeln einen neu entdeckten Respekt für das Prestige und die Eleganz der amerikanischen Medizin und ihrer makellosen Krankenhäuser, der Bestlisten der US-Nachrichten und der Gurkenwasserstationen. Erwähnenswert sind auch die frisch aus den Trocknerkleidern stammenden, vor Ort in E. R. durchgeführten Schulungen durch Krankenschwestern sowie Ratschläge und taktile Betreuung durch große blauäugige Experten in passenden Peelings, die nicht nach diesen NHS-Ärzten riechen. Fünf Sterne in der Tat. Muss für Neugierige und diejenigen lesen, die Dinge (oft) hinterfragen."
235,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5114433-liz-janet,3,"Interview with author that brought the book to my attention: https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_co...For years I have been watching news comedy shows from the U.K., mostly Mock the Week and Russell Howard’s Good News, and in every series the panel has to dispel the opinions of some member of the conservative government about how the NHS is a cancer and the portrayal of Junior Doctors as money-grabbing and undeserving people who only seek their own wealth. This book is a more direct answer to those politicians who believe they can blatantly lie on television in order to support their budget cuts, told in the diary entries of one of the doctors during his training.Adam Kay takes on the issue with the most amount of British humour he could possibly muster, considering he had some pretty idiotic people pop into hospital, ( including a couple who turned a condom inside out and obviously got pregnant, which isn’t even the worst one) and the evident fact his and his colleagues hard work was being undermined by bureaucrats who would never understand all the work the doctors actually do.“Patient too drowsy to assess.”I pop in. The patient is dead.But the book is not only the comical experience of an overworked man, but an observation on class and the wealth of the state and their influence on the well-being of the population, a remark on the demands these doctors were expected to fulfill, and how all these lead to the detriment of the doctor’s personal lives. A MUST READ!"
236,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80638935-hp-saucerer,4,"In This is Going to Hurt, Adam Kay provides a no-holds-barred account of his time on the front line of the NHS. Through a series of diary entries we begin to see how, under the weight of the huge responsibility placed upon them - with minimal supervision and little pastoral support - doctors are working themselves to exhaustion, crumbling under the strain of an excessive and unmanageable workload. The book reveals a (darker) lesser-known side to the NHS, a service that so many depend on and yet take for granted. I was astonished by the sheer and blatant ineptitude of hospitals when it comes to caring for their staff. How could this be? But then is this really that surprising, given that the junior doctor dispute a few years ago served as a reminder of how little the government value those who are willing to devote most of their working lives to serving the public. (Okay, down from the soap box and back to the actual book)Whilst many of the accounts Kay recalls so candidly are hilarious (the dance floor pessary/pram wheel confusion was a personal favourite), others are horrifying and absolutely heartbreaking. I did find one or two accounts disrespectful and even disparaging; at times Kay appears to be looking for cheap laughs, and here the humour becomes base and a tad infantile. On the whole though, this is a must-read that perfectly captures both the pain and joy of working in close proximity to despair, disease and death every day. Brilliant."

238,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66513638-gtf,5,"'This Is Going To Hurt"" is a brilliant memoir of Adam Kay's career as a junior doctor. The book spares no details with regard to every aspect of the job; it contains some very graphic accounts of unusual injuries and illnesses that he has come across during his time in medicine, and it also details what it's really like to work for the UK's healthcare system. In addition to its plethora of explicit details, Kay clears up a lot of the misconceptions that people tend to have about doctors, such as doctors being excellent problem solvers, when in fact they are often just following procedures, and junior doctors earning hefty salaries, when in fact they are being paid less than minimum wage for years. ""This Is Going to Hurt"" is an interesting fusion of misery and humor. Although Kay didn't feel human anymore towards the end of his career in medicine, he still managed to see the funny side to some of his experiences in his grueling medical career."
239,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9582364-andrea,4,"This book by Adam Kay came to my attention in an episode of the Diving In podcast, where it was described as laugh-out-loud funny; the kind of book you want to read during a pandemic. I decided to go audio, which is still pretty new to me, and was delighted to find that the author is the narrator. Although it had some dark and/or poignant moments, it delivered the laughs while at the same time opening my eyes to the world of obgyn and the problems of the NHS (UK universal health service). On one hand I think it's a shame that Adam Kay is no longer a doctor, but on the other hand, I think he makes an excellent writer/comedian."
240,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1076079-karen,4,"In this book, set in the UK, it is apparent that undergoing medical training under their National Health System reaps huge emotional rewards (I can do great good), but little else in the way of monetary or personal rewards (I most likely will have to work the day of my own wedding/child's Christening/best friend's funeral). Adam Kay's diaries are quite fun and funny, loaded with a unique brand of dark humor I enjoy. Then as long days, derision, and under-staffing take their toll on him, the book finally takes on a more serious tone and it's really sad how it works out for him and some of his colleagues. I would love to see an American doctor compare his or her experiences with Adam's as I'm sure there are similarities. I do believe UK (junior) doctors struggle with the long hours and low pay a lot longer than in the U.S.A really good book that I recommend."

I am so supportive of the NHS and it’s workers in this country, this book is proof of the amazing work doctors and nurses do for us every single day that a lot of us take for granted.I’ve said it a million times before, but I find comedy in books really hard to connect with and I rarely laugh out loud at books. To begin with, I thought the humour in this one felt a bit forced and I was sure I wasn’t going to enjoy this as much as I’d hoped but soon enough I began really enjoying the humour and found myself outwardly laughing at some of Kay’s anecdotes. I even read some of the passages out loud to Matt, now that’s praise!The writing in this book is really well done. It’s full of wit, sarcasm, and self-deprecating humour while also being filled with some controversial and powerful moments. Told in diary form entry this is a really easy book to speed through, even when it comes to some of the harder hitting moments.Call me heartless, but unlike a lot of others who’ve read this book, I didn’t find myself on the edge of, or even in, tears. There is definitely a fair share of upsetting entries, so be warned but it didn’t hit me as hard as it did others.Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this short read. It light-heartedly highlighted the ever-growing struggles of NHS workers while offering a humorous outlook of working as a junior doctor. I can also tell you this has put me off having kids for life!"

I could write a review from the point of view of a medical student/medical intern, who has also been a patient for years, but I’m not sure if I’m up for that right now. Let me know if you would be interested in seeing that in the future though."
243,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58158333-allen,4,"A funny, excoriating memoir about a ""junior"" ob/gyn physician who is ""nervous in the service"" -- not the military, but Britain's National Health Service during recent years of budget retrenchment, 2004 to 2010. Adam Kay and his colleagues had to deal with weirdly ineffectual decisions coming down the chain-of-command that are spun to send spuriously comforting political messages to the ""folks at home"" rather than merely save money at all costs. When a volunteer translator renders the Punjabi word indicating a chronic bleeder into ""hermaphrodite"" rather than ""hemophiliac,"" it's funny but potentially deadly. When an NHS decision from on high takes away the doctors' sleeping cots, remember that your next deliverer of a C-section may have been on his/her feet for 18 hours. God forbid those lazy malingerers should try to stay alert and refreshed! Adam Kay's writing style is funny, but we can see the humor and patience wearing thin when a hemorrhaging patient splashed blood on his scrubs, pants, expensive CK boxers and manhood underneath. The pay these young physicians received for their herculean efforts is usually pitifully small, and once again the invisible bureaucracy seems to have them in their sights--when the docs switch from the Nike type of trainer (athletic) shoes to the much cheaper Crocs, the brass ban use of Crocs but offer no clothing allowances. It's at this point Kay begins to wonder whether the joy of delivering baby after healthy baby really compensates for the occasional heartbreaking failure, the ridiculous hours, low pay, bureaucratic turgidity that ignores success but comes down hard on trivial infractions, and above all the inability to schedule a social life when everyone seems to be slotted in as backup for everyone else. That last problem really hits the fan when time off the author had been promised for a two-week overseas vacation is nullified by a weekend of duty right in the middle. Nobody's fault, but there's no going AWOL. A couple of notes about the language in this highly entertaining memoir with a high ""can't-put-it-down"" quotient: typically, Kay uses the common four-letter term instead of ""manhood"" above; Yanks who object to profanity may find the use and frequency of it in this book disconcerting. British slang is freely applied, too, but I forgive him all this for his scrupulousness in footnoting medical terms (which he very much intends to be read), so we readers can understand what references like ""trans-vaginal probe"" and ""pre-eclampsia"" and the convoluted acronym ""TAH BSO"" all mean. We readers know from the introduction to this powerful book that Adam Kay eventually left the National Health Service for a turn at comedy. While the National Health Service does not (yet) subject its patients to American-style five- and six-figure bills, we have to wonder about the priorities of any society that rewards gag-writing for telly so much more handsomely than saving the lives of mothers and fetuses. This shocking (but very funny) black-humored account remains a brisk seller on both sides of the Atlantic. Update: August 31, 2018"

There is no real plot or climax or discovery. We are told from the beginning that the health system in the UK is wonderfully free for all but extremely flawed and most medical staff are overworked to the point of gross negligence. So what we are left with in reading these daily diary entries are the proof. The entries are mostly written with a sarcastic punch line each one a story within itself. Each entry is well written. Sometimes humorous. Mostly sarcastic. However it is also shocking, disheartening and sad as well. 3 1/2 to 4 stars."

He also added helpful footnotes to explain any medical terms not familiar with readers.His fascinating account of his life as a doctor was painfully honest, heart-warming and many times hilarious. He explains in great detail his many experiences (including some that made my stomach turn) and the struggles he endured until he got to the point when he made the heart breaking decision to leave his devoted career. Adam's understandable departure from medicine is a great loss to his community and humanity. There are too few doctors with his wit, personality, compassion and devotion.I highly recommend this captivating read!Thank you to NetGalley, author Adam Kay and Little, Brown and Company for an arc of this novel in exchange for my honest review."

A must read for young idealistic med students.
247,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4074594-kiki,5,"I'm supposed to be taking a break from social media right now, so I'll just say this: I feel better, more whole, more comforted, and more hopeful after reading this book. It's visceral, funny, and so poignant; what a memoir should be, real commentary on real life. It's unpretentious, as if Adam Kay had come round for a chat and we got to talking about his time as a junior doctor. It's heartbreaking, a love letter to the people who make the NHS such a precious institution, and a retort to those who have bruised it. This is what a memoir should be. An elegy, a time capsule. It's a look at a life we so rarely see, but that we should all work to better understand. One of the best books I've read in a long time. Thanks, Adam. "

Apart from the side-splitting humour, it is an excoriating account of the manifold administration deficiencies throughout the National Health Service, once the jewel in the crown of Britain’s welfare society. The author decided to specialise in ‘obs & gynae’ (known in the medical world as ‘brats and - something I can't repeat here beginning with ‘t’) because you end up with twice as many patients, unlike in geriatrics, and it's a tragi-comedy from there on.You will never look at your hospital doctor the same way after reading this, but I would recommend you do so, rather than turn up in A &E if you can possibly avoid it."

Painfully sad? Excellent validation that I made the right choice in not becoming a doctor? Honestly, all of the above. With candor and a never-ending stream of (often dark) humor, this collection of journal entries by a former medical resident paints a vivid picture of all parts of the medical profession: the funny, the bizarre, the awful, the heartwarming, the disgusting, the personal.First, a brief disclaimer: the original version of this book was published in 2017 in the UK. After its wild success, and comments that it resonated with doctors in other countries as well, who had copies imported from across the pond (or across the globe), someone had the fantastic idea to make a US version of it. You know, change some of the British-isms to American vernacular, add some more context for bits about the British government and health system, and so on. So while this is an ARC for a book releasing in December, it has been around for a while, just in a different form.As is often the case with nonfiction, a summary won’t do you much good here. Basically, Adam Kay decided he wanted to go into medicine somewhat arbitrarily while in high school, because, you know, we expect kids to know what they want to do with the rest of their lives already even when their brains aren’t fully formed yet. Common sense, right? He elected to go into obstetrics and gynecology, having heard that this was the easiest branch to go into. Over his years as a house officer and/or registrar (the UK version of what Americans call a resident and/or intern), he kept a journal of all the goings-on at his place of work. This book is a compilation of those journal entries.Right off the bat, in case I haven’t made it clear enough yet, this book is, in many places, laugh-out-loud hilarious. I had to be careful about reading it in public sometimes for fear that I would burst out in a stupid grin or an actual snort of laughter. Even as he describes his experiences going to hell and back (which is almost a literal definition; he did once deliver a baby named “Sayton,” pronounced like Satan), he manages to infuse all but the most serious moments with snark and self-awareness of the sheer insanity of it all. SCBU (pronounced “Scaboo”) is the Special Care Baby Unit; NICU is the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit; PICU is the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit; and PIKACHU is a type of Pokémon.Seriously, patients do dumb stuff. Objectively, we know this to be true, but you don’t really understand it until you are reading about the doctors who see it all: the things people put up various orifices (a Kinder egg with a wedding ring inside, placed inside a certain part of female anatomy?), the absurd questions they ask, the stupid things they do just to prove a point (yes, there was a literal dick-in-a-fan incident)…it’s hard to comprehend just how insane doctors must think people are until you really see it all in one place. Especially when that one place is narrated by an incredulous physician who peppers the whole thing with footnotes both clarifying points and adding his own opinions.If you describe a grandparent as being old-fashioned, it’s a euphemism for “casually racist.” In a hospital setting, it means “unsupportive.” You’re on your own.That’s not to say that this book is all “hardy-har-har-let’s-laugh-at-medical-nonsense,” though. What makes this book really work, and what keeps it from being a nonstop stream of jokes without real substance, is its recognition of the flaws inherent in the British medical system. To my understanding, many of these flaws are pervasive in medical systems across the globe, too, so this isn’t overly Anglo-centric. The hours are awful, with long shifts that don’t allow for enough sleep. You’re expected to stay for extra hours past the end of your shift if needed, and you don’t get paid overtime for that. Heck, the pay isn’t even that good to begin with. Requesting a day off is rarely going to actually work, as you can (and probably will) still be called in at the last minute.I told a patient that his MRI wouldn’t be until next week and he threatened to break both my legs. My first thought was Well, it’ll be a couple weeks off work. I was this close to offering him a baseball bat.These shortcomings mean that being a doctor, while you are in theory helping people, is likely to cause you personal harm in the process. Kay missed major events in both his own life and his friends’ lives because of his work schedule. It wreaked havoc on his relationships, both personal and romantic. While the stories in this book are not focused much on his outside life, his jabs at the system and comments here and there about his personal problems weave an underlying narrative of a man who, like so many others in his profession, is being drained by a job that asks too much. We like to think of doctors as being selfless, noble, well-paid, and respected, but in reality, they’re no better off than most of us–and, in many case, actually have it worse.I should have had counseling–in fact, my hospital should have arranged it. But there’s a mutual code of silence that keeps help from those who need it most.And as if the job isn’t enough, another recurring theme throughout the book is when his personal life and career would overlap. Apparently, being a doctor means your friends think you are the person to call and ask about any medical problem they have, never mind that you may specialize in only one area that has literally nothing to do with their issue. Sketchy consultations? Check. Awkward surgery? Been there, done that. Recognized by former patients in public? Yup. Again, it’s a very strange juxtaposition that you don’t often see in other careers, and even the tamer stories in this book are nothing short of eye-opening and revelatory.Quick note: the ending of the book is actually very sad, culminating with the event that made Kay decide to leave medicine and move on to a completely different job (writing comedy, which is what he does now!), and you can probably guess what sort of story that is. Poignant, upsetting, and illuminating the disastrous toll that the medical profession can take on the mental health of practitioners. Though, to be fair, you can tell even from the skillful narration of this book, with pitch-perfect jokes on every page, that humor is more of a strong suit for Kay than medicine ever was. So why not a full five stars? As much as I enjoyed the humor in this book, there were a few moments where I felt like maybe the author took it a little too far. For instance, there was one joke about how being a doctor is more stressful than piloting a plane when a terrorist tries to take over, and there were several sex-related jokes that were more uncomfortable than humorous to me. (That said, there were also quite a few on the same topic that were still incredibly funny, but some missed the mark. I guess that’s going to be the case in most comedy–not every joke is for everyone.)Still, I strongly recommend this one. It makes you laugh, and it makes you think. It is the medical equivalent of the “Don’t Be a Lawyer” song from Crazy Ex-Girlfriend–which is definitely a good thing. And if you're considering going into medicine, this will help make sure you go into it clear-eyed and wholly disillusioned, because yes: this job is going to hurt, in more ways than one.TRIGGER/CONTENT WARNINGS: death of a child, death of a parent, lots of blood, lots of genital-related content (all in a medical context, of course), side character with depressionThank you to the publisher, Little, Brown Spark, for providing me with an eARC of this book via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review!"

I am a fan of medical memoirs, so it was right up my street.Adam writes with wit and humour, and even in the worst of situations this levity really makes a difference to the narrative. Doctors see people on the worst days of their lives, but we also see them on the worst days of theirs, even if we don’t realise it. We don’t know what they are going through, but Adam has given an insightful look into his life as a Junior Doctor and just how much it impacted him.I think what I enjoyed the most was the almost conversational aspect of the book. It’s written in diary entries from his time in hospitals, so they are often brief, but some of the entries are very powerful. Others really made me feel for him as his own personal life suffered at the hands of working absolutely crazy hours and nobody could understand why he was missing important events outside of work.I really enjoyed This Is Going To Hurt, even though enjoy seems like the wrong word considering the subject matter, but you know what I mean. Adam Kay has a way with words, and it made this a really easy read. Tough subjects obviously, but he made it more relatable with his affable writing manner.If you enjoy glimpse into the medical profession, and a little humour with your non-fiction the you should most certainly add this one to your list!Recommended!"

Also check.For those who are not medical professionals, I would highly recommend reading it. It sheds a light on a reality that some might not know exists: what goes on behind the scenes and what happens to your doctor on a day-to-day basis (spoiler alert: it ain't all good). And, honestly, we probably need more people to read it if we want to save the NHS."

This is a mixture of a testament to how brilliant and immensely readable this book was, mixed with me being smug and braggy.A hilarious, honest, heartbreaking and incredibly quick read. I can understand why this book has done so well. Glorious!"
256,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32420578-alina,4,"Excellent insight in the lives of doctors in UK. Good balance between dry humour, useful critique of the NHS system and hospital rules, and strong emotions."

258,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8378502-barney,2,"I was expecting I'd enjoy this book but I ended up really disliking it. It starts off well with a few funny anecdotes but after a while I realised a lot of them are at the expense of the patient themselves. Yes I am the fun police, and I know humour is a way of coping, but there's something about the thought of a group of doctors chuckling about the time a dementia patient sexually assaulted another patient - and then a group of readers reading that and also chuckling - which doesn't sit well with me.Also we can all agree that doctors deserve absolutely every penny they get and are entitled to far more than they're being paid currently. But there's nothing like someone pre-financial crash describing themselves as poor while also having just bought an apartment and a trip to the Mauritius which just aaaargh really gets under my skin.I couldn't finish the book in the end. I was about half way through and fading fast, only to come across an vignette about the doctor being called in to deliver a new-born 'mid-wank', which ends with him completing the procedure ""still erect"". It was genuinely the most horrifying sentence I have ever read.So yeah, 2 stars but mostly because (even though the book isn't really political itself) its popularity in the UK has contributed to conversations about how hard junior doctors work and how valuable their contributions are to the NHS."

Usually the highest they get is 4.5 which is usually rounded down to 4 as I save the 5 star ratings for truly incredible books or ones that really had a profound effect on me. This book deserves every single star. Hilarious and heartbreaking all at once, it highlights the importance of the NHS which we should all be fighting to protect and make better. Can not recommend this book highly enough! Full review to come."

This seems to be a long list of disconnected anecdotes, nothing more, and I'm finding reading former doctor Adam Kay's views on both his patients and colleagues downright upsetting. It's not funny to me at all. I understand that doctors have a hard time (and lets be honest, everyone else working for the NHS currently), that they are nowhere near rewarded enough in a really thankless job, and, yes, I understand that humour is perhaps a coping mechanism in such a stressful job. I'm happy that this book has apparently shed light on the horrific, stressful conditions overworked and poorly recognised medical professionals are working under in the NHS, but personally I cannot read another page of this. I understand he was unhappy in this job and perhaps writing these ""diaries"" was a coping mechanism, but I think... I want to keep the illusion alive that most doctors and other medical professionals would never have such crude and obnoxious thoughts about their patients. Other people have felt very differently about this book (I guess you have to be ok with his very dark sense of humour?), so maybe my extreme reaction is unusual and I'm a little sensitive to this topic, but personally I have no desire to force myself to keep reading something that has made me feel so low."

Dr. Adam Kay does inflict the pain from the many expletives and black humor that erupts all over his readers in this this magnificently crafted detail of being a doctor working for the NHS. Kay offers some true literary therapy when he retells a case of something rather wet happening to a patient’s father and having been put on the spot to explain it to his daughter (with a straight face). We are let into the reality of death rates on the rise when all junior doctors change hospitals and this transition may result in deaths on “Wednesday.” “…I leave them to deal with rectal bleed.…a seventy-year-old lady’s alcohol consumption…notes. I’ve established that wine is her poison. Me: ‘And how much wine do you drink per day, would you say? Patient: ‘bout three bottles on a good day.’ Me: ‘OK . . . And on a bad day?’ Patient: ‘On a bad day I only manage one.”—-Adam Kay, MD""The cadence at times can be chaotic. Commendable that the plasterer who called his wife’s cervical dilation to be exactly 6 cm---and Dr. Kay verifies such. From the mommy to be who presented him with a nine-page birth plan---as if it were the panacea to a novel way to a proper birth. Sadly, she had to part with it due to the epidural that was to be in this pregnant mommy’s new plan. Kay recalls the time he delivered “Satan” out of a woman (as if it were a bane of accomplishment) and wonders had the parents thought of how this name could go down in kindergarten or grade school? Technology found its way into A & E as Adam observes his patient “Facetiming” during a smear. Adam explains the task of finding the womb lacking a little one and instead the finding was just “distended loops of bowel. Sad.Laughter is definitely the progeny from Kay’s utterly sardonic quips that needs no assistance or catalyst to flow. The perils of universal healthcare are evidenced here, and we develop a newfound respect for the prestige and elegance of American medicine and its spotless hospitals, U.S. News Best lists and the cucumber water stations. Deserving mention too are the fresh out of the dryer gowns, on the spot education in E.R. by nurses and tactile care from tall blue-eyed physicians in matching scrubs that smell nothing like these NHS doctors. Five stars indeed. Must read for the curious and those who question things (often). ---Der Titel impliziert viel. Dr. Adam Kay verursacht den Schmerz durch die vielen Sprengsätze und den schwarzen Humor, die überall in seinen Lesern ausbrechen, in diesem großartig gestalteten Detail, ein Arzt zu sein, der für das NHS arbeitet. Kay bietet eine echte literarische Therapie an, wenn er einen Fall von etwas ziemlich Nassem nacherzählt, das dem Vater eines Patienten passiert und an Ort und Stelle gebracht wurde, um es seiner Tochter zu erklären (mit ernstem Gesicht). Wir werden in die Realität der steigenden Sterblichkeitsraten hineingelassen, wenn alle Juniorärzte die Krankenhäuser wechseln und dieser Übergang am „Mittwoch“ zu Todesfällen führen kann.""... Ich überlasse es ihnen, sich mit Rektalblutung zu befassen. ... Alkoholkonsum einer siebzigjährigen Frau ... Notizen. Ich habe festgestellt, dass Wein ihr Gift ist.

Von der Mutter, die ihm einen neunseitigen Geburtsplan vorlegte - als wäre es das Allheilmittel für einen neuartigen Weg zu einer richtigen Geburt. Leider musste sie sich aufgrund des Epidurals, das im neuen Plan dieser schwangeren Mutter enthalten sein sollte, davon trennen. Kay erinnert sich an die Zeit, als er einer Frau „Satan“ entließ (als wäre es ein Fluch der Leistung), und fragte sich, ob die Eltern darüber nachgedacht hatten, wie dieser Name im Kindergarten oder in der Grundschule untergehen könnte. Die Technologie fand ihren Weg in A & E, als Adam seinen Patienten während eines Abstrichs beim „Facetiming“ beobachtet. Adam erklärt die Aufgabe, den Mutterleib zu finden, dem ein kleiner fehlt, und stattdessen war der Befund nur „ausgedehnte Darmschleifen. Traurig.Lachen ist definitiv die Nachkommenschaft von Kays absolut sardonischen Sprüchen, die keine Unterstützung oder Katalysator benötigen, um zu fließen. Die Gefahren der allgemeinen Gesundheitsversorgung werden hier deutlich, und wir entwickeln einen neu entdeckten Respekt für das Prestige und die Eleganz der amerikanischen Medizin und ihrer makellosen Krankenhäuser, der Bestlisten der US-Nachrichten und der Gurkenwasserstationen. Erwähnenswert sind auch die frisch aus den Trocknerkleidern stammenden, vor Ort in E. R. durchgeführten Schulungen durch Krankenschwestern sowie Ratschläge und taktile Betreuung durch große blauäugige Experten in passenden Peelings, die nicht nach diesen NHS-Ärzten riechen.

265,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5114433-liz-janet,3,"Interview with author that brought the book to my attention: https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_co...For years I have been watching news comedy shows from the U.K., mostly Mock the Week and Russell Howard’s Good News, and in every series the panel has to dispel the opinions of some member of the conservative government about how the NHS is a cancer and the portrayal of Junior Doctors as money-grabbing and undeserving people who only seek their own wealth. This book is a more direct answer to those politicians who believe they can blatantly lie on television in order to support their budget cuts, told in the diary entries of one of the doctors during his training.Adam Kay takes on the issue with the most amount of British humour he could possibly muster, considering he had some pretty idiotic people pop into hospital, ( including a couple who turned a condom inside out and obviously got pregnant, which isn’t even the worst one) and the evident fact his and his colleagues hard work was being undermined by bureaucrats who would never understand all the work the doctors actually do.“Patient too drowsy to assess.”I pop in. The patient is dead.But the book is not only the comical experience of an overworked man, but an observation on class and the wealth of the state and their influence on the well-being of the population, a remark on the demands these doctors were expected to fulfill, and how all these lead to the detriment of the doctor’s personal lives. A MUST READ!"
266,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80638935-hp-saucerer,4,"In This is Going to Hurt, Adam Kay provides a no-holds-barred account of his time on the front line of the NHS. Through a series of diary entries we begin to see how, under the weight of the huge responsibility placed upon them - with minimal supervision and little pastoral support - doctors are working themselves to exhaustion, crumbling under the strain of an excessive and unmanageable workload. The book reveals a (darker) lesser-known side to the NHS, a service that so many depend on and yet take for granted. I was astonished by the sheer and blatant ineptitude of hospitals when it comes to caring for their staff. How could this be? But then is this really that surprising, given that the junior doctor dispute a few years ago served as a reminder of how little the government value those who are willing to devote most of their working lives to serving the public. (Okay, down from the soap box and back to the actual book)Whilst many of the accounts Kay recalls so candidly are hilarious (the dance floor pessary/pram wheel confusion was a personal favourite), others are horrifying and absolutely heartbreaking. I did find one or two accounts disrespectful and even disparaging; at times Kay appears to be looking for cheap laughs, and here the humour becomes base and a tad infantile. On the whole though, this is a must-read that perfectly captures both the pain and joy of working in close proximity to despair, disease and death every day. Brilliant."

268,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66513638-gtf,5,"'This Is Going To Hurt"" is a brilliant memoir of Adam Kay's career as a junior doctor. The book spares no details with regard to every aspect of the job; it contains some very graphic accounts of unusual injuries and illnesses that he has come across during his time in medicine, and it also details what it's really like to work for the UK's healthcare system. In addition to its plethora of explicit details, Kay clears up a lot of the misconceptions that people tend to have about doctors, such as doctors being excellent problem solvers, when in fact they are often just following procedures, and junior doctors earning hefty salaries, when in fact they are being paid less than minimum wage for years. ""This Is Going to Hurt"" is an interesting fusion of misery and humor. Although Kay didn't feel human anymore towards the end of his career in medicine, he still managed to see the funny side to some of his experiences in his grueling medical career."
269,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9582364-andrea,4,"This book by Adam Kay came to my attention in an episode of the Diving In podcast, where it was described as laugh-out-loud funny; the kind of book you want to read during a pandemic. I decided to go audio, which is still pretty new to me, and was delighted to find that the author is the narrator. Although it had some dark and/or poignant moments, it delivered the laughs while at the same time opening my eyes to the world of obgyn and the problems of the NHS (UK universal health service). On one hand I think it's a shame that Adam Kay is no longer a doctor, but on the other hand, I think he makes an excellent writer/comedian."
270,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1076079-karen,4,"In this book, set in the UK, it is apparent that undergoing medical training under their National Health System reaps huge emotional rewards (I can do great good), but little else in the way of monetary or personal rewards (I most likely will have to work the day of my own wedding/child's Christening/best friend's funeral). Adam Kay's diaries are quite fun and funny, loaded with a unique brand of dark humor I enjoy. Then as long days, derision, and under-staffing take their toll on him, the book finally takes on a more serious tone and it's really sad how it works out for him and some of his colleagues. I would love to see an American doctor compare his or her experiences with Adam's as I'm sure there are similarities. I do believe UK (junior) doctors struggle with the long hours and low pay a lot longer than in the U.S.A really good book that I recommend."

I am so supportive of the NHS and it’s workers in this country, this book is proof of the amazing work doctors and nurses do for us every single day that a lot of us take for granted.I’ve said it a million times before, but I find comedy in books really hard to connect with and I rarely laugh out loud at books. To begin with, I thought the humour in this one felt a bit forced and I was sure I wasn’t going to enjoy this as much as I’d hoped but soon enough I began really enjoying the humour and found myself outwardly laughing at some of Kay’s anecdotes. I even read some of the passages out loud to Matt, now that’s praise!The writing in this book is really well done. It’s full of wit, sarcasm, and self-deprecating humour while also being filled with some controversial and powerful moments. Told in diary form entry this is a really easy book to speed through, even when it comes to some of the harder hitting moments.Call me heartless, but unlike a lot of others who’ve read this book, I didn’t find myself on the edge of, or even in, tears. There is definitely a fair share of upsetting entries, so be warned but it didn’t hit me as hard as it did others.Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this short read. It light-heartedly highlighted the ever-growing struggles of NHS workers while offering a humorous outlook of working as a junior doctor. I can also tell you this has put me off having kids for life!"

Let me know if you would be interested in seeing that in the future though."
273,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58158333-allen,4,"A funny, excoriating memoir about a ""junior"" ob/gyn physician who is ""nervous in the service"" -- not the military, but Britain's National Health Service during recent years of budget retrenchment, 2004 to 2010. Adam Kay and his colleagues had to deal with weirdly ineffectual decisions coming down the chain-of-command that are spun to send spuriously comforting political messages to the ""folks at home"" rather than merely save money at all costs. When a volunteer translator renders the Punjabi word indicating a chronic bleeder into ""hermaphrodite"" rather than ""hemophiliac,"" it's funny but potentially deadly. When an NHS decision from on high takes away the doctors' sleeping cots, remember that your next deliverer of a C-section may have been on his/her feet for 18 hours. God forbid those lazy malingerers should try to stay alert and refreshed! Adam Kay's writing style is funny, but we can see the humor and patience wearing thin when a hemorrhaging patient splashed blood on his scrubs, pants, expensive CK boxers and manhood underneath. The pay these young physicians received for their herculean efforts is usually pitifully small, and once again the invisible bureaucracy seems to have them in their sights--when the docs switch from the Nike type of trainer (athletic) shoes to the much cheaper Crocs, the brass ban use of Crocs but offer no clothing allowances. It's at this point Kay begins to wonder whether the joy of delivering baby after healthy baby really compensates for the occasional heartbreaking failure, the ridiculous hours, low pay, bureaucratic turgidity that ignores success but comes down hard on trivial infractions, and above all the inability to schedule a social life when everyone seems to be slotted in as backup for everyone else. That last problem really hits the fan when time off the author had been promised for a two-week overseas vacation is nullified by a weekend of duty right in the middle. Nobody's fault, but there's no going AWOL. A couple of notes about the language in this highly entertaining memoir with a high ""can't-put-it-down"" quotient: typically, Kay uses the common four-letter term instead of ""manhood"" above; Yanks who object to profanity may find the use and frequency of it in this book disconcerting. British slang is freely applied, too, but I forgive him all this for his scrupulousness in footnoting medical terms (which he very much intends to be read), so we readers can understand what references like ""trans-vaginal probe"" and ""pre-eclampsia"" and the convoluted acronym ""TAH BSO"" all mean. We readers know from the introduction to this powerful book that Adam Kay eventually left the National Health Service for a turn at comedy. While the National Health Service does not (yet) subject its patients to American-style five- and six-figure bills, we have to wonder about the priorities of any society that rewards gag-writing for telly so much more handsomely than saving the lives of mothers and fetuses. This shocking (but very funny) black-humored account remains a brisk seller on both sides of the Atlantic. Update: August 31, 2018"

There is no real plot or climax or discovery. We are told from the beginning that the health system in the UK is wonderfully free for all but extremely flawed and most medical staff are overworked to the point of gross negligence. So what we are left with in reading these daily diary entries are the proof. The entries are mostly written with a sarcastic punch line each one a story within itself. Each entry is well written. Sometimes humorous. Mostly sarcastic. However it is also shocking, disheartening and sad as well. 3 1/2 to 4 stars."

He also added helpful footnotes to explain any medical terms not familiar with readers.His fascinating account of his life as a doctor was painfully honest, heart-warming and many times hilarious. He explains in great detail his many experiences (including some that made my stomach turn) and the struggles he endured until he got to the point when he made the heart breaking decision to leave his devoted career. Adam's understandable departure from medicine is a great loss to his community and humanity. There are too few doctors with his wit, personality, compassion and devotion.I highly recommend this captivating read!Thank you to NetGalley, author Adam Kay and Little, Brown and Company for an arc of this novel in exchange for my honest review."

It's visceral, funny, and so poignant; what a memoir should be, real commentary on real life. It's unpretentious, as if Adam Kay had come round for a chat and we got to talking about his time as a junior doctor. It's heartbreaking, a love letter to the people who make the NHS such a precious institution, and a retort to those who have bruised it. This is what a memoir should be. An elegy, a time capsule. It's a look at a life we so rarely see, but that we should all work to better understand. One of the best books I've read in a long time. Thanks, Adam. "

Apart from the side-splitting humour, it is an excoriating account of the manifold administration deficiencies throughout the National Health Service, once the jewel in the crown of Britain’s welfare society. The author decided to specialise in ‘obs & gynae’ (known in the medical world as ‘brats and - something I can't repeat here beginning with ‘t’) because you end up with twice as many patients, unlike in geriatrics, and it's a tragi-comedy from there on.You will never look at your hospital doctor the same way after reading this, but I would recommend you do so, rather than turn up in A &E if you can possibly avoid it."

Painfully sad? Excellent validation that I made the right choice in not becoming a doctor? Honestly, all of the above. With candor and a never-ending stream of (often dark) humor, this collection of journal entries by a former medical resident paints a vivid picture of all parts of the medical profession: the funny, the bizarre, the awful, the heartwarming, the disgusting, the personal.First, a brief disclaimer: the original version of this book was published in 2017 in the UK. After its wild success, and comments that it resonated with doctors in other countries as well, who had copies imported from across the pond (or across the globe), someone had the fantastic idea to make a US version of it. You know, change some of the British-isms to American vernacular, add some more context for bits about the British government and health system, and so on. So while this is an ARC for a book releasing in December, it has been around for a while, just in a different form.As is often the case with nonfiction, a summary won’t do you much good here. Basically, Adam Kay decided he wanted to go into medicine somewhat arbitrarily while in high school, because, you know, we expect kids to know what they want to do with the rest of their lives already even when their brains aren’t fully formed yet. Common sense, right? He elected to go into obstetrics and gynecology, having heard that this was the easiest branch to go into. Over his years as a house officer and/or registrar (the UK version of what Americans call a resident and/or intern), he kept a journal of all the goings-on at his place of work. This book is a compilation of those journal entries.Right off the bat, in case I haven’t made it clear enough yet, this book is, in many places, laugh-out-loud hilarious. I had to be careful about reading it in public sometimes for fear that I would burst out in a stupid grin or an actual snort of laughter. Even as he describes his experiences going to hell and back (which is almost a literal definition; he did once deliver a baby named “Sayton,” pronounced like Satan), he manages to infuse all but the most serious moments with snark and self-awareness of the sheer insanity of it all. SCBU (pronounced “Scaboo”) is the Special Care Baby Unit; NICU is the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit; PICU is the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit; and PIKACHU is a type of Pokémon.Seriously, patients do dumb stuff. Objectively, we know this to be true, but you don’t really understand it until you are reading about the doctors who see it all: the things people put up various orifices (a Kinder egg with a wedding ring inside, placed inside a certain part of female anatomy?), the absurd questions they ask, the stupid things they do just to prove a point (yes, there was a literal dick-in-a-fan incident)…it’s hard to comprehend just how insane doctors must think people are until you really see it all in one place. Especially when that one place is narrated by an incredulous physician who peppers the whole thing with footnotes both clarifying points and adding his own opinions.If you describe a grandparent as being old-fashioned, it’s a euphemism for “casually racist.” In a hospital setting, it means “unsupportive.” You’re on your own.That’s not to say that this book is all “hardy-har-har-let’s-laugh-at-medical-nonsense,” though. What makes this book really work, and what keeps it from being a nonstop stream of jokes without real substance, is its recognition of the flaws inherent in the British medical system. To my understanding, many of these flaws are pervasive in medical systems across the globe, too, so this isn’t overly Anglo-centric. The hours are awful, with long shifts that don’t allow for enough sleep. You’re expected to stay for extra hours past the end of your shift if needed, and you don’t get paid overtime for that. Heck, the pay isn’t even that good to begin with. Requesting a day off is rarely going to actually work, as you can (and probably will) still be called in at the last minute.I told a patient that his MRI wouldn’t be until next week and he threatened to break both my legs. My first thought was Well, it’ll be a couple weeks off work. I was this close to offering him a baseball bat.These shortcomings mean that being a doctor, while you are in theory helping people, is likely to cause you personal harm in the process. Kay missed major events in both his own life and his friends’ lives because of his work schedule. It wreaked havoc on his relationships, both personal and romantic. While the stories in this book are not focused much on his outside life, his jabs at the system and comments here and there about his personal problems weave an underlying narrative of a man who, like so many others in his profession, is being drained by a job that asks too much. We like to think of doctors as being selfless, noble, well-paid, and respected, but in reality, they’re no better off than most of us–and, in many case, actually have it worse.I should have had counseling–in fact, my hospital should have arranged it. But there’s a mutual code of silence that keeps help from those who need it most.And as if the job isn’t enough, another recurring theme throughout the book is when his personal life and career would overlap. Apparently, being a doctor means your friends think you are the person to call and ask about any medical problem they have, never mind that you may specialize in only one area that has literally nothing to do with their issue. Sketchy consultations? Check. Awkward surgery? Been there, done that. Recognized by former patients in public? Yup. Again, it’s a very strange juxtaposition that you don’t often see in other careers, and even the tamer stories in this book are nothing short of eye-opening and revelatory.Quick note: the ending of the book is actually very sad, culminating with the event that made Kay decide to leave medicine and move on to a completely different job (writing comedy, which is what he does now!), and you can probably guess what sort of story that is. Poignant, upsetting, and illuminating the disastrous toll that the medical profession can take on the mental health of practitioners. Though, to be fair, you can tell even from the skillful narration of this book, with pitch-perfect jokes on every page, that humor is more of a strong suit for Kay than medicine ever was. So why not a full five stars? As much as I enjoyed the humor in this book, there were a few moments where I felt like maybe the author took it a little too far. For instance, there was one joke about how being a doctor is more stressful than piloting a plane when a terrorist tries to take over, and there were several sex-related jokes that were more uncomfortable than humorous to me. (That said, there were also quite a few on the same topic that were still incredibly funny, but some missed the mark. I guess that’s going to be the case in most comedy–not every joke is for everyone.)Still, I strongly recommend this one. It makes you laugh, and it makes you think. It is the medical equivalent of the “Don’t Be a Lawyer” song from Crazy Ex-Girlfriend–which is definitely a good thing. And if you're considering going into medicine, this will help make sure you go into it clear-eyed and wholly disillusioned, because yes: this job is going to hurt, in more ways than one.TRIGGER/CONTENT WARNINGS: death of a child, death of a parent, lots of blood, lots of genital-related content (all in a medical context, of course), side character with depressionThank you to the publisher, Little, Brown Spark, for providing me with an eARC of this book via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review!"

I am a fan of medical memoirs, so it was right up my street.Adam writes with wit and humour, and even in the worst of situations this levity really makes a difference to the narrative. Doctors see people on the worst days of their lives, but we also see them on the worst days of theirs, even if we don’t realise it. We don’t know what they are going through, but Adam has given an insightful look into his life as a Junior Doctor and just how much it impacted him.I think what I enjoyed the most was the almost conversational aspect of the book. It’s written in diary entries from his time in hospitals, so they are often brief, but some of the entries are very powerful. Others really made me feel for him as his own personal life suffered at the hands of working absolutely crazy hours and nobody could understand why he was missing important events outside of work.I really enjoyed This Is Going To Hurt, even though enjoy seems like the wrong word considering the subject matter, but you know what I mean. Adam Kay has a way with words, and it made this a really easy read. Tough subjects obviously, but he made it more relatable with his affable writing manner.If you enjoy glimpse into the medical profession, and a little humour with your non-fiction the you should most certainly add this one to your list!Recommended!"
284,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10887793-julie,5,"This is the second book I read this year that I wish I had written (and, had I kept a diary, I probably could have - except the horrific penis-related injury I treated was not a de-gloving, but a fracture).I'm a *junior* doctor, and his stories of life, death and everything in between just sound so reassuringly familiar. It's kinda nice to know that somebody else has been there, done that, got the T-shirt and got it stained by blood almost immediately. Relationship breakdown? Check. Missing out on weddings/birthday parties/funerals because you had to be in work? Check. Developing a scathing, sarcastic sense of humour in order to deal with the death, tragedy and pain that constantly surrounds you? Also check.For those who are not medical professionals, I would highly recommend reading it. It sheds a light on a reality that some might not know exists: what goes on behind the scenes and what happens to your doctor on a day-to-day basis (spoiler alert: it ain't all good). And, honestly, we probably need more people to read it if we want to save the NHS."
285,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5765758-pip,4,"I totally read this in one sitting. This is a mixture of a testament to how brilliant and immensely readable this book was, mixed with me being smug and braggy.A hilarious, honest, heartbreaking and incredibly quick read. I can understand why this book has done so well. Glorious!"
286,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32420578-alina,4,"Excellent insight in the lives of doctors in UK. Good balance between dry humour, useful critique of the NHS system and hospital rules, and strong emotions."

288,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8378502-barney,2,"I was expecting I'd enjoy this book but I ended up really disliking it. It starts off well with a few funny anecdotes but after a while I realised a lot of them are at the expense of the patient themselves. Yes I am the fun police, and I know humour is a way of coping, but there's something about the thought of a group of doctors chuckling about the time a dementia patient sexually assaulted another patient - and then a group of readers reading that and also chuckling - which doesn't sit well with me.Also we can all agree that doctors deserve absolutely every penny they get and are entitled to far more than they're being paid currently. But there's nothing like someone pre-financial crash describing themselves as poor while also having just bought an apartment and a trip to the Mauritius which just aaaargh really gets under my skin.I couldn't finish the book in the end. I was about half way through and fading fast, only to come across an vignette about the doctor being called in to deliver a new-born 'mid-wank', which ends with him completing the procedure ""still erect"". It was genuinely the most horrifying sentence I have ever read.So yeah, 2 stars but mostly because (even though the book isn't really political itself) its popularity in the UK has contributed to conversations about how hard junior doctors work and how valuable their contributions are to the NHS."
289,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31502192-francesca,5,"I think this is the first nonfiction book I've ever given a full five stars to. Usually the highest they get is 4.5 which is usually rounded down to 4 as I save the 5 star ratings for truly incredible books or ones that really had a profound effect on me. This book deserves every single star. Hilarious and heartbreaking all at once, it highlights the importance of the NHS which we should all be fighting to protect and make better. Can not recommend this book highly enough! Full review to come."
290,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16471876-liz-barnsley,5,"Should be required reading for politicians everywhere, this is a brutally honest and realistic but absolutely hilarious memoir, where you will laugh and cry and wish that this dedicated, genuinely caring guy was still practicing medicine. Incredible."
291,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3126915-imi,1,"DNFed at end of second chapter, page 60 out of 256.I can't do it. This seems to be a long list of disconnected anecdotes, nothing more, and I'm finding reading former doctor Adam Kay's views on both his patients and colleagues downright upsetting. It's not funny to me at all. I understand that doctors have a hard time (and lets be honest, everyone else working for the NHS currently), that they are nowhere near rewarded enough in a really thankless job, and, yes, I understand that humour is perhaps a coping mechanism in such a stressful job. I'm happy that this book has apparently shed light on the horrific, stressful conditions overworked and poorly recognised medical professionals are working under in the NHS, but personally I cannot read another page of this. I understand he was unhappy in this job and perhaps writing these ""diaries"" was a coping mechanism, but I think... I want to keep the illusion alive that most doctors and other medical professionals would never have such crude and obnoxious thoughts about their patients. Other people have felt very differently about this book (I guess you have to be ok with his very dark sense of humour?), so maybe my extreme reaction is unusual and I'm a little sensitive to this topic, but personally I have no desire to force myself to keep reading something that has made me feel so low."

294,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24882791-india-m-clamp,5,"The title implies much. Dr. Adam Kay does inflict the pain from the many expletives and black humor that erupts all over his readers in this this magnificently crafted detail of being a doctor working for the NHS. Kay offers some true literary therapy when he retells a case of something rather wet happening to a patient’s father and having been put on the spot to explain it to his daughter (with a straight face). We are let into the reality of death rates on the rise when all junior doctors change hospitals and this transition may result in deaths on “Wednesday.” “…I leave them to deal with rectal bleed.…a seventy-year-old lady’s alcohol consumption…notes. I’ve established that wine is her poison. Me: ‘And how much wine do you drink per day, would you say? Patient: ‘bout three bottles on a good day.’ Me: ‘OK . . . And on a bad day?’ Patient: ‘On a bad day I only manage one.”—-Adam Kay, MD""The cadence at times can be chaotic. Commendable that the plasterer who called his wife’s cervical dilation to be exactly 6 cm---and Dr. Kay verifies such. From the mommy to be who presented him with a nine-page birth plan---as if it were the panacea to a novel way to a proper birth. Sadly, she had to part with it due to the epidural that was to be in this pregnant mommy’s new plan. Kay recalls the time he delivered “Satan” out of a woman (as if it were a bane of accomplishment) and wonders had the parents thought of how this name could go down in kindergarten or grade school? Technology found its way into A & E as Adam observes his patient “Facetiming” during a smear. Adam explains the task of finding the womb lacking a little one and instead the finding was just “distended loops of bowel. Sad.Laughter is definitely the progeny from Kay’s utterly sardonic quips that needs no assistance or catalyst to flow. The perils of universal healthcare are evidenced here, and we develop a newfound respect for the prestige and elegance of American medicine and its spotless hospitals, U.S. News Best lists and the cucumber water stations. Deserving mention too are the fresh out of the dryer gowns, on the spot education in E.R. by nurses and tactile care from tall blue-eyed physicians in matching scrubs that smell nothing like these NHS doctors. Five stars indeed. Must read for the curious and those who question things (often). ---Der Titel impliziert viel. Dr. Adam Kay verursacht den Schmerz durch die vielen Sprengsätze und den schwarzen Humor, die überall in seinen Lesern ausbrechen, in diesem großartig gestalteten Detail, ein Arzt zu sein, der für das NHS arbeitet. Kay bietet eine echte literarische Therapie an, wenn er einen Fall von etwas ziemlich Nassem nacherzählt, das dem Vater eines Patienten passiert und an Ort und Stelle gebracht wurde, um es seiner Tochter zu erklären (mit ernstem Gesicht). Wir werden in die Realität der steigenden Sterblichkeitsraten hineingelassen, wenn alle Juniorärzte die Krankenhäuser wechseln und dieser Übergang am „Mittwoch“ zu Todesfällen führen kann.""... Ich überlasse es ihnen, sich mit Rektalblutung zu befassen. ... Alkoholkonsum einer siebzigjährigen Frau ... Notizen. Ich habe festgestellt, dass Wein ihr Gift ist. Ich: „Und wie viel Wein trinkst du pro Tag, würdest du sagen? Patient: ""Etwa drei Flaschen an einem guten Tag."" Ich: ""OK. . . Und an einem schlechten Tag? ""Patient:"" An einem schlechten Tag schaffe ich nur einen. ""- Adam Kay, MDDie Trittfrequenz kann manchmal chaotisch sein. Lobenswert, dass der Stuckateur, der die Zervixdilatation seiner Frau als genau 6 cm bezeichnete, und Dr. Kay dies bestätigt. Von der Mutter, die ihm einen neunseitigen Geburtsplan vorlegte - als wäre es das Allheilmittel für einen neuartigen Weg zu einer richtigen Geburt. Leider musste sie sich aufgrund des Epidurals, das im neuen Plan dieser schwangeren Mutter enthalten sein sollte, davon trennen. Kay erinnert sich an die Zeit, als er einer Frau „Satan“ entließ (als wäre es ein Fluch der Leistung), und fragte sich, ob die Eltern darüber nachgedacht hatten, wie dieser Name im Kindergarten oder in der Grundschule untergehen könnte. Die Technologie fand ihren Weg in A & E, als Adam seinen Patienten während eines Abstrichs beim „Facetiming“ beobachtet. Adam erklärt die Aufgabe, den Mutterleib zu finden, dem ein kleiner fehlt, und stattdessen war der Befund nur „ausgedehnte Darmschleifen. Traurig.Lachen ist definitiv die Nachkommenschaft von Kays absolut sardonischen Sprüchen, die keine Unterstützung oder Katalysator benötigen, um zu fließen. Die Gefahren der allgemeinen Gesundheitsversorgung werden hier deutlich, und wir entwickeln einen neu entdeckten Respekt für das Prestige und die Eleganz der amerikanischen Medizin und ihrer makellosen Krankenhäuser, der Bestlisten der US-Nachrichten und der Gurkenwasserstationen. Erwähnenswert sind auch die frisch aus den Trocknerkleidern stammenden, vor Ort in E. R. durchgeführten Schulungen durch Krankenschwestern sowie Ratschläge und taktile Betreuung durch große blauäugige Experten in passenden Peelings, die nicht nach diesen NHS-Ärzten riechen. Fünf Sterne in der Tat. Muss für Neugierige und diejenigen lesen, die Dinge (oft) hinterfragen."
295,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5114433-liz-janet,3,"Interview with author that brought the book to my attention: https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_co...For years I have been watching news comedy shows from the U.K., mostly Mock the Week and Russell Howard’s Good News, and in every series the panel has to dispel the opinions of some member of the conservative government about how the NHS is a cancer and the portrayal of Junior Doctors as money-grabbing and undeserving people who only seek their own wealth. This book is a more direct answer to those politicians who believe they can blatantly lie on television in order to support their budget cuts, told in the diary entries of one of the doctors during his training.Adam Kay takes on the issue with the most amount of British humour he could possibly muster, considering he had some pretty idiotic people pop into hospital, ( including a couple who turned a condom inside out and obviously got pregnant, which isn’t even the worst one) and the evident fact his and his colleagues hard work was being undermined by bureaucrats who would never understand all the work the doctors actually do.“Patient too drowsy to assess.”I pop in. The patient is dead.But the book is not only the comical experience of an overworked man, but an observation on class and the wealth of the state and their influence on the well-being of the population, a remark on the demands these doctors were expected to fulfill, and how all these lead to the detriment of the doctor’s personal lives. A MUST READ!"
296,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80638935-hp-saucerer,4,"In This is Going to Hurt, Adam Kay provides a no-holds-barred account of his time on the front line of the NHS. Through a series of diary entries we begin to see how, under the weight of the huge responsibility placed upon them - with minimal supervision and little pastoral support - doctors are working themselves to exhaustion, crumbling under the strain of an excessive and unmanageable workload. The book reveals a (darker) lesser-known side to the NHS, a service that so many depend on and yet take for granted. I was astonished by the sheer and blatant ineptitude of hospitals when it comes to caring for their staff. How could this be? But then is this really that surprising, given that the junior doctor dispute a few years ago served as a reminder of how little the government value those who are willing to devote most of their working lives to serving the public. (Okay, down from the soap box and back to the actual book)Whilst many of the accounts Kay recalls so candidly are hilarious (the dance floor pessary/pram wheel confusion was a personal favourite), others are horrifying and absolutely heartbreaking. I did find one or two accounts disrespectful and even disparaging; at times Kay appears to be looking for cheap laughs, and here the humour becomes base and a tad infantile. On the whole though, this is a must-read that perfectly captures both the pain and joy of working in close proximity to despair, disease and death every day. Brilliant."

298,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66513638-gtf,5,"'This Is Going To Hurt"" is a brilliant memoir of Adam Kay's career as a junior doctor. The book spares no details with regard to every aspect of the job; it contains some very graphic accounts of unusual injuries and illnesses that he has come across during his time in medicine, and it also details what it's really like to work for the UK's healthcare system. In addition to its plethora of explicit details, Kay clears up a lot of the misconceptions that people tend to have about doctors, such as doctors being excellent problem solvers, when in fact they are often just following procedures, and junior doctors earning hefty salaries, when in fact they are being paid less than minimum wage for years. ""This Is Going to Hurt"" is an interesting fusion of misery and humor. Although Kay didn't feel human anymore towards the end of his career in medicine, he still managed to see the funny side to some of his experiences in his grueling medical career."
299,1509858636,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9582364-andrea,4,"This book by Adam Kay came to my attention in an episode of the Diving In podcast, where it was described as laugh-out-loud funny; the kind of book you want to read during a pandemic. I decided to go audio, which is still pretty new to me, and was delighted to find that the author is the narrator. Although it had some dark and/or poignant moments, it delivered the laughs while at the same time opening my eyes to the world of obgyn and the problems of the NHS (UK universal health service). On one hand I think it's a shame that Adam Kay is no longer a doctor, but on the other hand, I think he makes an excellent writer/comedian."
