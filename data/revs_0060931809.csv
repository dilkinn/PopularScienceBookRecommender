0,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,5,"This is the third Winchester book I’ve read in quick succession and I’m almost tempted to say that they just get better and better – except they probably don’t. I think they are all equally good. This one is about the ‘father of English Geology’. If the advance of knowledge really does depend on the geniuses who can see patterns where for the rest of us see only chaos – then William Smith is precisely that kind of genius: a man who ‘gets it’ and forever changes how we see the world.I’ll admit it. I’m partial to stories where the good guy wins out in the end – particularly after being faced with absurd odds. I even like stories where the guy gets the girl (or vice versa). And this book does end ‘happily even after’ – except…I didn’t come away from this book feeling particularly good about humanity. Especially not that section of humanity that is the ‘upper class’. As Winchester says during the book, it was almost as if the rich felt Smith needed to be taught a lesson for having the audacity of being both lower class and having worked out the secrets of geology before his betters.Why is it that so often – if one person has power over another person – the favourite game of those with power is humiliation? Smith was remarkably lucky in many respects – I mean, he ended up with a pension and with general respect – but for years he suffered and virtually no one lifted a finger to help him. And isn’t that the problem with systems of patronage? Even when all is done as stipulated and required one is left dangling at the whim of the patron. The humiliations Smith had to endure – most evident with the treatment meted out to him around the forced sale of his precious fossil collection – and the ‘costs’ to him of these humiliations (I mean costs in the literal sense and not just to his pride) were truly staggering. If you think the world is about 6000 years old I really couldn’t recommend this book to you – but then, besides the Bible, I couldn’t recommend any book to you. For everyone else, this really is an intensely interesting and deeply moving work. I’ve said it before – how is it possible that none of this guy’s books have been made into TV programmes? I’ve heard his talking books and I reckon he could be the David Attenborough of Geology and Lexicography. And if there is one thing the world definitely needs it is more David Attenboroughs. Come on BBC – get your finger out."

""In 1793, a canal digger named William Smith made a startling discovery. He found that by tracing the placement of fossils, which he uncovered in his excavations, one could follow layers of rocks as they dipped and rose and fell -- clear across England and, indeed, clear across the world -- making it possible, for the first time ever, to draw a chart of the hidden underside of the earth. Determined to expose what he realized was the landscape's secret fourth dimension, Smith spent twenty-two years piecing together the fragments of this unseen universe to create an epochal and remarkably beautiful hand-painted map. But instead of receiving accolades and honors, he ended up in debtors' prison, the victim of plagiarism, and virtually homeless for ten years more. Finally, in 1831, this quiet genius -- now known as the father of modern geology -- received the Geological Society of London's highest award and King William IV offered him a lifetime pension.The Map That Changed the World is a very human tale of endurance and achievement, of one man's dedication in the face of ruin. With a keen eye and thoughtful detail, Simon Winchester unfolds the poignant sacrifice behind this world-changing discovery.
MY COMMENTS:Simon Winchester had William Smith's diaries to help him compile this detailed account of one man's struggle to open up the science of stratigraphy (geology). What should have been a joyous discovery, turned into one man's ceaseless war against his own humiliation and ill fortune, forced to waste his energies raging against the cheating and class discrimination that seemed, time and again, to frustrate him.The author kept the interest in the tale alive with his conversational tone throughout. Statements like these, brought a smile to my face: ""It was left to the genial Irish prelate James Ussher, while he was bishop of Armagh, to fix the date with absolute precision. According to his workings, which he managed to convince his clerical colleagues were impeccably accurate, God had created the world and all its creatures in one swift and uninterrupted process of divine mechanics that began on the dot of the all-too-decent hour of 9 A.M., on a Monday, October 23, 4004 B.C.""Suffice to say, William Smith's birth, on March 23, 1769, in the cottage on the edge of the green in Churchill, Oxfordshire, took place, according to their implacably held beliefs, exactly 5,772 years, four months, and sixteen days after the creation of the world. He was the first son of the local blacksmith in the hamlet of Churchill.It is within this social mileu that William Smith, with his interest in fossils and rocks, would draw up the first geological map of England and change the world of science forever. ""It was a document that was to change the face of a science—indeed, to create a whole new science—to set in train a series of scientific movements that would lead, eventually, to the inquiries of Charles Darwin, to the birth of evolutionary theory, and to the burgeoning of an entirely new way for human beings to view their world and their universe. The inevitable collision between the new rationally based world of science and the old ecclesiastical, faith-directed world of belief was about to occur—and in the vanguard of the new movement, both symbolically and actually, was the great map, and now this equally enormous atlas that John Cary of the Strand was about to publish, and the revolutionary thinking that lay behind their making.""A fascinating biography of a brilliant man. He did not have class, or money, or the right address, but he had the nerve to persist and win. Captivating. Entertaining. Excellent. To view a bigger version of the map

It was well-researched and well-written and deserved a better rating, maybe by someone interested in geology.It was about Englishman William Smith who was a common man with no wealth or title. He dedicated his life to mapping the underground of England during the Age of Enlightenment . His findings became very beneficial to the economy of England, but he gained little fame or fortune because of his class status. He ended up in debtors prison and only afterwards did he get the recognition he deserved. Then came the collision of religious beliefs and scientific reasoning with the discovery of fossils."
3,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80316998-howard,5,5 Stars for The Map That Changed The World (audiobook) By Simon Winchester read by the author. This is one of my favorite nonfiction books. This is the story of the science of geology being discovered. This is about William Smith creating the first geographical map of Britain. And this new science was starting to challenge the church’s view that the earth was only a few thousand years old. 
4,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56491386-kirsty,4,"Despite having read and very much enjoying Simon Winchester’s The Alice Behind Wonderland, about Alice Liddell, the inspiration for Lewis Carroll’s Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, it has taken me an awfully long time to pick up another book of his. I bought The Map That Changed the World: A Tale of Rocks, Ruin and Redemption from a Salvation Army bookshop a couple of years ago, intending to read it immediately, and for some reason it has languished on my to-read shelf ever since.The Map That Changed the World became an international bestseller following its publication in 2001, on the two-hundredth anniversary of Smith’s first map. The Spectator declares ‘Winchester is the perfect narrator for this lovely story of success against the odds’. The Financial Times calls the book ‘a fascinating tribute to the man who put the unseen world of the underground on display’, and the New Statesman comments ‘this is what a model of popular history can be.’The Map That Changed the World tells the true story of William Smith. Though he was ‘not rich or well-connected’, his passion for fossils and ‘his twenty-year obsession with single-handedly mapping the geology of Britain’ mark him out as a man who should be praised. Smith, however, pursued his interests at great personal cost; his wife suffered madness, and his work was stolen by jealous men who eventually pushed him into ruin. Although Smith became ‘one of the most significant men of the nineteenth century’, he is largely forgotten in the modern world.‘Strata’ Smith, as Winchester occasionally calls him, was a man who ‘crossed boundaries of class, wealth and science to produce a map that fundamentally changed the way we view the world.’ His first map was produced in 1801, and a revised version appeared in 1815. This later map hangs behind ‘a pair of huge sky-blue velvet curtains’ in Burlington House, London. It measures over eight by six feet, and is ‘the work of a craftsman, lovingly done, the culmination of years of study, months of careful labour.’ This was the first geological map of anywhere in the world, which alone ‘heralded the beginnings of a whole new science… It is a map that laid the foundations of a field of study that culminated in the work of Charles Darwin.’ Smith’s output is remarkable for many a reason. Not only did he create the first geological map in the world, but he did so entirely by himself. In his prologue, Winchester writes: ‘All the Herculean labours that were involved in the mapping of the imagined underside of an entire country were accomplished not by an army or a legion or a committee or a team, but by the lone individual who finally put his signature to the completed document: William Smith, then forty-six years old, the orphaned son of the village blacksmith from the unsung hamlet of Churchill in Oxfordshire.’In The Map That Changed the World, Winchester has conducted his own research into Smith and the social and scientific climate in which he lived. He has also included fragments of Smith’s diaries and letters, in order to present a portrait of a ‘long-forgotten man’. Winchester opens his account in 1819, when Smith is released from a London debtor’s prison known as the King’s Bench. The author both sets the scene and captures Smith for his readers immediately: ‘Some less-charitable souls might call him a rather plain-looking man, perhaps even a little ugly. His forehead slants backwards, a trifle alarmingly. His nose is rather too large for comfort. His mutton-chop whiskers are wayward. But in most of the pictures he seems to be wearing an expression that serves by way of compensation for the facial shortcomings: he seems by his looks at once tolerant, kindly and perhaps even vaguely amused by the dull complexities of his life.’Winchester’s commentary then shifts backward in time to examine Smith’s life. He was born at the beginning of a period of immense change, in most fields. Winchester writes: ‘And when Smith was born, the rate and scale of alteration to society was such that even those in so small and isolated a settlement as Churchill, Oxfordshire, would be bound to notice.’ It is this which impacts upon Smith, urging him to leave his tiny hamlet as soon as he is able, to go and work on designing a network of canals.It was when Smith was employed at a mine near Bath that he really notices the differences in the rock structure of the earth. Winchester comments: ‘Smith could only stare at the junction between the rocks and wonder - why? How? How could one possibly make sense of such a bizarre arrangement?’ But make sense of it Smith did, refining his thoughts and research over time, and leading him to make a number of important, even pivotal, discoveries.The Map That Changed the World appealed to me on so many levels. I am always keen to learn about figures who have been largely forgotten over the centuries, and knowing very little about Smith piqued my interest. I was also a keen collector of fossils as a child, and very much enjoy cartography too. Here, Winchester has presented an engaging account of a man who so deserves to be remembered. He has included a wealth of extra information of interest to the reader, including a stratigraphical column with the timespan of each geological period; a glossary of terms; notes on sources; a list of recommended further reading; and an index. The frontispiece is adorned with a copy of Smith’s 1815 geological map. Winchester’s writing is engaging and highly accessible, and he wonderfully handles his primary material. Quite a dramatic tale in parts, The Map That Changed the World held my interest throughout, and whilst informative, it never felt overloaded with facts. Anyone remotely interested in cartography, geography, geology, or just the eighteenth- and nineteenth-centuries, is bound to get a lot out of this wonderful book."
5,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/646953-patrick,3,"This is a very interesting story poorly told. The preface and the first chapter (both) tell the whole story in a nutshell, and the rest of the book goes on to fill out the details in an awkward, often overblown manner. The story is however quite compelling, about the dramatic life of William Smith, the first person to understand, survey and then map the stratification of rocks in England, thereby establishing modern geology. His is a cautionary tale for would be entrepreneurs that are not from the moneyed classes (yes we still have them just they did in early 19th C. England). His reactions to continual snubbing by the upper classes and theft of his IP reminded me of more than one would-be startup CEO: overspending and overreaching in an attempt to play with the big boys of finance. If you can deal with Winchester's arch prose, it is worth the read. Ideally, someone would write one of those longish pieces in the New Yorker about the story - that is really all the material there really is, and a better written narrative would do the subject considerable benefit.[N.B. I read a reviewers' draft that might have been somewhat rougher than final copies - I can only hope so]."
6,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10312986-lyn-elliott,3,"Winchester's biography of William Smith, one of the 'fathers' of English geology, should sing with the joy of intellectual discovery, but doesn't quite get there for me.From the start, Winchester flags the collapse of Smith's fortunes and the misappropriation of his findings by wealthier, better connected men than he. He builds anticipation of misfortune throughout until the bailiffs actually arrive and Smith is imprisoned for debt. When it actually happens it is almost a relief, as the long way down has been an exhausting journey. For me, this overweighs excitement at the significance of Smith's realisations that the laying down of fossils in different strata of England's landscape marked the beginning of a modern scientific view of the earth's history as one marked by long periods of changing climate, flora and fauna; that species appeared and disappeared; and that the record of all these great changes lay in rocks and could be read.This challenged creation myths of all faiths, and must have influenced Charles Darwin's thinking as he worked towards his theory of evolution. Winchester may have written about this, but I confess to skipping through sections on Smith's struggles, and may have missed it."
7,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1188122-kara-babcock,4,"Rocks. They’re old.Thank you for reading my review.OK, I guess I’ll go into slightly more detail. In his phenomenal 
A Short History of Nearly Everything
, Bill Bryson devotes slightly less than a page to William Smith and the first geological map of Britain. This is likely a result of Bryson (or his editors) striving in vain to meet that promise of being “short”. Bryson promises us a more “comprehensive” account in The Map That Changed the World. I didn’t actually find this book through A Short History of Nearly Everything; I only saw the reference when I went back to look up what Bryson has to say about Smith. One day I casually stumbled upon the story of William Smith, fossils, and rocks, and this seemed like the sensible book to buy in order to learn more. This guess largely turned out to be correct, with some minor quibbles and caveats.Much like 
Longitude
, another non-fiction book that I read recently, The Map That Changed the World is a semi-biographical look at the contributions of one man to a field of scientific study—in this case, geology. By definition it attributes to William Smith an importance that might be overstated, in the sense that English geology seemed to be doing fine without him and probably would have continued doing fine if he hadn’t come on the scene. Yet it’s true that Smith’s contributions are both important and, considering his background and his often penurious circumstances, all the more outstanding. If one wants to examine how one individual affected a scientific discipline, few choices would be more appropriate than William Smith.Simon Winchester begins by describing Smith’s release from debtor’s prison before jumping back to his origins and start as a surveyor in rural England. As with most endeavours, Smith’s come to fruition through a careful combination of skill, hard work, and luck. Sometimes he’s in the right place at the right time to get a job that lets him travel around England, looking at layers of rock—such is the case with his position surveying for the new Somerset Canal. As Winchester unfolds Smith’s life before us, we get to see how the economics of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries played a role in shaping scientific inquiry. The vast, industrial scope of coal mining gave Smith both the access and the reason to delve deep beneath the Earth and look at layers of strata. More importantly, the rich upper class’ interest in being able to find coal before digging up their property provided an economic interest in Smith’s studies. Although it certainly seems like Smith was both clever and dedicated, I can’t help but form the impression that he also happened to be born at the right time, and in the right country. England, Winchester explains, was ripe for a revolution in scientific thinking. And Smith’s discovery that fossils are the key indicators of a rock’s type and age would begin that revolution.If Smith is correct, then the Earth is not six thousand years old. It’s far, far older. This was not the popular view in Smith’s time and would not be for some time after his death—as Winchester is careful to point out, Smith himself did not care to go so far as to posit how or why stratification occurs the way it does. He just reported what he had observed, and used it to make useful predictions. But it was a start, a beginning in a chain of reasoning that would lead geologists to speculate that the Earth’s past extends into the millions and billions of years, and culminate in Charles Darwin publishing a controversial treatise about the origins of humankind.The way that Smith and so many scientists clung to the Biblical interpretation of the origins and age of the Earth stayed on my mind as I read this book. Although I’m an atheist, I do not view science and religion as irreconcilable. However, people who subscribe to fundamentalism but also claim to be adherents of science do puzzle me. There are, to put it lightly, contradictions between these two schools of thought. And with science, as with fundamentalism, it seems to me that it is hypocritical to pick and choose. What makes science so enduring, so potent—dare I say, so sexy—is that everything is interconnected in incredibly complex and interesting ways. So Smith’s ideas lead inexorably to this idea that the Earth is much older than six thousand years. Our ability to calculate, now, things like the speed and direction of motion of planets and satellites and even stars lets us “turn the clock back”, so to speak, and look at the solar system thousands or even millions of years ago. Fundamentalists reject all these claims and come up with very creative ways of doing so. But many watch television. Many use cars. Many wear glasses and take medicine. These are all a result of the same science that tells us the Earth is ancient and the stars themselves gave us life. How can one accept all the more mundane marvels but reject the other ones and still claim to be consistent? (Obviously it’s very easy if one does not claim consistency, but for some reason people get offended when you go up to them, call them a hypocrite, and begin itemizing contradictions in their personal belief system….)But I digress. The Map That Changed the World got me thinking about science, the nature of science and how we do science, as any good science history book should do. It also chronicles the difficulties Smith faced as he began working on his geological map. Some of these were difficulties of his own making—he lived as if he were well off and had a stable income, and he married a wife who was an emotional and financial burden. Some were a product of the still-rigid class system, wherein Smith was an uneducated country bumpkin, and upstart whose contributions should be overlooked whenever possible and stolen if not. The story of how George Greenough blocked Smith from membership in the fledgling Geological Society—which was, after all, just supposed to be a dinner club for gentlemen—and then plagiarized from Smith’s map to produce one of lesser utility on behalf of the Society is exactly the type of dirty scientific feud I love to read about. And Winchester delivers on all of these accounts.I also loved reading about Smith’s dedication to this singular task. He travelled all across England and Wales to compile observations and evidence for this map! Granted, England isn’t quite as large as, say, Canada—but he did this on foot or by coach. And he had to go into the field, dig into the mud, get dirty, day after day for decades in order to get the data he required. For that alone he deserves a medal! A note about the map at the beginning of this book remarks that its similarity to modern maps is all the more impressive because it is the work of one man, whereas modern maps are the work of large, coordinated teams. This is a keen observation. Despite being terrible with money, unlucky in love, and reluctant to publish until it was almost too late, William Smith was a profoundly hard worker. I’m not quite certain I’m as eager to buy into Winchester’s attempts to turn this into a discussion over the gulf between fieldworkers and theorists, but at the very least, it made me, as an armchair mathematician extraordinaire, feel very lazy!There are a few aspects of Winchester’s writing style that marred my otherwise unqualified enjoyment of this book. He is overly-enamoured of the passive voice. It kept reappearing, feeling very out of place by dint of Winchester’s attempt to give his account a sweeping, narrative arc. Also, while Winchester is very diligent about noting when we have evidence available to us and when something is mere speculation, he does like to indulge in considerable parenthetical digressions about what might have motivated Smith to do one thing or another. That is to say, he injects too many of his own conjectures and opinions about Smith for my own liking. I’m not sure how to say this without saying I would have preferred a drier account. I kept comparing Winchester unfavourably to Bryson, who always seems to manage to make the subject of his writing the focus of any sentence rather than his own thoughts on the matter.This is a nicely designed book, with some cool illustrations, and my edition has a colour plate in the middle depicting a map. (Alas, it’s so small that the detail is almost indecipherable.) Yet it probably could have been shorter. Winchester includes an entire chapter that is nothing but an interlude describing his childhood fascination with fossils along the cliffs of Dover. It’s informative in its own way, and I suppose for some readers it might be the highlight of the book; for me, however, it was a distraction from the main story of William Smith. Coupled with Winchester’s tendency to hop through the chronology—occasionally in vexing ways—in order to highlight certain themes, thereby repeating or relating some facts more than once, and The Map That Changed the World is slightly long-winded.Neither of these criticisms are enough to stop me from recommending this book to others, mind you. I’m not as certain I will read other things by Winchester, but I’ll take a look at his catalogue and see if anything else piques my interest. This is far from a perfect book, and there were times when I found my mind wandering to other topics or found myself cursing the overabundance of passive constructions. Overall, though, The Map That Changed the World is a detailed and passionate account of the life of William Smith and his contributions to English geology. It has its rough patches. But it promises to tell the story of how one map changed everything, and in this respect, the book definitely succeeds.

8,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1526851-will-byrnes,3,"This is the tale of William Smith, the first guy to create a geologic map. He identified the strata that makes up what comprises the ground for quite a ways down and figured out that it was standard. The story is an interesting one, about a poor bastard beset by the rich types who stole his work and denied him the credit he so deserved, to the point where the guy actually was consigned to debtor’s prison. His social life was even less successful. Late in life he married a much younger woman of fragile psychological stability. She was an added burden. Her maladies included nymphomania. This is not a book for the average reader. Perhaps a geeky orientation might be desirable to truly enjoy this book. And I found that it sagged towards the end. I would recommend it, but not to just anyone."
9,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14546476-bellagbear,4,"This is truly a beautifull homage for a man who gained recognition for his work very late in his own life. This is a scientific non-fiction book, but the way it is told it reads like a great adventure novel of the 'quest towards a geological map', which is in my opinion has been a very good choice to tell the story. Also it is obvious that the author is a fan of William Smith and his work which made this a very happy book to read because the author has so much compassions for Smith's trials.Because of its adventurous vibe this book is very accesible also for readers who do not know anything about geology (like me). I do not pretend I understood the whole book, but the more technicial parts I could easily skip in favour of the story.So recommended for everyone with a general like for science; maps; geology or everyone who loves a story with an adventurous, altough a bit naive, protagenist, betrayal and a fitting reward at the end for the good guy."
10,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2315202-cameron,4,"Though the writing style is not quite what his other books have been, I have to give it 4 stars for a thoroughly interesting trek through the world of eccentric 19thC English science. I love this period's history of scientific exploration and the pure enthusiasm and fearlessness and determination of many of the explorations into hitherto unknown realms. Geology was practically brand new except for elite, upper class fossil, mineral and rock collectors who met occasionally at elaborate dinner parties and drank and talked but did little or no field studies. Then along comes this nobody who for 20 years is crawling around engineered trenches and digging below the surfaces and who makes the most formative, huge, hand colored map of all of the British Isles and what lay beneath the green heath. In come the aristocrats to discredit him.Wonderful read."
11,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1647517-victor-sonkin,4,"This is an account of the life of William Smith, who more or less single-handedly, without any special means or education, and much against the spirit of the time (before Lyell, let alone Darwin) created and perfected the first geological map of Great Britain (minus Scotland, more or less); the map the book tells about was published in 1815, but recognition only came to Smith a generation later, when he received the first Wollaston medal (the first of its kind; to this day, this is more or less the equivalent of the Nobel prize in geology). The book is just as it presents itself and as it should be: clear, well told, with small but relevant digressions, well-researched and everything."
12,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5422600-kristi-thielen,5,"I have read Simon Winchester’s superb book once before but reread it because the story of William Smith is so compelling. The humbly-born Smith is widely regarded as the father of geology, and labored diligently in the early 19th century to learn about the geology of Great Britain and eventually create “The Great Map,” the original of which now hangs in the Burlington House, in London. Smith’s science was far ahead of its time, when most earth “scientists” were wealthy dilletantes who scorned those, like Smith, who actually labored in the field to learn what they knew. And even these gentlemen were wedded to the Biblical idea of the earth’s age and unwilling to accept the deep time that Smith’s findings would support. It would be churlish to overly criticize Smith’s poor decisions: a habit of buying homes and property he couldn’t keep up and a very ill-advised marriage; for his life was a series of frustrations and humiliations entirely out of his control. Snobbery, professional jealousy, associations that failed him and peers who stole his work led to a sad downfall. But his life eventually takes a turn for the brighter and this makes his story a dramatic but satisfying one. In and around Smith’s life story, the author provides very readable and interesting detail about the geology of Great Britain and the beginnings of the science itself. Highly recommended! "
13,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/440651-dov-zeller,4,"When I was a New York manny (before moving to western MA to go to grad school) one of the families I worked for gave me this book. I think I was probably supposed to return it, but wound up having to leave NY in a hurry because of a health and then a housing situation. So I still have this on my non-fiction shelves and every once in a while pick it up and flip through the pages and think about the ""discovery"" (such a loaded and often unwieldy term) of the consistent and patterned behavior of earth's sedimentary layers and one man in particular who took that information and ran with it (though sometimes into walls and closed doors). Many goodreads reviewers are less than satisfied with the delivery of this book, and I hear that. There are also some notices of misinformation. And others argue that there is enough substance in here for a pamphlet but not necessarily a book-length manuscript. I think all of these things are fair points to make, but I still found that the book was enjoyable and educational. So, somewhere between a 3 and a 4. "
14,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/870702-gale,2,"I have been reading this book for over a year. The story is fascinating. Winchester has the most irritating writing style I have ever encountered. It is hard to force myself to pick up the book. Sad, because William Smith and his geologic map of England mark an important milestone in the history of science. They are also important to understanding the development of the concept of deep time. Creationists are often stymied when they learn that Smith was able to use fossil species to place the rock strata in time order long before the theory of evolution by natural selection was even a gleam in Darwin's eye."
15,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28825839-stephie-williams,4,"This is a book about William Smith who figured out that only certain fossils are found in certain strata, and you could use this information to created a vertical map of the earth underneath our feet or below ground. For this he used his surveying skills and multitudes of physical observations in the English countryside. His life was not so smooth. He went from employment to self-employment, which gave him more time and freedom to explore and study what he was finding. At times his jobs would bring in a nice bit of money, but not always. This eventually ended him up in debtor's prison because he could not keep up with his mortgages and rents. He was eventually let out of debtor’s prison, which were mild confinements compared to regular prisons, and slowly people started to recognize the importance of his work and the map that he worked for most of his life. Without him geology and evolutionary theory would have taken more time to become settled sciences.I only have one comments on a part of the text. Brackets [] show page number with the Kindle edition pagination.[173] In mentioning the delay of radiographic dating in relation to ammonite fossils he states, “. . . more or less exactly 178 million years ago.” (my italics) In seems exceedingly odd that you would use a phrase like “more or less” in combination with “exactly” for such a high figure. Anyway I got kick out of reading this.Simon Winchester has written another very good book. It does not matter what his subject is he explains it well and perhaps writes even better. My favorites of his are the two on the making of the Oxford English Dictionary (the go to academic dictionary).I think anybody who likes good writing would enjoy this book, unless they cannot stand the topic."
16,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6889171-david,5,"William Smith is one of those characters from the English industrial revolution who led such a fascinating life, that it is surprising that he hasn't more biographers. The only other that I have encountered is a much earlier work by John L Morton which are harder to obtain. Many, especially the Scots, would disagree with the claim that Smith was the father of modern geology. Most, myself included, would bestow that accolade on James Hutton. However, for my money, William Smith's is a better story and of interest to those who did not previously have the slightest interest in rocks. It is the life story of much flawed character with the single-minded, stubborn determination, common to the genius irrespective of their chosen field.

As a kid I would linger over maps in the encyclopedia, particularly those maps that described terrain, geology, natural resources, etc. so I was bound to like this book, especially considering the dust jacket is a fold-out, full-color reproduction of the map under discussion. This book, with its somewhat hyperbolic title, is a mix of biography, history, and science, and it is particularly good reminder of just how rough and contentious the beginnings of a new area of science can be.I found two primary scenes of conflict in this book: that between religion and scientific progress, and that between classes, specifically the moneyed elite vs the working class. Smith's work on understanding the actual age of the rocks and the fossils was considered ungodly since it contradicted the received wisdom of that age that the earth was about 6000 years old. and yet he allowed the evidence to guide his thought processes, collecting specimens, and organizing the data in such a way as to reveal the true age of the rocks, in good scientific fashion.The other conflict played out in numerous ways, including the co-opting of original work by Smith, who was considered of lower class, by others who were in the upper class. The repeated spurning of Smith by the various Societies of the time was also a direct result of class stratification, only rectified very late in his life. Through it all shone the light of Smith's ceasing hard work, constant traveling, and collecting samples. His obsessive attention to detail when producing the actual map, which is a thing of beauty.This story has perhaps too many details about Smith's personal life, for example his difficult marriage that from my perspective seemed pretty devoid of love, but for other readers these personal details probably make the story more poignant. Overall this book was satisfying and edifying, and I enjoyed learning something about this overlooked historical figure."
19,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15659828-s,3,"MAP is 3/5 because half of it is geology and most people are not fascinated by geology. so, it's a weaker Winchester book although apparently the crowd disagrees and rates it 3rd in overall popularity. in fact, according to GR, it's half as popular as Krakatoa and twice or even four times the Winchester back catalogue.SW is eminently readable, and although I'm just about finished all the paperbacks stacked up on my bookshelf, Noble Lordships is proving sort of a slog. so I guess I get to summarize Simon Winchester in this review.the thing about SW is that he's that bright kid with thick glasses eager about geology while everyone else is starting to get pimples and become interested in the other sex. there's a quality of innocence in S. Winchester that accounts for his wide-ranging academic interest, and allows him to be so fascinated in the OED, for example, that he wrote two books about it. it takes a special person to write a book about, well, rocks, and to research the stories, intrigues, and culture of the time. S.W. both a scientific mind and a good writer, is a unique constellation of talents. so the eccentric sweep of his works and his lifetime in journalism both combine to create an ouevre that is both remarkable and composed of extremely quick reads.a lot of writers who have multiple specialties (whether it be they write medical thrillers on the one hand and travel fiction on the other) are only appealing in one genre. Simon Winchester is a strong travel writer and he's strong in the historical academia he also specializes in. even this 3 wasn't horrible-- you just skipped the geology sections and went on to the drama and culture parts. I strongly recommend this great author to the reading public."

As a result of his efforts mines were opened, canals built and the industrial heritage of the UK was set. Winchester has researched the subject well and has a passion for both the man and the science that infects the reader from start to finish. While I didn't enjoy this as much as some of his other books, for reasons I can't quite put my finger on, it is still a thoroughly good read with superb supporting illustrations, footnotes and background information. The glossary at the back clarifies some of the terminology for those who are not so familiar with the subject without being condescending or patronising and the bibliography has some great suggestions for further reading. Overall another great book from a brilliant science writer."

Yes, I enjoyed his book The Professor and the Madman and yes, I was desperate for a talking book, but really a book about a man who figured out how to map England below ground?Well to be honest, it was fascinating. Occasionally I had trouble following the science and sometimes I wondered if the book had maps or pictures that I would be interested in. Neither of these things were a real problem. Whenever I would think it was time to quit or actually read the book, Winchester would talk about something that really caught my attention.I don't still know why this book seemed like the right choice at the time, but it was. I now know a bunch of irrelevant facts about the geology of Great Britain and I had a fun time learning them."

At first it was hard to get into the book, but I grew quite interested in the story as time passed. Smith's life was full of ups and downs, and is especially interesting to realize that his career advancement and recognition was actually severely hampered by his social status. His marriage was difficult because his wife had mental illness, and they never had children. A nephew who lived with them followed in his uncle's footsteps and I was glad to know that he had some positive family interaction in his life. An unusual and remarkable story.Simon Winchester writes wonderful nonfiction! I am looking forward to the next title I choose to read by him."

I do want to know about this man, who he was and what times he lived in. More important, I want to understand why his story is meaningful. I got all of that, sometimes in much more detail than was really needed. What I had trouble with is the actual geology. There is a great chapter devoted to the fascinating geology of Britain but I really needed to call on Google to get me through it. Once I saw this map properly, the light bulb went on and it all made sense. Testament to the power of a good map, I got a glimpse of why this one was so revolutionary."

The subject is interesting and I was compelled to read it at the realization that this brings up so many interrelated ideas - not to mention the cultural impact.

26,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/630575-jeanne,4,A fascinating look at how William Smith's discovery changed how the world was and is seen. The birth of modern geology. 
27,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53294398-carl,4,"I read this book solely based on the author's previous work, The Professor and the Madman, which is one of my favorite books. I was not disappointed. Save one chapter, this is a very good read. I could have done without Ch. 11 A Jurassic Interlude, it is a long slow march through history. Then the reader is rewarded with Chs. 12-17, they are fantastic and I couldn't put it down. The story is about William Smith, THE Father of Geology, who unfortunately was not recognized for his contributions to this new (at the time) science until much too late in his life. He spent the better part of his adult life in pursuit, at his own expense, of the map that would change the world. His map would show the rock stratification of England and Wales, which would have a huge impact on its economy (think coal, limestone, etc.). For the first time, landowners had an idea of what was beneath them. Smith had the ability to view land in his mind in 4-D and was then able to reproduce it on a color coded map first published in 1815. Smith used fossil assemblages to determine rock layer order. This is where his true genius came in. It is, for the most part, a sad story of Smith working hard, receiving little recognition from his peers, not being offered a membership into the newly formed Geological Society because of his common man status, going broke and ending up in debtor's prison, all while married to a woman who herself was going mad. But you never stop rooting for him. His name truly belongs with all the other great early scientists we think of. Unfortunately, the map today resides in the Geological Society of England, behind blue curtains and is only revealed when asked. His massive fossil collection is also not on display and sits the archives of a museum in England. All in all, an enjoyable read about the founding of the science of geology and the man who did it."
28,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7973311-claire,3,"I never heared of William Smith before. The life of this pioneer in geology and and the way he made his important map are an interesting topic. I enjoyed the fact the his life was described against the background of Victorian society. The way think8ng shifted and the world changed during a rather short time, is utterly fascinating. "
29,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11782744-kira,3,"This book is a snooze fest. I appreciate what William Smith has done, but perhaps the author isn't doing him full justice.

32,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6829322-clark-hays,4,"The father of stratigraphic maps who “rocked” the world of GeologyGeologic time moves slowly. So too, apparently, does geologist time. This is a fascinating book about a man who almost single-handedly freed the science of Geology from the clutches of those blinded and shackled by religion, bad science and/or narcissism. And yet William Smith almost died in obscurity and absolute poverty, with his methods discredited and work stolen.Smith was born in 1769 into the lower class and, despite having the deck stacked against him and limited means, he rose tantalizingly close to prominence — both academic and financial. Thanks to his keen intellect and curious mind, he noticed something revolutionary while surveying and cutting canals across England, something hidden in plain sight and missed by all the learned men around him in the preceding years and centuries: layers of similar rock, no matter how twisted and contorted by upheavals, contained similar, predictable groupings of fossils. That simple observation allowed him to draw, in essence, the first stratigraphic map (of England), developing a rigorous, testable scientific method that overturned suppositions about the age of the earth and the source of fossils, and quite probably set the stage for evolutionary theory.But thanks to the scheming of intellectual dilettantes and Smith’s own almost pathological need to make bad financial decisions, he ended up in debtor’s prison. But not before marrying a much younger, apparently chronically insane woman — nymphomania was one of the many conditions with which she was diagnosed. Setting aside the fact that in those days nymphomania was more of a catch-all term for anything men found suspicious in female behavior, from healthy sexual desire to unhealthy, from intelligence to schizophrenia, she was institutionalized.This is history, so I don’t think it’s a spoiler alert to say that at the end, his name, reputation and fortunes were mostly restored and he received his just due for elevating geology out the (sorry) stone age and into the relatively sleek, modern science we all know and love today.I’ve read other books by this author and enjoy them, though this one came close at times to being pretentious with some overly flowery word choices that seemed out of keeping with the Mohs-hard science (“…the Variscan Orogeny wrought havoc with the seams…”), but it could be argued that the highly-literate language also helped evoke the era. I also jotted a few notes in the margin when I found him presuming access to the internal thought processes of some of the principal players, as I found it a little distracting.But all in all, it was a highly enjoyable read and filled with interesting asides such as how Smith might have first become interested in fossils thanks to Oxfordshire poundstones, local stones of uniquely similar size and weight, used to balance butter scales. The stones were actually the fossilized remains of sea urchins (also, significantly, I learned that “urchin” is Latin for hedgehog). Or how the Koreans have a word for an exceptionally long span of time: imagine a mountain of granite one mile high and every 1,000 years, an angel flies by and brushes the mountaintop with her wing, dislodging one grain of the rock. The span is how long it would take to reduce the mountain to sea level. Maddeningly, he doesn’t share what that word is.It’s an immensely enjoyable book, with lots of tangential seams for readers to explore, a clear mastery of the subject matter — both historically (capturing the era), and technically (capturing the geology). And it seems a fitting tribute for a man who changed the world, almost lost everything and regained a tiny piece of fame and glory at the very end.Thanks to William Smith, “For the first time the earth had a provable history, a written record that paid no need or obeisance to religious teaching and dogma, that declared its independence from the kind of faith that is no more than the blind acceptance of absurdity.”It’s worth noting that I read this as we embarked on a trip to the Big Island of Hawaii where we visited Volcanoes National Park — one of the youngest and most active and intense geologic settings in the world today — and saw the extension of his work in not just the maps on display, but also in refined theories of geology and our still-evolving understanding of the earth we live on."
33,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43477226-todd-stockslager,3,"Review title: Standing on solid groundThis is a standard Winchester popular narrative nonfiction. Part biography, part layman's science, the writing is solid, even though the subject seems a little thin for even 300 small pages. Not to denigrate Mr. Smith, though it seems like he endured plenty of that during his lifetime, but this material might have been written into a long magazine feature--if magazines were still which carried long features were still published, and if people still read them. First the title: Smith was an early 19th century engineer-practitioner who helped build canals, find coal seams and plan mines over them, and study and improve drainage of farm fields. While he had little formal education and was born lower-class, his hard-earned practical success earned him commissions with wealthy businessmen, governments, and noble gentry and took him across the British countryside where he redeemed his time studying and drawing the rock seams and fossils associated with them. With his extensive knowledge he was able to create in 1815 a huge hand-drawn three-dimensional map of the strata of rocks underneath the surface of the entire country, and more importantly create a theory identifying the age, pattern and location of the strata based on the fossils present in the rock. He verified the theory by his field work, and his huge map, more than 8 foot by 6 foot and all the work of his own hand, is recognized as a foundational document in the history of geology and a scientific and historical artifact of immense value. Then the denigration: because of his low birth, lack of education, and a singular focus on field work that left him little time or inclination for publishing his findings and maps, he was passed over for commissions and membership in the fledgling Geological Society, and his work was plagiarized without attribution or compensation. Thus ignored and deprived of rightful income, his life and career reached such a low ebb that at one point he was consigned to debtor's prison! Not that he was completely clear of blame on his own: based on Winchester's research Smith made unwise real estate purchases and spending decisions that exceeded his income and left him vulnerable to debt collectors. Plus, though the documentation is sketchy (based on Smith's journals and letters), his wife was mentally ill, necessitating large out-of-pocket expenses up to and including institutional care. And there's the rub that knocks a point off my rating: the documentation just appears too thin to support even this slim volume, so it feels like Winchester ends up padding to length to justify the book and not the feature length magazine piece this might have been. It isn't bad writing, mind you, just not as tightly edited or as compactly told as Smith's story might have been. Smith appears to be an engaging character, worthy of Winchester's attention, and his findings did literally change the world we saw under the surface (his work was the basis for the geological knowledge that enabled underground mineral resources to be identified based on the rock strata and fossils in them), so if this is your topic then this is your book. "
34,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2660354-cartercam,4,"I found myself generally frustrated by Smith. I suspect some of my frustration may have been constructed by the author, but nonetheless it was exasperating to read how much he desperately wanted recognition, but really didn't do much about it. How he kept such expensive habits though the baliff was beating down his door. Though I don't live in the class-divided England of the early 1800s that probably drove some of the behavior, his actions were surprisingly relatable. I feel like I know people that would have behaved the same way: obliviousness and helplessness. Which made Smith a better character I believe, though I was apprehensive through much of the book knowing his downfall was coming.I know the book drew heavily on Smith's journals and other records, but I do wish more time had been spent on his actual investigations. The best we get is Smith leaping off of coaches to hammer rocks and collect samples. Maybe there is not much else to describe to the layperson without boring them completely. It is probably my own bias as a geologist who has done a tiny bit of mapping to want more.I did like the chapter where the author journeys through England on the upper- and middle-Jurrassic divide. It made me want to travel the same path and see the steep contact he described. He also made English geology sound stupendously simple. Which maybe it is?Smith was described pretty much exactly how I expected him, and pretty much any old geologist, to be in old age: beaten down by field work, kind of bumbling, in good spirits. It made it all the more unsurprising to me that he doesn't have a more prominent place in history. So many of our historical figures were brilliant marketers, and Smith was not. Again, relatable. And makes you realize how skewed our history is and how much has been lost due to a lack of advertising skills.I was glad the book did not delve further into how the religious sector reacted to Smith's work and geology in general (beyond the line or two about how they thought his work supported theirs).I also liked the author's description about how some of the English villages are ""very English"" because of the geology and I feel he does a good job of bringing to light the influence geology in our everyday lives, from building stone to the atmosphere of towns on certain outcrops, etc. That is part of the reason I find geology so, so fascinating; it is the underpinnings of pretty much everything, from the great empires of history to the founding of civilization to evolution. From agriculture to trade routes to extinctions to fire gods. Is there anything else that is so far-reaching that is yet so easily observable?"
35,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26729-felicity,3,"I am a big fan of Simon Winchester's books in general, but this one I found less enjoyable than his others. There were occasional inaccuracies (""bird progenitor pterodactyl""? What?) or oversimplifications (sedimentation can't occur without an ocean?) which bothered me, as well as a certain habit of repetition. I am not sure these flaws were more pronounced here so much as his usual sterling qualities had less range for expression. This is, after all, a fairly straightforward story. Though William Smith's accomplishments shaped the history of geology, his life and career are fashioned on the scale of the personal, the regional. Where Winchester has excelled, in A Crack in the Edge of the World and Krakatoa, in tracking down scores of accounts and sources and using them to fashion a multi-faceted portrait of vast cataclysm, here he has a smaller canvas to paint. He has fewer sources -- Smith's papers and abortive autobiography, his nephew's biography of him -- as well. There is less here for Winchester to thoroughly investigate and vividly imagine for us, and less surprise. Smith's ill fortune and lack of recognition is hardly startling, since it fits into a pattern in the history of the sciences in Britain, as Winchester notes.I'm glad Winchester wrote this book. It's unfair that Smith's posterity should be confined to those who took Sedimentology and Stratigraphy courses in college, and I was glad to learn more about him than the single day's lecture I remember from that class. It was edifying, well-written and interesting. However, I feel it could have been pruned quite a bit.Notes on the audiobook: The author narrated his own book, and did it admirably. His accents for quotes -- notably Smith's own Oxfordshire -- were lovely."
36,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17609571-peter-ellwood,5,"My voyage of discovery of the latter half of the eighteenth century marches triumphantly on. My goodness, there are some cracking books* out there on this subject, and this is surely one of them. I tended to think of the nineteenth century as the quintessential time of intellectual ferment and bursts of creativity, which made England the centre of the imaginative world at that time; but in fact it’s easy to see that it all started in the eighteenth century. How on earth did a simple blacksmith’s son, born into an era which swore blind that the earth was no more than 5,000 years old, and that every word of the bible’s account of creation was literally true: manage to work out that you could predict the geology of a place by studying the fossils, which told you exactly when the each layer had been formed? How did such a humble man work out how to map it all, in ways that still define the world? But he did. The Map That Changed the World is an account of how it happened.Beware reader. If you find rocks and fossils boring, then perhaps this book is not for you. But if you have any interest in the subject at all, this account is actually, positively, exciting! It’s an amazing tale of intelligence and creativity, set in a time and place when England was gently fizzing with ideas. You can only sit back and marvel at William Smith’s contribution to the world – literally. In his quiet way the man was a genius.Simon Winchester’s account is pitch perfect. He is a fine writer and his whimsical, quietly humorous prose hits exactly the right mark consistently. I must read more of this guy’s work.* If you haven’t read them, other not-to-be-missed, five star books on the same period are Richard Holmes’ Age of Wonder, and Jenny Uglow’s The Lunar Men. Read all three books and you’ll wish you could go back in a time machine to see such wonder in ferment."

I got the paper back with that comment on it, and I reacted with scorn (I confess I didn't even know what 'diffident' meant before I started to feel offended).Simon Winchester writes books about interesting and unusual people, in this case William Smith, the man who mapped the geological features of Great Britain, thereby creating the field of geology.Winchester could have been more diffident about religion. From early in the book where he mentions the ""implacable"" belief system of Smith's father and mother (Smith left diaries, so maybe he wrote that his parents were forceful in their views, but in the context of the story and Winchester's general treatment of it, I had the feeling that the Smiths were simple folk -- a black smith and his wife -- and hardly a religious force of nature holding back the development of the modern world.) Any scientific discovery mentioned in the book seems to deserve credit for crushing the shackles of religion. In a couple of places, I felt that the book was making the kind of claim I've seen on Internet: ""this one shocking heresy!"" Ironically, several members of the clergy were involved in some of the discoveries. The only explanation must be that they were ""oxford-educated."" In a brief side story, Simon Winchester tells a tale of his youth at a Roman Catholic private school, and the strict nuns. Is this the source of Winchester's ""lack of diffidence""?William Smith's unusual story was fascinating: a man with a great idea, willing to pursue it with no money. Those who enjoy science will love the descriptions of the layers of stone and how they came to be. For me, I put the audio-book on double speed, and was able to pick up every thread of conversation.

There is no map to guide your way, but only a tour guide that doesn’t stop on giving suggestions – segued with non-stop gossip and unnecessary trivia.

The point of the book and the emphasis is not to debate that issue, but by throwing it out it does detract somewhat from the central story, that of a common man in uncommon times creating a new scientific method for making sense of the miles of sedimentary rock that hides beneath the grass in our collective pastures.Rather than a history of stratigraphy, it is a truly human story of success, utter failure and ultimate redemption. The author alludes to one of his sources as being in the process of writing that 'other' book--the thorough history of the birth of the science of stratigraphy with Smith as a main if not central character. Still, the amount of information about the various strata of England and Wales in this work may be more than enough for the majority of readers.It was a satisfying and worthwhile read."

As an autodidact, I love the work of men like William Smith, the father of geology, being celebrated. He's the guy who figured out the idea that the rocks and sediments of the world were deposited in regular strata which could be identified by the fossils found inside the layers. He was a self-educated canal surveyor who worked for 14 years to make the first geological survey map of England, which was the first geological survey map of anywhere. Smith made the map to popularize and disseminate his discovery of the stratification of the earth. It was plagiarized by the aristocrats who ran the geological society and only twenty years later, six years before his death, did he receive his due. An amazing story of the essential step that lead to Darwin and our understanding of the earth."

A ""commoner"" in the early 18th century, William Smith was a brilliant, self-educated, dogged, persistent, and incredibly observant man, who discovered the ""stratification"" of the earth, essentially becoming the father of modern geology. Although others would go on to take his work and refine and enhance it into our current understanding of plate tectonics and the forces that create and destroy our planet, William Smith was the first to put all the clues together into a beautiful whole: a map of England's strata. The politics and social life of the time that tried very hard to stand in his way are as interesting as the geology itself. "

It is a tale of passion for science, betrayal by colleagues who plagiarised his work, cruelty by colleagues who did not recognise his genius, and ultimately, satisfaction when his work was recognised.The story is not riveting reading, but I found the technical details fascinating and will have an admiration of what William Smith achieved and a much better understanding of the English landscape."

Winchester takes the complicated and makes it understandable.

This book reminded me of several people's characterization of male British dating habits; they tend to hang around quite a bit without making a move before even attempting to mention that they'd be happy to see you to dinner.He kept telling us that he was about to tell us about something, then he'd talk around it before finally telling us something. It was aggravating.But he is a good writer, and it is a fascinating story."
46,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8868162-ash,2,"Started reading this book for a class and decided to finish it. Not one of my better decisions. While the subject matter is interesting enough, Winchester's presentation of it is... well, horrible. This could have been an enjoyable read had it been a third of its size. Instead of writing a succinct, illuminating portrait of William Smith, he babbles. Repetition; never-ending descriptions of already sufficiently described events, landscapes, and ideas; and useless facts and accounts wore away my desire to continue reading. Poor William Smith. "
47,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/886653-deirdre,5,"I enjoy Winchester's writing style. On this occasion, I listened to the book on audio and found his speaking colorful and entertaining. For any map or geology enthusiast, this was a great read about William Smith, a self-taught canal builder. Smith is responsible for creating the first geological map of the UK but is also a fascinating character. Winchester chronicles Smith's desperate attempts to find recognition and financial stability. Smith was often plagiarized. Like many of Winchester's books, the book also share interesting non-sequiturs that tie nicely into the overall narrative. "

If the reader was really interested in geology and mapping, this would be an interesting resource, but I found it a pretty dry subject matter. I can appreciate the importance of Mr. Smith's discoveries, and the impact it had on scientific, and even religious thinking at the time. There was some interesting information about debtor's prison, and the importance of class."
49,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62704-nate,2,"Very dry read. As dry as a book about the first man to use stones to date the landscape could be. Are you snoring yet? I stuck it out though and was somewhat redeemed when the hero of the story gets his recognition after years of being a forerunner to a Steve Carell character. Originally interested in the 'Map' part of the title, but instead of Geography the book focused on Geology. Should really learn to read secondary titles from now on."

The premise was interesting, and valiant effort trying to liven up such an old topic. Usually these books are right up my alley but no dice this time. "

The author does a good job of telling William Smith's story and includes the small details of life in late 18th and early 19th century England (who knew debtor's prisons were mostly for the middle class and that prisoners could leave whenever their debts were satisfied?)

Which leads me to believe that it's the writing that I'm struggling with as opposed to the subject matter. Granted, most people would argue that geology is not an especially interesting topic (I'm not one of those people, BTW) but this is really about the public feelings about this new science that might disprove all their widely and closely held beliefs."

64,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49575307-rodney-harvill,4,"In a time when much scientific endeavor was performed by members of the wealthy upper classes who could afford to divert their attention from such mundane matters such as earning a living, it is remarkable that the orphan son of a yeoman farmer would be the one to lay the foundations of the science of geology. While providing technical support for coal mines, William Smith noticed patterns of distinct rock layers with distinct fossils in each layer and began building a mental model of the stratigraphy of England that he further refined while supporting canal construction and land drainage projects. Furthermore, this growing stratigraphic understanding enhanced his ability to successfully manage such projects as well as advise land owners of the potential mineral wealth under their property. Over time, he began drawing and publishing stratigraphic maps of different counties and regions and finally published a comprehensive stratigraphic map of the entire country. This is the “map that changed the world” by providing a systematic framework on which the field of geology could be built. It set the stage for subsequent scientists, such as Charles Lyell, to develop theories of geological evolution that influenced Charles Darwin in the development of his theory of biological evolution. In other words, the map didn’t change the world, but changed the way we understand the world.An engineer, I applaud Mr. Winchester’s efforts to draw attention to the obscure founder of geology. Those in the technical professions tend to work in obscurity, gaining public notice only if they make a spectacular mistake that causes some kind of harm. So, it is good to see such a man honored for his contributions to society.On the other hand, certain aspects of this book trouble me. I have read several other books my Mr. Winchester and can and will state that he is an outstanding writer who shows a solid understanding of his subject matter. That said, this book, more than the others by him that I have read, puts on display a deep, deep disdain for the biblical creation accounts. I am not surprised that he would disagree with them and am not troubled by that, at all. Yet, I detected a hint of glee every time he wrote about how members of the clergy sometimes helped Mr. Smith in his efforts, only to undermine in the long run their doctrines of creation. Has Mr. Winchester never heard of natural theology, the idea that we can learn about God and even honor Him in studying His creation? Sadly, the clergy did hurt their cause, but not by helping Mr. Smith. Rather, as documented in this book, some proposed that the stratigraphy of rocks and embedded fossils might be a product of the Genesis flood, only to be shot down by the clergy, who argued that the flood, as described in the Bible, would not have been sufficiently violent to produce such geological features, an interpretation in which they added their own assumptions to the biblical account, which made no statements about the violence or otherwise of the cataclysm of the flood. This, not their aid to Mr. Smith, is what enabled the fledgling science of geology to ultimately undermine the Bible. It wasn’t until the twentieth century until others, recognizing the potential geological violence of the flood, began developing a theoretical basis for the flood as the cause of the stratigraphy and fossil record that Mr. Smith observed. However, in advocating what was now a minority view, they faced and still face an uphill battle. I can’t help but wonder what might be different if those eighteenth century clergy hadn’t made such interpretations of scripture as the mild nature of the flood, the static nature of the species and the fixed locations of the continents, all of which have been long ago rejected by modern creationists. Sometimes Christians are their own worst enemy.Aside from the above-mentioned issues, I enjoyed the book. As I noted earlier in the review, Mr. Winchester is a competent writer, and his books are very well written."
65,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10085593-sarakat,2,"I almost abandoned this one several times. I thought the author included way too much flowery language and extraneous information that didn't really further the story. I would have cut quite a bit of the book including the entirety of chapter eleven. Sometimes it was just too much.The task required patience, stoicism, the hide of an elephant, the strength of a thousand, and the stamina of an ox.I love this period of scientific history and have read several great books about it, but this one suffered from a comparison with them. It is a great topic--the birth of modern Geology and the trials of William Smith in this birthing process. Smith had a truly great practical mind and was able to see the way everything fit together. So many others saw the same things as him and didn't connect the dots, so he truly deserves the title he earned. After Thomas Huxley saw the map and the terrain that Smith had observed, he bemoaned the fact that he hadn't figured it out himself.That William Smith was first to do so was a measure of the man's extraordinary achievement: to see what others could have seen but never did, to set down on paper what others might have suspected but never felt confident enough to declare.I enjoyed reading a bit about English farming history as it went from a free-for-all to well-managed, enclosed fields with modern farming methods. And livestock went from scraggly beasts that died off every winter to prized new breeds (some farmers even commissioned portraits of their best specimens) who lived all year and prompted a new age of prosperity. The French noticed the newfound wealth of the English dinner table and nicknamed the English ""Le Rosbif"". he he heThe English class system played a big part in Smith's journey. He was born in a time when the upper class disapproved of educating the lower classes so they didn't get ""ideas"". But that was slowly changing, thank goodness. Much of his troubles with the other geologists stemmed from his lowly origins when the upper class dilettantes who started the brand new Geological Society acted like real jerks and dismissed the man while stealing his work. Luckily, when the Geological Society caught up with the times and allowed members of all classes, the newer members denounced this behavior and gave Smith the credit he was due. Smith didn't do himself any favors on this front, either. He seemed to have no sense when it came to anything but science. He wasted his money, offended people for little reason, and seemed to break every promise he made to his supporters. He caused many of his hardships himself. My favorite little snippet about this was the fact that the author called it a ""map battle"" which made me think of Smith and Greenough rapping at each other in a Hamilton-esque scene. he he heAnother thing that Geology had working against it and preventing too rapid an acceptance and growth was the church. At the time, the English were pretty certain that the world was 6,000 years old, but that didn't fit with all the new information coming out, so this science grew a little more slowly than some other branches. I loved how the author described Reverend Young as having to ""engage in some interesting spiritual gymnastics"" to overcome the two warring ideas of the Earth's age in his profession and his avocation. ...though the Church may have briefly frowned, all humankind went on to benefit. That is the truth about so many things the Church disapproves of; logic and science and rational thinking eventually win every single time...eventually."
66,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/782114-nathan-albright,3,"I didn't like this book as much as I could have had the author approached the subject differently.  As someone who reads a great many books and is aware of my own biases and worldview commitments, there are really two ways that a book like this can go sideways and despite having an appealing hero in the unsung William Smith (can one imagine a more generic name than that?) the author cannot avoid making a great deal of the discussion hinge on parochial English class politics and cannot overcome false dilemmas about science and religion, both of which greatly reduce the enjoyment of this book.  So we are left with a biography of sorts about an appealing person, but where everything that is tangential to his own sympathetic life story of somewhat self-induced poverty and the rampant theft of his maps by seemingly everyone involved in geology in England at the time detracts from the enjoyment of the book because the author is trying to score points against fundamentalists or make some kind of attack on British class snobbery, both of which are not aspects of any book that I appreciate.Coming in at 300 pages of material in seventeen chapters, this book at least is able to keep up a good pace.  As if frequently the case in books, we begin in media res with a discussion of Smith's escape from penury to the north of England (1).  After that the author discusses England at the time when Smith was born (2),various geological mysteries, and alternates discussions of Smith's canal digging and the insights he gained as far as the locations where coal could be found with discussions of plate tectonics and other somewhat speculative matters of the dating of rock layers and other discussions of Smith's interactions with others in his field as well.  There are discussions of Smith's writing, his struggles with publishers, the hostility of the gentlemanly fossil collecting elite to more practical mineralogists, and the excellence about his map, and even about the way that Smith attempted to get some money by selling his collection to the British museum, and closes with a discussion of his professional vindication after he was an old man.  There are even discussions of the British system of debt prisons and their comfort level and seeming paradoxical aspect of imprisoning someone who is unable to pay a debt and also unable to work to repay a debt while imprisoned.In reading this book, I am left with two levels, at least, of reflection.  On the one hand, I have a limited but real degree of sympathy for Smith, seeing him as largely responsible for his poor marriage, his financial mistakes of overspending on real estate, and for his decision to be a freelance geologist in a rather vulnerable time, but otherwise a decent enough fellow.  On the other hand, I have very little tolerance with the perspective or approach of the author, who seems unable to recognize that he and others like him are in the same position of the fundamentalists he likes to poke fun at by extrapolating from what is known and viewing as certainty that which is only speculation and interpretation.  One would think that he would be more charitable to those who act as he does, but he seems to think he stands on more steady ground than those he criticizes, which is deeply unwise.  This book is an example of one where the context of a man and his work matters just as much (if not more) as the man and his work itself."
67,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27912126-brett-hetherington,5,"[This article was first published in Catalonia Today magazine, November 2017 under the title ""Evolution's forgotten man.""]This story begins in the late 18th century with a small boy's limitless curiosity, at first for staring at his marbles and stones, but soon this grows into a thirst for knowing what lies deep under the British countryside around him.​William Smith was unusual for many reasons. As a self-taught young man he traveled a great deal further than most parochial males from farms and this helped to fire his fascination with the natural world. Unlike almost all ""well-learned"" professionals of his day, he also had no distaste about repeatedly climbing down into dark, dangerous coal mines. Here, he was one of the first to study and report on that black mineral where it actually lay. Of course it was coal and coal miners themselves that were mainly responsible for the industrial revolution which was then putting Britain into the status of an empire-building superpower. ​One of the major founding fathers of geology, Smith went on to cover about 10,000 miles a year on foot, on horse and by carriage, cataloging the locations of all the rock and fossil formations that make up the UK. Over 14 long years, he also labouriously produced a giant hand-coloured map that showed exactly where the strata of rocks could be found under the earth. Nobody had done anything of the sort before in such a comprehensive and systematic way and two centuries later this sublime masterwork is still accurate and relevant. In his book titled “The Map that Changed the World,” Simon Winchester makes the valuable point that Smith’s “lonely and potentially soul-destroying project” was done, at this time in our history, “in a wholly unknown area of imaginative deduction; there were no teachers, no guidebooks.” As well as these limitations, Smith could have looked around and noticed that even scientists were convinced for example, that 'mountains grew like trees, organically, upwards and outwards,' all apparently from god’s design.Smith played a major part in the grinding process where religious and other superstitious beliefs were slowly being cast off (just as we today are (hopefully) living in an era where stupidity related to gender, race or sexual and national prejudices are are finally starting to die.)For most of his career Smith was also an expert in the crucial program of canal building but he was in fact snubbed by the main organisation or ‘society’ of his profession as a geologist. His working-class family background meant that a couple of the ‘perfumed’ snobs who ran and financed what was in truth little more than a gentlemen’s club’ could steal his ideas and claim them as their own. Largely as a result of this, Smith was to spend time in a debtors prison in London. He was to write with understandable bitterness that “the theory of geology is in the possession of one class of men [and] the practise in another.”Despite his on and off financial problems, William Smith clearly deserves to have a much greater place in the collective memory of science’s leading men and women. His name merits being up there with Charles Darwin, Albert Einstein or Richard Dawkins. [http://bretthetherington.net/default....]  ​"
68,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68583290-jamie,4,"I have read Simon Winchester’s Professor and the Madman and Krakatoa, and liked them both. He writes very well, and engages the reader deeply into the story. Settling down with his books is like starting up a conversation with an old friend. The Map that Changed the World is no different; it tells a fascinating story of a remarkable man, and deftly explains the world in which he lived.They say that a genius is someone who sees the same things as everyone else, but also sees something in them that nobody else does. William Smith was such a man. He looked at rocks and instead of seeing just rocks, he recognized that the layers they appeared in reoccurred elsewhere. They rose and fell in places, but the same rocks, with the same fossils, could be traced for miles, in some cases clear across England. From this observation he set out to create a geological map of England. It took twenty-two years to complete and bankrupted him, sending him to the humiliation of debtor’s prison.While he was working on his map he found jobs that allowed him to get out to the countryside and examine the strata. He was well known as an expert in field drainage and supplemented his income by consulting with farmers.Manchester does a fine job recreating the late seventeen-hundreds. One thing that Smith was able to use to his advantage was the growing demand for coal. The start of the Industrial Revolution had created a vast market for it. There was value to be had by being someone who could predict the presence of coal underground from the surface rocks, which saved landowners the cost of digging experimental shafts. Furthermore, as the coal mines went deeper and spread out farther, Smith could use them to confirm the rock strata for the map he was working on.He certainly had his faults. He was abruptly and mysteriously fired from his first major assignment supervising construction of a canal. He had started from a working man’s background and desperately wanted to rise and be accepted by society, and lived well beyond his means. He also managed to offend the well off and cultured because he was smarter and harder working than them. It is painful to read about how he was snubbed and mistreated by third-rate men convinced of their own superiority. The most egregious example of this came when he finally published his map; one of the nobles simply copied it and passed it off as his own. Apparently he felt that since he had a title, he could do whatever he wanted. It was good to see that justice finally prevailed for Smith, and he was acknowledged for his great contribution to science. That contribution was not just a map, but a new way of thinking. It was impossible for all the rocks and their fossils to have been laid down in just six thousand years; the earth had to be immeasurable older than that. This was a dangerous idea, and it set in motion the powerful forces that led to modern geology, and even evolution."
69,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8490329-janta,2,"Read this in ebook format; narrative text concluded at 75% of the overall book, and the remainder was notes, etc.You know, having just finished this, I'm not sure I could tell you much about William Smith and his map of the geological strata of England. I got slightly distracted early on by Winchester's writing style in this book, which I found a little verbose. So while I struggled with overcoming my annoyance, he added some lowkey, casual misogyny: ""the aforemenioned Miss Bennett...is thought of in some circles as English Geology's First Woman if not quite (since she remained unmarried, and was described as 'somewhat mannish') its mother."" (from Chapter 8, 28.8% of the way through the text) Totally unnecessary description here. Who cares if she was ""somewhat mannish"" now? Why is it relevant here? Bennett plays no further part in the narrative, and this cattiness reads to me as cruel for the sake of a cheap ""laugh"".From Chapter 11, which begins with Winchester reminiscing about his boarding school days: ""...an unusually ugly sister [he attended a religious boarding school] who sported a luxuriant blond moustache."" (Chapter 11, 40.5%)Again: pointless, cruel, and honestly stereotyped description of a woman. I know the English boarding school system was terrible, and I don't mean to suggest that his experience wasn't also awful. But again, this mention of a woman doesn't actually add anything to the narrative and it's just a gross stereotype. An older, unpleasant woman (with, almost certainly, an unpleasant and difficult life of her own) depicted as physically ugly and mannish. The implication that ""real"" or ""nice"" women don't have faical hair just makes my eyes roll right to the back of my head.(chapter 11 as a whole struck me as mostly filler -- it's mainly about the rocks in the countryside of England, and about Winchester's visiting of these areas. I made a note that sums it up: ""blah blah blah rocks are pretty"". It just didn't connect much with the Smith's story, at least not when presented as a separate chapter. Perhaps if these sides about rocks had been incorporated into the ongoing narrative? Eh, I dunno. Finally, I wanted to mention the frankly odd treatment of Smith's wife in this text. Almost every single time she is mentioned, Winchester feels it necessary to add that she was crazy. If he doesn't remind the reader that she was crazy (specifically, she had some kind of mental illness that included nymphomania, and spent her final years in an asylum), then he mentions that she was ""fading fast"" or similar. I understand we know very little about her; Smith himself either hardly ever wrote about her or destroyed/redacted his journals. Still, the frequency with which Winchester reminds the reader that Mrs. Smith was mentally ill seemed peculiar (and, again, unnecessary).I guess this just wasn't my cup of tea, ultimately. I'm disappointed that I didn't enjoy it very much. I know I've read at least one of Winchester's other books and didn't have such a negative reaction."
70,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/611031-kater-cheek,2,"I usually love books like this, and I usually don't review books that I haven't finished, but I don't know if I want to waste any more time on this one. I'm 93 hard-won pages into this and I think I'm going to quit. So far I've been told that William Smith is an amazing man. There are strata when you dig down in a mine that seem to be the same everywhere. William Smith is an amazing guy, because he was the first to notice this (except he wasn't, but still, what a cool dude.) The strata slope sometimes. William noticed that the local stones were fossils, and wasn't he smart for having been the first to figure that out? Not the first, but still, what a hero. William got a job surveying for a canal. Canals were big back then. William probably talked about rocks a lot, but people didn't understand him, because they didn't know he was a genius. He'd have some bad luck, but eventually triumph, but I'll get to that later. William looked at rocks. He was smarter than other people. Wasn't he great? Yeah, I get it. I've been told he's important. I get that.Here's what I didn't get: a compelling character, a compelling story, or information about geology. I love books about science. I love books about history. Books about the history of science? Should be a page turner. But the author is like a pre-teen telling his first shaggy dog story, only the story meanders and he interrupts himself every few minutes to go ""but this is really good, I promise, just wait for it. I'm getting to the good part.""And if there were ever a book that needed more pictures, this is is. I got tired of reading and rereading paragraphs to try to figure out what he was talking about. Either illustrations of how the canal cut through the hills revealing the strata, or just a better description would have really helped. And how about a better idea of what a surveyor actually did in the 18th century? When the author does talk about the countryside, it helps to put me in the story, but I just didn't get a sense of the man's life. It's like the author assumes that everyone knows the geology of Southern England really well and the daily tasks of an 18th century surveyor so he doesn't have to describe it.I love the idea of this book, and I love the author's description of the train that was featured in that 1950's movie. The set-up is promising. The rest of the book just failed. Despite Winchester's obvious admiration for William Smith, Winchester was unable to sell me on how and why William Smith mattered or why he was important, or even to get me fired up about geology."
71,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24562513-e-c-koch,2,"It's hard to not like a book like this, a story about a guy that history has almost entirely forgotten but who, by ignoring his times' prevailing mores and received wisdom, hastened knowledge's march forward irrespective of consequence and criticism only to be vindicated as a visionary in posterity. But I didn't like it. It seemingly had all the right ingredients: a suitably obscure subject, William Smith, English father of geology; a capable narrator, Simon Winchester; and hero-worthy obstacles, manifested here as classism, dogmatism, and plagiarism. And so here Winchester offers the story of William Smith who was the first guy to notice a pattern in the distribution of fossilized ammonites in the strata of Britain's terra firma, and who also, in the face of prevailing dogma and class limitations and perfidy, created a map of the strata of rock that form Albion, all while going further into debt in order to see the project through. Yet, there was something in the combination of sentence-level repetition, the glacially slow arrival at an underwhelming climax, and the amorphousness of the villains that led me to put this down a lot. The most interesting part of this book for me were the discussions of what was commonly believed about geology (a word that didn't really exist yet) at the start of the nineteenth century, which turned into a examination of how religious dogma prevented many from investigating the geological curiosities that were clearly inconsistent with that dogma (e.g., the fossilized remains of extinct animals). This read to me like an outline of the slow process of Western secularism, which has been accreting, rock-like, for centuries now, and was a neat backdrop against which to read this story. Winchester, though, while remarking (several times) about how Smith's work influenced Darwin's, is content to allow this to remain sotto voce. Maybe it's because Smith's ultimate downfall - debtor's prison - isn't made to sound that bad, or maybe it's because Smith regains his reputation before he dies, or maybe it's because recovery projects of forgotten white heroes aren't quite politically a la mode, that I didn't feel this book gaining narrative tension, or myself gaining empathy for Smith.

There is no questioning Smith's brilliance or the courage and perseverance that he demonstrated in the face of both secular and religious opposition to his modern, forward thinking, brilliant ideas on the topics of evolution and the origins of geological strata.But the fact remains that, unlike the story of Krakatoa or the San Francisco earthquake which Winchester told to his fans in such exciting fashion, geology is a topic that is inherently slow-moving and, frankly, dull as dirt (or perhaps one might say ... pulverized rock?) Oh sure, there are entertaining moments but, by and large, The Map That Changed the World is pretty slow-moving stuff and barely rises above the level of interesting. I'm a long-time fan of Winchester and his version of history but there's just no way I could suggest that this particular entry ever gets elevated to the level of ""compelling"".Thank goodness for Winchester's detailed research, his wit and subtly British sense of humour and the power of his writing skills. Without those, The Map That Changed the World would have been doomed at the outset to remain an utter yawner. As it is, we'll complement Winchester by categorizing it as interesting.Recommended.Paul Weiss"
73,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1587359-kathleen-hulser,4,"Gorging on limestone with the founder of British geology, William Smith. What a tale, as always narrated with enthusiastic skill by Simon Winchester. The strange poetry of stratigraphy unfolds in names: Oolite, Red Marl, Cornbrash, Forest Marble, Clunch Clay, Coral Rag, Millstone Grit, Fuller's Earth and more. Fuller's Earth is the special clay layer that can remove the lanolin from raw sheep's wool, useful indeed in the Dorset region where much of this tale of discovery is set. The humble surveyor William Smith worked in coal mines and studied the layers he passed descending to the depths of the mines. Then, amazingly, he won a post planning a canal which allowed him to compare a horizontal cut right across England to the vertical layers he knew so well from mining. As a side note his story also offers a view of the enclosure, draining and ""improvement"" of lands that dominated the 18th and early 19th century in England. His biography is a sad tale of the modest man betrayed as his stunning observations congeal into a map; his rivals, friends and contemporaries then simply rip off his map drafts. The founder of geology spent time in debtor's prison and was forced to sell at a discount his precious fossil collections to the British Museum. Winchester's embrace of the spiral wonders of the fossil world are enough to make anyone rush to buy an Estwing tip rock pick and start tapping at a cliff in a railroad cut."

His story was redeeming and frustrating. At times he seemed to be his own worst enemy and lived a difficult life in a difficult historic time. The turn into the 19th Century saw Science and learning beginning to emerge out of the swamps of ignorance and superstition. Yet society was class oriented and more credibility was given to Biblical accounts of creation and earth sciences than actual knowledge. It was easier to accept what you've been told for decades than truly learn and understand anything new. Smith was recognized, but also plagiarized and brushed aside by ""science societies"" that were far more interested in having only upper class, wealthy socialites than promoting true science. I guess it's an often told tale of trying to educate the general populace. Smith FINALLY overcomes most of his demons and published his map, but it took until well after his death for him to be recognized and esteemed for his ground breaking observations and discoveries. This story was a solid read, and I heartily recommend it to anyone who enjoys nonfictional stories about the founding fathers of science ."

So, even on near house arrest, it took me many moons to read this lovely biography. I'm also not really one -but learning- to appreciate non-fiction. All that said, this book was a delight and really quite an easy read. Winchester is a wordsmith and a craftsman. He's pulled words out of obscurity and some magical historic thesaurus to smartly use not only geological and palaeontological terminology in a smooth easy form, but also 'archaic' and 18th c usages that had me sitting, reading with my own dictionary beside me!He has thoroughly researched our hero, the father of English geology, William Smith, through his years, trials, and battles with the British class system, as he personally and practically alone, mapped out the underworld of the British Isles. Sad, poignant, insightful, we all sit in Smith's shadow and on his shoulders as a result. Added bonus with the hardcover, you get a copy of his map that has truly changed the world! The book is so nicely illustrated (so many ammonites, so little time) I am really happy I didn't opt for an audio version -I would have missed out!Highly recommended and not only for those of us who are still learning from digging in the ground! I hope you can enjoy it too."
76,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2221182-virginia,3,"William Smith was the father of England’s geology. He was skilled at surveying, canal building, and draining farmlands. During the course of this work he had opportunity to discover geological strata and the intelligence to use the composition of each layer, as well as the unique fossils found in each layer, to map out what lay beneath the surface of Britain. It’s an interesting enough history although I’m not much interested in geology. But the telling of it by Winchester wasn’t compelling. Smith was a ‘countryman’, not high-born or educated. He had good mentors and friends who saw his obvious skills and intelligence, but he wasn’t smart about finances and business, and his social status worked against him. His work was plagiarized and he only received recognition of his work long after he spent time in debtors’ prison. My sympathy for his situation is heartfelt, but Winchester nearly undoes it with his somewhat coy writing. He imagines scenes and possible scenes, not based on known facts. He inserts himself into the book with schoolboy excursions to the Dorset beach. I’m quite surprised and dismayed by this, having read The Madman and the Professor, as well as Krakatoa. The best part of the book is the dust jacket, which is actually a copy of Smith’s iconic map pleated to fit the book."

I would give the subject 4 stars, and the style one. The subject matter and the Smith side stories are interesting and informative. I really appreciated the material and learned quite a bit about geology.On the other hand, the writer's style is very taxing to read. Sometimes he tells us William Smith's story, and sometimes he tells Simon Winchester's story. I believe that he was attempting to give the reader some background for the Smith stories. But his stories feel like they just pop up willy-nilly and are written like a letter to a friend in a manner that I found difficult and distracting from the real story.One other thing, which I don't fault Mr. Winchester about, is the difference between British English and American English. (Thank goodness for Kindle's dictionary function!). I am sure that a British reader would probably have no problem reading the material, and if that is the audience he was attempting to attract, he probably succeeded; American audiences, maybe not so much.

I found this book extremely difficult to get through because of its redundancy and obsessive need to foreshadow all of its major events. This is the structure of most of the novel's paragraphs:""Event C was the direct result of A after B had brought it about. C would eventually lead to D, which in turn would bring about E. C, D, and E were to be the final straws necessary to found the budding new science, but not before events F, G, and H brought down utter destruction and endless years of penury. Nevertheless, A, B, C, D, and E would eventually lead to I, which would CHANGE THE WORLD."" Then the next paragraph begins:""Later that year, event D happened. This emerged directly from event C, triggered itself by A and B...."" and so on forever.The author also has no idea what the phrase ""only too well"" means. He uses it liberally all the way through the book, and about half of the time he gets it right. Overall, I cannot recommend it, unless you enjoy grammatical errors (as, admittedly, I do); the book has some nicely gnarly sentences."

Winchester follows his career from the beginning through the trials and tribulations and incredible accomplishments. It took Smith around 3 decades to be recognized for his revolutionary work and during that time he went from rags to riches to rags. Smith may not have been the first to notice the layers/strata beneath the earth's surface but he certainly was the first to deduce theories from his observations and test them. His ideas and discoveries countered Divine Creation which was the canon of the time although that was beginning to be questioned by some.Simon Winchester writes in a delightful style with wonderful descriptions that are sometimes slyly humorous. I thought the book bogged down a bit through the extensive geological/paleontological discussions. It was informative but dense. That's the only reason I gave this 3 stars. Whether or not you are knowledgeable about geology, reading about William Smith and his single-minded tenacity and ethic is worth it."
80,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57568576-alice-lemon,4,"I swear I didn't consciously decide to read all of Simon Winchester's books just because my friend Shulin recommended I read Krakatoa: The Day the World Exploded: I didn't even like that book that much! That said, Winchester does seem to tend to pick interesting topics to write about.I came to this book with an honestly kind of embarrassing lack of knowledge about the topic: my knowledge of sedimentary geology (which seems to be the only sort in England) and stratigraphy is almost entirely taken from my childhood special interest in paleontology. Honestly, I would've preferred if the book focused more on the geology and history of science and less on William Smith's life. (I also would've probably benefited from reading a paper edition in the likely case that one would contain maps, as my knowledge of English geography is...spotty.) Still, it was interesting and about a section of the history of science that I really need to know more about than I do!"
81,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10835551-david,4,"The Map That Changed the World by Simon Winchester presents the story of the beginnings of the field of geology. While that may not sound all that interesting but when you learn that it all started when a canal digger named William Smith with no formal training or education discovered during his excavations to build canals there were patterns and layers of rocks and fossils that remained consistent as they rose and fell across the British landscape. He theorized that this may be true for all of Great Britain and probably around the world. He then came up with the idea of creating a multi-colored map that would show these hidden parts of the earth and worked at it for 22 years. But rather than being recognized for his discovery and achievements he ended in debtors' prison and was the victim of plagiarism as others sought to take credit for his work. Finally, in 1831, he was recognized and received the Geological Society of London's highest award and received a lifetime pension from the king. Today he is known as the father of modern geology. The book is well written and, although it's not quite a page turner, it held my interest to the end."
82,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17319567-robert-federline,5,"Fascinating and captivating. Who knew the study of geology could be so absorbing. In school the jocks were disdainfully dismissed as those studying rocks. This book creates a whole new perspective on the study of ""rocks"" and gives it impressive credibility. The debt we owe to people like William Smith is enormous. Like many geniuses who make serious, material changes in how we see our world, and are able to make new horizons and perspectives for us, he was unappreciated by the world of his day, and certainly went insufficiently compensated for his efforts. Stories (the true ones, of course) like this are important to inspire the nonconformist in possession of true vision to continue to pursue his goals, dreams and to maintain his incomprehensible attitude. In the face of adversity and misunderstanding, it is important to persevere and to press on with an eye on the prize, knowing that the reward from this world will likely not be realized in your lifetime, if ever. The legacy that you leave, however, is more than reward enough. And it has to be. Because you are extremely unlikely to ever be rewarded, although you will enrich mankind for generations to come."
83,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48051175-casey,4,"A good book by one of my favorite authors, glad I finally got around to it. This book describes the life and work of the Englishman William Smith, one of the founders of the science of geology. The map in question is a geologic survey of England, with all the various rock formations properly located and labeled. But the book is a whole lot more: it is a dive into the Romantic era of science, when young men of humble backgrounds but peerless intellects had a chance to publish their thoughts and spread their findings. Though Smith faced more challenges than most, frankly due to his own faults rather than others, his story is presented as an example of the necessity to open a field of endeavor to all comers. A great book if you would like to know more about the foundations of geology and the early 19th century scientific revolution. Incidentally, this book now holds the distinction of containing my favorite quote: Stormtroopers of the Divine Intervention, used to describe the author's catholic school nuns."
84,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19672057-cade,3,"The biographical nature of this book kept the author a little more tethered to the actual subject matter. Unfortunately, what digressions there were were particularly uninteresting. I am really not interested in a run-down of semi-forgotten amateur scientists of the early 1800s in England, and I am especially not interested in the author's self-indulgent reminiscing about the time he found an ammonite as a kid and the time spent while writing this book wandering around looking for another one.My main complaint with the content itself is that it never really explains the mechanics of building and reading a geological map well. Is there any information available other than the uppermost rock layer identification at a locality? An internet search suggests there can be (e.g. information on orientation of strata), but this is not mentioned. Are there characteristic features of certain phenomena (e.g. inverted layers, missing layers, etc)? This book doesn't say. This is really just a biography, not a geology book."
85,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25032447-karen-goatkeeper,4,"William Smith is the father of modern geology and you've probably never heard of him. He accomplished a task most of us would rate impossible only to face censure as he was middle class and debtor's prison.What he did, around 1800, was build canals for coal mines and drain farmland to alter the face of Britain. In the process he realized the different earth layers had a particular order, a slant and particular fossils in them. He walked and rode coaches all over Britain to map these and create a geological map.The book is easy reading in many ways. The topic is interesting. The difficulty I found is with the author. He is a geologist and admirer of William Smith which is fine. However the author had difficulty deciding his approach to the story. Parts are personal memoir. Parts mention Smith's future several times, then go back to the time in question. It upsets the flow of the book leaving the reader floundering.For anyone interested in science and history of science, the book is a great read."
86,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7110041-arend,2,"A book that was simply too long, stuffed with asides, long lists, irrelevant “isn’t it a small world” anecdotes, repetitious foreshadowings; and in the middle a chapter devoted to an sentimental excursion by the author. The story is of interest, but the telling doesn’t help. The evangelical outbursts positing geology as the first crack between faith and science, the start of the dawn of a new age, are a bit much. The more since much is written from an engineer’s perspective, where use of land and resources and machinery are a thing of beauty, as long as it is cleverly done. The social aspects of history get short thrift: I’ve never read such an enraptured account of the enclosures in 18th century England; or of the canal digging frenzy. Contrast that with the love he lavishes on the rolling hills of England with its beautiful villages of charming cottages. The disdain for anything else is a bit ironic. In short: too long with not enough nuance to keep it interesting throughout. I’d rather have spent the time on the actual map. "
87,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25722571-robert,3,"Once again Simon Winchester has gifted readers with an intriguing study of a relatively forgotten figure and often overlooked topic. This short biography of William Smith, one of the fathers of modern geology, provides an interesting look at the man and his role in revolutionizing the science he helped to establish. For the reader with little background in this area there is much to learn from Winchester's portrayal. Smith's discovery of the use of fossils to date rock strata and his ability to take this knowledge and map all of Britain's geology is fascinating. However, in this work the author has also displayed an unfortunate tendency toward repetition. For example, the reader is presented countless times with the twofold thesis that defines Smith's primary contribution to geology. Ultimately, in comparison to Winchester's other works, including Krakatoa and his fine book on the Pacific, this work falls a little flat."
88,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10310364-vicky-hunt,1,"A Great Story... Executed PoorlyWilliam Smith was a man who lived a remarkable life, and achieved an accomplishment worthy of notice. The story is deeply intriguing. It made me search elsewhere for the full story. (Wikipedia contained more facts than this book.) Simon Winchester's account does not focus on the Geological Science, but wanders around getting bogged down in opinion and trivial aspects. He repeats the same words over and over in several chapters. I almost quit reading in the first chapter because of this repetition of phrases. I can't recommend this book, and I searched my To Be Read list for the other books by Winchester, which I then deleted. I learned nothing within the pages of this book. It was a similar experience to ordering chicken at a Kentucky Fried Chicken Restaurant, only to be told they are out of chicken, and being offered a moon pie instead. Fluff not Science. "
89,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2540960-ron-christiansen,3,"A classic story of a man, William Smith, who worked his entire life in the field where he mapped out the layers of the earth--without degree, money, or class. Over and over the importance of his work was not understood and when it was, it was plagiarized. The big ideas in the beginning and the end of the book were the most interesting to me. Some sections in the middle were tedious. Winchester, also author of the brilliant and a bit more engaging ""The Professor and the Madman: A Tale of Murder, Insanity, and the Making of the Oxford English Dictionary,"" has a fascination with the big ideas along with the very little details and, sometimes, the mundane. The later is most clear in his footnotes of historical odd miscellany. Still, by quick reading much of the middle section, the last few chapters are redemptive and instructive of how science also works as a social, that is a people-based, science. "
90,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/851558-sara,3,"The title of this book grabbed me. I really enjoyed the prologue with its excitement of the huge map of England and Wales hiding behind curtains in a mansion. As the story unfolded, however, the storytelling became a bit dry for my taste.William Smith, as I learned, spent most of his life digging canals and drainage fields. It was in the pursuit of his work that he looked closer at the layers of rock he was digging up. He discovered the differences in the strata and eventually deduced that there were consistent patterns to be found. Much of this book discusses his personal life and how his work wasn't taken seriously until it was. Then he was belittled by the academic community and not even allowed to be a member of the first English geological society.I learned a few new terms such as ammonites and oolites. I wish the author had spent more time discussing the actual fossil discoveries and their history."

While The Professor and the Madman (about the first Oxford English Dictionary) was more my flavor—being a writer and genuinely interested in words, I mean—The Map That Changed the World was a worth entry into the Winchester catalogue. My attention wasn't quite held during long stretches (or strata) of rock types. Tried as I might, learning fossil names and rock strata is just not for me. Still, the narrative of William Smith's life is a journey of human triumph: An uneducated everyday man overcomes 19th Century class warfare to become the founding father of Geology—only to have it all taken away, only, again, to see it all come back shortly before death. Definitely a tale that needs to be known. "

I really loved Krakatoa and the author's writing style. I did not have the same reaction with this one. It was very VERY adoring of William Smith, and I thought it would have been better told if it sounded a bit more objective, and less like William Smith was just doing his best as a misunderstood genius amidst a whole bunch of villains (even though that may have been true) in a super classist society. I also didn't really like the description of his wife as a burden, and crazy. i know the author mentioned that it was really hard to find any info about her, but still. Some neat stuff in here about debtor's prisons, and descriptions of the rock and mechanics, and I really loved all the drawings of fossils and houses."
93,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70186735-kee-onn,5,"An enthralling biography of the virtually unknown father of modern geography, William Smith. Born a commoner and initially trained as a canal engineer, Smith found a higher calling when he noticed the patterns of layers in the earth while digging out canals. Geology was a nascent field back when he embarked on a one-man journey to make the first geological map of Britain, exposing the ""fourth dimension"" of Earth and led to theories challenging the Biblical narration of the formation of the world. With a careful balance of English geology and William Smith's biography, this book will not only initiate the reader's interest in a vast science including minerals, rocks and natural history; but also return the spotlight to a dedicated scientist whose name is forgotten by time. "
94,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75634178-john,2,"This book lays some marginally helpful groundwork for an evolutionary or old-earth view of the age of the earth. Its view of England at the time is fascinating and I enjoyed large swaths of the book. It seems very thoroughly researched and is told in a very entertaining manner. It spent a great deal of time on things that, while marginally pertinent to the life story of William Smith, had little connection to the map that changed the world. Lastly, the author has some serious issues with Christianity. His disdain for it and his joy in mocking it come through so strongly at certain points as to make one wonder if he should see someone to help him move past this. He does mention that he was connected to the Catholic Church in some way in his youth so perhaps there are unresolved issues there. Regardless, he is very hostile towards Christianity, to the point of absurdity at times. "

Winchester's other books are actually very well written and interesting. Here, he just seems to ramble on about rocks instead of focusing on the man himself. He saves that for the last chapter of the book. He did his best to make fossils and rocks seem interesting, but in the end it is the map that he should have been focused on. It is indeed a masterpiece of work and should be celebrated, but let's face it, it's only Great Britain. Imagine that same map of the world. Bottom line, toss this book the instant you see it. I only read it because it was the last on my shelf and had nothing else to do with this virus thing going around. I don't know if it was even worth my time. "
96,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2115862-peter,4,"Another really interesting book By Simon Winchester. He tells the story of William Smith, mostly self taught founder of modern geology. From his work in digging canals in south western England, he realized there was structure in the rocks and rocky outcrops that was repeated in other areas. Eventually after a few major roadblocks, he published a map showing the geologic formations that underlay England, a map you can still see today in London England! Winchester tells the tale in a way that gives insights into the times, the early 1800's. Smith decided to map all of England (one person, 1800's, horses and carriages and stagecoaches) and succeeded!One very determined person can make a diference."

It succeeds so well at what it does. (Well, mostly. I balked a few times when assertions of the importance of it all felt slightly forced and exaggerated. It's only that the author doth protest a tad too much…) The characters very much come to life. Winchester's thorough research allows him to explain clearly and succinctly aspects of the context that, having since changed, would otherwise be hard to understand. The result blends an excellent critical character study, solid economic and social history, delightful turns of phrase, and beach-worthy vibrancy. I am looking forward to reading Krakatoa."

Also the writer would go off into pointless explanations and tangents which were difficult to follow and detracted from the narrative. But the second half was good because it seemed more about geology and was less rambling... or maybe I just got used to the author’s writing style. I was glad to see Smith was recognized for his achievements while living and was finally content at the end. He was an original thinker. 
99,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45859662-george-goodall,3,"This fascinating little book describes the work of William Smith to produce a geological map of the England and Wales. Winchester discusses the history of maps, fossils, and the industry of England. Smith -- as a surveyor of canals and mines -- brings these threads together. The book moves through details quickly but leaves a fascinating account of the evolution of scientific and technological knowledge. It amazes me to think that there was a time when it was completely appropriate to use Noah's flood as an explanation for all geological phenomena!"

Perhaps there just wasn't enough material to build a more rounded work - certainly would have helped to have some visual references - and at this stage in his writing he assumes almost a strictly English reader. He casually bandied about names, places and scenery common to an englishman but head scratches for everyone else. "

The story of William Smith and his contributions to early geology are an interesting topic, although I found myself losing interest in the story around the middle of the book. I set it aside and later resumed to finish the whole book. In the end, the story of Smith's life provides an interesting glimpse into life in the late 1700s-early 1800s in England, and it was a worthwhile read for a few reasons.I'd recommend the book for people interested in geology and/or history."

His map was a culmination of years worth of work and evidence to support the idea of strata below us.

Winchester covers the ups and downs of Smith life and how he doggedly remained determined to his dream. It was wonderful to see that at the end of his life he came through his challenges and was given his fair recognition. It is interesting to see how the 1800's was that period where ""naturalists"", often wealthy amateurs gave way to scientists and how Smith was caught in that transition.Great book for history buffs of that time."
105,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4606766-scott-johnson,4,"This was thoroughly enjoyable, though perhaps enhanced by coming off two atrocious nonfiction books prior to this.It was generally well-organized, though my one big criticism was the very tiring pattern of moving forward in time normally, then jumping back and repeating numerous years and events and continuing a bit beyond where the jump occurred. Repeat until you eventually get to the end, reading through each point in time 2, 3, sometimes 4 times. It might be necessary at times when a lot happens at once from many points of view, but this was a pattern that was repeated throughout.I had vaguely known about this map from way back in 9th grade Earth Science, and knew a lot more about geology in general, but this was a refreshingly new story to me. It's also a nice change of pace to end on a very happy ending, though you can hardly fault the authors since history is what it is; it just gets really tiring reading about one tragic figure after the next who never gets redemption or vindication.One of my first passions was geology, and especially paleontology. This book has made me add to my to-do list ""find more geology/paleontology books""."
106,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5177888-dee,5,"Truly touching and inspiring book about the forgotten father of English geology, William Smith. A glimpse into the early world of science -- when gentlemen ""philosophers"" of rank held themselves above men who were willing to go out into the field, observe, make theories, and prove or disprove them with the facts -- especially when those men were not particularly well-born. Also the story of one unique thinker who was able to see the pattern in a mass of rocks, when others only saw chaos, or only believed what the church had taught for millennia about the earth. "
107,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39679658-dan-dwyer,5,"Eventually Truth Wins OutThe story of William Smith as brilliantly told by Simon Winchester should inspire every person whose ideas will contribute to the advancement of his fellow man. It should also encourage us in our setbacks to carry on and perform even better. I marveled at Smith's genius, but I was in awe of his persistence and the belief in himself, and I was made thankful that he was destined to be appreciated before he died. I'm his own way, William Smith was a saint and Simon Winchester proved to be a worthy hagiographer."
108,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51187053-mark-tyra,3,"This book should have been shorter. Some material was repeated as the author would hint at things to come, circle away from it, and then circle closer again before circling away again. Also, the theme of Smith’s striving for recognition in a classed society (where his class was at odds to recognition) seemed overplayed. How much of this was real and how much of this was only a plot device? It would have been more interesting to have more content about the map itself and the lands that Smith explored."
109,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10878734-katie,3,"So the problem with this book is that I'm not actually interested in the history of geology. I'm interested in maps, and all I read was the title, and thought, ooh, this will be a book for me. I didn't read the subtitle or the book summary. So that's my bad. Really the only part of the book that interested me was the small section about Smith's endeavor to make his map. I've been wanting to read Winchester for ages, and this was a seriously underwhelming introduction. I'll give him another try and hope to have better luck with a different topic."
110,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23393065-andreas-lorenz,3,"The title is misleading: The books is not principally about ""the map that changed the world"", but rather about it creator, William Smith. So think of this book as a kind of biography. The story of William Smith is interesting enough, but this book would have been much better if had been much more about the map, it's importance for science in general and geography in particular. The knowledge and understanding that this map helped bring forward was instrumental in ushering in the beginning of our modern world view as geology - and all that came with it - began as a science. "
111,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48228379-abdysadyk,4,"Amazing book with the use of linguistic means, the truly compelled story itself and how the author described as you are in the same boat with the protagonist and feeling those moments of anger, anxiety, frustration, the moments of strolling all-around England and fully-fledged history of William Smith's life what truly matters for us in today's world. The author itself of this book and The Professor and Madman what I can say for sure a brilliant description, great variation of choosing appealing words."

Insight into the class system of England in the 17th and 18th centuries, a system that extended through the whole country, including politics and the sciences. Tells where the word chum came from and also clink. Read the book and find out. I learned two new words from this book, both on the same page, quiddity and pendle, neither of which my spell checker thinks are real words!"

It's written by someone who has the journalistic skills to be able to bring the era and social context as much as the science of the discoveries alive to the layperson.Highly recommended."
114,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5399134-les-dangerfield,4,"The story of William Smith, from humble origins the founder of modern geology. Not a well known figure in the UK's pantheon of the greats of science - probably largely resulting from the limits which society placed on him (and still would) because of those humble origins. An interesting account, though, because Simon Winchester is a geologist himself it often suffers from going into too much technical detail about geology."
115,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35905397-jeffrey,3,"Hardbound. Readable, but somewhat repetitive, biography of William Smith, the Englishman who first realized how strata were related by matching the fossils in layers. He made the first stratigraphic map in 1815, of the UK, which can be seen today at Burlington House in London (Royal Geology Society). The work established that the earth had to be old, and influenced Darwin in developing evolution."
116,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17327110-leslie,3,Very interesting topic and individual in William Smith and thoroughly researched by the author. I set it down several times though because the author gets a bit repetitive and wordy. A good reference on geology and British social history of the time in terms of class structure. It’s encouraging to read about the tenacity of people who don’t give up on their dreams or ideas or theories despite social or economic setbacks. 
117,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/798894-jeanette-lukens,5,"I think the naturalists who made massive discoveries around the beginning of the 19th-century using only their skills of observation and experimentation are so interesting. William Smith is no exception. I also like this book, though, because one of the original copies of the map hung in the room where my small group of classmates met every day during grad school. It was fun to learn more about its creation and creator. "
118,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33569468-cat,4,"I enjoy history that unfolds through one object and Simon Winchester does this very well. In this case, it's not only history, it biography, it's geology, it's a lot of information that is put into a narrative that rolls along without getting dry. An interesting book, though the title is a touch hyperbolic. A note: I listened to the audiobook version and Winchester's voice is charming and he did the voices!"
119,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54669463-banbury,3,"This book is interesting and entertaining enough, but is too long, especially since the main outline of the story is set forth at the beginning so that there is no urgency to find out what will happen. I would have wished a bit more of a scientific explanation of the reason Smith is considered the ""Father of Geology""; specifically a more complete discussion of the use made by Smith in determining the significance of rock strata."
120,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60841638-tim-knutson,2,"Not that William Smith and his contributions to geology weren’t interesting, I just didn’t enjoy this book and how it was written. I felt like I was constantly stuck in the weeds of little uninteresting details of Smith’s life rather than learning about the significance of his work or the history of geology. I do think there is even an interesting story of his misfortune and trials but I don’t think the book succeeded there either. "
121,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76134654-tyler-coghlan,2,This didn't need to be 300 pages...The first 3 chapters were repetitive. Things got interesting enough for couple chapters after. I skimmed most of the rest and gave up by 200. The topic was one worth knowing about. The problem is all the useful information is filled between copious filler and inference that it's just dull and tedious. The book is more a biography of the map maker than the about map itself.
122,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3540806-christian-hartman,4,"4.5 stars, absolutely wonderful. We never think about what the rise of the geological map has done for humanity, but it deserves its place in the pantheon of human achievement, leading to the downfall of entrenched religious dogma, the rise of the idea of evolution, the industrial revolution, and scores of modern geo-political conflicts that have shaped the world order. Not bad for a map of some rocks."
123,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5925546-holly,4,"I really enjoyed this book! I’m not a massive fan of scientific history (which makes this an interesting title to have selected, I know) but William Smith did live a very interesting life, and the social history here, about debtors and prisons isn’t a topic that’s touched on much in other biographies or historical fiction that I’ve read before, so it was interesting to learn about that, too. Definitely worth a read, even if you aren’t into geology!"
124,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86509473-madison,3,"I liked hearing the story about the first geological map and I'm incredibly impressed that it was the work of one man. The book did drag on at times. One of the most infuriating things was that the author kept mentioning in passing how Smith's wife was becoming ""increasingly crazy,"" yet we didn't get a paragraph or even anecdote on that until the end. Even saying that we don't have much information about it would've been better than just repeatedly mentioning it and failing to elaborate."
125,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2605780-holly,2,"Sounded like an interesting topic, and because I was a fan of some of his other work, I wanted to read this one as well. However, it fell kinda flat for me. The beginning was good, and some other parts throughout, but there was a lot of boring/slow parts where I fought to finish a page. I haven't given up on Winchester yet though; I will keep an eye out for some other topics."

I would recommend this book for anyone interested in history, geology or who just likes a well written biography. The only thing that I could have done without were the constant foreshadowings of debt. Since it's told about in the first chapter, it's not really necessary. "
127,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27277355-schopflin,1,"I don't often abandon books and still can't quite work out how Simon Winchester made the topic so terribly dull. Maybe his constant signalling of the importance of events was over-compensating for the fact that he didn't find the topic very interesting himself. At any rate, I gave up in despair about 130 pages in."
128,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2955864-matt-willden,3,"Not Winchester's best, but a fascinating study of William Smith, eulogistically titled the father of English geology. A remarkable if quirky historical figure, whose enormous personal commitment to his craft and grand vision of how strata and fossils could tell us the age of their associated stone - culminated in a remarkable map that un-hyperbolically changed the course of modern human history. "
129,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7006790-angel-garbarino,3,"I really struggled to get through this book. The story is solid, but the writing style is too much. I felt this a little to with his other book about the OED, but I couldn't handle it this time around. He's a prolific and well regarded author, so it's more a reflection of my taste. I'd recommended previewing if possible first and seeing if you like the style."
130,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36762019-drinkinwookie,4,Without Smith there is no Darwin. It's hard to say how important the guy this book is about was... and yet not many have ever heard of him. It's time to forget about generals and world leaders and fill our history books with the makers of ideas. The quality of writing is worthy of the subject matter here.
131,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36550557-mary-a,5,A fabulous book! I had no idea geology could be so fascinating. I read this book on a visit to the UK and was amazed and delighted to stumble across a copy of the map in the York Museum. I felt like there should be flashing lights and neon signs announcing that this was the map that changed the world - but I had to make do with hugging myself delightedly instead. 
132,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19165211-mindofwinter,2,"Winchester sketches out three or four more interesting stories in the first 50 pages than the one he eventually tells. Not altogether his fault -- Smith's biography is not as interesting as its repercussions, nor as interesting as its larger cultural moment. The canonization undertaken here would have made a brilliant chapter in an altogether different work."

I enjoyed the second half of the book, which talks more about William Smith's efforts to publish (or not) his ideas, and the academic controversy endemic to London and its academic societies."
134,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22232670-sara-jose,1,"While I really enjoyed Winchester's Krakatoa, this book is painful. I admit to not finishing it, because he inserts too much opinion into what I was hoping was a nonfiction book. Winchester has a definite idea of what England is, was, and should be- and I was hoping he could lay that aside to tell the story of something that should be fascinating."
135,0060931809,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4373298-jamie-hughes,3,"It took me some time to slog through this book. I locked Winchester’s earlier book, “The Professor and the Madman,” and there were parts of this one that were equally riveting. However, there is so much talk of rocks, soil, and adorable British village names that I found myself glassy eyes on more than one occasion. A solid read, but dry as rocks at times. "
