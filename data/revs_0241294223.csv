They are not addictive, toxic, debilitating or destructive. They cause no illness and have no side effects. They seem to unlock receptors in the brain, causing mashups and unexpected connections (and therefore perceptions). They dissolve the ego by restricting blood flow to the Default Mode Network of the brain, which can cause users to lose the border between their persona/self/ego and everything else (eg. the universe). They do not take over (unless you allow it). You can manipulate your bad trip as well as your good trip if you so desire. You can switch from love to hate, you can send demons away, and explore more of what you are appreciating. It’s something like directing your dreams, except you will remember everything, and it will change your outlook. Possibly for life.Michael Pollan has done the research and tried four different psychedelics, always under the administration of guides, either underground/outlaws or in labs. They were psilocybin (mushroom), LSD (artificial chemical compound), DMT (the venom of the Sonoran toad), and ayahuasca (Brazilian plant compound). How to Change Your Mind is an exploration of the experience and the potential of these chemicals. From what Pollan has seen, it is all very positive. And he is not alone. Engineers, doctors and other researchers all seem to have one thing in common: once they’ve tried psychedelics themselves, they want absolutely everyone to try them too. No other drug has that rep.The mind-expanding powers of psychedelics is a function of the infinite connections the brain goes through when its receptors are unlocked and the Default Mode Network (DMN) powers down. The DMN runs the core brain and defines the ego/conscious/persona. It fights to keep control and sends corrective signals to reinforce what it has learned over its lifetime, to the point of denying/correcting what you see in front of you.We spend our lives specializing, becoming more expert in an ever-decreasing number of subjects. To the DMN, anything that diverts from that is irrelevant and a waste. The ego actively suppresses them. So we lose our childlike appreciation of most everything. We also become set in our ways and our perceptions. By opening up to all the possibilities at once, users flood themselves with new appreciations and insights – to plants, animals, the planet, the stars, music – anything that pops into their minds during their trip. Instead of all inputs being directed to their appropriate receptors, it is possible for music to have shape and color, for rocks to become animated, for objects to melt into the scenery. And for the now borderless, bodiless self to merge with nature (“I was swimming in the ocean. I was the ocean” for example). Suddenly, absolutely everything is possible.For all the dozens of trips Pollan describes, the most common change is being one with nature or the universe (for some it is seeing God). No one seems to have incredible sex or become fabulously wealthy. It’s not about peace on Earth, but merging with and appreciating the facets of the universe. And as Pollan found, “You bring a different self to the journey every time.” Perhaps disappointingly, he says, the most common takeaway from psychedelic trips is that love is everything. Trite, but that by itself seems to change everyone who tries them.When directed by guides, psychedelics help the dying be relieved and appreciate their position and role in the universe. (Aldous Huxley had his wife inject him with one final dose of LSD on his deathbed.) It has stopped people from smoking because smoking is so superficial and irrelevant. It can reverse depression and anxiety. And it’s all quite illegal, thanks in large part to Timothy Leary.There is a long tale of Timothy Leary in all this. He is reviled by the community for making such loud and obnoxious noises that all such compounds became illegal and research all but completely halted. Leary set back the discipline by decades, though at the same time, he made it known to the world. His gleefully unscientific approach (Tune in, turn on, drop out) remains a horror to medicine to this day. They’re still trying to live down that reputation.Pollan is not the most economical of writers. The book could have been a hundred pages shorter and still imparted the same information. There is a lot of description, history, speculation and self-questioning that becomes a little tiresome. It often reads like an infomercial, with endless testimonials from satisfied customers – including Pollan – that on television would be followed by an 800 number. But the information he delivers is valuable. He dispels myths, corrects wrong impressions and sets the record straight. The science of the brain is fascinating. We are still just cracking the code. Importantly, Pollan shows how seriously beneficial such compounds can be, and how seriously research scientists take them. There is a huge future for psychedelics in medicine. How to Change Your Mind tackles the small-mindedness (in every sense of the term) and beats it up pretty good.David Wineberg"

The idea that one group of compounds (psychedelics) could transform how we view and treat these various challenges to the human condition is VERY excititng. Pollan's book does a great job of juggling the memoirist experience with psychedelics (think of this partially as a 21st century version of Thomas De Quincey's Confessions of an English Opium Eater) with a narrative nonfiction exploration of the history and current science surrounding primarily LSD, Psilocybin, and 5-MeO-DMT (the Toad). Michael Pollan writes well (he's not quite, for me, upto the level of John McPhee -- but he's close). He both annoys and seduces at the same time. He reminds me of a well-produced TED Talk. He is both interesting and compelling, but also a bit like a worn and comfortable shoe (say a Birkenstock) that represents a group I already feel comfortable both simultaneously walking with and yes kicking.Most of Pollan's book focuses on LSD and Psilocybin (which makes sense because that is where most of the history and science are). I was familiar with Leary, Ginsburg, Huxley, and even James' takes on mind-altering drugs and states, but it was nice to see it framed by Pollan. I was also thrilled to be introduced to a bunch of characters I had never heard before. I feel a movie could/should be made about JUSt Al Hubbard.There is a huge part of me that finds the idea of psychedelic experience very compelling (I've got friends who are well-respected doctors, writers, and attorneys who feel the same way). However, my issue with most drugs (especially pot), is most people take them to GET close to where I feel I am already. I have a lot of awe, wonder, don’t get depressed, feel no guilt, exist with very low anxiety, etc (although I’m absolute shit at meditation). I think I do a pretty good job of hanging in the present (while being able to look both forward and back when needed). So, I'm not sure I would be seeking LSD or Psilocybin (or smoking the Toad) for any reason except curiosity and [gasp] recreation. That's the draw. The reason I am skeptical still is I'm not sure I trust most of the product (clarification, after reading this I trust the product more than say the manufacturer, deliverer, source). I'm a bit suspect of taking candy OR street tacos from complete strangers so ""smoking a Toad"" that I didn't catch and milk myself doesn't exactly seem like something I'm going to run off and do anytime soon. But, if the practice comes above ground, standardizes, or I'm dying -- all bets are off. Bring me the TOAD."
2,0241294223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"This is an epic book about the history of psychedelics, and their potential for improving the human condition. My first thought on the subject was of people tripping on LSD, and making a mess of their lives. But, this does not have to be the case at all. Many mental illnesses could be cured with ""psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy"".The first half of the book is about the history of psychedelics. Before 1965, Time-Life Publications were enthusiastic boosters of psychedelics. For example, in Life magazine in 1957 had an article by R. Gordon Wasson, a banker, who may have been the first white person in recorded history to eat divine mushrooms. Wasson hypothesized that some religions may have been inspired by a psychoactive mushroom. The Spanish had tried to crush mushroom cults in South America because they saw them as a ""mortal threat to the authority of the church.""LSD was used in the 1950's and early 1960's to successfully treat thousands of alcoholics in Canada and the United States. Therapeutic sessions with LSD had success rates of 70% for anxiety neurosis, 62% for depression, and 42% for OCD. But sadly, this history has been all but erased. Experiments showed that success depended on the setting and environment of the treatment. Simply giving someone LSD in a sterile environment, without any discussion ahead of time or real-time guidance, is a recipe for failure. The downfall of LSD in the 1960's was unintentionally assisted by Timothy Leary, a professor at Harvard. He did ""experiments"" that had little scientific value. He famously told a reporter, ""Psychedelic drugs cause panic and temporary insanity in people who have not taken them.""LSD became illegal in 1966. All research was shut down, except for the large program at the Maryland Psychiatric Research Center at Spring Grove. Research there continued to explore the potential of psychedelics to treat alcoholism, schizophrenia, and the distress of cancer patients.I thought the following anecdote was hilarious. Andrew Weill was a young doctor working in the Haight-Ashbury Free Clinic in 1968. He saw a lot of bad LSD trips and developed an effective treatment. After examining a patient and determining that it was a panic reaction, he would tell the patient, ""Will you excuse me for a moment? There's someone in the next room who has a serious problem."" This was an immediate cure!So, the real question is why psychedelics can be helpful for such a wide range of mental illnesses. Brain scans (fMRI's) have shown that the default mode network is turned off in people undergoing psychedelic sessions. The default mode network is the portion of the brain that is active when not actively thinking about anything. It acts as a filter on the fire hose of sensations that the body encounters, and also acts as a filter on the subconscious. The hypothesis is that the ego temporarily loses its dominion, and the unconscious, now unregulated, comes to an observable space. Brain scans show that psychedelics rewire the brain. Whether this rewiring is temporary or permanent is not known. It is interesting that the brains of experienced meditators look very similar to those on psilocybin. Both dramatically reduce activity in the default mode network.The problem with performing scientific research, is that it is very difficult to perform double-blind studies that have become the foundation of testing for pharmaceuticals. The reason is that both the patient and the research can know almost instantly whether the medication is a psychedelic or a placebo. In addition, it is difficult to isolate a single variable. A psychedelic/therapeutic session is not simply a matter of ingesting a chemical; it is only successful with the proper guidance, and this can be a subjective matter.A single guided psilocybin session is sufficient to remove depression from 80% of cancer patients. The fear of death is a function of our egos, and a psychedelic can suppress the ego. The resulting journey yields a ""heightened sense of purpose and consequence."" The journey can shed light on ""how best to live the time left.""A study of smoking cessation found that most participants stopped smoking. Those who had the most complete mystical experiences had the best outcomes. But, pharmaceutical companies might not be interested in psychedelics. The LSD patent expired long ago, and psilocybin occurs in nature. And, if a single dose/session is sufficient, there may be little profit.The author, Michael Pollan, has written another wonderful book. My attitude toward psychedelics is completely turned around. Hats off to a fascinating story!"
3,0241294223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4684009-william2,2,"Don’t expect any “nicety of style” here, to use E.M. Forster’s phrase, though the book is well organized. Nor does Pollan possess much wit, though I will not call him entirely humorless. These propensities make the reading more work than it should be. Moreover, he flattens and homogenizes his experiences with psychedelics so they’re almost nothing. He incapable of evoking moods. The opportunity is given to him to tell us about his life in the context of these psychedelic experiences. He remains guarded. As a result, this book is a missed opportunity for both the author and the reader. But we can thank him for one thing: other more daring authors shall surely follow in his path, just as he follows Huxley et al. For that he deserves our gratitude.The book starts with background on the relatively recent resurrection of research into psychedelics after the 1960s federal suppression of it on grounds—I’m serious—of national security. Historically, psychedelics, which induce in the seeker an unequivocal belief that one has experienced nothing less than a view of the fundamental non-dualist nature of the universe, created an unprecedented generation gap.Normally, rites of passage help societies knit together as the young cross over hurdles and through gates erected and maintained by their elders, coming out on the other side to take their place in the community of adults. Not so with the psychedelic journey in the 1960s, which at its conclusion dropped its young travelers onto a psychic landscape unrecognizable to their parents. (p. 216)It turns out that the early suppressed research, roughly a thousand clinical papers, showed how psychedelics might be used to treat addiction, PTSD, depression, anxiety and other maladies. Most of this valid research, according to Pollan, though tainted at times by over-enthusiasm on the part of investigators, proved beyond a reasonable doubt that psychedelics could be a viable pharmacological tool. Yet out of fear and destestation of those experimenting with the drugs in those days, who were young and vehemently anti-war, the findings were suppressed so that, yes, millions might suffer without the alleviation psychedelics would surely have provided them. This suppression of science is a national disgrace and reason, as if we needed more, to heap further opprobrium on past leaders.Pollan writes about this era of Cold War suppression, but focuses mainly on figures like Bob Jesse, Roland Griffiths and others who have been instrumental in spurring recent research into psychedelics. In addition to a description of the history, present day research, and neurological functioning of psychedelics, are the author’s own experiences with LSD-25, psilocybin, and 5-MeO-DMT, or Sonoran Desert toad venom.In addition to the failure to use the form of memoir to explode the nonfiction constraints of this book, it becomes ever more amorphous as it winds along. The late conclusion that “children are basically tripping all the time” strikes one as specious because it’s so inadequately argued. I know writing about the brain is no simple task. But then I suppose Oliver Sacks’s too genial model has spoiled me. This book, while at times informative, doesn’t come close to serving adequately its subject matter or its reader. It is, however, a milestone in publishing terms; it’s been a great commercial success. It’s my hope more adroit writers will follow."
4,0241294223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22699228-matthew-quann,5,"A cursory glance at the cover of Michael Pollan's new book examining the science of psychedelics manages to say a lot with very little. There are no vivid colours arranged in mandalas, no kaleidoscopic landscape, no face with eyes replaced by swirls of sickening colour combinations. Instead, a black, text-laden page is only broken up by the not-quite-square dimensions of a window that looks out onto a blue sky. In one sense, this encapsulates the book perfectly: it is an attempt to reorient the reader from the counterculture, 1960s, Timothy Leary-infused legacy of LSD and psilocybin to the scientific and social future of psychedelics. It may not be of a comparable level to the cognitive expansion made possible by psychedelics, but this book certainly opened my mind to the potentials and pitfalls of this science undergoing its second go-around. As in The Omnivore's Dilemma, a favourite of mine from last year, Pollan acts a superb narrator and a stellar scientific journalist. While reading or listening to some nonfiction and scientific journalism can feel like your most dry undergraduate course, Pollan always manages to write in a fashion that is compelling, thoughtful, and mindful of narrative. Part of what makes this book work so well is that Pollan tackles his own hopes, misgivings, and flagrant disbelief in a way that endears the reader to his quest to understand psychedelics. Additionally, I couldn't help but be excited to listen to Pollan talk about his own trips on several different psychedelics. His attempt to lay structure upon ineffable experience is admirable, interesting, and emotionally honest.Of course, it helps Pollan that his subject matter is controversial and, at least to me, inherently interesting. If you've ever wondered about the limits of consciousness or been curious about the trips induced by psychedelics, then this book is definitely going to pique your interest. I was taken in by Albert Hofmann's discovery of LSD and its brief journey through the halls of science before being derailed and made publicly available by figures such as Timothy Leary. It was compelling to hear the accounts of researchers devastated by the public consumption of substances they were still trying to understand, and having that quest for understanding cut short by the government. Following the account of several of Pollan's trips, the medical and neurological research ongoing into psychedelics makes for a smooth landing of a difficult to pilot vessel. I was perhaps most taken by the psychedelic experiences of palliative cancer patients, who reported decreased or absent existential dread about their death after their guided experiences on psychedelics. These and other avenues of psychedelic research are all guided by trained psychologists or physicians, which seems a far-cry from the dreadlocked, Burning Man, tie-dye psychedelic experience you might expect. It is in these chapters that Pollan makes both his most compelling argument for continuing the study of psychedelics while distancing them from their tumultuous childhood. Leaving the book, I'm definitely more curious about psychedelics than I was beforehand. Pollan lays out potentials and pitfalls of the future of psychedelics. There will be a precarious balance between entrenched public perception (held by many people: most of my family and friends with whom I discussed the subject quoted myths and prejudices discussed by Pollan), the possible danger of these molecules, and their therapeutic potential. I really enjoyed this book and was impressed throughout by Pollan's ability to remain objective even when dealing with the most zealous anecdotes. This is a great one: expand your mind with a listen!"
5,0241294223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1045774-mehrsa,5,"I read the Pollan essay in the New Yorker about psychedelics and so I picked this up right away. And I'm convinced. I totally want to try this! Wish it wasn't illegal. What was really brilliant about this book is his exploration of the ego and how that leads to so much stuckness and unhappiness. The book is a sober, in-depth account of a radical idea. "
6,0241294223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13298726-michael-perkins,2,"On the path to the Murti-Bing....Pollan was born the same year I was, which makes us what I call mid-Boomers. As he says himself, we were too young to be part of Haight Ashbury, The Summer of Love and Woodstock.But I had two older siblings who were on the front end of the Boomer generation and experienced it all. I paid close attention to what happened to their cohort. My older brother was destroyed by drugs, including psychedelics, and died at age 39. There's a kind of evangelistic fervor in this book that I found rather slanted. Instead of taking a realistic look at the 60's, for example, he hammers Timothy Leary page after page. Meanwhile, Ken Kesey gets no more than a couple of limp paragraphs. Oddly, the author's hero is one Al Hubbard, a huckster who dresses in military fatigues and packs a sidearm. (Hubbard made me think of Walter Sobchak, the John Goodman character in the 'The Big Lebowski') Hubbard is equally hostile to Leary. To me, these rants against Leary prove nothing and are pretty weird. But this seems to be the author's way of dismissing what actually happened back then, which can't be ignored. Meanwhile, Hubbard ended up broke, living in a trailer park in the Arizona desert. I feel I have read some version of this book several times before written by different people. As people in my Boomer generation moved away from, or out and out rejected, traditional religious structures they began searching for alternatives that continued into the 70's. This New Age quest led to distorted versions of Eastern religion and even cults. Techniques abounded. Now that Boomers are older, and staring death in the face, it's not surprising that they're returning to these questions no matter how successful or wealthy they've become. (The author is a self-described ""scientific materialist,"" looking for more, including a kind of safe passage to death under the influence of psychedelics). In my experience, flexible intelligence, openness to change, willingness to take risks, and to forgive others, do not require mind-bending drugs, but humility and an open heart. ------A dark side of psychedelics that Pollan doesn't cover---how the CIA used these drugs on unsuspecting victims who suffered severe brain damage, or even death, in the agency's quest to see if the drugs could be used for mind control or to extort confessions. It didn't work, but the casualties were horrible.https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/10/bo...===============What is the Murti-Bing?https://www.goodreads.com/review/show..."
7,0241294223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19546543-sarah-jane,2,"I thought the writing was great but the more I read, the less interested I became in this topic. One description of someone’s trip was fine, by the tenth description I was bored."
8,0241294223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1444651-david-katzman,4,"I knew that in the 1960s some research had been performed that demonstrated the highly successful use of a psychedelic drug called Ibogaine to disrupt alcoholism and cocaine and nicotine addiction. One of the most interesting facts that I learned from this book was how extensive the addiction research had also been using psilocybin and LSD. And these psychological studies have actually been revived legally in university settings today.How to Change Your Mind, was an interesting journey that explored numerous aspects of the use of psychedelics and the psychedelic experience, which appears to be enjoying a resurgence in social and psychiatric use. Pollan reviews the history of psychedelic use in the history of the U.S.—with Timothy Leary looming large here but featuring other key figures as well. He explores the results as well as the challenges of past and present scientific studies, the beliefs of psychedelic users, and the diverse variety of psychedelic experiences. In this latter regard, while writing this book Pollan himself took a number of psychedelic drugs and related what occurred. He also spends some time considering how plants with psychedelic effects may have evolved with such capabilities.He spends quite a great deal of time evaluating the idea that many psychonauts come away with (but by no means all) that they have experienced something mystical. And by mystical, I mean something “out there” rather than only “in here.” That somehow a psychedelic experience puts you in touch with something trans-personal. You touch “God.” Timothy Leary was a big proponent of this philosophy, but while some theology students have taken psychedelics to achieve a personal meeting with God, for the most part, these psychedelic experiences seem to counteract any belief in religious Fundamentalism. That is to say, the universal love and oneness that some individuals experience on psychedelics is a non-denominational ego-less state that doesn’t welcome specific doctrine or dogma. There is too much oneness-of-all-things to make room for parochial belief in written books purporting to explain what God wants. When you experience it first hand, you little need anyone else’s explanation.I found he spent too many pages on this belief. But I suppose it’s out there and has been promoted by so many New Age crackpots, including Leary, that it was good for him to evaluate it. Debunk it is the attitude that I would have, but Pollan is far more open-minded than I am. He cites the fact that so many psychonauts come away from their experiences absolutely 100% convinced that they encountered something greater than themselves, which makes it worth evaluating. I think that point of view is no more worth evaluating than it is to set two Fundamentalists against each other, a Christian Fundamentalist who believes Jesus was God and a Muslim who believes Allah was God and let them try to convince each other that because they are 100% convinced for sure absolutely that they are correct that…well, they are correct. Is it worth the debate? It’s not. That said, he does point out some interesting reasons why it might be the case that psychonauts come away feeling that psychedelic experiences are different from dreams, relating to certain centers of the brain connected to critical thinking. I have had several very bizarre, very intense psychedelic experiences in my life. And I never considered them to be in any way mystical nor even what I might call spiritual. They don’t connect you to a magical realm “out there” like the fantasy realms of heaven or hell or Middle Earth or the 5th dimension in spacetime. However, they can—and I say “can” carefully because they certainly don’t always—unlock increased powers of imagination and creativity. These bizarre experiences can shatter conventional thinking and allow you to achieve visions of not only artistic works but also new ways to live and be. They can make you aware of how habit and convention and social constraints and cultural struggles have entombed our species into the diverse traps laid for us by wealth and privilege and power. They encourage your mind to ask, What If and Why Not and How? It’s not hocus-pocus religious magic and god; it’s a spark or catalyst for mental empowerment. I am convinced it can produce powerful, personal insights that can be gleaned on one’s own or in a therapeutic setting. And also, because extremely powerful psychedelic journeys also initiate a dissolution of the ego, I have found that these trips can increase a feeling of empathy and sympathy for others, which can contribute to a more enlightened political view as well as richer art. Lastly, I do feel that these experiences have the capability when used in the proper context with a proper guide to improve psychological well-being and break addictions. The research isn’t conclusive but generally does show much faster and more effective recovery. Some studies have also shown that terminally ill patients come away from psychedelic experiences with much less anxiety and greater peace of mind about dying. There is value to be tapped if use and study becomes further legalized. Although there were many times while reading How to Change Your Mind where I was frustrated and thought Pollan was reporting some ridiculous mumbo-jumbo, in the end, his evaluations were relatively reasonable. And there was much of value (and interest) throughout the book."

Self and Spirit define the opposite ends of a spectrum, but that spectrum needn't reach clear to the heavens to have meaning for us. It can stay right here on earth. When the ego dissolves, so does a bounded conception not only of ourself but of our self-interest. What emerges in its place is invariably a broader, more open-hearted and altruistic – that is, more spiritual – idea of what matters in life. One in which a new sense of connection, or love, however defined, seems to figure prominently.
How to Change Your Mind dovetails so nicely into my reading interests about the brain and consciousness and picks up some related threads that other recent reads wove for me (in particular, What Are We Doing Here by Marilynne Robinson and Natural Causes by Barbara Ehrenreich), and continues a course of inquiry that I left dangling decades ago (with reads like Zen, Drugs, and Mysticism by R.C. Zaehner and The Teachings of Don Juan by Carlos Castaneda) – left dangling because, as someone raised on shocking Afterschool Specials, the flashback scene in Go Ask Alice, and the horror story of kindly Art Linkletter's tripped-out daughter jumping off a building because she thought she could fly, I knew that I would never consume acid or 'shrooms or peyote as a shortcut to enlightenment; institutionalised fear worked its trick on me. How odd to have been sent this ARC of a book by Michael Pollan – whose only previous work I had read was The Omnivore's Dilemma, back when I was interested in the philosophy of food – just at the time that other books started talking about the resurgence of research into psychedelic therapy. This book came at such a good time for me, and so perfectly suits my interests, that's there's some danger of me overrating it; I'm giving it five stars anyway. (Usual caveat: As I read an ARC, quotes may not be in their final forms.)How to Change Your Mind is divided into sections covering the history of research into and the eventual banning of psychedelics (and especially the invention of LSD and the introduction of psilocybin – the active ingredient in “magic mushrooms” – to the West, which both occurred in the mid-twentieth century), Pollan's recent personal experiences with psychedelics, a brief section on neuroscience and how psychedelics impact the brain, and the uses to which these chemicals are being put to therapeutic study today. As a journalist first, Pollan is present in each part of the book – interviewing subjects and describing his own experiences – and every bit of it was interesting to me.Pollan writes that nearly every culture on earth has used psychedelics – the exception being the Inuit, who simply don't appear to have access to the right chemicals in their environment – and with reference to the “Stoned Ape” theory (that prehistoric experimentation with psychedelics might have shocked the brains of early hominids into becoming us; although this theory isn't widely accepted, at any rate, these early visions of “the divine” might explain the persistence of religious belief throughout human civilisations), he makes the case that their use has been widespread throughout time and place. There are, of course, nonchemical ways of achieving a psychedelic experience: the characteristic dissolution of the ego can be attained through meditation or hypnagogic breathing techniques; the nineteenth century Romantics – Emerson, Whitman, Tennyson – were so in awe of nature that they became one with it and wrote about it in language that prefigures the accounts of acid trips; Appollo 14 astronaut Edgar Mitchell describes his sudden mystical experience when viewing the Earth and its place in the universe from space:
Suddenly I realized that the molecules of my body, and the molecules of my spacecraft, the molecules in the bodies of my partners, were prototyped, manufactured in some ancient generation of stars. [I felt] an overwhelming sense of oneness, of connectedness...It wasn't 'Them and Us,' it was 'That's me! that's all of it, it's one thing.' And it was accompanied by an ecstasy, a sense of, 'Oh my God, wow, yes' – an insight, an epiphany.
I can't help but think that if most of us can't achieve (or won't put in the work to train ourselves to achieve) spontaneous mystical experiences that have the potential to show us that all of humanity is connected and deserving of love, then what's the harm in guided recreational use of psychedelics? On the other hand, you can kind of see why there was such a backlash against Timothy Leary in the Sixties: if everyone does tune in, turn on, and drop out – if everyone suddenly sees the pointlessness of their worker bee lives – then who will keep the lights on and the grocery stores stocked and streets ploughed while the rest of us are seeking higher consciousness? It feels ironic to read of Aldous Huxley's enthusiasm for widespread LSD use so many years after writing Brave New World, where he seemed to be advocating for the more authentic life lived by the savages in the wild who weren't blissed out on Soma. One way or the other, psychedelics are making their return to respectability:
So maybe this, then, is the enduring contribution of Leary: by turning on a generation – the generation that, years later, has now taken charge of our institutions – he helped create the conditions in which a revival of psychedelic research is now possible.
Recreational (or religious/shamanic) use of psychedelics has never gone away – and Pollan was easily able to find trained and experienced guides to help him safely use LSD, psilocybin, and “the toad”. I was impressed by the level of attention that all of these guides paid to preparation (the set and setting that primes the mind), their care of Pollan during the experiences, and their training in helping him make sense of his trips after the fact. I was also impressed by Pollan's efforts to describe the ineffable, as well as his apparent transparency in sharing what seems such private encounters with himself. These guided trips seem to be like compressing years of therapy into a weekend (it can be Freudian or Jungian, depending on how you prepare your mind beforehand), and that sounds valuable.Even more remarkably, there are reputable institutions currently conducting research into using psychedelics to combat depression, addiction, and obsessions (what all of these seem to have in common are brains that are stuck in destructive modes of thinking that can literally be rebooted – like shaking a snowglobe – by a single acid trip.) Terminal cancer patients who are given psychedelic therapy discover their loving place in the universe and accept death as nonthreatening, smokers realise that their habit is pointless, people with depression (so far, temporarily) see the beauty in life – even Bill W, the founder of AA who had quit drinking after tripping on belladonna, is said to have wanted psychedelic therapy available to alcoholics; his philosophy of fellowship and surrendering to a higher power comes directly from what he experienced on his own psychedelic trip. Love is everything. Is a platitude so deeply felt still a platitude? No, I decided. A platitude is precisely what is left of a truth after it has been drained of all emotion. To re-saturate that dried husk with feeling is to see it again for what it is: the loveliest and most deepest of truths, hidden in plain sight. A spiritual insight? Maybe so. Or at least that's how it appeared in the middle of my journey. Psychedelics can make even the most cynical of us into fervent evangelists of the obvious.Pollan is careful not to conflate the metaphysical with “God” – even avowed atheists who could only describe their experiences as having been “bathed in God's love” still assert that they don't believe in God after it's over – but as the common experience seems to be seeing oneself as a part of all creation, and as this fosters a feeling of love for all humanity, it's hard to see what governments are afraid of by banning the recreational use of psychedelics (except for that whole needing the worker bees to keep the lights on and the grocery stores stocked and the streets ploughed). Full of history, science, and personal experience, How to Change Your Mind suited me and my interests perfectly."
10,0241294223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45941903-lou,4,"I have such a wide range of non-fiction reading interests that sometimes, until I actually see the book and its subject, not even I knew that I wanted to read it! But if it is something I am eager to know more about, I know right away. Let me start by saying, the only drugs I have even taken are those prescribed for me by a doctor, so I have no idea about other drugs, including psychedelic ones. What I do know about is how strong painkillers (morphine, fentanyl, buprenorphine, oxycodone etc) can certainly have a big impact on the way your mind works while taking them, so this book intrigued me in that respect. In ""How to Change Your Mind"", Michael Pollan aims to discover whether psychedelic drugs can alter your worldview. When LSD was discovered in the 1940s, it seemed to researchers, scientists and doctors as if the world might be on the cusp of psychological revolution. The sort that would lead to groundbreaking discoveries on consciousness, as well as bring relief to addicts and the mentally ill. But in the 1960s all research was banned. However, in recent years this work has begun once again on the potential LSD, psilocybin and DMT. Pollan bravely volunteers as a guinea-pig and writes a remarkable history of psychedelics that paints a compelling portrait of this extraordinary world.The narrative is accessible and will appeal to researchers, scientists, doctors and the general public alike. Pollan is clearly a guy that takes pride in his work, even taking psychedelics himself in order to make this study as reliable as possible. It's testament to his character that he chosen to do this, where others may have merely consulted those who have experience of taking the drugs.Many thanks to Penguin Books (UK) for an ARC. I was not required to post a review and all thoughts and opinions expressed are my own."
11,0241294223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28266634-liza-fireman,3,"This is probably the most boring book of someone telling about his experience of smoking toads and using psychedelics in general. It got a little bit better towards the end, and it was interesting to read about psychedelics therapy, but I can't say that I would be reading it again or that it was a revelation.  There was a lot of history in the book, and actually not enough science. The main thing is that were some stories, that I am sure could be told in a more engaging way. I also felt that it was very repetitive and the two words that I remember the most is psychedelics and Aldous Huxley. I did like the spotlight vs lantern consciousness allegory, which is actually not a Pollan thing, but that's the first time I encounter that. In The Philosophical Baby, Gopnik draws a useful distinction between the “spotlight consciousness” of adults and the “lantern consciousness” of young children. The first mode gives adults the ability to narrowly focus attention on a goal. In the second mode—lantern consciousness—attention is more widely diffused, allowing the child to take in information from virtually anywhere in her field of awareness, which is quite wide, wider than that of most adults. (By this measure, children are more conscious than adults, rather than less.) While children seldom exhibit sustained periods of spotlight consciousness, adults occasionally experience that “vivid panoramic illumination of the everyday” that lantern consciousness affords us. To borrow Judson Brewer’s terms, lantern consciousness is expansive, spotlight consciousness narrow, or contracted. So overall, too much anecdotal 'evidence', and not enough engagement on my side. About 2.5 stars."
12,0241294223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3268839-theresa-alan,4,"I’d read Michael Pollan’s book The Omnivore’s Dilemma, so when a friend bought this book for me, I already knew that Pollan was a respected journalist. I’d read a couple news articles about how LSD and psilocybin may be able to help with addictions. Since I believe the ridiculously high rates of incarceration the United States engages in since the war on drugs began with Nixon in the ‘70s, primarily because of people who battle substance abuse but aren’t violent criminals, I’m for anything that can help folks get free of their addiction. It’s at least something we should study. There were serious studies regarding these drugs in the fifties and early sixties as to how it could help folks stop smoking cigarettes or drinking alcoholically. One of the things that blew my mind was reading that Bill Wilson, a co-founder of AA, was an advocate of people taking psychedelics to help conquer alcoholism after he’d had a mystical experience on belladonna. He wanted to include it in the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous, but others felt that would muddle their message of being clean and sober. Also, some AAers don’t want sober alcoholics to take any drugs, including anti-depressants or sleep aids. Think how many lives could be saved, how many emergency room visits averted by bringing down the number of people who battle drugs and alcohol. When it comes to addiction, we need to use every tool possible and not let the cultural backlash of the free love 60s thwart research into any area that can help. There have also been studies on how these drugs, when administered in a safe environment with a doctor who is not high, can help with depression and anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder. Because LSD is a Schedule 1 drugs (along with marijuana, ecstasy, and heroin), it’s been hard to get funding for research. A serious danger is that, for people who might had a predilection for schizophrenia, it has been known to cause psychotic breaks. In the ‘60s the flamboyant advocate for LSD Timothy Leary, as well as the free love era in which lots of our young men did not want to fight a war in Viet Nam that they did not believe in, infuriated Nixon, who wanted his young people docile and compliant.This book has more history on magic mushrooms and LSD than I ever needed to know. Because there have been so few studies on how these drugs can help people overcome other addictions, it’s largely anecdotal. The studies that have been taking place since 2006 are limited.It seems counterintuitive that someone battling substance abuse should take a drug. The theory is that the addicted mind keeps doing the same thing over and over. Like if you go sledding and someone went sledding before you, your sled is naturally going to want to take the same route through the snow that the other sled made. Your mind goes through the same grooves of thinking patterns that are well worn. LSD and psilocybin are not addictive, and they get you to let go of your ego and see the world differently. For some people, just doing them once had a profound change and they were able to quit smoking or drinking or shake off the worst of the depression. For others, it might be something that needs to be repeated every six months or so. I’ve never wanted to take acid or magic mushrooms. It sounds terrifying, even though Michael Pollan described his own personal experiences, and, for the most part, had good things to say about the experiences. If I drink too much, at least I know exactly what will happen (mostly, I’ll hate myself in the morning and feel like hell). But with both marijuana and LSD, if we can help folks with anxiety disorder or substance abuse, we need to look into every avenue that can help, and not let prejudice or ignorance stop legit research.

13,0241294223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3897817-morgan-blackledge,5,"What a great book. What a fun book. What a wonderful, interesting, informative and even transformative read. I loved it, not because of the novelty of the subject, but because of the absolutely appropriate caution, charming naivety and utter lack of pretense with which the author Michael Pollan handles the subject. I’m 50, I grew up in a university town, and my parents and our family fiends and acquaintances came of age in the swingin’ 1960’s. So needless to say, far (far far far) too much of my youth was spent listening to baby boomers ballyhoo endlessly about psychedelics, leftist politics and new age spirituality.I have quite a bit of personal experience with each of those endeavors, including many of the magic molecules that are the protagonists of this text. But all of my youthful excursions occurred in the opaque cognitive and cultural shadow cast by said boomer evangelists, and consequently, many of the conclusions I came to regarding the meaning and value of these experiences were heavily influenced by that particular set and setting. In contrast, Michael Pollan is 60 something, but he’s kind of a square, and as it were, he’s one of those guys who never did acid, not even in college. So he takes to the psychedelic venture rather late in life, with a fully developed critical facility, coupled with a beginners mind refreshingly free from the aforementioned hippy hyperbole.In other words, he trips with the sober, curmudgeonly skepticism of a smart, responsible ‘saving for retirement’ type ‘dad guy’, mixed with the curios, open and friendly here n’ now enthusiasm of a good natured golden retriever. Pollan somehow manages to render the quintessentially ineffable psychedelic experience into something rather sensible and perhaps even effable (Harris, 2018).It’s a very different, more grounded, more responsible, less contrived, more skeptical, more broadly considered take on the subject than what we’ve come to expect from the likes of Huxley, Alpert, Leary and Kesey. My previously mentioned personal experiences were a wonder to be sure. Absolutely enriching without a doubt. But I have labored as an adult to put their lasting value into precise language. My sense was that these were immensely valuable and formative introductions to the expanded mind, but beyond that, the experiences remain rather implicit, as opposed to explicitly understood and usefully integrated. In yet another autobiographical example of youth wasted on the young, I was more enamored with the splashy perceptual effects of the drugs than the subtle lessons they can facilitate regarding self transcendence. But my interest in introspection was sparked, and this ultimately led me to meditation. Like many of my boomer predecessors, I began my serious meditation practice working in a Hindu tradition, with the psychedelic experience as my most proximal frame of reference. Analogously, I spent too much time and energy in this stage chasing cathartic spiritual ‘fireworks’ rather than digging in and drilling down to their source.The catharsis was valuable, but again, not explicitly or clearly useful in any practical sense. My later life meditation practice occurred in the Buddhist context, and this is when all of the introspective practice really took hold and provided traction in life. Bringing concentration, clarity and equanimity to absolutely ‘butt normal’ experiences enabled real life progress, reduced suffering and facilitated a more flexible, less binding sense of self. I entered the field of psychotherapy in order to share this fantastically liberating way of being with anyone who cared. The problem is, it’s really hard to do, and almost nobody cares. Most people don’t want subtle. Most people desperately want those cathartic epiphany and release experiences, and look at you like you’re a total dick if you challenge that even a little. And maybe that’s just the way it is. Maybe people just need a little thunder and lighting in order for the rain to come and soften the ground for new growth. This book helped me realize how helpful those early psychedelic experiences were. They captured my youthful imagination, and slaked my thirst for the numinous, while concurrently providing the foundation for more subtle work later on.Plus they we just plain giggly wiggly fun.I’m still WAY more interested in what good therapy combined with really good meditation instruction and practice can do for a person. But after reading this book, I’m slightly more open to how (precisely) a psychedelic experience, occurring within a therapeutic context, can jump start, or even rocket boost a process of personal exploration, radical acceptance and spiritual growth in a reasonably stable and sufficiently mature individual. I’m not interested in groovy acid orgy deadheaded pestilence, or teeth gnashing, amphetamine fueled dance party revelry, or burning man dehydration festivals, or shamanic shitlock crystal pleasures, or anything of the sort. I have WAY been there and TOTALLY done that. It’s really fun, but it’s kids stuff, and when the party is over, it’s not so cute. At this stage of life, my fundamental concerns are: freedom, connection, health, well-being, and meaningful accomplishment. Ultimately, it’s my assumption that you have to be pretty dang sober to get all of those things in a durable and lasting way. But I’m a grumpy old man who has the benefit of some truly adventurous, borderline degenerate youthful life experiences to draw from. My current relative rigidity was something I developed, rather late in life, out of sheer necessity. Sobriety, sober community and structure are my magic at this particular juncture of my ‘one wild life’.But if someone is languishing in a state of icy, turgid, spiritual paralysis (many many good examples come to mind), than I can absolutely see how a little molecular magic, in the proper set and setting, could defrost and ignite the engine of enlightenment.This book really helped me warm up to this exciting frontier of therapy. Thank you Michael Pollan :-)"
14,0241294223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/730754-ken,5,"Over 400 pages of psychedelics: its history, its big players, its experiences, its possibilities, its science. No one could do it justice, probably. No one but Michael Pollan. If you want to talk technical merit, this is a 5-star product, start to finish, even if you're only 4-star enjoying it as a read. Chiefly Pollan deals in magic mushrooms (here referred to more technically as psilocybin), LSD, and 5-MeO-DMT (a.k.a. ""The Toad,"" and don't ask, but it's something out of a giant gland that you squeeze out of a special live toad so this gunk sprays out onto a mirror, where it dries up and... er... let's hop to another topic, shall we?).After the history and an awful lot of Timothy Leary, a happy villain to the psychonauts-that-be, we get to Pollan's trips themselves. Now there's a good journalist: sacrificing himself in the name of literature. Pollan takes three trips on the aforementioned drugs, all under the watchful eyes of ""guides"" who are experts, all in controlled conditions. If you're keeping score (for him, anyway), the shroom definitely wins.After tripping, we get some science, which brings us back to that last frontier (space, you thought?), the brain. Still, with all the science flying around, we get a lot of mysticism too. Just to keep the scientists honest and all.Finally, Pollan chronicles how these drugs have made a long and tortured climb back to respectability (asterisk) in that researchers are now seriously working on their helpful effects for the dying, the addicted, and the depressed. Need a change of mind? Voila. Need to take your mind off your impending death? Nothing like being detached from your ego, for no one has ever experienced ANYthing like they do when tripping. The only thing one has to fear is fear itself (even though one expert posits that man fears three things: death, other men, and their own brain).If you're hesitant because you remember the egg in the frying pan (""This is your brain on drugs.""), this book is just the ticket to loosen you up. Sure, marijuana is going recreational left and right, but that's child's play compared to where these things will take you. All you need be is careful. Real careful. And do as Pollan does. Proceed carefully and educate yourself. Leave Alice to the Dormouse.Still (Timothy) Leary of it all? Change things up. Give the book a go. It's a long haul and not equally interesting in all sections, but it surely is...unique. I only read it because it made the New York Times's ""Top Ten Books of 2018*."" If that's good enough reason for you, too, ""Turn off your mind, relax and float downstream....""(* Those book lists. Such delightful trips!)"

16,0241294223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3536004-jenna,3,"Prior to reading this book, I didn't know much about LSD or other psychedelics. If you'd asked me about them, I'd have furrowed my brow, bit the bottom corner of my lip, and remarked, Umm..... The Grateful Dead? So of course when I saw this book, realising it's something I knew nothing about, I wanted to read it. Seeing all the raving reviews about it, I wanted to read it even more. Sadly, I didn't love it as much as I expected I would and most others do. Some of the history of LSD and psilocybin was interesting, but for the most part I found it tiresome as there was so much detail about the various people who had researched/is researching it. There is also quite a lot about both the author's trips and those of study subjects, and reading about them made me incredibly anxious. Why? Because just imagining having my brain do that was enough to disturb my control freak brain! Why anyone would willingly take something to hallucinate and be out of control of one's brain is beyond me and yet people do it all the time. And love it! So perhaps I'm just weird or maybe what I need is a good trip to loosen up my need for control? The one chapter I absolutely loved was ""Neuroscience"". Learning how psychedelics work on the brain (at least as far as we know so far) was incredibly interesting. If the book had only been about that, I'd give it 5 stars. Sadly, the rest of the book was only 2 and 3 stars for me. I love the way Michael Pollan writes but this just wasn't the book for me. "
17,0241294223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,5,"Nature's miracle products reveal many immediate healing options. Perhaps they even made the incarnation possible aka ""stoned ape theory"".Please note that I have put the original German text to the end of this review. Just if you might be interested.The pharmaceutical industry has a logical aversion to non-industrial medicines. As a result, coverage of all alternative therapies is always biased and described one-sided negative. One of the favorite arguments is the lack of exact dosing and varying agent concentration in all natural substances. Apart from the fact that these are often not life-threatening fluctuation margins, the advances in plant breeding and genetic engineering will improve accuracy.It would be a losing business for the pharmaceutical industry if everyone could breed their toads at home or grow a variety of fungal cultures in a hypothetical cultivation set. The resistance to cannabis legalization was primarily driven by competitiveness. As with the eco-social market economy, the various sharing concepts, decentralized energy production, etc. Everything that makes people self-sufficient and independent of manufacturers and thereby ensures that they are lost as customers. When often only one dose with long breaks in between is sufficient for the healing process.Because the elimination of the ego in the brain, worries, addictions and even fear of death is recognized as irrelevant. People trained in meditation for life have similar brain functions as people under the influence of certain drugs. This higher level of consciousness can first be achieved in a stoned state of mind and the wisdom from this experience transferred to the sober, expanded, healthier and better life. Once the brain has functioned freed from the burden of subjective impressions and limitations, the restored consciousness has matured.The ""stoned ape theory"" is a daring hypothesis. But if one sees the restrictive and often self-damaging ego as a drag, the dissolution of it in the animal ancestors could have caused an evolutionary boost. According to the mantra ""use it or lose it"", a flood of substances that open up new functional mechanisms, experiences and interconnections is a great workout. Perhaps without the many more or less psychoactive substances in food, brain development would have progressed much more slowly.Indeed, there is an individual risk with any medicine because one often doesn´t understand the exact mode of action. The chemists know the effect that is triggered in the body. But nobody knows exactly how and why. Therefore, every conventional and approved drug is part of a vast experiment with uncertain long-term consequences.A differentiation between severe addiction and the healthy dose would be socially necessary. Rather than kicking the door in with a SWAT Team for the possession of all alternative substances, a distinction should be made between a reasonable dose for healing purposes and substance abuse. But that would require a social consensus and an open dialogue. And not a sterile hospital environment, but a pleasant and personal atmosphere when treated with the help of an empathic trip-sitter.This raises the question of why individualized medicine is not forced. Because not only the exact dosage of active ingredients is essential. But also that one determines how fast or slow a patient metabolizes. There are slow, normal and fast metabolisms and everyone would need a separately calculated dosage. This would be done a one-off with a more and more affordable test, and then the dose of each drug could be adjusted to it. But it would mean that the slow metabolizers would need less medication, which would be a loss for the industry.One knows too little about the effects, as that one could demonize or glorify something. More extensive basic research is urgently needed. Or at least the consistency and honesty, to par the severe side effects of conventional and legal drugs with the possible, much rarer negative consequences of psychedelic substances.Part of the fascination is the fact that unexplored chemicals enter the not understood brain in unknown ways and change something. Tiny parts are known, but most stay a mystery. Same thing with the plants, animals and fungi that produce substances that cause such reactions in mammals with huge heads. And that many great discoveries of human history were probably only made possible under the influence of various drugs. It could be hypothesized that it was this combination of genius and the vehicle of mind expansion that made milestones possible.Die Wundermittel der Natur offenbaren viele unmittelbare Heilungsmöglichkeiten. Vielleicht machten sie sogar ""stoned ape theory"" die Menschwerdung erst möglich.Die Pharmabranche hat eine logische Aversion gegen nicht industriell herstellbare Medikamente. Von daher ist die Berichterstattung über alle alternativen Therapien immer voreingenommen und einseitig negativ. Eines der Lieblingsargumente ist die mangelnde Dosierbarkeit und Wirkstoffkonzentration in allen natürlichen Stoffen. Abgesehen davon, dass es sich dabei oft nicht um lebensbedrohliche Schwankungsbreiten handelt, werden die Fortschritte in Pflanzenzucht und Gentechnik die Genauigkeit verbessern. Es wäre ein Verlustgeschäft für die Pharmabranche, wenn sich jeder selbst daheim seine Kröten züchten oder in einem hypothetischen Kultivierungsset diverse Pilzkulturen züchten konnte. War doch der Widerstand gegen die Cannabislegalisierung zu großen Teilen auch nur vom Konkurrenzdenken getragen. Wie auch bei ökosozialer Marktwirtschaft, den diversen Sharing Konzepten, dezentraler Energieerzeugung, usw. Alles, was Menschen autark und unabhängig von Herstellern macht und dadurch dafür sorgt, dass sie als Kunden verloren gehen. Wenn oftmals nur eine Dosis mit langen Pausen dazwischen reicht. Weil durch die Ausschaltung des Egos im Gehirn Sorgen, Süchte und selbst Todesangst als irrelevant erkannt werden. Weil ein Leben lang in Meditation geschulte Menschen ähnliche Hirnfunktionen haben wie Menschen unter Drogeneinfluss. Diese höhere Bewusstseinsebene kann zuerst unter Drogeneinfluss erreicht werden und die Weisheit aus dieser Erfahrung auf das nüchterne, erweiterte und bessere Leben übertragen. Wenn das Hirn einmal befreit von der Last der subjektiven Eindrücke und Einschränkungen funktioniert hat, ist das wieder zurück gekehrte Bewusstsein gereift.Die ""stoned ape theory"" ist eine gewagte Hypothese. Aber wenn man einschränkendes und oft für sich selbst und andere schädliches Ego als Hemmschuh sieht, könnte die Auflösung dessen in den tierischen Vorfahren wirklich einen Evolutionsschub bewirkt haben. Frei nach ""use it or loose it"" ist eine Flutung mit Stoffen, die neue Funktionsmechanismen, Erfahrungen und Verschaltungen eröffnen, ein super Workout. Vielleicht wäre ohne die vielen mehr oder weniger psychoaktiven Stoffe in der Nahrung die Hirnentwicklung wesentlich langsamer voran geschritten.Sicher ist ein gewisses Risiko bei jeder Medizin, weil man die genaue Wirkungsweise häufig nicht versteht. Die Chemiker kennen den Effekt, der im Körper ausgelöst wird. Aber wie und teilweise warum genau, weiß keiner. Von daher ist auch jedes konventionelle und zugelassene Medikament Teil eines großen Experiments mit ungewissen Langzeitfolgen. Eine Differenzierung zwischen schwerer Suchtkrankheit und der gesunden Dosis wäre gesellschaftlich notwendig. Anstatt bei allen alternativen Stoffen die Tür einzutreten, sollte zwischen einer vernünftigen Dosierung zu Heilungszwecken und Drogenmissbrauch unterschieden werden. Was aber einen gesellschaftlichen Konsens und einen offenen Dialog voraussetzen würde. Und ein nicht eine sterile Krankenhausumgebung, sondern eine angenehme und persönliche Atmosphäre bei der Behandlung mit einem empathischen Tripsitter.Es eröffnet sich die Frage, warum die individualisierte Medizin nicht forciert wird. Denn nicht nur die genaue Wirkstoffdosierung ist wichtig. Sondern auch, dass man eruiert, wie schnell oder langsam ein Patient metabolisiert. Es gibt langsame, normale und schnelle Stoffwechsel und jeder bräuchte eine separat berechnete Dosierungsmenge. Das wäre mit einem, immer günstiger werdenden, Test einmalig zu bestimmen und dann könnte die Dosis jedes Medikaments darauf angepasst werden. Aber es würde bedeuten, dass die langsamen Metabolisierer weniger Medikamente brauchen würden, was ein Verlustgeschäft wäre.Man weiß noch viel zu wenig über die Auswirkungen, als dass man etwas verteufeln oder verherrlichen könnte. Längere Grundlagenforschung ist dringend notwendig. Oder zumindest die Konsequenz und Ehrlichkeit, die schweren Nebenwirkungen von Psychopharmaka und anderen Medikamenten auf eine Stufe mit den möglichen, negativen Folgen von psychodelischen Stoffen zu stellen. Die Faszination macht aus, dass unerforschte Stoff auf unbekannten Wegen das unverstandene Gehirn entern und an den Rädchen drehen. Das Pflanzen, Tiere und Pilze Stoffe herstellen, die in Säugetieren derartige Reaktionen verursachen. Und dass viele große Entdeckungen der Menschheitsgeschichte erst unter dem Einfluss diverser Drogen entstanden. Man könnte die Hypothese aufstellen, dass erst diese Kombination aus einem genialen Geist mit einem Vehikel zur Bewusstseinserweiterung Meilensteine ermöglicht hat. "

Over half of the book is about the history of psychedelics and made me feel like I was reading a history textbook with unnecessary dates, people, and irrelevant facts. On top of that, the authors style of writing wasn't for me, there was a lot of fluff and unnecessary details in his writing. I would have liked the book better if it was actually about what psychedelics taught us rather than the history behind them. I also prefer authors who write more straight to the point without the run on sentences. He adds a lot of jargon and descriptive words to describe something that could of otherwise been told in a few short words. I'm more of a get straight to the point kinda gal. If you make it to the last few pages, the book gets a bit more interesting, recalling different peoples journeys with psychedelics. It was the only part I liked."
21,0241294223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18695911-daniel-chaikin,5,"Now that I'm using audible.com I feel some responsibility to pick good books with good narration and I spent a lot of time struggling to come with a one this time and nothing seemed quite right enough, then I listened to this oddball title and Pollan won me over with his passion in the sample - he reads this himself. And, he also completely won me over with this book.There was a time when psychedelics were a serious medicine under serious study, especially for alcoholics. Then Timothy Leary came in, decided everybody needed to experience these drugs, acted as if he had discovered the whole field and promoted them in such an attention-grabbing way to where everyone knows something about LSD...and also to the point that the drug become illegal, and study of it dropped to zero in the US, full stop. Of course, Leary got his message across and these drugs saw wide illegal usage especially in the 1960's...and also especially in silicon valley where, as a software developer put it, LSD helps you see patterns.LSD is a powerful drug, but, in a surprise at least to me, it turns out it creates no health issues. The only danger with LSD is what someone might do while they are using it (like Charles Mason's group, maybe). But it doesn't have any impact on anything in our body except for it's temporary impact on the brain. And it's non-addictive, maybe anti-addictive. But it does have surprising benefits when used the right way. To frame this kind of the way Pollan does, research in NYU on terminally ill patients found spectacular results with patients using a psychedelic. Many said they had mystical experiences, and many lost their fear of the coming deaths and made peace with it. In some examples, people had the best parts of their lives, terminally ill, after their experience with psychedelics. It didn't work for everyone, of course.So, what's going on? This is where the book gets especially fascinating. Recent study of brain activity has determined what is our default node network - that is, your brain activity when you're not doing anything. You're just day dreaming and filling in time. This activity is actually a big deal, it's your basic thought process, your default mindset. And you can't really change it very easily. Pollan uses a ski slope as an example. Imagine your brain as slope with a fresh cover of snow. Someone skis down and leaves tracks. As more people ski down, some tracks harden, and soon everyone has to ski down the same track, you can't get out of it. That's your brain, and track is the default node netwark - all your thoughts funnel down the well worn path.This is actually an issue with everyone. Our brain tries to make things easier on us, and it forms these networks so we can focus on other things, but we lose some touch with reality, if you like. Instead of seeing things as they actually are, our brains make all sort of assumptions and we accept these as real without really knowing. We lose that childhood sense of exploring everything because everything is new. This breaks down when, say, we travel to a new country and all these assumptions start to fail. But, it becomes a serious problem for certain states of mind. Our brain has a structuring and the more structured we are, the most separated we from reality and more prone we are to various obsessive problems, like addiction of course, and OCD, but also depression and anxiety and other things. Essentially the brain becomes too rigid.So, the big thing with psychedelics is that they shut down our default node network, our background brain, or ego. In the ski slope analogy, they provide, for short period, a fresh coat of new snow. Our brains are freed up to re-investigate the world around us with new eyes, like a child. And, the connections in our brain are free to follow new paths, and new connections, leading to some strange stuff, but also, apparently, to a completely new view of consciousness, or maybe even other consciousnesses. (technically you don't need the drugs, you can mimic this affect with meditation, for example). And, with the drugs, you don't lose the experience, but you remember everything. And anything you learn stays with you. I know I'm getting wordy and maybe it's better to just read the book then read my review with all its oversimplifications, but this stuff has got me thinking so much. So, I'll add here that Pollan points out the experience doesn't work for everyone, that it's very dependent on the mindset and setting you are in when you take the drug, and whose around to guide you and help you if you get into trouble. And the affect wears off. And while the terminally ill tended to have inspirational life changing experiences, and nicotine and alcohol addicts had good rates of positive results (much better than, say, with AA), there were also those oddball experiences. There was the smoker who had such a powerful important insight, she made the guide with her write it down. When she came out of the high and checked on the message, it was...eat fruits and vegetable and exercise (but she kicked smoking)Anyway, I recommend this one with all the enthusiasm expressed above. -----------------------------------------------63.

Among many others, what do Anaïs Nin, Jack Nicholson, Stanley Kubrick, André Previn, James Coburn, Aldous Huxley, Bill “W”, Ram Dass, Andrew Weil, Ethyl Kennedy, Steve Jobs, and Cary Grant have in common? Psychedelic therapy.Are there other uses for mushrooms beyond sautéing them in butter, garlic, and dry sherry? Yes! They can wipe out carpenter ant colonies, clean up pollution and industrial waste, and act as agents to fight bioterrorism. What else? That’s what some people want to find out.I came of age after LSD was banned by the government (thanks in no small part to Timothy Leary) so my knowledge of it was primarily negative and I was definitely too scared to try it despite hanging out with people who used it freely. Come to think of it, they are probably why I was scared to try it.But up until 1966 it was legal and there were 70 serious research programs at prestigious institutions throughout the 50s and early 60s exploring its potential to treat depression, schizophrenia, ease a person’s death journey, and help cure addictions to nicotine and alcohol. All these decades later there is renewed scientific and personal interest.Oh, the potential. What if we could:➤experience no doubt, know instead of just believe➤experience the very worst of what life can throw at you, including death, and regard it objectively and accept it with equanimity➤become more open at an advanced age when the grooves of mental habit have been etched so deep as to seem inescapable ➤go on a journey that could be among the two or three most profound experiences of your lifeThe author went above and beyond attempting to find some answers for himself and the reader. I have nothing but praise and respect for his efforts. This was #1 on our library’s most requested list for good reason. Fabulously researched, fascinating, and worth my reading time—and convincing? My mind has definitely been opened and changed and all I did was read the book.You might be curious how many tabs I used writing this review—a lot let me tell you!I’m talking about the little sticky colored ones to mark favorite book passages.Would I like to sign up for a session?

23,0241294223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7958239-elizabeth-theiss,5,"Prepare to change your mind about the role of psychedelic drugs in western culture. Or, if you have experience as a psychonaut, get ready for a broad, expansive review of history, research, and the possibilities for public policy.When LSD, mescaline, psilocybin, and other psychedelic drugs first became known in the 1950s and 1960s, academic and medical researchers explored their potential for relieving depression, addiction, and other mental problems. The promising research results were abandoned when Timothy Leary, a Harvard professor, began urging young people to “Tune in, turn on, and drop out.” The federal government ultimately outlawed hallucinogenics for all uses, including research. In the late 1990s, research on psilocybin and other mind-expanding drugs resumed and the results are rather stunning. The vast majority of subjects reported experiencing ego-shattering, transcendent trips that resulted in a deep understanding of the interconnectedness of themselves with the universe and a new openness to experience. Guided psychedelic experiences lead subjects to deep insights. For example, in a tobacco cessation program, participants describe feeling a deep realization of the destructive nature of tobacco and a powerful connection to the universe. Why would one disturb the life force that empowers them with the destructive force of tobacco? In research on the impact of LSD on existential anxiety in cancer patients was especially impressive. It allowed subjects to let go of narrow conceptions of materialistic death and embrace a more holistic sense of death as a transition to another state of being. Confession: I am a child of the 60s who experimented with mescaline and LSD. I count these experiences as among the most formative of my life. I am a more creative, happy person because of them. I learned that humans are entirely intertwined among ourselves and every other animal, plant, and mineral on the earth. We are stardust. We are golden. Everything counts and yet nothing really matters in the context of the millennia. I read Pollan’s descriptions of his own forays into psychedelia with a sense of familiarity. The potential of psychedelic drugs to change the world for people suffering from depression, existential anxiety attendant to life-threatening disease, and addiction seems settled. What stands in the way is Nixon-era prejudice and fear. The scientific community seems to have developed some consensus that psychedelics can play an important role in healing several resistant diseases of western civilization. Where public policy goes from here will depend on the policy community paying more attention to data and less to prejudice. "
24,0241294223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47188780-kathleen,4,"Pollan’s research regarding psychedelics is all-encompassing—covering everything from the time LSD was first discovered in 1938 by Albert Hofmann, a Swiss scientist working for Sandoz; to ingesting LSD, psilocybin and the crystallized venom of the Sonoran Desert toad himself. Of note, Pollan is most interested in the medical studies of this class of drugs and their potential use in humans—and not their recreational use.Psychedelic-aided therapy, properly conducted by trained professionals can help with: addiction to alcohol, treatment-resistant depression, and terminally ill cancer patients. The egoless realm of consciousness achieved by taking psychedelics helps to modify the brain so that it can pursue different pathways—even gaining a mystic or spiritual awareness. Of note, people who practice serious meditation can also experience this transformative state. Pollan relates the experiences of many of those who have taken psychedelics. Surprisingly, their stories tend to run together and are rather boring. This comprehensive overview could have been shortened considerably."
25,0241294223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62390164-numidica,4,"Additional comment 1/9/2019: I've shared this review with non-Goodreads friends and got a bit of side eye. So I'd like to share some context. I have never taken LSD or mushrooms, or for that matter any non-prescribed drug other than a minuscule amount of pot in college. So my point here is not to promote psilocybin because I use it, because I never have, but rather to provide a review of a very interesting book.How to Change Your Mind is an investigation by journalist and writer Michael Pollan (The Omnivore’s Dilemma, The Botany of Desire) into the history, use, and benefits of psychedelic compounds. I probably would have passed over this book had I not previously read Omnivore’s Dilemma; I know the quality of Pollan’s research and writing, and that convinced me to give this book a try. I’m glad I did! It turns out that most of what I thought I knew about psilocybin (magic mushrooms) and LSD (the pharmaceutical version of the mushroom) is wrong. LSD and psilocybin have been illegal in the US since the ‘60’s, and are classed (along with heroin) as a Schedule 1 illegal drug. As Pollan describes in his book, the idea of LSD or psilocybin as dangerous is mostly an artifact of ‘60’s anxiety about the counterculture rather than being based on actual evidence of danger from the drug / mushroom. Psilocybin is not addictive, and the number of “bad trips” resulting in injury or death is vanishingly rare. The major concern about psilocybin use is for people who have psychotic tendencies or schizophrenia, because in a few cases the drug may further unhinge them. Many of the reasons that were cited to categorize LSD / psilocybin as a Schedule 1 illegal drug are simply without factual basis. For instance, one claim, which I remember from my youth, is that LSD “damages chromosomes”; there is simply no evidence for this. Pollan reviews, at length, the history of the drug, and the research done on LSD in the 1950’s and ‘60’s, and he shows that scientists then believed that LSD was a promising treatment for depression and addiction. Unfortunately, most of this research was filed away or flushed when the government made LSD illegal and cut off research funds, and even before that scientists were becoming increasingly uncomfortable with the promotion of LSD by Timothy Leary and others as a recreational “consciousness-expanding” drug. And yet, expansion of consciousness is apparently one of the real values of psilocybin / LSD. Pollan describes the experiences of many, many peoples’ “trips”, including his own, and the words various people use to describe the experience are remarkably similar: a description of diminution or elimination of the ego; a visual review of their lives, sometimes meeting long-dead relatives or friends; an overwhelming feeling of love and empathy toward other people as well as toward plants and animals; and in some cases the feeling of meeting or being one with “God”. Pollan delves deep into the biological basis for this effect, and the general sense is that the drug increases neuroplasticity on a temporary basis, though some of the effects last for months or longer. Pollan expands upon this later in the book, explaining that the default mode network (DMN) of the brain, which allows rapid processing of new information based on prior experience, is temporarily off-line, and so each new experience, whether it is seeing a leaf, or an insect, or a person, seems as new and wonderful or strange as it would to a young child. Hallucinations also occur, as is well known.And all of the above might be interesting reading with a sort of “so what?” conclusion, if not for the evidence of some truly astounding results in improving outcomes in a number of otherwise intractable conditions. In a study involving smokers who wanted to quit, use of psilocybin resulted in an 80% cessation rate. For those of you who have known smokers trying to quit, this is amazing, to say the least, and it is a better result than any other known approach. Among people suffering from “treatment-resistant-depression”, results appear to be equally high compared to other treatments. A preliminary study of alcoholics treated with psilocybin showed >50% success. One of the most moving stories in the book is about the use of psychedelics to treat anxiety among those with cancer. In many cases, people simply lost their fear of death, and in others it was greatly reduced, and this allowed the cancer patients to have a much better and loving engagement with loved ones, and an improved quality of life as the end grew near.And why does this happen? It appears that the experience of ego dissolution allows people, during, and for a while after their trips, to view themselves truly objectively, while enhancing their love and empathy toward others. The answers people gave to the question, “what happened?”, seem banal or obvious, but they gain profundity through the changed behavior of the post-psilocybin-using patients. When one person who quit smoking was asked how she could do it, she said, “Smoking was no longer relevant”. Others said things like: “I could see now that this was bad for me – so why would I continue?” All these were things that they knew intellectually prior to their trips, but after the trips they knew and they believed. Other effects cited by Pollan, though harder to quantify, are increased creativity, renewed interest in one’s career, and increased love and empathy for others.Pollan makes an enlightening comment about some of the more obscure assertions of 18th & 19th Century writers about transcendence, trance-like states, etc. – maybe they were achieving an ego-less state via meditation, breathing exercises, or some other trance-inducing mechanism; perhaps even psychedelic substances. The same goes for some of the more obscure statements in the Bible, like God speaking from the burning bush. This could have been a psychedelic experience. Almost all cultures have some sort of substance that brings on psychedelic experiences. As the NYT points out: “You don’t necessarily need drugs to enter this strange, egoless realm of consciousness: Near-death experiences, meditation and fasting can get you there, too.” But the psychedelic drugs get people there reliably. Many people, after their trips, begin a meditation regimen which allows them to partly regain the ego-less state and some of its benefits. Experienced meditators, observed in scientific studies, exhibit similar brain function as people who take psilocybin.All in all, this is a very interesting book, highly recommended. Psychedelics are beginning to be studied again at various universities, so I expect we will hear more on this subject in the coming years.P.S. The only reason I did not give this five stars is that Mr. Pollan, god bless him, really does go on at length about certain things that could be dealt with more succinctly. But I love that he has obviously done his research."
26,0241294223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20735143-yaaresse,3,"Once again I seem to be in the minority. Oh well, I'm used to that. Having read The Omnivore's Dilemma and Botany of Desire. I had fairly high expectations for this book. Those high expectations were only slightly dampened by the tidal wave of praise for this book, which these days is more often a sign of brilliant marketing and/or controversial content than a sign of brilliant writing/content. Three are three sections to the book: 1. A very brief history of psychedelics' use through time and a less brief history of research on psychedelics (mostly LSD and psilocybin, less on MDMA and others.) I thought this was the most interesting and best organized part of the book, but it was still fairly bare bones. And for someone who claimed they weren't going to spend a lot of time talking about Timothy Leary, he spends a hell of a lot of space on Timothy Leary. 2. Descriptions of Pollan's experiments with LSD, mushrooms, and toad venom. The actual descriptions are fairly brief. Most of the time is spend with him freaking out about preparations and worry about not being able to control every aspect of the experience, then later lamenting how it was all so much less than he expected. This was my least favorite part of the book. His ""I paid my money, and I want my safe, easy, permanent instant enlightenment right NOW...even though I don't believe in any of that nonsense."" Typical western attitude: I want it all, I want it now, and I don't want to have to put in any time or effort to get it. OK, I get it. He's a content atheist. But the constant snark about all things religious or with what he felt had any religious-spiritual trappings got old fast. The more he snarked, the more peevish and arrogant he seemed. 3. Current research on use of psychedelics to treat addiction and depression, also to treat anxiety in end-of-life. He said he was going to talk about the neuroscience in this section, but there's very little of that. Most of it is anecdotes, which get repetitive quickly. This section had the most potential given our society's near-epidemic of opioid addiction and long-term use of anti-depressants. Unfortunately, it didn't really deliver much hard information. I suspect he has subscribed to the Gladwellian formula of ""keep the science light and shove in a lot of anecdotes that that support your pet points."" The book is a defense for the use of psychedelics, so don't expect objectivity or balance. Pollan is clearly a fan of the stuff. And that's fine except it puts the book squarely in the ""preaching to the choir"" club. Those inclined to agree with him will praise it. Those who don't agree will probably not bother to read it. Pollan does make one depressingly good point -- although it's made almost in passing and he doesn't explore it at all -- when he notes that no drug company is going to invest in psychedelics as treatment because there is no money in it for them. The patent on LSD has long expired. Mushrooms can be grown by almost anyone with a little training. Most of all, drug companies are far more interested in maintenance drugs than single or rare-use treatments. If Pfizer (or Lilly or Glaxo) can keep people on a med for life, they have no interest in interrupting that revenue stream. Basically, this book was just interesting enough to make me realize how much better it should have been and just informative enough to make me want to read something more in-depth (and far more objective) on the subject."
27,0241294223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10407443-ross-blocher,5,"How to Change Your Mind is a great book, addressing psychedelics from a variety of angles and demystifying a topic with a whole bunch of mystery surrounding it. Michael Pollan, best known for his books about food and farming, delves first-hand into the world of LSD, psilocybin, DMT, ayahuasca, and a number of other well-known and more obscure drugs (5-MeO-DMT, anyone?). He describes the historical context, when these compounds were discovered, their stigmatization and eventual outlawing, the practices and ritual surrounding them, early pioneers of research, the influence of polarizing figures like Timothy Leary, the conflation with 60s counter culture, the current figures advocating for further research, churches and individual guides who licitly and illicitly administer them, the physical mechanisms of neural pathways and blocked (or activated) receptors in the brain, and the personal experience of being turned on, tuned in, and dropped out.This latter challenge remains the unattainable goal: putting into words precisely that which defies and often bypasses the language centers of the brain. Pollan does an admirable job of this. Having tried ayahuasca myself, I found a lot of truth and overlap in Pollan's description of a psychedelic experience, such as how an oft-repeated truism like ""all you need is love"" or ""we are all connected"" suddenly takes on an all-consuming, powerful sensation of conviction and reality, which continues to resonate in the sober aftermath of the days and even years that follow. Pollan also outlines many possible benefits these compounds might impart, from dealing with depression and end-of-life angst or addiction (ironically, this class of drugs might help with quitting other drugs) to, as the title suggests, literally changing our minds to think in new and creative ways and be less factional and competitive. The common sense case for reclassifying many of these drugs (almost all are schedule 1), funding further research, and opening up avenues for recreational use is well made, with equally common sense provisos about some unexpected effects, overdoses and bad trips. Pollan's accounts make me curious to try some of these other compounds, but I'll have to work on getting my wife's permission first."
28,0241294223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6790341-benjamin-siegel,4,"I feel lucky to live in a world where Michael Pollan has now written, sometimes quite beautifully, about tripping."
29,0241294223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/147289-jason-pettus,0,"A few weeks ago, I was raving here about the first book I ever read by participatory journalist Michael Pollan, 2006's The Omnivore's Dilemma which permanently changed the way I now shop at grocery stores; and now I can say that I've had an equally great experience with my second Pollan book, his newest, the 600-page behemoth How to Change Your Mind, which looks at all the latest post-hippie, 21st-century, Western-medicine research into the links between psychedelic drugs, mental health, mindfulness and Buddhist-style meditation.To make my biases clear right away, back in my early twenties I did LSD in college a handful of times, mostly in a mindful and deliberate way (although admittedly a couple of times at raves for fun too), thus making it natural that I would be interested in what Pollan had to say; and he essentially takes this mindful, medicine-type approach too, presenting not just an exhaustive history of the subject as it first became known in the US in the 1920s and '30s, blooming into national mainstream popularity and then just as quickly burning out in the 1960s, but also concentrating just as much on the quiet, more sober research that's being done in our current age, where contemporary doctors and scientists are looking at the ways that LSD and psychedelic mushrooms might in fact be a ""magic cure"" of sorts for such mental conditions as depression, anxiety and addiction.It all boils down to a term that's suddenly been gaining a lot of mainstream traction recently, called the ""Default Mode Network;"" as we're learning with more and more certainty, this is the part of the brain that essentially acts as the ""CEO"" or ""orchestra leader"" of all the other parts of your brain, the section of the brain that's most active precisely when you're doing nothing particular at all, and the section that allows you to think about the past, to anticipate the future, to project a sense of ""self"" to yourself, and basically all the other activities that we've typically associated over the centuries with what is conveniently called the human ""soul."" Modern MRI research is showing us that, when someone is on psychedelic drugs, its main effect is to shut down the default mode network; that basically lets the other sections of your brain talk to each other in unexpected and random ways, which is what produces the ""hallucinations"" so commonly associated with the drug. And since it's the default mode network that directly causes mental disorders like depression (obsessive worrying about the past) and anxiety (obsessive worrying about the future), research is showing more and more that psychedelic drugs can act as essentially a way to ""reformat a corrupted hard drive,"" and to let people with unhealthy behaviors towards the past and future basically reset and permanently change their behaviors. And, incidentally, it turns out that this is the same exact process the brain goes through during mindfulness-based meditation, which is why it's no coincidence that Buddhism and psychedelic drugs are so closely associated with each other in our society, and why Buddhist-style meditation has been shown in recent years to work even better than anti-anxiety drugs on PTSD-suffering veteran soldiers.Pollan's book is about all kinds of other things too, including his own first-person forays into psychedelics and what exactly occurred to him during his ""trips;"" and as always, it's written in his engaging if not often opinionated conversational style, which I love but I learned during The Omnivore's Dilemma drives other people crazy, so be warned. An illuminating and fascinating book that will (here we go again) permanently change the way you think about psychedelic drugs, meditation, and mental illness, it is so far the one book in 2018 that I most recommend general audience members picking up. Destined to make my top-ten list at the end of the year, if not come in at the number-one spot altogether. "
30,0241294223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30901613-zoomball,1,"Tedious. Self-aggrandizing. I was drawn to the book by it's promise of ""the new science..."" If that is your interest, skip the first four chapters. Even then there is precious little content about this. ""How to Change Your Mind""?? I can not understand how this title relates to the content of this book which time and time again emphasizes the illegality of the drugs and the incredibly limited number of experimental clinical trials with all their [necessary] constraints. If you are interested in a painfully detailed history of the use of psychedelics (including descriptions of items of clothing worn by individuals who promoted them) and the monotonous recounting of one journalist's personal experience of the nature of consciousness as revealed by these drugs - well then, this books for you. It wasn't for me. "
31,0241294223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9628169-charles-j,3,"I have led a boring life, at least as measured by the topics covered by this book, Michael Pollan’s ""How to Change Your Mind."" Not only have I never taken any psychedelic drug of any type, I have never taken any illegal drug at all. Similarly, I have never had any type of mystical experience whatsoever, though I am certainly open to such a thing and have total confidence that many other people have. Just not me. But here, as in many matters, others go where I have not tread. Pollan, famous mostly for books on food, decided to explore drug-induced alterations of consciousness, and this book is the measured result of his spelunking in the caverns of the mind.I suppose that psychedelics might be interesting for me. Among other benefits, they are said to provide a lasting uptick in the personality characteristic “openness to experience,” in which I am very low indeed, according to test results. But I am a bone-deep paranoid, of whom long ago it was said that my core belief is “bad people are everywhere, and they must be put down.” Therefore, the chances that I would perceive ghostly enemies in my fever dreams, and then reach for my boot knife, seem to me far too high to risk taking any drug that alters perception of reality. So all this is abstract to me, and will remain so.As far as the book, this is, disappointingly to some, not a book about Pollan’s own experiences with drugs, although those do figure. Those expecting an updated version of Aldous Huxley’s florid ""The Doors of Perception"" will not find it. This is a book mostly about history and science, cut with ten percent description of the author’s closely controlled personal experiences with psychedelic drugs. In other words, Pollan is not an evangelist or proselytizer for drug use; his advice is thoughtful, rather than enthusiastic.The first two hundred pages are history. It should have been fewer, and could have been fewer, if Pollan had cut out the unbelievable number of references to the “moral panic” that we are told resulted in psychedelics being suppressed in the 1970s, largely a result of the clownish behavior of Timothy Leary. I am perfectly willing to believe that there was a somewhat unjustified overreaction, but the constant characterization of the suppression of psychedelics as only a panic, and therefore wholly irrational, are obviously wrong even on Pollan’s own account, and smack of an aging baby boomer’s moral preening. In any case, Pollan starts by talking about recent revived interest in using psychedelics, primarily psilocybin, derived from mushrooms, to treat conditions such as depression and anxiety among terminal cancer patients, as well as more mundane problems like nicotine addiction. Then we are taken backward, to the original 1943 synthesis of LSD and its use, and misuse, over subsequent decades, as well as the history of other psychedelics.The focus is on psychedelics as a class, not on the many varieties thereof, few of which are specifically delineated. Pollan mostly talks to various figures, ranging from scientists now carefully studying psychedelics in accordance with strict regulations, to elderly hippies and their younger disciples still flogging LSD as a miracle that will bring mankind together. Many of the latter are flakes, prone to what Pollan charitably calls “intellectual extravagance.” The scientists, on the other hand, are mostly hesitant to ascribe mystical powers to these drugs, including one who boldly goes way out on a limb, saying “I’m willing to hold the possibility these [mystical] experiences may or may not be true.” Along the way, we learn what psilocybin mushrooms look like, how they grow, and how to take them, which might be useful for some of us, especially since many mushrooms that look very similar permanently crash your liver.Finally, we get to what everyone really wants to read, which is Pollan’s own drug travelogue. He took, at separate times, three drugs: LSD, psilocybin, and something obscure named 5-MeO-DMT, or “the Toad,” extracted from, you guessed it, the venom of a Mexican toad. He details the run-up to each use in excruciating detail, and also narrates the actual experiences, which are pretty disappointing, both to the reader and, for the most part, to Pollan. He did not have any earthshattering mystical experiences, and the Toad was terrifying. He did have various experiences revolving around dissolution of the ego, the most common characteristic of all psychedelics, something that he, a mostly no-nonsense, goal-oriented person, found quite interesting and valuable. He saw and interacted with dead relatives. But all in all, this is pretty pedestrian, and most of what is interesting about drug trip descriptions in this book comes from quotes from people other than Pollan.Then, after fifty pages of travelogue, it’s back to another two hundred pages of the more boring stuff, in this case science, especially examinations of how precisely it is psychedelics work (answer: nobody knows anything very concrete, and from notes and parentheticals, it’s evident Pollan is exaggerating what little agreement there is), along with possible present-day applications of psychedelics to medicine. These actually seem quite promising, even if phrases like “it could be” and “isn’t entirely clear” keep cropping up. Certainly, if I suffered from untreatable depression, or someone close to me did, I would consider psychedelic therapies. And that’s it for the book. Frankly, it’s on the boring side.Still, we can pick out of this several interesting facts, or at least facts I found interesting. For one example, there is substantial evidence that young children’s minds have much in common with the mind of an adult on psychedelics. Adults develop useful mental shortcuts that cut out the sense of open-ended wonder, and the drugs seem to, in some instances, restore it, or a facsimile of it. (This reminds me of the classic science fiction story “Mimsy Were the Borogroves,” in which a brother and sister can see the real meaning of the Lewis Carroll nonsense poem “Jabberwocky,” and use it to vanish into thin air, watched by their father, “in a direction he could not understand.”) For another, the effects on any individual of any psychedelic drug are tremendously dependent on the setting in which the drug is taken, and even more on what the user expects to happen. Pollan notes that there is substantial debate about whether the popularity of Huxley’s book in fact created much of the experiences that users have since had, and whether if that book had not been written, those experiences might have been largely different. There is also a side-mention, not explored further, that Europeans have far fewer mystical experiences under the influence of psychedelics than do Americans, which seems like it would bear further exploring, but the topic never recurs.More broadly, all the discussion in the book offers an obvious question—what does the use of psychedelics, and what they appear reveal to the user, say about the nature of reality and of consciousness? Despite the desperate flailing of materialists like Steven Pinker, there is no evidence whatsoever that consciousness is the product of the brain, rather than an external phenomenon mediated by the brain, as Henri Bergson, among others, would have it. Of course, there is little evidence of the latter, either. We just don’t know. Pollan, certainly, is sympathetic to the idea that psychedelics reveal evidence for the latter, though he is very cautious in his approach. No doubt, listening to the stories of drug users, many of whom are utterly convinced of having had, in William James’s terms (from ""The Varieties of Religious Experience""), an ineffable, noetic experience, one feels the pull toward believing that psychedelics can provide direct evidence of, and direct access to, a wholly different realm.On the other hand, I think that one single fact, that neither Pollan nor anyone else that I know of discusses, strongly suggests that all psychedelic experiences are merely internal manifestations of the mind. This is that no new substantive knowledge is ever gained. If the individual consciousness were actually being exposed to, or subsumed into, or enfolded with, some universal or greater consciousness, some set of until-then unknown truths would seem certain to emerge. That could be anything—a scientific fact, the existence of aliens with specific verifiable facts about themselves, or merely exposure to another consciousness merging with yours (as exposed to the interactions with internally generated avatars of others that seem common, separately from the merging phenomenon, which Pollan himself experienced), or some kind of telepathy. But not once is such a thing ever mentioned, which strongly suggests that psychedelic experiences are purely internal, though I suppose they might be revealing underlying structural truths, even if they do not reveal identifiable higher level or new knowledge.The most interesting elements of the book, though, concern the intersection of religious belief and what is perceived under the influence of these drugs. It’s not just the drugs—even before he took LSD, Pollan’s “guide” had him do basic breathing exercises that put him in a hallucinatory trance, completely without drugs. (This is probably why the Orthodox, in repetitious prayer regimens, strongly caution against the untutored engaging simultaneously in the breathing exercises sometimes done by monks.) But there seems little doubt that many users experience effects that are the same as those identified as mystical religious experiences in William James’s classic book. The question is, what does that mean, or show?We have to clear out some underbrush first. Pollan, a genial atheist, seems completely unaware, no doubt because everyone who touched this book before publication was equally unaware, that many of the supposedly novel thoughts that come to him under the influence of psychedelics are commonplaces about reality in Christian theology. “I felt for the first time gratitude for the very fact of being, that there is anything whatsoever. Rather than being necessarily the case, this now seemed quite the miracle. . . . Everybody gives thanks for ‘being alive,” but who stops to offer thanks for the bare-bones gerund that comes before ‘alive’?” Every well-educated Christian, that’s who, and Pollan could do worse than reading David Bentley Hart on this topic, though any major Christian writer from the first century A.D. onward would do. Similarly, the idea of ego dissolution in an overwhelming and loving whole, which at the same time mystically maintains the individual’s ability to perceive, is nothing more than an attempt to describe the traditional Christian view of Heaven, best expressed in the Orthodox concept of theosis, though here lacking the presence of God, what Catholics call the Beatific Vision (the absence of which, again, suggests to a Christian that all this is purely internal to the drug user, though perhaps not less relevant for that). So, Pollan says of an atheist’s drug use, “Not only was the flood of love she experienced ineffably powerful, but it was unattributable to any individual or worldly cause, and so was purely gratuitous—a form of grace.” Any Christian would recognize this as an everyday description of Christian belief; the only things of interest are the direct experience, rather than its mere narration, and that the woman who experienced it described it as “being bathed in God’s love” and had lost her fear of death, yet insisted she was still an atheist, which seem highly unlikely, unless “atheist” is code for “my friends will think I’m weird if I say I believe in God.”This offers the second obvious question—does this imply that psychedelic drugs offer evidence of the truth of Christian belief, given how closely some of these visions align with core revealed truths found in Christianity? There may also be parallels with certain threads of Buddhism (about which I am ill-informed, hence my hesitation), although the retention of the individual’s viewpoint after the dissolution of ego runs counter to what I understand of “nirvana.” At the beginning of the book, Pollan notes that the original acid trip of the inventor of LSD, Albert Hofman, exhibited “neither the Eastern nor the Christian flavorings that would soon become conventions of the genre.” And then Pollan never returns to either “convention.” This was extremely disappointing to me. The only later mention of Christianity is the vision of a hard-core alcoholic mother, who admits she completely failed her children, being told by Jesus that she shouldn’t spend any time beating herself up, because nonjudgmentalism. That may be a Christian flavoring to the drug experience, but more likely, it’s what Oprah told the woman last time she was drunk, which was yesterday (the alcoholic, not Oprah, though maybe Oprah was drunk yesterday too). What I wanted to hear was if anyone under the influence of psychedelics ever had direct, specifically Christian revelation, such as regarding the Trinity, or Christ saying something not banal, or even an inkling of the Communion of Saints. I suspect not, or we would have heard of it. Which, again, suggests all this is internal, or at least it suggests that to a Christian.Regardless, none of this means it’s a good idea for Christians to take drugs. In fact, it’s almost certainly a very bad idea. Shortcuts generally mean trouble, and I am reminded of the words of Abraham to the rich man, pleading to return to Earth to warn his brothers of the wages of sin, “‘If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.” Moreover, there is no reason to suppose that only pleasant or truth-telling invisible realities would be revealed by a drug that could tear the veil of the world. Although Pollan does not mention it, one psychedelic, dimethyltryptamine, often gives the user the perception of contact with intelligences, so called “machine elves” or “chattering angels.” That sounds dangerous. No, on balance, these are things to be avoided.Still, that’s not to say that there’s no benefit in undercutting materialism by recognizing what psychedelics may be and do. Somewhere, Steven Pinker is rending his garments, wailing that the peasants shouldn’t be permitted to believe in a transcendent reality, because then they will be insufficiently enlightened, and will immediately go back to burning witches, led by priests who believe in vampires. To me, opening the possibility of a broader reality in this gray, de-magicked age is a feature, not a bug, regardless of whether there is any underlying reality to what drug users are shown under the influence."

Albert Hoffman, discoverer of LSD wrote those words in 1943. He had unintentionally absorbed some of the synthesized substance through his skin. When I read that description it reminded me of the “Stargate” sequence in Stanley Kubrick's film, 2001, a Space Odyssey, released in 1968. There is no direct evidence of a Kubrick-LSD connection. In fact, Kubrick denied he had ever taken LSD. However, Pollan cites a source claiming Kubrick, like many prominent Hollywood celebrities, underwent a regimen of LSD enhanced psychoanalysis in the 60's (Acid Dreams: The Complete Social History of LSD: The CIA, the Sixties, and Beyond, by Martin A. Lee and Bruce Schlain). Film maker and researcher Michael Benson states that Fred Ordway, a scientific consultant on Kubrick's film, contacted Dr. Walter Pahnke who conducted an LSD experiment known as the Good Friday Study under the direction of Timothy Leary. There is no evidence of any actual correspondence between the two (Space Odyssey; Stanley Kubrick, Arthur C. Clarke, and the Making of a Masterpiece). Was Kubrick being truthful about never taking LSD or was he distancing himself from a bit of baggage contradicting the artistic breakthrough he envisioned in this film? In any case, the contrast reflects the prodigious turn of events that transpired in a mere decade. In 1960 LSD was at the forefront of an edgy new frontier. By 1970 it was illegal.Pollan matches the experiences of researchers, meditation and spiritual pedagogues, and his own assisted triptamine experiments with these profound cultural shifts. He opens with a historical compendium, working both backwards and forwards from the year 2006. In that year the Supreme Court ruled against the government's attempt to block the União do Vegetal Church from importing the vines used for making hoasca, a hallucinogen. In the same year, Dr. Roland Griffiths, a neuroscience professor at Johns Hopkins, published a study of psilocybin's effects; it was praised for the scientific rigor of its design. Pollan traces a trajectory beginning with comparisons between psychedelic effects and those of mental illnesses like schizophrenia (the psychomimetic model). Further examination indicated that the psychedelic experience only superficially resembled mental illness. The model was replaced by interest in psychedelics applied to expediting conventional psychoanalysis (the psycholytic path). This research, however, was overshadowed by a single figure, Timothy Leary. Commenting on a December 1960 get-together between Allen Ginsburg and Leary, Pollan observes:  “...Leary gave psilocybin to the Beat poet Allen Ginsberg, a man who needed no chemical inducement to play the role of visionary prophet....'We're going to teach people to stop hating,' Ginsberg said, 'start a peace and love movement.' You can almost hear in his [Ginsburg's] words the 1960's being born, the still-damp, Day-glo chick crackling out of its shell.” (p.193) After Leary, there was a decades long hiatus. The Controlled Substances Act was passed in 1970. Funds dried up. Sandoz had already curtailed its distribution of LSD. And researchers came to be viewed either dismissively or with fear by the general public. Pollan is therefore surprised and encouraged by a renaissance in psychedelic research.Having read two of Pollan's previous books, I was disappointed by HOW TO CHANGE YOUR MIND. The names of dozens of researchers appear in the chapters on history. The most interesting section was Chapter 2: “Natural History; Bemushroomed.” Here, Pollan returns to his passion — botany. He meets Paul Stamets, an eccentric but dedicated mycologist who guides him on a field trip to collect psychedelic mushrooms. Stamets lives a comfortable life off the income of several patents, including a hybridized Cordyceps species of mushroom with the lurid property of causing fire ants to ingest them and explode their heads. The psychedelic compound of interest to Pollan is psilocybes. However, Pollan wonders why the substance is concentrated in the fruit and not the underground connective network known as mycelium, which would be the logical focus if the substance evolved to protect the organism. He hypothesizes that perhaps the substance encouraged the fungi's dissemination by appealing to a variety of animals, including humans. Referencing Terence McKenna's rather wacky “Stoned Ape” theory, he speculates:  “...what might have started as a biochemical accident has turned into an ingenious strategy for enlarging the species' range and number...it is the mushroom itself that helped form precisely the kind of mind — endowed with the tools of language and fired by imagination — that could best advance its interests. No wonder Paul Stamets is convinced of their intelligence.” (p.117)Pollan's chapter on neuroscience focuses on the concept of the “Default Mode Network” developed by Marcus Raichle. In brief, the theory supposes that the drugs erase familiar neural pathways forcing the creation of novel paths, provoking the synesthesia evidenced by many subjects' experiences. The basis for this thinking is studies of neuro-imaging patterns. By generalizing this broadly, Pollan is able to transition easily into his account of clinical applications in the areas of depression and addiction. Still, after 400+ pages of often prosaic writing, I was hoping for something more. Pollan concludes that his research has led him to an epiphany about his own life. I wish I could say the same about mine after spending the week on this book.NOTES:Interview where Kubrick denies ever having taken LSD. https://scrapsfromtheloft.com/2016/10..."

this is precisely where psychedelic therapy seems to be operating: on a frontier between spirituality and science that is as provocative as it is uncomfortable.
michael pollan is one of those authors who can, with ample research, elucidatory prowess, and a captivating writing style, make nearly any subject wholly fascinating and engaging. so it is with his new book, how to change your mind, wherein he explores the intriguing background of psychedelics (mostly lsd and psilocybin) and the great promise they show in treating a host of medical and psychological maladies. if the experience of transcendence is mediated by molecules that flow through both our brains and the natural world of plants and fungi, then perhaps nature is not as mute as science has told us, and ""spirit,"" however defined, exists out there—is immanent in nature, in other words, just as countless premodern cultures have believed. what to my (spiritually impoverished) mind seemed to constitute a good case for disenchantment of the world becomes in the minds of the more psychedelically experienced irrefutable proof of its fundamental enchantment. flesh of the gods, indeed.as in many of his books, pollan immerses himself first-hand within his chosen subject (in this case, ingesting the very substances he writes about). after a lengthy history on the origins of psychedelics, their recreational and therapeutic uses, and mid-century studies into their efficacy, how to change your mind also delves into the neuroscience of how these drugs work on and affect our brains. perhaps the most compelling chapter is ""travelogue: journeying underground,"" which recounts pollan's own psychedelic experimentation, as his insights, musings, and philosophical ponderings provide considerable food for thought (as he's forced to confront his own fears, hesitations, beliefs, and ego).
so perhaps spiritual experience is simply what happens in the space that opens up in the mind when ""all mean egotism vanishes."" wonders (and terrors) we're ordinarily defended against flow into our awareness; the far end of the sensory spectrum, which are normally invisible to us, our senses can suddenly admit. while the ego sleeps, the mind plays, proposing unexpected patterns of thought and new rays of relation. the gulf between self and world, that no-man's-land which in ordinary hours the ego so vigilantly patrols, closes down, allowing us to feel less separate and more connected, ""part and particle"" of some larger entity.
given pollan's reputation and popularity, how to change your mind will likely engender a much larger national conversation about psychedelics and their place in treating addiction, ptsd, depression, as well as in palliative care for end-of-life patients. psychedelics have had, in this country, a history fraught with political posturing, fear-mongering, and general apprehension, yet, as pollan makes abundantly clear in his book, the attitude towards these remarkable substances is softening (as more studies show their unparalleled promise), with a sea change perhaps just on the horizon. how to change your mind is an important, timely book, and pollan deftly charts the forefront of modern psychedelic research. *4.5 stars"

It's an area I know relatively well, and thought Pollan did a good grounded job of reviewing both the history and current science, though I found his style sometimes a little annoying. (Too positive? Too self-satisfied with life?).To put it another way: While I enjoyed reading the book, and it made me realize it's been way too long since I've taken magic mushrooms, I wouldn't want to do them with Michael Pollan. As harsh as that might sound.4-stars."

Hopefully it'll help reverse the stigma on psychedelic substances so they can be used by science to open new doors in our consciousness, something we really ought to do if we wish for a better world.

36,0241294223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4112781-erin,1,"Dude, we got it, you did ‘shrooms. You don’t need to write 400 pages about it. Loved his nutrition based books, but this one was a dud."
37,0241294223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38036772-annie,5,"This is such an important book. You should read it, even if (especially if) you think you aren’t into the idea.Let’s backtrack for a second. I love Michael Pollan. And I love psychedelic literature. And in fact, last year, I wrote a 20 page paper on the legal status of psychedelics, specifically with the emerging field of psychedelic therapy on my mind as I did so. I was so excited when this came out, I bought it right away. But a funny thing happens- and happens, and happens and happens- on the rare occasion I’m excited enough to buy a book. Because I own it, and don’t have to return it to the library in 2 weeks, somehow it always gets pushed to the backburner in favour of library books (which all have deadlines to return, naturally)- no matter HOW excited I am to read it.So although I’ve owned this book and have kept trying to find time to read it since May of last year, only now did I really get around to it. The first half was pretty dry and redundant. The history of the use of psychedelics is familiar to me and I’ve read essentially the same narrative in other books. The rest, however—both Pollan’s personal psychedelic journeys at the age of 60, and the tidy summary of the current exploration of the therapeutic uses—was perfect. Fascinating and tight.-------------------QUOTES--------------------Studies show that under controlled, scientific conditions, psilocybin can facilitate genuine mystical experiences, and in doing so, “offer hope of nothing less than a re-sacralization of the natural and social world, a spiritual revival that is our best defense against no only soullessness, but against religious fanaticism. And it does so in the very teeth of the unscientific prejudices built into our current drug laws.” “Hubbard handed [a patient in Vancouver] a bouquet of roses during an LSD session: he said, ‘Now hate them.’ They withered and the petals fell off, and I started to cry. Then he said, ‘Love them,’ and they came back brighter and even more spectacular than before. That meant a lot to me. I realized that you can make your relationships anything you want.”When encountering difficult feelings on a trip: “It’s like when you see a mountain lion. If you run, it will chase you. So you must stand your ground . . . and demand to know, ‘What are you doing in my mind? What do you have to teach me?”“Pscyhedelic experiences are notoriously hard to render in words; to try is necessarily to do violence to what has been seen and felt.”The insights of a philosophy professor on drugs boil down to, as he says, “Love conquers all.” He notes that he has been embarrassed by this, “as if they give voice to a cosmic vision of the triumph of love that one associates derisively with the platitudes of Hallmark cards.” This is the prevailing sense of drug takers quoted in the book: “I’ve heard that all my life, but never realized its full meaning until now.” The author notes, “The mystical journey seems to offer a graduate education in the obvious. Yet people come out of the experience understanding these platitudes in a new way; what was merely known is now felt, takes on the authority of a deeply rooted conviction. And, more often than not, that conviction concerns the supreme importance of love.”“During my session this art of relaxation itself became the basis of an immense revelation, as it suddenly appeared to me that something in the spirit of this relaxation, something in the achievement of a perfect, trusting and loving openness of spirit, is the very essence and purpose of life. Our task in life consists precisely in a form of letting go of fear and expectations, an attempt to purely give oneself to the impact of the present.” “Is a platitude so deeply felt still just a platitude? No, I decided. A platitude is precisely what is left of a truth after it has been drained of all emotion. To resaturate that dried husk with feeling is to see it again for what it is: the loveliest and most deeply rooted of truths, hidden in plain sight.” “If it were possible to temporarily experience another person’s mental state, my guess is that it would feel more like a psychedelic state than a ‘normal’ state, because of its massive disparity with whatever mental state is habitual with you.” “[One scientist] thinks that psychedelics render the brain’s usual handshake of perception less stable and more slippery. The tripping brain may ‘slip back and forth’ between imposing its priors [predictive assumptions based on context] and admitting the raw evidence of its senses.”A dying man on psilocybin: “Never had an orgasm of the soul before.” And then, two months later, said he was the happiest he had ever been in his life, and that he was “the luckiest man on earth.”I loved the idea that when brains on psilocybin are scanned and compared to regular brains, it shows that thousands of new connections form, “linking far-flung brain regions that during normal waking consciousness don’t exchange much information.” And the long-term changes in the personality trait of ‘openness to new experience’ raises the possibility that some kind of learning takes place while the brain is rewired.And don’t even get me started about the plant-in-a-cage thing towards the end, when Pollan is on ayahuasca. That provided really fun fodder for rumination."
38,0241294223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14941179-anna,4,"I must have read a review of ‘How To Change Your Mind’ that persuaded me to read it, as altered states of consciousness are interesting to read about. I really enjoyed The Doors of Perception. Rather uncharitably, I assumed at the start that Pollan’s enthusiasm for psychedelics was a form of midlife crisis. To my surprise, though, by the end of the book I could not only see the appeal in theory but could even imagine wanting to try them myself one day. This is no small thing, as I am extremely control freakish about my body and try to avoid taking even over the counter medicines in case of side effects. Pollan really does make the psychedelic experience sound convincingly meaningful and therapeutic. At one point he compares it with a shortcut to the effects of cognitive behavioural therapy, which seems magical. His trips rather resemble supercharged dreaming, and I certainly love vivid dreams.The book is broadly structured in three parts: the history of LSD and magic mushrooms in the West and how they went from promising medical treatment to criminalised, followed by Pollan’s personal accounts of his experiences taking several psychedelic drugs, then concluding with a summary of the resurgence in medical research using LSD and psilocybin. The first part could perhaps have been a little shorter, although it was as engagingly written as the rest of the book. Pollan’s accounts of his own trips are likewise compelling. The most interesting part from my perspective, however, was the latter third. This summarised recent research, including how the effects of psychedelics manifest in the brain as observed via MRI. Trials have demonstrated that psychedelics can be remarkably effective at alleviating depression and addiction, indeed more effective than traditional treatments. Pollan reflects on what this might mean for mental health more generally, which was a fascinating reminder of how the categories of mental illness are both arbitrary and exist as a result of treatments rather than vice versa. As well as throwing diagnostic categories into doubt, psychedelic treatments could bridge the divide between psychotherapy and psychiatry. An investigator on one of the trials summarises this neatly:""We’ve had this conflict between the biologically based treatments and psychodynamic treatments. They’re been fighting one another for legitimacy and resources. Is mental illness a disorder of chemistry, or is it a loss of meaning in one’s life? Psychedelic therapy is the wedding of those two approaches.”This is a transformative idea. Pollan briefly discusses some of the implications, such as a lack of profitability (one-off treatments rather than regular dosing, no patents), medicalising the mystical, and the difficulty of testing psychedelics in standard double-blind tests:The very strangeness of these molecules and their actions upon the mind is [...] testing whether Western medicine can deal with the implicit challenges they pose. To cite one obvious example, conventional drug trials of psychedelics are difficult if not impossible to blind: most participants can tell whether they’ve received psilocybin or a placebo, and so can their guides. Also, in testing these drugs, how can researchers hope to tease out the chemical’s effect from the critical influence of set and setting? Western science and modern drug testing depend on the ability to isolate a single variable, but it isn’t clear that the effects of a psychedelic drug can ever be isolated, whether from the context in which it is administered, the presence of the therapists involved, or the volunteer’s expectations. Any of these factors can muddy the waters of causality. [...] Add to this the fact that the kind of experience these drugs sponsor often goes under the heading of ‘spiritual,’ and you have, with psychedelic therapy, a very large pill for modern medicine to swallow.Given the impact of psychedelics in the 1960s and the backlash against them in the 70s, it’s also clear that there’s something subversive (indeed anti-capitalist!) in drugs that awaken empathy, openness, joy, spirituality, and linkage with nature. As well as treating mental illness, could LSD be the antidote to the neoliberal psychopath Homo Economicus? ...Is this just rediscovering ideas from my parents’ hippy generation? If so, maybe it’s worth giving them another try? Pollan’s evangelism is explained and evidenced so thoroughly as to be very thought-provoking. Drugs like LSD have been banned throughout my life and this book significantly altered my understanding of them (in combination with David Nutt’s Drugs Without the Hot Air: Minimizing the Harms of Legal and Illegal Drugs). Hopefully research will continue to discover what good psychedelics can do, for people just searching for a profound experience as well as the mentally ill.I also learned from this book that Dr. Paul Stamets on Star Trek Discovery is named after a real Paul Stamets, who is likewise an expert of mycelial networks. Albeit not the kind that are suitable for intergalactic travel, as far as I know."

But dang, this is such a fascinating book. I was pulled in by the discussions of dissolution of ego, of the nature of consciousness, of entropy, awe, spirituality, by the potential of psychedelics in mental health treatment and the position that they should also be used for the ""betterment of the well."" The best parts of the books are the sections on Pollan's own experiences with psychedelics and on psychedelics in treatment (though the history of research was also educational for me). Reading Pollan's descriptions of his trips made me realize that in my youth, I barely tasted the positive potential of these drugs. I had some trips in my youth, some that I still remember fondly, but I did not have transcendental experiences, I did not experience the dissolution of ego. The role of the guides in these more significant trips, as well as set and setting, its connection to shamanism, is really interesting. And kind of intriguing to this old broad. I have some quibbles with his writing (his descriptions of people's physical appearances annoys me, among other quibbles) and I think the epilogue drags. But this is good reading. "

The second chapter, the heart of the book for me, is an informative and interpretive history of psilocybin (the psychoactive compound in LBMs) and LSD (its synthetic twin). There are some surprising episodes from 1947 when it was marketed by Sandoz to 1966 when it became illegal. Research on these drugs, which had all but disappeared in 1966, was re-started with institutional support of the USDA and its European equivalent agency in 2016. Pollen introduces more unusual characters from the known: Timothy Leary; to the little known and the very cryptic: Al Hubbard. The author describes but disguises his (illegal) trips and their guides. He gives enough color to demonstrate “set and setting” which are considered critical to having a positive trip experience. There is layman-friendly explanation of relevant neuroscience. The material on the DMN: default mode network seems to say that the concept of “ego” might have an explanation in pure science. There are examples of how psilocybin can be used to treat addiction and depression. (There is no mention of Alzheimers, where the stimulating properties would seem to have promise.)At a recent conference on the drugs established and bookish types mixed easily with off the grid practitioners. That such a conference, which would be unthinkable 20 years ago, took place shows the growing acceptance of the drug and suggests a promising future. The down side might be that “big pharma” and mental health institutions may not welcome a drug with the potential to cure addiction or depression without ongoing billables. The author’s shows his command of the material. He has the ability to integrate science, culture and personal narrative to entertain as well as inform the reader.

Digging out from the countercultural baggage of the 60's, psychedelic research is showing remarkable efficacy in treating depressions, addiction and the existential anxiety of the terminally ill. But Pollan takes things a step further and recounts several of his own guided sessions, his first at age 60. These aren't recreational binges or microdosing sessions but heroic doses administered with the help of trained professionals. But Pollan himself notes how hard it is to share these experiences. How they tend to cliche and the outright banal. ""Love conquers all."" ""We are all one."" But at the same time, in the grip of a psychedelic episode, these take on profound import. Pollan brings the same level-headed reason that he applied to food in a Defense of Food to psychedelics, perhaps leaning a bit harder on the science given the controversial nature of his subject.

I've still never smoked anything, and I haven't ever drunk enough alcohol to develop a taste for it. But I think it would be cool to just jump straight to the magic mushrooms.Michael Pollan was much like me. He describes himself as something like a product not of the psychedelic sixties, but of the moral panic they provoked. He's a hyper-rational guy who writes books about facts, so a book about the virtues of psychedelic drugs seemed a bit off-brand to me. But the facts indeed speak for themselves. LSD, psilocybin, DMT, mescaline... they can have incredibly beneficial effects. One dose can help someone quit smoking. They can help people with terminal diagnoses lose their fear of dying. They can aid in the treatment of depression and anxiety, apparently much more effectively than traditional medicine.And they're not just useful to people with major problems. They can provide transformative experiences to the average Joe that—according to the data—will rank among the most important events in his life. They have the ability to temporarily disconnect the recipient from his ego, so that he can view things from a more cosmic perspective. You can dissolve into the universe, lose your sense of self; take your head out of your ass. Wouldn't that be nice?Of course, these things are not safe. Bad trips are a real thing, and psychedelics are particularly susceptible to suggestion, i.e. you can use them to cast demons out of you or Charles Manson can use them to inspire murder. Pollan doesn't advise anyone to go out and buy some illegal mushrooms and get to tripping. He does advocate for more research, and if you're determined to experiment, do it under the guidance of someone who is experienced with them—in a possible future, you may go to your therapist who can administer the drugs and guide you on your trip. There have been thousands of doses administered in a new round of studies of psychedelic drugs and there hasn't been a single case with adverse effects.Needless to say, this was an enlightening book for me. Pollan's picture of psychedelics do not at all align with my picture (mostly informed by my cousin's friends who all wore tie-dyed shirts with dancing bear logos and fake dreadlocks) and I'm happy to have it corrected. We'll see if I ever get the guts to try any of these drugs out."
49,0241294223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,4,"Pollan has a great writing style. The last book I read about microdosing, A Really Good Day by Ayelet Waldman, was really unsatisfying. The writing style was definitely not my cup of tea, and I felt as if the only way I might enjoy the book would have been if I were lucky enough to have microsdosed before reading it and have been looking for a good book on microdosing ever since. Pollan's book was a good antidote to Waldman's book. Pollan included an interesting history of psychedelics as he wrote about his own experience trying some of these drugs. The best parts of this book reminded me of Drugged by Richard Miller and made me love reading about humans and their quest to understand the effects of drugs. I would have given this 5 stars if not for a tiny section in the book where he kept writing about the perspective of ""science"" from scholars such as Timmothy Leary and others. He kept referencing psych experiments and saying that since Leary and others didn't like the results, they didn't like science. All too often, psych fits into the category of extremely soft science. The methods are often horrific. The findings based on self report and subjective interpretation. CBT often provides results that could be considered scientific, but most of the time, the field of psych is flying blind (and not blind in the good way, as in double blind trials). Pollan should know better than to lump all of science together like that. It's fine, and in fact preferable, to call out pseudoscience. Pollan did challenge Leary and others for not using the scientific method. He was also really good at conveying that what Leary and others were trying to get at might be, in their opinion, beyond the bounds of science. All of that was fine. It was just the way he talked about science in general, as an entity, showed at times his own lack of understanding about what science, in general, is. No scientist or science Journalist should write about science in that way. It gives the public an entirely incorrect idea about what science is.Beside that small issue, the book was one of the best I have read about psychedelics. I highly recommend. "

If you've ever read anything about LSD studies from the 70s, you can skip the first third of this book. It takes you from Huxley to Leary and Bill W... so, it is great background if you don't already have any, but it is a tiresome repeat for some.If you have any personal experience with psychedelics/entheogens/[insert chosen term here], you can skip the second third of this book. Pollan discusses his own experience with hallucinogens as well as the importance of set, setting, and finding the right guide. While Pollan's description of an entheogen-filled experience may be eye-opening for some, I personally find other people's tripping stories are rambling, incoherent ""you had to be there"" stories. I was bored by Huxley's LSD fascination with cloth, and I was bored when Pollan described urinating diamonds. But maybe that's just me.The final third of this book is the reason I picked it up in the first place. What effect do entheogens have on our brains? And how can that help us cope with depression, anxiety and existential distress experienced by some to a crippling degree?A worthwhile read but, unless you are totally new to the subject, pick and choose. Take what you can use and leave the rest."
51,0241294223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9573608-mason-neil,4,"I have been fascinated by psychedelics ever since I experienced psilocybin a few years ago and experienced an almost immediate loss of some negative habits that had been having a negative effect on my mental health. Michael Pollan's perspective was particularly attractive to me because I already have a lot of respect for him after reading In Defense of Food and The Omnivores Dilemma. His approach is skeptical and honest, and I found that he wrote with a candid tone that I hadn't heard in his other writing that I am familiar with. The book began with a formality that I found uncomfortable, but this stiffness was quickly lost as Pollan began recounting his own experiences. I think the overall shift in style of the writing reflected the difficulty that arises when writing about psychedelics—their effects are personal and resist logical explanation so well that bending a discussion of them into a scientific and rigid text would be almost impossible. The book delicately balanced an exploration of known scientific research with a legitimate discussion of mystical experiences, all without falling into a condescending or distrusting tone that would discount the experiences of others. This was a fantastic read and I am already planning on purchasing copies to give to some family members. "
52,0241294223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21194062-meghan-burke,5,"I'm quite fearful of almost all drugs, but if there is anyone who could help me understand this class of drug biologically, in historical and political context, and relative to other conversations ranging from the scientific to the spiritual, it's Michael Pollan. I loved so much about this book: It reminded me of the things I appreciated about The Botany of Desire (one of my all-time favorite books), the reasons I'm compelled (though currently not quite adequately trained) to teach medical sociology, what I am learning as I'm several years in to seriously studying and practicing Buddhism, and more. I'll likely still never try a psychedelic, but I have learned so much about what they do, and their potential. I'm grateful for this book, and as always, for Pollan's smart and accessible writing."
53,0241294223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11820811-camelia-rose,5,"When the voice of the author faded at last, The Beatles started singing All You Need is Love in my head.How to Change Your Mind: What the New Science of Psychedelics Teaches Us About Consciousness, Dying, Addiction, Depression, and Transcendence is a mix of history and science. There are three parts:Part one is the history of the first wave psychedelic era, which started from the discovery of LSD by Albert Hofmann in 1940s, continued into 1950s, epitomized in 1960s American counter-culture, and abruptly halted in 1968.It's fascinating history to read. Michael Pollan talks about the major figures of the era, such as Albert Hofmann, Timothy Leary, Ram Dass, Al Hubbard, Gordon Wasson, María Sabina, Aldous Huxley and Sidney Cohen. The author's tone is positive, but seems to blame Timothy Leary for the moral panic the drug triggered. Some might argue Timothy Leary did what he did because he was brain-damaged by the drug, but that depends on your definition of mental normality. The anecdotes in the book fit into what I know about the ""all you need is love"" counter-culture of 1960s America. For example, Allen Ginsberg, the famous poet, while high on LSD (given by Timothy Leary), wanted to arrange a meeting between the leaders of US, Soviet Union and China for world peace.Since the war on drugs, the use of psychedelic drugs have been greatly reduced but never terminated. A lot of users moved on. Some went underground. Some sought east, and directly influenced the New Age Movement that later flourished in California.Part two is Michael Pollan's own experience with psychedelic drugs. In order to writer this book, he went to several ""trips"", once at home by himself (and his wife), others offered by underground practitioners because these drugs are still illegal. I find the drug experiences from a ""functional normal"" interesting, not as frightening as I had expected, although it is still not enough to persuade me to try some soon. I like where he went ""mushroom hunting"" with the expert Paul Stamets. As a nature lover and science nerd, I will read more about mushrooms in the future.Part three is the new wave of psychedelic drug research, starting from 2006. This part is what I like most in the book. It covers several researches in US and Europe, where psilocybin (not LSD because of its heavy baggage from 1960s counter-culture) is used to treat anxiety in terminally ill cancer patients, alcohol addiction, nicotine addiction, and drug-resistant depression. The results are very promising. What I have learned from the book and some of my thinkings:1. The word ""psychedelic"" comes from Greek and it means ""mind manifestation"". It is considered by some chemists as hallucinogens (but it doesn't induce clinical hallucination?) . These drugs work through the brain's serotonin receptors, which is a different neuro pathway than the pathway used by drugs in opioid family. Perhaps this is why it is not addictive comparing to morphine and cocaine? Again, it depends on the definition of ""addictive"". If you like what you experience during the ""trip"", wouldn't you want or even crave go on it again?2. Human mind has strong suggestive power. Psychedelic drugs increase such power, which is why today's researchers name the therapy ""psychedelic drug assisted therapy"" rather than ""psychedelic therapy"". The setting and the interaction with the therapists, as well as patients' own expectation, are essential and they have dominate effect. No wonder some medical scientists call it ""applied mysticism"". A strong placebo affect is working behind the scene, but if it works, if it reduces suffering with very little (so far) side affect, why not? 3. Bad ""trips"" are usually induced by wrong settings in unguided sessions or with wrong/indifference guides/therapists. The world is not ready for casual, ""recreational"" use of psychedelic drugs--I do hope not. It can change your mind, after all, just as CIA tried in 1960s to use LSD to mentally destroy or bring embarrassment to their enemies. 4. The brain scan shows strong similarity between someone in meditation and someone on psilocybin. The mechanism behind psychedelic drugs is still unclear, but there are several plausible hypothesises. For example:-- Psychedelic drugs quiet down the brain's Default Mode Network, such as Posterior Cingulate Cortex, which is linked to our sense of self, the human ""ego"", therefore give rise to ""oneness"", ""unite with the universe/God/nature"", feeling of being given ""higher purpose"" etc...-- By damping the Default Mode Network, it works like a system reboot, and the brain is free (forced) to ""work harder to interpret information from fresh"". In combination with ""let go"" notion from the therapist and the patient's expectation, the sense of relief/rebirth can be achieved. -- It increases the brain's plasticity, which allows the brain to form new connections, hence breaks the addiction, anxiety, OCD or depression.5. Psychedelic drug assisted therapy is no panacea--it does not work on the other end of mental disorder spectrum, i.e. psychosis, such as schizophrenia, and perhaps (my guessing) bipolar disorder or psychopath. Some reading says that it may likely to cause schizophrenia.I have generally positive opinions about this book. The words ""transcendence"" and ""spiritual"" are used loosely and interchangeably. Their definition is unclear until the very end. Here, ""spiritual"" is rather abstract, without pointing to any specific religion or belief. Instead, it refers to an altered mental state where one feels somewhat united with a higher power or a higher purpose beyond the normal waking consciousness. The similar mental state can be reached by longterm meditation, or, through the shortcut offered by psychedelic drugs. The writer thinks the opposite of ""spiritual"" is not ""material"", but ""egoistic"".Here is what I don't like about this book: 1. The title is misleading. It sounds like a self-help book about how to use psychedelic drugs to change your mind.2. The distinction between social history and medical science is unclear, especially in the first part. There is too much poetic language when describing 1960s drug-infused culture. Is this intentional? Is the author biased? 3. Some words used in this book are cringe-worthy for a serious science book. He refers figures in the first wave psychedelic era ""elders"". It sounds too much like a cult."

Overall, this is probably the easiest book to recommend to anyone interested in a recent book on psychedelic science, covering lots of aspects from history, characters, and culture, to the up-to-date neuro and clinical research that is on track to bring psychedelic-assisted therapy into mainstream within a decade.Together with some personal experiences, it also reminds us that psychedelics may be used beneficially beyond their role in mental health treatments. Apart from possibly surpassing mere symptomatic treatment and instead helping tackle the root causes of many common and/or serious ailments, there are also pointers indicating psychedelics as a general tool for creativity, problem-solving, plasticity/(re)conditioning, and understanding (on a viscerally felt level) what the platitudes of meditators, environmentalists, and consciousness researchers actually mean or where they’re coming from.Unlike psychedelics themselves and despite its length, this book could even be said to have a good signal-to-noise ratio if you’ve never looked into this stuff before. Highly recommended for the human/cultural/subjective context; otherwise, you might enjoy reading the actual papers (esp. from the 2010s) or popular articles condensing their methods and findings, and/or checking some lectures or podcasts from professionals in the field—a quickly expanding field where lots of new hypotheses are waiting to be studied!(There’s next to nothing in this book about MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, though.

56,0241294223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1593844-sara,5,"Outsized affection for this book (audio, narrated by author) in all its glory: the science, history and research, the mystical and theoretical, anecdotes, the first person experience, the humor, endearing quirks and ineffability of rendering into words (though the earnest grappling is part of what I loved) the entire premise and journey. So much heart, smarts, honesty. I feel so much better about life, death, and my own personal battles with anxiety and depression simply from listening. So who’s eating mushrooms with me in a field?"
57,0241294223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/880021-david-sasaki,5,"I was reluctant to read Michael Pollan’s The Omnivore’s Dillema back in 2009. I equated it with foodies, which I equated with bourgeois snobbery. But after enough recommendations from dear friends whose opinions I value, I gave in and ended up writing a fawning, long-winded review from Buenos Aires, which included the line “few other books have given me so much reason to re-think my own beliefs, outlooks, and behaviors.”It’s true. To this day, The Omnivore’s Dillema has changed both what I eat and how I eat, and how I think about the inextricably linked co-evolution of humans and the species we depend on for nourishment. I then read The Botony of Desire and In Defense of Food and ... I’ll just say that am I glad that Pollan decided to write about something other than food.Of course, Pollan’s books were never just about food, which is what makes them so compelling. Peering through the kitchen window, he weaves together stories along the seams of history, biology, and pop culture. It all seems rather effortless and smooth to the reader, but surely requires years of research followed by aggressive editing and deletion.I’m such a fan of Pollan’s writing, in fact, that I’ve read a good deal about his approach. Unlike most writers of non-fiction, who aim to impress upon the readers the weight of their credentials, depth of experience, and strength of argument, Pollan introduces himself as a flawed but curious know-nothing, who is eager to take a journey with the reader to learn something new. There is no convincing, no condescension, just an invitation to explore and learn something new. In fact, well into his 60’s, Pollan admits to his readers that he had never tried psychedelics prior to this project, that he’s “less a child of the psychedelic 1960s than of the moral panic that psychedelics provoked.” I find it more satisfying to learn about something through the eyes of an intensely curious novice, I realized, than an expert with hardened views.How to Change Your Mind is as much about mindfulness and changing the mental habits that become so ingrained in adulthood as it is about psychedelics. In the prologue, as if he had just returned from a week-long meditation retreat, Pollan writes:Habits are undeniably useful tools, relieving us of the need to run a complex mental operation every time we’re confronted with a new task or situation. Yet, they also relieve us of the need to stay awake to the world: to attend, feel, think, and then act in a deliberate manner. (That is, from freedom rather than compulsion.) The efficiencies of the adult mind, useful as they are, blind us to the present moment. We’re constantly jumping ahead to the next thing. We approach experience much as an artificial intelligence program does, with our brains continually translating the data of the present into the terms of the past, reaching back in time for the relevant experience, and then using that to make its best guess as to how to predict and navigate the future.This is not a novel observation. Back in the 70s, even while psychedelics provoked moral panic, corporate California was already reading about Zen Buddhism, popularized largely by Shunryu Suzuki’s book Zen Mind, Beginner’s Mind.Pollan approaches the topic from a novel perspective -- through the medical and recreational use of psychedelics to show us the path to beginner’s mind through intense experiences that dissolve the obsessive, analyzing ego and leave us with nothing but observation and appreciation for what is around us. “Less doing, more being,” as he describes it.Psychedelics seem to be especially helpful for a certain type of person: ruminative, introspective, analytical — someone like me. “The achievement of an individual self,” Pollan writes, “a being with a unique past and a trajectory into the future, is one of the glories of human evolution, but it is not without its drawbacks and potential disorders.” The price of a sense of self with the ability to shape an individual identity is also a sense of separation from others and nature. Self-reflection can lead to great intellectual and artistic achievement but also to destructive forms of self-regard and unhappiness.Those of us who spend a great deal of time in our heads — analyzing, reflecting, problem-solving, imagining forms of creative expression — can easily become blind to the beauty that surrounds us. Not just the natural beauty of a sunset, but the significance of our friends, a potential conversation with a neighbor, the taste of a delicious meal. We need to get outside of our analytical heads, tune into our senses, and just observe without judgement. As the novelist Andrew Martin put it:I’m all for interrogating the shit out of everything. But I’d like to be able to experience art in an open, unmediated way, to be really moved by something even if it’s out of fashion or challenging to some of my own values.You can substitute the word ""art"" with just about any other noun. Psychedelics are one powerful way to get us out of our own heads. They offer an intense, often transformative, experience that reveals what life could be like if we were to turn off our obsessive, analytical minds, extinguish our insecurities and aspirations, and simply be. Also, unlike coffee, cigarettes and alcohol, there is no evidence that psychedelics are addictive. But the effect does seem to eventually wear off and we return to our usual mental habits driven by deep seated insecurities and anxieties that we barely register or understand.Still, although not a one-time cure-all, the psychedelic experience provides us with a North Star that we can return to when we’re at our most anxious and depressed. Why am I obsessing over these recurring thoughts rather than enjoying all the amazing experiences all around me? What would this same, boring, uncomfortable group dinner be like if I were on magic mushrooms? How much can we change about our lives simply by changing perspective? Quite a bit, psychedelics tell us.One of the great benefits of reaching the stage of life where I currently find myself — let’s call it close to 40 — is that I have developed useful template responses for most situations. I can kinda coast comfortably on auto-pilot. As Pollan puts it:Certainly by middle age, the sway of habitual thinking over the operations of the mind is nearly absolute. By now, I can count on past experience to propose quick and usually serviceable answers to just about any question reality poses, whether it’s about how to soothe a child or mollify a spouse, repair a sentence, accept a compliment, answer the next question, or make sense of whatever’s happening in the world. With experience and time, it gets easier to cut to the chase and leap to conclusions—clichés that imply a kind of agility but that in fact may signify precisely the opposite: a petrifaction of thought.I think that’s why I sense more of an interest in psychedelics these days from folks in their 40s than young people in their 20s. I appreciate my learned ability to easily deal with many situations today that would have caused me anxiety and akwardness in my 20s. But I’m also wary of becoming an adult automaton based on prior experiences and assumptions that likely need to be revisited. In short, I don’t want to be set in my ways.A day after finishing the book, I was walking through San Francisco with my wife when we passed a young homeless man muttering to himself, not an uncommon occurrence in this city. Like so many others, I feel helpless and horrible when simply walking by a fellow resident so obviously in need of help. Homelessness is the most visible symptom of the American mental health crisis, but the increase in suicide is more telling. ""There are almost forty-three thousand suicides every year in America (more than the number of deaths from either breast cancer or auto accidents),"" Pollan writes, ""yet only about half of the people who take their lives have ever received mental health treatment."" I still hear a longstanding assumption that the mental health problems of most homeless San Franciscans are caused by alcohol and drug abuse. But after reading How to Change Your Mind, it struck me that the causality is likely the other way around. What if these individuals have especially analytical, ruminative minds? What if drugs and alcohol are the only reprieve to turn off the otherwise insistent inner-monologue?My only disappointment with the book is that Pollan didn’t attempt a 10-day silent meditation retreat as a comparison with his experimentation with mushrooms, acid, and DMT. Toward the end of the book he says he tries to keep up a daily meditation practice of 15 or 30 minutes, but in my experience such a daily practice is closer to taking a nap than the dissolution of the ego of the self that comes with the rigor of more than a week of constant meditation.The East Coast media — especially the New York Times — still like to poke fun at meditation and psychedelics, which they group with worst kinds of gemstone West Coast quackery. Ironically, it’s the kind of highly analytical and critical folks who work at East Coast media institutions that are most in need of a psychedelic experience. Michael Pollan is the rare individual — a credentialed professor who writes for the New Yorker — who can write earnestly for both coasts. No wonder How to Change Your Mind has been on the New York Times’ bestseller list for weeks now. Highly recommended."
58,0241294223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/974210-erik-graff,4,"Although I'd never read Pollan, I'd heard a lot about him, mostly from NPR. What I'd heard had been positive so when a friend offered to loan this book to me I was gratified.I was introduced to psychedelics by the mainstream media in the sixties. Articles in Time and Life magazines were often positive and intriguing. Thus, in my sophomore year, I did a presentation for Mr. Martello's public speaking course on LSD, having prepared for it by reading everything I could find on the subject in the library at Maine South H.S. Two years passed before I ever tried the stuff, two years of further exposure through the media and the testimony of friends. My first experience at the end of senior year was pretty unremarkable: enhanced sense perception, noticing patterns, wavy lines--evidence of a very mild dose. The second time, just weeks later, was an entirely different story: full-blown hallucinations, the revelation of a cosmic soteriological quest in which I and others were engaged. The quest was the reality behind the veil of the quotidian. I had, tripping, finally awakened.I was, to say the least, very intrigued and went on to try other psychedelics: mushrooms, cacti and their synthesized active ingredients. Then, about a year after the aforementioned impressive trip I had my heaviest experience, it being a complete separation from this consensual reality into another, profoundly meaningful dimension, a trip which apparently lasted most of a night and involved my only encounter with a non-human, but humanoid, intelligence as well as the oft-noted 'white light' experience. It was like stepping, wide awake, eyes open, into a exceptionally coherent dream. Now, having moved on, I can also compare it to a DMT event, one that lasts for six or more hours.Pollan approaches this class of psychoactive drugs as a late middle aged adult and, so, from the perspective of the last few decades and not from that of the sixties. He treats not only of his own experiences, but of those representing contemporary therapeutic applications. He nests this in a history of psychedelics, decrying the clampdown of the seventies and extolling the reopening of research in the late nineties. He attempts to represent current theorizing about how these 'medicines' work, both physically and psychologically. Overall, he does a fair job.The only fault with this book might be some credulity on the part of the author. Yes, it's true that, given appropriate sets and settings, psychedelics have led, both now and way back in the fifties, to remarkable therapeutic results (80% success rates in 'curing' addictions like alcoholism), but so do most 'new' drugs and therapies. And, indeed, Pollan is aware of placebo and novelty effects as well as of the powers of suggestion (witness the success rates of hypnosis with 'suitable' subjects). What I'd like to see is more information about longitudinal studies spanning years and comparisons between more and less novel therapies. It seems, much as I'd like to think otherwise, too good to be true.Still, given the political history of psychedelics, it's refreshing to read such a positive reappraisal. Although most of the history was old hat to me and some of it oversimplified (mushroom use, for instance, goes back into the mists of antiquity; Wasson's 'discovery' was a very narrow one), the review of current research, research since the University of New Mexico's sponsored study of DMT, and theorizing was informative. Certainly, as a readable introduction to the field, this book is to be recommended."
59,0241294223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8762584-jolene,5,"When I was nineteen, I wanted to try psychedelics because The Doors were cool and Aldous Huxley was cool and Ken Kesey was cool and the counterculture was cool. But I didn't because I was also slightly concerned that I would go insane.Over a decade later, and 64-year-old, decidedly uncool Michael Pollan is telling me that, actually, there is a lot of science that shows that psychedelics--specifically, but not limited to, psilocybin--can be a healthy, effective means to heal depression, addiction, and anxiety.The more you know. 🤷As always, Will's review is more thoughtful and comprehensive than mine. Go read it. And then go read this book. (I seriously would have bought it for most people in my life had I not finished my holiday shopping before finishing this book. I guess there's always next year.)"
60,0241294223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25537068-richard-wu,4,"I believe this is my second Pollan book, the first being, if memory serves, The Omnivore's Dilemma, which I must've read while undergoing in high school what one might call a ""nutritional awakening."" I remember that book being positively soporific, of no consequence to my dietary habits, and, as I now know to expect of NYT bestsellers, forgettable. This one's better. Here's the ending:
But this I can say with certainty: the mind is vaster, and the world ever so much more alive, than I knew when I began.
That was a litmus test, by the way; how intrigued you felt on reading it will, in proportion, dictate its truth for your reading of the whole. Personally, my mind was not changed with regards to any claim made herein, nor was my world livened. Which is OK, because it delivered exactly what I'd expected: a thorough history of American psychedelic culture and its major figures, a state-of-the-scene-and-science gloss, and a few trip reports (kudos to Pollan for putting his skin in the game) which convey approximately zilch of the substances' phenomenal texture—not, mind you, because one has to ingest them to grok it, but because he lacks—insofar as what is considered ""showing"" in sober, journalistic prose amounts, on higher-dimensional experiential planes, to ""telling""—sufficient grasp of language's formal properties. Not his fault for tailoring to the TED crowd (or being tapped—by whom? why now?—to evangelize our country's glut of so-sold ""educated, skeptical critical thinkers"" entheogens), though. How to Change Your Mind is strongest when in detective mode. Pollan is meticulous. His reputation grants him access not just to leading researchers but also their subjects, who provide colorful, earnest testimony of their trips and subsequent effects. He faithfully regurgitates soundbites from neuroscientists, philosophers, and psychotherapists, weaving them in with paraphrased summaries as context demands. He chases leftover mythical debts from the 60s, as if to assign them their proper and factual weight in history's accounting. Those reading to be informed will not be disappointed. It is weakest when editorializing. William James, one of my favorites, is cited multiple times with an understanding analogous to that of a New Age crystal cruncher abusing relativity metaphors to further cement unexamined epistemics. More damningly, several interviewees with deep subject matter expertise in, for instance, physics and metaphysics specifically (and heroically) attempt to dissuade Pollan of the thoroughgoing dogmatic materialism through which he subsumes all forms of evidence (in fact that he at all produced this gargantuan work without, after consuming multiple psychedelics, detethering from its original intentions should itself allay purports about their insanitizing aftereffects), proving once again the truth of Murray Gell-Mann's old barb contra journalists and their profession. Naturally one should beware empirical statements coming from someone who, for all his science worship, ""earned a D in high school chemistry."" Case in point:Of course, this re-contextualization of an old habit doesn’t just happen; countless people have taken psilocybin and continued to smoke. If it does happen, it’s because breaking the habit is the avowed intention of the session, strongly reinforced by the therapist in the preparatory meetings and the integration afterward. (Emphasis mine)Fatally ironic—for the instance sets precedent for all claims of kin—is Pollan's confidence in a causal mechanism for which the study in question was not testing, had no control, and did not posit. On the whole, I do submit the relation is plausible—but plausible is a long way from factual, and Pollan's presentation here betrays his trigger-happiness for conclusions he has no need of formal standards to endorse (I suspect no quantity of Psilocybes—effective as they may be for PTSD, depression, death anxiety, opioid addiction and suchlike ailments—can cure him of his scientism).On the prose level, as other reviewers have noted, a dearth of humor pervades. I forgive it this because psychedelics, by virtue of their past, are a touchy topic, and as such a serious, levelheaded sobriety may accelerate their mainstream resurrection. Less so is Pollan's overreliance on terms like ""scrim,"" ""abeyance,"" and ""italicize,"" which, like a maraschino cherry, are clever once but saccharine thrice. Minor quibbles, of course; but even the smallest itch can catalyze a bad trip. Speaking of, let's segue into the one thing I have changed my mind about:
Psychedelic experiences are notoriously hard to render in words; to try is necessarily to do violence to what has been seen and felt…
If one considers the experience of living to be triplike (""life is but a dream""), or even if not, to write at all is in a way already to sublimate the material and/or phenomenal into the Platonic and/or metaphysical; an abstraction, and thus a reduction, but also, one may propose, a purification or distillation of essence. To eff the ineffable, then, is precisely the miracle of language and literary art, so let the poets do violence, I say, and wring beauty pro tanto; for it is no wonder small or large that theirs are the words in which the psychonaut most readily finds recourse."
61,0241294223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/94056-kate,4,"I confess I'm a bit of a fan of Michael Pollan. I've read much of his writing on food, and I generally find his journalistic style approachable and informative without being overly dry. I was a bit surprised to learn that he had stepped outside his usual beat to write about psychedelics. And yet, now that I've read the book, the two topics -- food and psychedelics -- seem like two peas in a pod (no pun intended). Pollan draws on much of his knowledge and experience with plants to illustrate how plant-based chemicals act on the mind and have influenced history and culture, not unlike the way food itself influences the functioning of the body and has left a significant impact on society in general. One of the things I like about Pollan's work is that he is able to take a multi-faceted look at a topic, melding history, science, and personal memoir all into one cohesive narrative. I think he mostly succeeds at that with this book, although I felt the first half of the book was a slightly different book than the second half. The first half tells a straightforward story of the origin of renewed interest in psychedelics, followed by a traditional history of the origins of psychedelic drugs themselves, their initial embrace, and subsequent cultural backlash. The second half, however, gives us a glimpse into Pollan's personal experiences with these substances in a memoir format, and then is followed by interviews with researchers who are finding new (or renewed) uses for these drugs as treatments for mental disorders and existential suffering. Although the narrative jumps around in this way, I appreciate Pollan's attempt to tell the story of psychedelics from all these different angles, since it gives the reader a more complete understanding of what is and what has been going on, both above ground and below. I also like that Pollan inserted himself into the story since it gives the reader a chance to experience something that most people tend to describe simply as ""inexplicable."" As usual, Pollan's voice as a respected journalist lends a deeper credibility to his subject, which is certainly a characteristic that opens him up to criticism by those who have tackled the same subject before with less fanfare. But the remarkable evidence in support of expanding the use of these substances for the treatment of mental illness and for improving the lives of many may well justify the need for the straight white male treatment. I'm also keen to read Ayelet Waldman's recent memoir on the same topic and compare.My takeaway from the book is that psychedelics may be our best hope in the treatment of mental illness since the decline in the effectiveness of SSRIs but is certainly not a panacea and probably shouldn't be added to the drinking water supply any time soon. The importance of ""set"" and ""setting"" are key to having an experience that is therapeutic rather than just weird or scary, which explains why double-blind trials that seek to isolate the drug as the sole variable show less success than those in which the drug is administered as part of a holistic ritual experience. It's exciting and a bit, dare I say, disruptive, to consider that these substances may force medicine to re-embrace the mystical along with the pharmacological, finally reuniting mind and body.My other big takeaway was the realization of the profound influence psychedelics had on the cultural revolution of the 1960s. Of course the loopy fonts and groovy colors of that era evoked pyschedelics, but more than that these drugs actually influenced the mindset of the young people who took them, which invited the kind of break with authority that actually occurred on a massive scale. The cultural changes cannot be entirely blamed on psychedelics -- Nixon and Vietnam certainly helped matters -- but the ego-dissolving experiences these drugs gave young people certainly helped to open their minds to a whole new world of possibilities in politics, race, gender, and sexual relations, among other things.I really liked one passage where one of the interviewees commented that psychedelics are wasted on the young, because those of us who really need our minds expanded are those of us who have worn deep grooves into our brains following many years of repeat patterns and experiences. Our brains naturally tend to cut cogitative corners by using the same mental processes over and over again rather than seeking more complex and creative solutions. Unlike infants and young children who are basically on naturally-occurring acid trips all the time, the adult brain is very set in its ways, and often in ways that are not very helpful or joyful. Psychedelics can undermine the neuroticism of the experienced mind by smoothing over these groves and helping the mind to make new connections. It was helpful to me personally to view my own neuroticism in these terms, as the mere normal functioning of my brain, but also as a function that is capable of disruption through meditation, and maybe even (eventually, someday, if it becomes legal) through the assistance of a psychedelic."
62,0241294223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76740103-jed,4,I was surprised by how much I liked this book. It taught me all about a subject that I knew nothing about. It also convinced me that there are many positive uses for psilocybin and other drugs as a much better alternative to the garbage doctors are prescribing nowadays for mental illness. 
63,0241294223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/112265-katie,5,"In this book, Michael Pollan covers the history and science of psychedelics. The book is divided into five main sections which cover several aspects of psychedelic drugs: natural history, cultural history, Pollan's personal experiences, neuroscience, and uses in psychotherapy. Pollan meets with all sorts of experts in the field and his writing style and journalistic style is engaging, conversational, and easy to read. I didn't realize that in the 50s and early 60s there were a lot of promising clinical trials using LSD to treat alcoholism and some mental health issues. When the drug became associated with the youth counterculture, LSD was made illegal and for the most part these studies stopped. Recently, a number of studies using LSD and psilocybin (the active compound in mushrooms) have gained FDA approval. While the studies are still in early phases, many seem to be showing remarkable results in treating things such depression in cancer patients and addiction. So much of this book was fascinating, but I was especially fascinated by the way people (including Pollan himself) described their experiences using psychedelics, and how this translates to what is actually happening neurologically in the brain. Our brains are incredibly complex organisms, trained over years of experience to filter through an overwhelming amount of stimuli to process what is important and create the neural pathways that enable us to function on a day to day basis. The brain favors the familiar and doesn't always allow information in the doesn't conform to what is expected. Psychedelics break down these repetitive neurological patterns and parts of the brain that don't normally communicate with each other begin to do so. This allows people to get outside traditional ingrained thought patterns and see themselves and the world in an entirely different way. My understanding of neuroscience is shaky at best, so I don't fully understand it, but it is fascinating stuff. People who use psychedelics often describe a feeling of oneness with the universe and a certain loss of ego. It all sounds overly spiritual and new agey, so I appreciated the way Pollan himself, as an atheist and skeptic, approached his own trips, sometime almost seeming to roll his eyes at the ideas of ego dissolution, interconnectedness and the banality and triteness of the ""all you need is love"" cliche. He admits he has trouble finding the words to describe his profound experiences, so all he has are these platitudes. The environment in which psychedelics are administered is especially important. People use the phrase ""set and setting"" to describe this. The ""set"" refers to the mindset the person brings to their experience, and ""setting"" refers to the physical environment in which the experience occurs. Psychedelics used recreationally may not always have profound and lasting affects, but when professionals are trained in psychedelic assisted therapy to create proper set and setting the chances seem to increase remarkably. It is interesting that despite the fact that many psychedelics have no toxicity or addictive properties, they still have no accepted medicinal use. Opiates, on the other hand, with known addictive and toxic properties, retain their status. Some would argue that because psychedelics cause people to challenge the status quo and ideas of materialism and hierarchy, the powers that be have a vested interest in suppressing their use. Also, the patent on LSD has expired and psilocybin is a naturally occurring substance, so there is really nothing in it for big pharma.I think that one of the biggest things I took from this book is that when people are able to get outside of themselves and their own egos and thought patterns and realize there is a world beyond the self, mental health improves. Studies have shown that this can happen through various means including meditation, spending time in nature, and traditional talk therapy. Psychedelics are a pharmacological approach to achieving the same end goal. I got a little bogged down in the section of the book about the history of psychedelics, but other than that I was always excited to pick up the book. If you don't feel like reading this book, I would recommend at least reading or listening to an interview with Pollan about the book. Fascinating stuff. And I've finally learned to spell psychedelic!   "
64,0241294223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2068331-bee,5,"This book was excellent. Exactly what i needed.It got a bit boring in the middle, history is history, and can get bogged down in names and dates and details. This one did better than most, but still got a bit slow near the middle. But it was absolutely worth it. The ending made up for all slogging through boring bits. I've had numerous insights and realisations during this read, a lot of my own experiences were put into perspective. And has helped me help others too. Too much to put into words here. Maybe later.But if you're interested in Psychedelics research and Psychedelics therapy. Read this book"
65,0241294223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5899702-sally-boyer,5,"My video review can be seen here: https://youtu.be/6k3MP9M0vvsWant to cure yourself of depression, anxiety, addiction, neurosis, or any other mental disorder that typically afflicts the average contemporary human? Dissolve your ego, temporarily. You can do this via meditation, which requires lots of time, and serious dedication, or you can do it the quick and dirty way; hallucinogens. While the book is lengthier than need be, it’s mostly a fun and engaging read, filled with history, neuroscience, and personal anecdotes. What it boils down to is this: hallucinogenic substances temporarily free your mind from an overly rigid filtering system that has caused your brain to go on an often harmful auto-pilot. “When the grooves of self-reflective thinking deepen and harden, the ego becomes overbearing.” (P313) In other words, when the Default Mode Network (our adult computer brain that interprets reality in a repetitive and closed off fashion) becomes excessively ordered and controlling, our emotional health starts to suffer.Depression and anxiety are serious health problems that all of us have been touched by (either we have suffered or a loved one or friend), but as a society it’s still taboo to talk about it openly. This is irresponsible and our lack of open communication about depression and anxiety as a common human experience in our modern world is contributing to unnecessary deaths every day:“There are almost 43,000 suicides every year in America (more than the number of deaths from either breast cancer or auto accidents), yet only about half of the people who take their lives have ever received mental health treatment.” (335) The problem with the treatment, however, is that it doesn’t work so well. The psychiatric drugs are just bandaids, at best.Prior to Timothy Leary apparently really messing it up for all the researchers investigating how psychedelics might loosen the grip of depression, anxiety, and addiction on our rigid Default Mode Network with its established self-abusive patterns, there was no social stigma about hallucinogens. But when they hit the mainstream and they were being taken recreationally rather than for mental health, politicians flipped out and researchers lost funding. The good news is that, the research on psychedelics as a cure for depression and other mental disorders is once again gaining respect, and funding, and the most recent studies have produced some promising results. Now, why would the “powers that be” not want this to succeed? Why wouldn’t they want us to be healed of our mental diseases? Pharmaceutical companies probably wouldn’t be so happy. Using a psychedelic to treat depression might be a 1-4 times per year treatment. Depression meds, however, are a daily dose. So, the answer might be greed. Times in the past when psychedelics were demonized include President Nixon in the 1970’s who was afraid that “psychedelics were nourishing the counterculture, and the counterculture was sapping the willingness of America’s young to fight.” (58) The Spaniards in Mexico, upon arrival to the New World, felt threatened by the mystical experience that the native Mexican people could create for themselves with their plants, making it difficult to convince them of the superior power of Christianity. (59)As usual, control and authority has a lot to do with this issue. Mental health is taboo and the pharmaceutical companies have taken advantage of it by glossing the problem over with a money-making series of pills. Psychedelics are safer than alcohol, yet because they can cause people to “think outside of the (depression) box,” we’ve made them illegal. Good job society (sarcasm). Despite it being illegal, there are people who are trained to help guide you through a psychedelic experience. I don’t know where they are or how to find them, but they are out there. I encourage you to open your mind."
66,0241294223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7167006-m-l-rio,4,"Pollan does a remarkable job articulating the ineffable, unpacks without prejudice the complicated history of a complicated subject, and wisely lets the reader draw their own conclusions."
67,0241294223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1500718-ryan,5,"Is it harder to give in to the urge to take on a new subject at the end of one's career or is it harder to ignore it? Our careers sometimes lead from way to way and it seems ridiculous to just swerve onto a new path entirely. And yet, people often do it. In How to Change Your Mind, Michael Pollan, who has mostly made his name writing about food, decides to spend the credibility he has accrued on ""the new science of psychedelics."" Why not?The shift pays off. As he did in The Omnivore's Dilemma, he is going to labs and to the field and meeting scientists and enthusiasts who have, it turns out, a lot of knowledge to share with the general public. Pollan's cast here--which includes psychologists, psychedelic enthusiasts, and mycologists (the last appears to have inspired the creators of Star Trek Discovery)--is fun, interesting, and sometimes notorious.If you want to make the case for being open to new experiences, one of the five OCEAN personality markers, this book is for you. Pollan advocates for greater exploration of psychedelics by ""healthy normals,"" though this call to action is primarily aimed middle aged folk. And Pollan's willingness to go into the forest, to document what he observes while tripping, and to square his conclusions with research makes for excellent reading. Drug use aside, if someone asked me for a model for thinking or for education, Michael Pollan would be one of my first recommendations. I worry about the reader who looks at this book and dismisses it because it ""encourages drug use.""If you want to make the case against being open to new experiences, this book might also be for you. Bad trips sound awful. Reports of prominent 60s counter-cultural figures, while amusing, often are also deflating. Ginsberg is tripping when he decides to call world leaders from America, China, and Russia to help them work together. He also wants to go out, naked in the middle of a winter night, to preach the benefits of psychedelics. How deeply should we consider his thoughts in that moment?Whether or not we should be open to tripping is separate from whether or not others should be prohibited from tripping. The final chapters detail how psychedelic trips help to beat addiction, help to ease anxiety in the face of death, and help to ease anxiety / depression in the face of life. I'm also skeptical that ""healthy normals"" should be prohibited from pursuing these experiences, though I'd certainly agree that people should be clearly warned about how to pursue them. Pollan emphasizes the need for guides, set and setting.How readily should we swerve onto a new path as we reach and pass middle age? Pollan offers three ""travelogues"" of trips he takes (technically, there are two others). To be perfectly honest, if anyone else had written these accounts, I would have probably dismissed them. At the end of the day, How to Change Your Mind is fascinating, I expect to think about it for years to come, and it often works because Pollan built a successful career and strong reputation writing about cooking, nutrition, agriculture, gardening, and architecture. And then he successfully took on a new subject."
68,0241294223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2759420-jake,4,"Michael Pollan normally writes about food, a subject that bored me to tears until I read his books, so a book about psychedelics is a departure. (And you know a book will be good when there is a legal disclaimer at the beginning warning that the subject described is of a highly illegal nature and the publisher would like the United States Government to know that they would never, never, never advocate breaking the law). The book is about the resurgence of professional, above board psychedelic research but Pollan has to start with the history. A decade prior to the hippies discovering these chemicals (or was it these chemicals making the hippies?) researchers took psychedelics seriously. They were given to the movers and shakers of the world. Carey Grant and RFK's wife were treated with them and one of the founders of Alcoholics Anonymous proposed using them in their program. Then came the stranger than fiction story of the CIA setting up the infamous MK Ultra mind control program, which backfired spectacularly. They gave it to Ken Kesey and Tim Leary at Stanford and Harvard and created a monster. These dudes were so enthusiastic that they thought everyone should have them and there would be no more war, etc, etc, and here come the hippies and the dudes in suits panicked and made it highly illegal and Tim Leary had to escape from jail twice and hide out in Africa with Black Panthers, etc, etc, and eventually he died and had his head cryogenically frozen. Well, that last part wasn't in this book, but it really happened... So, the more serious research had to stop until fairly recently. The new science has used brain scans to see that there are actually reasons to believe that psychedelics have a beneficial effect on the mindset of those with terminal illness, depression, anxiety and addiction. They inhibit a part of the brain associated with the ego, and allow disconnected brain functions to link together to create a mystical sense of awe and wonder. Incidentally this is much harder for older folks to experience. This same part of the brain that uses past experience to quickly bypass bullshit also tends to inhibit creativity. Pollan, as a 60 something himself and a dedicated journalist, uses LSD, psilocybin, DMT and Ayahuasca so his gentle readers don't have to. He comes out of his trips with a new perspective and recommends it to his fellow senior citizens. As usual Pollan writes a very interesting book. Hopefully some Tim Leary type doesn't bring out the reactionaries and kill the current research on these highly illegal drugs. (This review does not advocate breaking any laws of man or god under any jurisdiction past, present or future just in case the NSA reads this and gets any ideas)."
69,0241294223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2118933-leo-walsh,4,"As usual, Pollan manages to delight me. Typically a food writer, he turns his considerable skills to investigating psychedelics, which contemporary psychiatrists have revived from the misuse that Timothy Leary unleashed on the culture during the 1960s, a movement most involved in serious psychedelic therapy, then and now, hated. It turns out that psychedelics have a long, positive history in therapy. They are wildly effective in helping depressed people and/ or people dying of cancer recover a sense of self and love of life. They are the most effective therapy psychiatrists have yet to discover for alcoholism, and when taken under the guidance of an experienced (and SOBER) therapist, a great tool for ""healthy normals"" to use, increasing their creativity and spirituality. As usual with Pollan, he mixes in-depth reporting with personal experience. And he reports on several trips he took under the guidance of therapists. While I liked the book, I have caveats. For instance, he's well aware that people taking LSD are susceptible to suggestions. And while he mentions it, what's to stop someone like Charlie Manson to pose as a ""psychedelic therapist"" and brainwash others into doing evil. Afterall, while I knew some great psychonauts in college, mostly Dead-Heads and Pfish-groupies, we had a terrifying, emotionally imbalanced kid living in our dorm-complex we called ""Acid,"" a goth/ vampire wannabewho tripped weekly. Word through the vine was that he considered himself Satanic. And while I never saw him act violently, I wouldn't be surprised to learn that he'd killed someone. And if a person tripping fell under his sway... who can tell? However, just ""because this bad thing can happen"" is no reason to throw away the baby with the bathwater. And if psychedelics are indeed that useful, we should allow health practitioners to use them to help others. And we can always remember cats like Timothy Leary who fell prey to the ""I am a prophet!!!!"" delusion that often haunts people who use psychedelics. My caution aside, the book was serious food for thought. Four stars. "
70,0241294223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9846570-leah,4,"This book has really changed the way I see drugs lol Specifically psychedelic drugs like psilocybin (aka shrooms) and Lysergic acid diethylamide (aka LSD).You can't get addicted to them and they can't kill you - something I thought the opposite of growing up from all the brainwashing. I mean it's good they brainwash you as a child not to do drugs but they technically are feeding kids lies. It's because children should definitely not take any drug because they are so weak and malleable they would go down the wrong path. But later in life when you have the knowledge and self control to take it properly it's not bad. It can cure alcoholism, smoking habits, depression, and even the fear of death. These trips take you onto a spiritual journey that the ego has no part in. You surrender to it's divine power. You let down your walls and guards to realize true meaning. Mind you it has to be in the right environment when you take the drug and it's encouraged to get a professional guide that can lead you on the journey. The trip makes you think differently, see things differently and find true meaning and value in things. People say that it's a life changing experience and they see the world completely different now. The results that these people had sounded a bit like how Landmark affected me. I found that we are meaning making machines and you can make your own meaning out of anything you choose to. And most importantly that we are all connected into one larger entity and at the end of the day we are all the same.Many artists and successful people became successful after a trip because it opened their minds and allowed them to see their true potential and purpose.If I find a suitable guide that could take me on a trip I would totally do it."
71,0241294223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1927745-sharman-russell,5,"I organized a book club around this book in the Gila Valley because my friend loved the book so much and I wanted something—for this first meeting—that was a fairly quick read, accessible, on an interesting and popular subject. I knew my book club members would be interested and also experienced, likely having taken hallucinogens in their youth. We could walk down memory lane together (although my experience is limited to a single dramatic night of peyote at the Grand Canyon Lodge in 1969, when I was a sophomore in high school). These were modest expectations which Pollan exceeded. The book led me to the future, not the past, which is really what I want a book to do. The neuroscience of How to Change Your Mind and the potential of opening our inner “doors of perception” for problems like addiction and depression is both exciting and also familiar. Also commonsense. It makes sense to me. I’m pleased to be introduced to new terms like the default mode network—that part of the brain that orchestrates and filters and could roughly be called the ego—and I am intrigued how certain drugs or meditative practices dampens its activity. I definitely want to dampen my own default mode network and am planning a therapy-guided trip somewhere, sometime, following Pollan’s lead in choosing and planning (as much as possible) that experience. I don’t mind at all that mystical experiences, the dissolution of the ego into the All, the One in All and the All in One, can be induced by a chemical. We are chemicals. We are molecules. We are the One in All and the All in One. Sometimes it’s good to be reminded of that. "

It doesn't present you with detailed descriptions of experiments, instead it gives you detailed descriptions of psychedelic trips. Momentarily, its bigger objective seems to be to tell you ""look, science is so dull; these things are so much outside of its domain; science is never going to explain this..."".What is more, it is centred around the personalities of various researchers, gurus, charlatans and whoever may come to mind on the sound of the word ""psychedelics"", rather than the subject matter itself. Trying to remember all of those at some point becomes futile.At some point, the Author seems to (very emotionally) blame Leary for undermining a potential utopia with widely-present psychedelics only to go on to defend him by a means of ""a bigger-picture""/""everyone has a role to play"" and all that.The descriptions of trips themselves appear rather cheap. They are actually comparable to the kitsch of the religious kind of spirituality. If anything, they discouraged my from trying psychedelics, as I am quite capable of getting into a whole lot better, meaningful state by meditation.In the beginning I honestly wanted to like this book, but in the end it was unbelievably disappointing. If you are looking for a book to actually learn something about psychedelics, this one isn't for you."

Sometimes those descriptions came acrosse powerfully but most of the time they were hard to relate to. The impact it had on everyone was clearly evident but unless you have ""seen the ocean"" it just isn't the same. Even knowing and easily recalling my own experiences didn't quite plug me into the prose Pollan used to describe the trips.I enjoyed the history of LSD and psychedelics and I really enjoyed the discussion of old and current research using them. Pollan convinced me about the large number of possible benefits but I am more of a Boulder hippy than most so the convincing didn't need to be extreme.This was a good, not great book that had an impossible task of describing something that in my opinion can only be experienced."

Primary emphasis is on helping with mental illness issues such as addiction, depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, etc. I was surprised to note that Bill W., founder of Alcoholics Anonymous was trying to get LSD approved for treatment because of his own success with the compound. Note the emphasis in this book is the use of these drugs, whether LSD, psilocybin mushrooms or other is used while accompanied by a trained individual as a ""guide"". In other words, don't try this at home! There is some commentary about the recreational aspects that so horrified the government types over the years but mainly this focuses on current research issues. The author did volunteer himself for ""treatment"" several times with interesting results which gives the book a certain verisimilitude, but in general the story would have benefited from a bit of depopulation and some more judicious editing.

Furthermore, a bit too much time was spent on Pollan describing his trips, and well, a bunch of people have already written about their trips extensively...and unless you're in it, it's kind of boring.

The problem with psychedelics is that they can bring about a powerful transcendent experience. Users of these substances can become ardent proponents with extreme zeal on behalf of these substances precisely because they give this feeling of transcendence. One only has to look at the case of Timothy Leary to see how a researcher can go overboard and become a guru for this stuff. Still, the powerful effect to change thinking and get people out of ruts be they habits or addictions says something about their potential value.

There was some interesting information and it seemed well researched (and he was as passionate as always!), but the subject wasn’t interesting enough for me to stay engaged for hundreds of pages. I also felt the scope was too broad (going from history to personal experience to neuroscience to applications) and he could have narrowed it down into one argument or exploration to make it more effective."

I think this is the tip of a new iceberg floating out of the arctic past. It's so rare that we get an opportunity to think about that which has not been thought about and researched to death. Here is the closest thing to an experiential journey into the actual unknown that we are likely to get from a book. Excellently pedestrian where it needs to be and vividly illustrative where it has to be. Best kind of literary trip. Only John McPhee could have done a better job. "

83,0241294223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13315860-peter-colclasure,3,"Full disclosure: I have never tried mushrooms, LSD, or any other hallucinogenic drug. I never thought I would want to. I was raised on cautionary tales and horror stories, of people driven insane, throwing themselves out windows in a LSD-induced frenzy, haunted by flashbacks, permanently unmoored. Some of my friends were at a party in college where a kid, high on something, became convinced that everyone else was a vampire, and he tried to stab them through the heart with a wooden stake or something. Not sure where he obtained a wooden stake, and the details of this story are third-hand and likely spurious, but the upshot is that the kid was barricaded in a closet and my friends took turns leaning against the closet door for several hours, holding it closed, keeping the kid contained, because he was a violent threat to others. What a nightmare.According to Michael Pollan, the horror stories are lurid exaggerations. Given the proper environment and guide, psychedelic trips are nearly always positive experiences. Many users report that their experience on psychedelics was the SINGLE MOST meaningful experience of their lives, eclipsing even the birth of their children. This book tells the story of psychedelics. There's a chapter about the natural history of mushrooms, a chapter about the discovery of LSD and the promising early research into this potent molecule that was derailed by the antics of Timothy Leary and the anti-drug paranoia of the 1960s that resulted in the drug being classified as a schedule I substance. Funding was banned, and the potential of LSD was buried and forgotten.In the late 1990s, after decades of government crackdown, the culture softened, and researchers gained permission to experiment with psychedelics once again as a treatment for addiction, depression, and anxiety in cancer patients. The results were extraordinary. An impactful ""trip"", attended by a competent and supportive therapist, had better results in treating alcoholism and depression than anything humans had ever tried. I learned about this book when Michael Pollan did the talk show circuit to promote it. I saw him on Colbert and Real Time. He was engaging and funny and warm. Then this book was listed as one of the top 10 books of the year by the The New York Times. And finally a random teenager working at a coffee shop in Bodega Bay was reading it and said good things. So I gave it a go.Parts were fascinating. Parts were boring. His first-person narratives about trying LSD, psilocybin, and mushrooms for the first time as a 60-year-old man were fascinating. And the chapter about the potential of these drugs to treat depression and addiction was incredible. However, a third of the book is given over to the history of psychedelic research in the 1950s and 1960s. That, I discovered, was more information than I needed. Pollan introduces dozens of scientists, psychologists, and zany characters like Al Hubbard. I couldn't keep them straight after a while, and ultimately I didn't care. I applaud the research and the due diligence Pollan demonstrated in giving credit where credit is due, but the gist is that these drugs were given serious scientific scrutiny at first, there was (perhaps over-zealous) optimism about their potential, then the '60s happened and mainstream culture freaked out, so they were banned. That's the story. I wasn't particularly interested in the supply chain of medical-grade LSD linking various research labs around the world. I think these drugs, in the right setting, have the potential to help a lot of people. Maybe when I'm 70 I'll give them a try. Here's a quote that sums up the book's message for me: The next day, during our integration session, Fritz read from his notes two things I apparently said aloud during theis part of the journey: “I don’t want to be so stingy with my feelings.” And, “All this time spent worrying about my heart. What about all the other hearts in my life?”It embarrasses me to write these words; they sound so thin, so banal. This is a failure of my language, no doubt, but perhaps it is not only that. Psychedelic experiences are notoriously hard to render in words; to try is necessarily to do violence to what has been seen and felt, which is in some fundamental way pre-or post-linguistic or, as students of mysticism say, ineffable. Emotions arrive in all their new-born nakedness, unprotected from the harsh light of scrutiny and especially, the pitiless glare of irony. Platitudes that wouldn’t seem out of place on a Hallmark card glow with the force of revealed truth.Love is everything.Okay, but what else did you learn?No—you must not have heard me: it’s everything!Is a platitude so deeply felt still just a platitude? No, I decided. A platitude is precisely what is left of a truth after it has been drained of all emotion. To resaturate the dried husk with feeling is to see it again for what it is: the loveliest and most deeply rooted of truths, hidden in plain sight. A spiritual insight? Maybe so. Or at least that’s how it appeared in the middle of my journey. Psychedelics can make even the most cynical of us into fervent evangelists of the obvious."
84,0241294223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3143117-david,4,"I was a little leery of this book. My son in-law passed it on to me arguing it was a good read. I enjoy Michael Pollan’s books on food, but drugs? I must have put it off for a couple of months, then decided I need to at least read the first 20 pages and then pass it back. At least I tried.Instead I read the 400-page book in three days. What happened you ask? Did he change your mind? Pollan has a very easy going story telling method even though he throws a lot of facts and information to you. I found out he is only a few years older than me and his drug interest came when he turned sixty. So we both share a common past, the height of the psychedelic years happened in the 1960s when we both were children, too young to be part of the scene. You know, Timothy Leary’s mantra, tune in, tune out and drop out. I had heard much of this as I grew up.The war on drugs began and LSD was in the headlines for all the wrong reasons. In my case, I was not into drugs but didn’t care if others did it. Wild mind bending trips that found the meaning of life or saw the beginning of the universe looked great on screen such as “Altered States” but I thought it was just a lot of “fiction”.Yet Pollan gives us the background to the drug industry, such as the discovery of LSD in 1938. It was used by the medical institution to help cure alcoholics and depressives. Always under the watch of science, it was becoming a new drug to help the world. Psilocybins or magic mushrooms were a long part of indigenous cultures. Then the 1960s came along, Leary and others brought it into the mainstream, and of course, the media picked up on the bad trips and of course, the government banned it. Psychedelic drugs went underground.Interestingly some new research recently into clinical treatments to assist dying patients, people suffering depression and addiction have resurfaced. Pollan decided it was time to try LSD, psilocybin mushrooms and toad venom. His experiences brought him around to a new attitude. It seems that the ego, that thing that controls all of our minds, under psychedelics can be kept in check and in doing so, creates a positive outcome. Are we in touch with the universe? Maybe but more so, in touch with ourselves. Things like fear of dying seems to have been alleviated in some cancer patients. Our society has a great fear of dying, and I think this is a good thing.I doubt that I would change my mind personally about taking psychedelic drugs, but his thesis opened my eyes to many decades of thinking differently about this issue. In this case, I would say he succeeded with me. My son in-law was right, it is a very good read."
85,0241294223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/216786-ken-ichi,4,"I fear Michael Pollan. Too often when reading his books I am swept along, forgetting to plant my feet and scrutinize factual claims or the coherence of his reasoning. I like his writing, I share his interests, and I find the narrator he presents companionable and worthy of my trust, so of course I am filled with anxiety when I step away and wonder what this guy just did to my brain.Now said guy comes along and writes a book about intentionally dissolving his own skepticism with psychedelic drugs, and his own anxieties over doing so, leaving me in some kind of Inception-like anxious state. Queue the BWAH.Regardless, Pollan has again succeeded in changing my mind (a ""locution,"" to borrow one of Pollan's locutions, that most reviewers of taste have no doubt avoided). Before, I saw psychedelics as ultimately recreational, but Pollan reveals a rich history of 20th century western research into their uses in treating mental illnesses that seem related to inescapable patterns of thought (addiction, depression), and their potential for addressing less-serious but still-troubling afflictions of mental ruts (fear of change, missing out on experiences, failing to value loved ones as much as you could, perhaps even bigotry). Certainly worth reading for stick-in-the-muds like me who would never have considered trying such drugs.Personally, I find the loss of self induced by psychedelics far less concerning than the loss of skepticism. Much of the ego dissolution Pollan describes from his psychedelic trips and from the reports of others sound like an enhanced version of my own experiences encountering the non-human world. The combined feelings of awe and connection are what I feel looking up at a mountain, or when looking at an especially weird bug or an especially beautiful flower (or even not-so-especially weird or beautiful bugs and flowers). It's rarely ecstatic or revelatory, but it seems related. It's the after effect of decreased doubt that I find more alarming and different. Even in nature, some of the greatest rewards come when I don't take things at face value. Maybe that rock is actually a turtle. Maybe that bee is actually a fly that parasitizes bees. In the human world of symbols and information, doubt seems as vital as air. The book certainly made me curious about trying psychedelics, and as most acquaintances my age have tried them and endorse them, I feel like I'm missing out on something important, but Pollan's book did not entirely allay my fears.Some scattered notes:* The fact that medical research into psychedelics was squashed in the 60s seems like a nice counter-example to notions of technological determinism, in which Puritanical cultural forces crushed a medical advance with demonstrable benefits. Then again, on a larger time-scale, it didn't, so maybe not.* ""When one is screening raw footage of people in costume tripping on mushrooms and dancing sloppily to a reggae band, a little goes a long way"" (p. 103) Pollan as a thoroughly qualified guide through the woo.* p. 122 Pollan cites a conversation with mycologist Michael Beug stating that ""Beug has tested fungi for psilocybin and psilocin levels and found that they occur only in minute quantities in the mycelium–the part of the organism most likely to be well defended"" and goes on to postulate that psychedelic compounds evolved because animals liked them and preferentially consumed (and thus distributed the spores of) fungi that concentrated these compounds in their fruit bodies. I could not find any publications by Beug on this topic in a cursory search, but I did turn up Gartz & Moller (1989), who did find higher concentrations of psilocybin in the fruit bodies of Psilocybe bohemica relative to the mycelia, so maybe that is generally true. Apparently the lethally toxic compounds that make death caps (Amanita phalloides) so deadly are also concentrated in the fruit bodies (Kaya et al., 2015). Like many Psilocybe species, Death caps are successful synanthropic mushrooms, which might either contradict or require a different explanation than Beug's ""animals that like getting high"" hypothesis for why mushrooms have these compounds. I'd guess they have more to do with the relationships between the mushrooms and flies or worms than with vertebrates.* The repeated emphasis on the effects of ""set and setting,"" or rather the expectations you have going into a psychedelic experience and the environment in which you have it, reminded me of this excellent article on research into why placebos work (and how a mechanistic explanation both supports and contradicts advocates of placebo-like approaches to healing). Pollan briefly mentions the connection between set & setting and placebos on p. 159, but doesn't go much further. I suspect there's considerable connection between the two bodies of work.* How awful is this cover? Like, all the covers of this book suck. I mean, there's no need to summon a goofy 60s-era aesthetic, but a single skylight on black is normcore to the max.* p. 312: ""Certainly getting older feels like an entropic process–a gradual running down and disordering of the mind and body. But maybe that's the wrong way to think about it. Robin Carhart-Harris's paper got me wonder if, at least for the mind, agin is really a process of declining entropy, the fading over time of what we should regard as a positive attribute of mental life."" Can't decide if this is an empowering perspective or just another thing to worry about, but it was a novel insight for me.* Discussion of the ""default mode network"" and problems of getting trapped in ""prisons of the self"" and obsessing over the future and the past (pp. 386-387, among many other places in the book) reminded me of Wendy & Richard Pini's concept of animal cognition, the ""now of wolf thought,"" which almost certainly emerged from the same mid-20th century obsession with Asian philosophy, specifically Buddhism, that fueled so much of our expectations about what psychedelics do, but ElfQuest might have been where I first encountered ideas like that, specifically in the example of one character who loses ""the now of wolf thought"" and cannot stop obsessing over past tragedy and the future (doesn't help that time travel is involved). It would not surprise me if psychedelics played a very direct role in the development of ElfQuest. It also reminded me of James Tiptree Jr.'s story ""Love Is the Plan the Plan Is Death,"" in which the protagonist struggles to escape ""The Plan"" of instinct and the present to communicate thoughts about the past and the future that might benefit their progeny, sort of the opposite moral where the price of being stuck in the ""now"" could lead to extinction."

87,0241294223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3932962-barbara-the-bibliophage,4,"To learn what the latest Michael Pollan book, How to Change Your Mind, is about just check out its subtitle: What the New Science of Psychedelics Teaches Us About Consciousness, Dying, Addiction, Depression, and Transcendence. Pollan creates an epic book. It’s part memoir, part history, and part science and medicine text.Pollan interweaves each of these elements seamlessly. He uses this style often and it should be familiar to fans of The Omnivore's Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals, for one. But don’t expect it to be studious or boring. The fabric of this book is just as colorful as 1960s tie dye. It spins and wiggles. Most of all, now I think completely differently about the positive potential of psychedelic drugs.HistoryYou might think LSD or Magic mushrooms began with Timothy Leary and “Turn On, Tune in, Drop out.” In fact, mushrooms with psychoactive capabilities have been used since ancient times. And LSD was developed decades before Leary in a completely scientific setting. Pollan explains both origin stories thoroughly.Through the last 50-60 years, public perception of psychedelics has shifted back and forth. Of course, they’ve been illegal in the U.S. since 1966. But people also use them to assist in spiritual and emotional journeys, both before and since then. Originally the psychological community embraced their potential. And now that same group is also contributing to the future of psychedelics.Many other types of scientists have investigated the role of psychedelics in life as we know it. For example, one theory aims to prove that apes ingesting psilocybin led to changes in the hominid brain, including societal bonding and analytical thinking. It’s called the Stoned Ape Theory. Psilocybin is the psychoactive drug compound found in over 200 types of mushrooms.Science and MedicineResearchers are studying various psychedelics for medical purposes, according to Pollan. Multiple respected institutions have conducted drug trials to investigate these possibilities. One example is giving psilocybin “to terminal cancer patients as a way to help them deal with their “existential distress” at the approach of death.”Additionally psychedelics are being tested for use with patients whose depression is both major and intractable. Pollan intersperses research information with stories from study participants, which adds both relevance and gravitas.MemoirPollan also tries mightily to describe his own various experiences with psychedelics. All the while he says that words fail to adequately describe his experiences. His explorations explain the advantages of “guided journeys” for introspection and spiritual advancement. Rather than randomly ingesting psilocybin, there’s a lot of logic to creating some ceremony and having other (non-ingesting) people around to keep you safe. Those “guides” also serve to help “ingesters” to emotionally process and integrate their psychedelic journeys. This structure harkens back to the way hallucinogenic substances have been used for centuries.My conclusionsI had many laughs at Pollan’s stories. In one, he’s with an expert hunting for a certain type of mushrooms called azzies. “We’re obviously not the first people to hunt for azzies in this park, and anyone who picks a mushroom trails an invisible cloud of its spore behind him; this, he believes, is the origin of the idea of fairy dust. At the end of many of those trails is apt to be a campsite, a car, or a Winnebago.” Having ready many fantasies set in the fairy world, this seems oddly logical to me.More than the laughs, I gained true insight into the nature of these psychedelic journeys. Pollan balances the science and history expertly with the more groovy aspects of his book.AcknowledgementsI received a digital advanced reader copy of this book in exchange for this honest review. Many thanks to NetGalley, Penguin Press, Penguin Random House, and most importantly, Michael Pollan for the opportunity."
88,0241294223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59281813-daniel-flanagan,5,"“Our normal waking consciousness, rational consciousness as we call it, is but one special type of consciousness, whilst all about it, parted from it by the filmiest of screens, there lie potential forms of consciousness entirely different."" – William James (American Philosopher; 1902).I thoroughly enjoyed voyaging through Michael Pollan’s exhaustive expose into the mysterious and misunderstood world of psychedelics. This exceptionally well-researched piece of scientific journalism was my introduction into Pollan’s writing, for which I had lofty expectations given the praise for his revolutionary book published in 2006, The Omnivore’s Dilemma. Let me tell you upfront, it did not disappoint.As a 60-something, self-described ‘staunch materialist’, Pollan takes a rigorous and scientific approach to assessing our current body of knowledge (and lack there-of) surrounding these enigmatic molecules. I appreciated the somewhat skeptical and hesitant feel that jumped off the page, because much like myself, I believe others will initially bring their preconceived bias to this topic. Pollan’s process for understanding psychedelics is no different from other issues he’s broached: read the scientific literature, interview the historically significant individuals and those conducting the research, and ultimately, get his hands dirty with a first-person experience. All these facets of his analysis come together in an extremely comprehensive overview of the subject.To summarize the narrative presented in the book, the so-called ‘classical psychedelics’ consisting of psilocybin (the active molecule in a polyphyletic group of psychedelic fungi), and LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide), among others, possess serious therapeutic value for humans afflicted with various mental illnesses such as addiction, depression, obsessive disorders, and anxiety associated with a terminal diagnosis – especially when combined with forms of cognitive behavioral therapy and experienced trip guides. Additionally, these molecules are non-toxic (do not affect us physiologically) and anti-addictive. Not only are the therapeutic benefits for mental illness now well-researched and supported by a growing number of clinically controlled trials, the author also outlines the experiences of otherwise healthy individuals utilizing these compounds to further understand their own minds and the world around them, often leading to a more fulfilling life (and often from a single dose). It’s important to note that Pollan candidly and impartially illustrates the risks associated with the intake of these substances, highlighting the fact that individuals with a high propensity to experience schizophrenic or psychotic episodes should steer clear.So, why then, are these molecules classified as ‘Schedule 1 Controlled Substances’ in the U.S. – the most dangerous category of drugs (which are described as having ‘a high potential for abuse’, and ‘no currently accepted medical use’)? And why do we have such a negative cultural bias towards psychedelics? Pollan answers these questions by opening his book with a complex historical backdrop ultimately leading us to Timothy Leary, the Harvard Psilocybin Project, and the mid-1960’s moral panic which influenced a whole generation’s view of these compounds – and not in a good way.Pollan isn’t advocating for everyone to go out and do magic mushrooms and LSD, but what he and other scientists are saying is this: there seems to be real utility in psychedelics, in that they can genuinely help to reduce the suffering associated with common human experiences, and ultimately, we need to advocate for further research into their potential applications.If you’re looking for a book to challenge your worldview and open your mind to new perspectives, I would highly recommend reading, How to Change Your Mind by Michael Pollan."
89,0241294223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12091097-jo,4,"4.5 starsI’ve been a fan of Michael Pollan’s writing since Botany of Desire and so when I saw he had a new book out and one that was all about psychedelics I was eager to pick it up. The book looks at the history of psychedelics, which goes further back than the notorious sixties cultural phenomenon, to their use by ancient peoples, their chemical effect in the brain and most importantly, their use in therapy to help patients suffering from addiction, depression and anxiety. In order to fully embrace and understand his subject Pollan also took trips of his own on psilocybin, LSD, 5-MeO-DMT (that comes from the glands of the Sonoran Desert toad) and ayahuasca.The book is a real mixture of science and biography, personal experience and history but is structured so that the heavier sections, such as that on the neuroscience of the brain, are interlaced with Pollan’s personal journeys and the therapeutic uses which look at an array of individual experiences. I was grateful for this as the first section, for example, outlining the current renaissance in psychedelic therapy was name and date heavy yet the following section looked at the history of the psilocybin mushroom and this I found fascinating. Michael Pollan has always been a great nature writer and so I think it is these sections that really drew me into the book. His personal experiences are also fascinating although, even as a journalist, he admits to a large degree of ineffability in describing them. He admits that often, when he hears the experiences of others or looks back at his own, there is the temptation to dismiss it all as delusional rantings or trippy dippy sixties speak but the work that has been done in the past and that is being done right now, shows that whatever these experiences are, and they are different for all of us, their value to mental health therapy could be immense. The history is fascinating and enlightening going back to the persecution of Native Americans by the Catholics for their “superstitious” use of these molecules, to revealing that although LSD in particular has a bad name, in large part to figures such as Timothy Leary who created a counter culture that lead to its designation as a Class one drug, at the same time the CIA were using it in highly unethical ways for their own agenda. He writes about some fascinating individuals he meets along the way, and as well as revealing his initial skepticism and giving us a balanced review of the research and its potentials he also lays his soul bare, so to speak, when describing his own journeys.Yes, the science can get confusing as he discusses aspects like the default mode network in the brain yet he always keeps in the forefront the human side to this all this, whether it is helping those with cancer lose their fear of death or help ‘well’ people expand their creative thinking and by the end, you can’t help feeling that taking a guided trip would be a worthwhile experience for us all.‘Hubbard understood intuitively how the suggestibility of the human mind during an altered state of consciousness could be harnessed as an important resource for healing-for breaking destructive patterns of thought and proposing new perspectives in their place.’‘There is so much authority that comes out of the primary mystical experience that it can be threatening to hierarchical structures.’‘Mysteries abide. But this I can say with certainty, the mind is vaster, and the world ever so much more alive, than I knew when I began.’"
