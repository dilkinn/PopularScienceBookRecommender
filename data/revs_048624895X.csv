0,048624895X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,4,"One of my current projects is about using speech recognition to build educational software, and there is a long-running discussion in our group about whether learning should be fun (for more background, see this review). I am one of the people in favor of making education entertaining, but others in the group believe equally strongly in the principle of no pain, no gain.I'm pleased to see here that the late George Gamow is a firm upholder of the contrary principle. Forget French conversation: everything, including quantum mechanics, can be presented in a way that is at the same time hilariously amusing and very instructive! He does a splendid job of walking you through the early decades of the quantum revolution, cleverly mixing anecdotes about his old friends (Bohr, Pauli, Dirac and others) with some quite sensible physics. At the end, I had learned several interesting things I hadn't known before. For example, I'd read a couple of weeks ago in Pais's biography of Einstein that Bohr had been able to derive the Rydberg constant from first principles but not understood how it was done; Gamow's explanation was both easy to follow and reasonably mathematical. All the same, it's hard not to give preference to the anecdotes. I think my favorite was the following one about Dirac:Dirac was notoriously shy with women, so his colleagues were surprised when they discovered that he had married the sister of Eugene Wigner, another famous physicist. In those pre-internet days, gossip got around more slowly. A visitor, who hadn't yet heard the news, turned up at Dirac's house one day and could hardly believe his eyes when he saw an attractive woman sitting comfortably on the living-room sofa, obviously behaving as though she was very much at home there.""I'm sorry,"" stammered Dirac, ""I should introduce you. This... this is Wigner's sister."""

2,048624895X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85723871-thomas-dietert,5,"Given a recent revelation that I know virtually nothing about how (or what) physical reality is comprised (of) at a most fundamental level and my subsequent pursuit of acquiring such conceptions, before reading this book I had read a series of pop-sci books on the nature of quantum physics, particle physics, quantum electro-dynamics, and the like. Most of the books in that series presented substantial historical context, high-level overviews, and a web of explicit and implicit interconnections between the discoveries and formalizations of such ubiquitous and fundamental notions about how physical reality ""works"" at quantum (indivisibly small) scale. None of these books provided me the insight that I obtained into the inner-workings of such theories as this book did, and I am so glad that I decided to read ""Thirty Years that Shook Physics"" when I did-- lest I wallow in the characteristic hand-wavingly vague, confounding, and imprecise explanations of such theories presented by most of modern pop-sci publications.In this brilliant work, George Gamow presents a linear, historical narrative and exposition of the inception of, elaboration upon, and impact of the aforementioned theories on the field of physics in the early 20th century, supported with insightfully clear figures, diagrams and drawings, and (most notably) the precise mathematical underpinnings that necessarily serve as the foundation for building a more coherent and intuitive conception of the theories at a high level. Furthermore, since Gamow participated in this revolutionary trio of decades as a seminal contributor and prolific collaborator, the book is peppered with amiable and cheerful anecdotes that permit unique insight into the lives, personalities, and blatant humanity of the physicists who revolutionized our understanding of the quantum.A few of my most favorite ideas presented in the book are as follows:  Max Planck  postulated that light must be quantized due to an inaccurate conclusion of a thermodynamical thought experiment (The Jeans Cube) suggesting that, if the Equipartition Principle holds true for light (as it does for gas) and if frequencies of light waves are infinite such that the total energy of a closed system of electromagnetic waves should be distributed across these infinite frequencies, then (put simply) your fireplace hearth would readily explode with the violence of the hottest star soon after you ignited the logs. Since this obviously is not the case in reality, Planck postulated that the energy able to be stored in electro-magnetic waves must decrease inversely with respect to frequency, and that the amount of energy contained by the wavr  must  be an integer multiple of the (subsequently computed) Planck constant. Wolfgang Pauli  formulated the Pauli Exclusion principle which, in its full form, is a bit more interesting than the usual form taught in University level Chemistry courses. The full extent of the principle counters the notion that ""two electrons share a single atomic orbit"" (originally quantified by Sommerfeld with three parameters) is not completely accurate: Instead, a fourth quantum number is needed to characterize the orbits precisely, known as an electron's ""spin"", and that only two electrons can share the same orbit only if they have opposite spin. Furthermore, since electrons can be thought of like a very tiny negatively charged particle spinning on an axis, the magnetic moment produced by these oppositely spinning electrons make it so that the pair of electrons with opposite spin that share an orbit described the original 3 quantum numbers do not actually share the same orbit at all-- the magnetic moment produced by each electron will repel the other, shifting the orbits enough for it to be incorrect to say that the two electrons have the same orbit! George Gamow  found that it is not only electrons that abide by the more precise interpretation of the Pauli principle (that is, that electrons have atomic spin, that only two can ""share"" an orbit, and that they exist in a structured form on different ""energy levels"" [particle interpretation] or ""atomic shells"" [wave interpretation]), but that both protons and neutrons also have atomic spin, and that the structure of the atomic nucleus can also be described by protons and neutrons existing on differing, structured energy levels (or ""nuclear shells""). That is to say that neutrons and protons each have their own nuclear shells overlaid upon one another, and that there are a certain number of each particle permitted on each level such that the nucleus remains stable. Werner Heisengberg  presented a clear and ingenious thought experiment that serves as the foundation of the famous  Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle , yielding the undeniable conclusion that we cannot discover both the velocity and position of a particle with a single classically mechanical measurement (due to interesting qualities of both the mechanism of interaction between the particle and the photon performing the measurement, and the physical limitations of the measurement of the measuring photon by the theodolite). Gamow does a wonderful job illustrating this thought experiment through a full page diagram and lucid derivation from assumptions to conclusions. Instead of doing a poor job of summarizing it here, I will point the interested reader to Fig. 24 on page 108, and the section in which it resides called ""Discarding Classical Linear Trajectories"".There are many more theories and conceptions presented within these pages that, for lack of better terms,  blew my mind , but in the interest of brevity I elect to not include any more of these incredible insights but to instead reiterate the point that Gamow fills this text to the brim with approachable yet dense expositions of these revolutionary ideas and theories of quantum physics conceived throughout the duration of the thirty-year quantum spring, and it is a truly exciting and deeply humbling experience to read from cover to cover. It is most certainly the mathematics of these quantum theories-- which Gamow readily demonstrates for virtually every theory presented in depth-- that I developed such a strong appreciation for this book. That being said, to read this book is not an easy venture and the process demands focus and attention from the reader in order to extract the entirety of the value it provides. Though this book is purported to be a ""lucid layman's introduction to quantum theory"", it is difficult to appreciate many of the mathematics presented without some non-trivial existing conceptions of classical physics such as kinetic and potential energies, rotational motion, Coulomb's law, and the mental agility to follow algebraic reformulations and substitutions of terms in equations performed on most every formula derivation (for brevity, I assume). Admittedly, many of the chapters of the book required my unfaltering attention in addition to multiple traversals over the content in a somewhat staggered manner. I often read each section twice by default, thrice usually, repeatedly consulted previous chapters when I inevitably discovered my conception of aforementioned theories was lacking, and often chose to re-read sections I had read the previous day as a review before starting on the next section. Many of the topics covered-- such as pilot waves, anti-particles, radioactive decay (via weak-nuclear force), and mesons (strong nuclear force)-- we're still just out of my reach, even after substantial effort. I say all this to suggest that this book is not for leisure reading, and if a reader approaches it as such (without sufficient background in quantum physics foundations) they will be almost certain to not appreciate its contents. I picked up this book to get a stronger mathematical conception of the fundamental theories of quantum physics and that is what it delivered, but not without significant effort on my part; succinctly put, this is a ""morning book"".In conclusion, Gamow's ""Thirty Years that Shook Physics"" is a remarkably eloquent book illustrating the foundational conceptions of seminal quantum theorists and their theories, at both the high-level and mathematical levels of abstraction. I would recommend this book to anyone who has a passion for physics and/or understanding physical reality more deeply. Though many will set this book down with more questions than when they started, readers will without a doubt (assuming the willingness to endure the initial struggle each and every theory presented demands) achieve a greater understanding of the underpinning of quantum theory, and the incredible and revolutionary advances made by the likes of Planck, Bohr, Dirac, Pauli, De-Broglie, Fermi, Heisenberg, Einstein, and many others during the wonderfully prolific decades of 1900 - 1930. These physicists, their theories, and magnificent conceptions are  the giants  whose shoulders all modern quantum theories, theorists, and experimentalists stand."
3,048624895X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75310921-kirk-moodey,5,"Heh I misremembered this as '40 years', no, it's 'thirty years'. Good to remember the actual name for search engines or when doing book recs, yes?Anyway, this is a great book that does not talk down to you. It mentions actual equations (fairly easy ones), which can be incredibly hard to find in a book aimed at general audiences/pleasure reading, but if those aren't to your taste there is plenty of equation-free material and it is easy enough to skim read over the equation bits. I always appreciate a book that doesn't assume the reader is a moron but doesn't take 10 pages to get to the damn point or swim in highly technical language either, and because of this if you have read other popular physics books this one will almost certainly have different material for you to enjoy. It has a bit about de Broglie waves as a precursor to Schrodinger's waves that I have yet to see anywhere else."
4,048624895X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/998218-astrotama,5,This is one of my all time favorite popular books on physics! I read it when I was 15 yrs old and the stories (and the physics!) have inspired me since then!
5,048624895X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7852031-annie-kate,4,"I first read this book several decades ago and enjoyed it hugely this second time as well. It is a history of early 20th-century physics organized around some of the major contributing scientists.With personal knowledge of the physicists involved, Gamow is able to share not only the physics (in simple terms) but also the atmosphere of the time.For physicists, immersed in mathematical theories, who can no longer see the forest for the trees, this book gives a quick overview of the beginnings of quantum theory. For anyone trying to understand some of the most important ideas in the recent history of science, this book provides a fairly accessible introduction containing only a small amount of mathematics. Recommended for those studying physics as well as those interested in the history of science."
6,048624895X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11375563-michael-huang,5,"Discussed the 30 years of fast advancement of quantum theory, with some equations and quite a bit of human stories of the scientists. 	1. Planck: There is an equal partition theorem derived from Newtonian mechanics: in a large number of particles, the energy will be shared equally on average. (Energy is equal. Larger particles will thus be slower.) The resulting distribution of energy vs particle number is later derived by Boltzmann. The distribution of EM radiation from black body is qualitatively similar and can be explained if radiation frequency is not continuous but discrete. Planck postulated this discreteness and got the constant named after him.	2. Bohr: the classic principle of least action states that particle from A to B the total action (energy x time) is smallest or largest of all trajectory. This is adapted to say the action of the electron going through its orbit in a complete cycle (m*v*2πr) must be integer multiple of h. This explains the atomic radiation spectra. 	3. Pauli developed the exclusion principle. He also speculated on neutrino which he calls neutron. Fermi later gave the diminutive to Pauli’s neutron because it’s not massive. They are so elusive that to filter out half of neutrinos requires light-years thick of iron!	4. De Broglie. The wave theory of light can show that in total internal reflection, the light actually goes out of the glass, which can be verified by placing another glass several wavelengths away and see the light. De Broglie extends this to particles and considers them having a “pilot wave”. The same effect happens and particles can now get over energy barriers classical mechanics won’t allow them to.	5. Heisenberg. There is a nice explanation of the uncertainty principle. Classic trajectories are idealized lines with no width. Measurement of atomic particles (think cloud chamber) gives a trajectory a width. The minimum width is determined by the uncertainty principle. And the wave function also gives the predicted trajectory a width.	6. Dirac: So far, quantum theory is incompatible with relativity. With relativity, if you multiply time (ict) it is indistinguishable from another space dimension. Yet in Schrodinger’s equation, there is asymmetry as the spatial dimensions have 2nd order derivatives and the time 1st order. There were efforts to bring time to 2nd order and didn’t work. Dirac tried to make the spatial dimension’s derivative 1st order. In so doing, the math allowed for antiparticles which explained cosmic ray observations. 	7. Fermi: in explaining beta emission, Fermi made the simplest assumption that probability is proportional to all participating component’s wave function at a particular point. This agrees with observation and now allows all kinds of particle transformations. 	8. Yukawa: the strong nuclear interaction is effective only when neucleons come in close contact (about 10^-18cm). Once this happens, breaking the bond takes ~10Mev. Initial attempt to explain this is with electrons exchanging between atomic shells and the math of “exchange force” was created. But it didn’t work for electrons. Yukawa calculated that it takes a particle 207 more massive to do it. This is dubbed meson in the end. Later it was discovered that there are two types of meson, a pi type and a mu type (pion and muon).What I like most about Gamow’s book (beyond that it’s clear and to the point) is that he’s not shy of using equations, which is so much clearer."
7,048624895X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15049145-stephen,3,"I have a bachelor of science degree in physics, and though I'm not the best at it I'm pretty solid in both advanced math and basic physics. I just wasn't cut out to be like the physicists George Gamow writes about at the turn of the century that turned classical physics on its head.Though some people say this book is directed at laymen, you really should have some physics background to appreciate it. It starts with the ultraviolet catastrophe prediction which led to the rethinking light as photons and ultimately the birth of quantum mechanics. Later, Niels Bohr applied the same thinking to atomic structure.George Gamow was a Russian physicist and contemporary of many of the famous physicists in this book. He offers up a lot of the history of the science, as well as humorous anecdotes of those involved firsthand at the revolution in physics that occurred at the beginning of the twentieth century.Do yourself a favor and only get the version that includes the 1932 parody of ""Faust"" if you read this book.I cannot recommend it to non-physicists, but this is my second time reading this book and I find not only quantum mechanics fascinating, but George Gamow's matter-of-fact way of describing the problems and how those scientists came up with their radical ideas to model what we observe in nature."
8,048624895X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39637934-randomdots,4,"Geroge Gamov has done really well to make a topic, like quantum mechanics, as simple as possible. It covers some prominent events between 1900-1930 that shaped the course of modern physics. Besides explaining quantum theory laconically, it also shows the funny sides of some famous physicists.Overall, if you want to know the very basics of quantum theory without being overwhelmed by its complexity, it should be your go-to book."
9,048624895X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/94879331-vishal-upendran,5,"George Gamow is an amazing popular science writer. One certainly does not need much background in Quantum mechanics to get an overview, but one will certainly appreciate much, much more - appreciating where in the world people got the idea to quantize things, and how things just blew up due to a bunch of smart guys.If you are any science enthusiast at all, you must certainly read this book!"
10,048624895X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/113271095-ijal,5,"Good if one were to have background in science. I can see how some of the concepts may put some people off, with their technicalities. But what can one be inclined to expect greater than this, written by the renowned physicist Gamow, and mind you, insights are crawling all over the page."
11,048624895X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10812762-courtney,4,"Thirty Years that Shook Physics is a book written by a scientist about scientists...to scientists. While I enjoyed this book, and found the history fascinating, there was a lot that went over my head. The book is chock full of formulas, equations, and phrases that run something akin to, ""I don't have space in this book to explain this specific theory, so I am going to assume you already have a functional knowledge of it."" This isn't me complaining; I still enjoyed the book and went into it well aware that I would not understand everything inside of it. I just say this as a warning to anyone else considering reading it. The writing style of the author was incredibly endearing. I really enjoyed looking at history through the eyes of someone who is not a historian by trade. The anecdotes he shared about the scientists--his friends and people he knew well--were funny and to the point, and showed a side of the scientist that I had rarely seen. There was no skimping on the science however! Gamow still dealt carefully with all of the specific discoveries that were made during these thirty years, and in a technical way. Even though I didn't understand all the specifics, I still felt at the end of it that I had a half-way decent grasp on what kind of a change had occurred during the 30 years he talks about. It was a good read, and I recommend it!"
12,048624895X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88336520-sarah-naimi,4,"I loved this book as a physicist with solid knowledge of quantum theory. He really tries to intuitively explain the physics but I think it won't hurt to have some general knowledge about physics and quantum physics before reading this book. Sometimes he misses the point and don't follow up, which was a bit frustrating but in general very enjoyable and funny read. "
13,048624895X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21843217-ahlam,4,"I picked this book up at a sale event in our public library. I am an engineer so I have meager to nill knowledge of quantum physics. So I was really curious but a little bit anxious to read about the subject. However this turned out to be a fascinating journey through stories about some of science rock stars who revolutionized physics in the early 20th century. Here you find bits and pieces of their personalities and their scientific achievements. The book also offers a relatively easy to understand fundemental principles of the quantum theory that broke every basic classical notion of space, time, and motion that were well established and subject to common sense. Just like how earth was flat to ancient people but certainly not to Magellan. Just like how theory of relativity showed that at very high velocities and very large distances things do not behave as ""they should have"". Quantum physics takes you to to the scale electrons neutrons protons and neutrinos. And shows you how things really work. Absolutely loved this book and will definently come back to it again. If you are a science enthusiast, you might wanna have this in your library."
14,048624895X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15193589-devinder-dhiman,5,"Thirty years that shook physics by G. Gamow gives a very good account of the happenings in physics circle from 1900 to 1930. These thirty years are considered very important in the history of Quantum physics. The author, himself a great scientist, gives in detail the part played by other great scientists Max Planck, N. Bohr, W. Pauli , De Broglie, W.Heisenberg, Dirac, Fermi and Yukawa in the development of quantum physics. If you want to learn about quantum physics, this book will help you learn the basics about it, and at times it is is funny too when it describes some of the incidents related to these scientists. I had a good laugh when reading about Pauli's very funny third principle of things breaking down in laboratories in the presence of theoretical physicists. When a scientist's experiment went wrong, he wrote a letter to Pauli. Pauli wrote back that he was in the train at that time and the train had a brief halt at the station in the city where the experiment was being conducted, suggesting the failure of experiment due to his presence in the city station at that time. Really good humor !"
15,048624895X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12269600-gary-patella,5,"This book does an excellent job of explaining the various achievements in quantum physics over a critical thirty year period. Although this book was first published in 1966 (nearly 50 years ago), no new developments have been made in quantum physics since that time. While that can be disheartening, it also makes this old book surprisingly relevant.Gamow's ability to explain difficult physical concepts is well-known from his stories about Mr. Thompkins. However, this book explains the concepts without the child-like aspects, and focuses on important figures in quantum physics.The Faust play at the end is entertaining for physics enthusiasts, even if it is somewhat lacking as a play overall. But Gamow was not the playwright, and decided to just add it for entertainment purposes at the end, so I cannot criticize him for that.The only criticism I could give is that there should have been a separate chapter on Erwin Schrödinger, as well as a second chapter on Richard Feynman.Overall, this is a book worth reading for those that have an interest in quantum physics."
16,048624895X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175087-brian,4,"I found this to be a very cohesive account of the history of the field of modern physics, beginning in early twentieth century and ending in the 1930's or so. It did a nice job of explaining the major findings of quantum mechanics and also gave a brief but good account of the major players in this field, including Max Planck, Neils Bohr, Wolfgang Pauli, De Broglie and Schrodinger, Werner Heisenberg, Paul Dirac, Enrico Fermi and Hideki Yukawa. I can't claim to understand everything that was discussed in this book, but I do now have some understanding of why Schrodinger and Heisenberg came up with different methods but identical conclusions on wave mechanics of particle motion. I hope this book has provided me with a good foundation for further reading on the theory and history of quantum mechanics. "

It goes from Planck to Dirac with some notes on particle physics. These last chapters are a bit dated though, missing the more recent QED, QCD, electroweak theory, and standard model. Plus misses more recent quantum mechanics like entanglement and the EPR argument which lead to it, plus there is no discussion of alternative interpretations. In Search of Schrödinger's Cat, or Quantum Realities is a better start I think. "

The full extent of the principle counters the notion that ""two electrons share a single atomic orbit"" (originally quantified by Sommerfeld with three parameters) is not completely accurate: Instead, a fourth quantum number is needed to characterize the orbits precisely, known as an electron's ""spin"", and that only two electrons can share the same orbit only if they have opposite spin. Furthermore, since electrons can be thought of like a very tiny negatively charged particle spinning on an axis, the magnetic moment produced by these oppositely spinning electrons make it so that the pair of electrons with opposite spin that share an orbit described the original 3 quantum numbers do not actually share the same orbit at all-- the magnetic moment produced by each electron will repel the other, shifting the orbits enough for it to be incorrect to say that the two electrons have the same orbit! George Gamow  found that it is not only electrons that abide by the more precise interpretation of the Pauli principle (that is, that electrons have atomic spin, that only two can ""share"" an orbit, and that they exist in a structured form on different ""energy levels"" [particle interpretation] or ""atomic shells"" [wave interpretation]), but that both protons and neutrons also have atomic spin, and that the structure of the atomic nucleus can also be described by protons and neutrons existing on differing, structured energy levels (or ""nuclear shells""). That is to say that neutrons and protons each have their own nuclear shells overlaid upon one another, and that there are a certain number of each particle permitted on each level such that the nucleus remains stable. Werner Heisengberg  presented a clear and ingenious thought experiment that serves as the foundation of the famous  Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle , yielding the undeniable conclusion that we cannot discover both the velocity and position of a particle with a single classically mechanical measurement (due to interesting qualities of both the mechanism of interaction between the particle and the photon performing the measurement, and the physical limitations of the measurement of the measuring photon by the theodolite). Gamow does a wonderful job illustrating this thought experiment through a full page diagram and lucid derivation from assumptions to conclusions. Instead of doing a poor job of summarizing it here, I will point the interested reader to Fig. 24 on page 108, and the section in which it resides called ""Discarding Classical Linear Trajectories"".There are many more theories and conceptions presented within these pages that, for lack of better terms,  blew my mind , but in the interest of brevity I elect to not include any more of these incredible insights but to instead reiterate the point that Gamow fills this text to the brim with approachable yet dense expositions of these revolutionary ideas and theories of quantum physics conceived throughout the duration of the thirty-year quantum spring, and it is a truly exciting and deeply humbling experience to read from cover to cover. It is most certainly the mathematics of these quantum theories-- which Gamow readily demonstrates for virtually every theory presented in depth-- that I developed such a strong appreciation for this book. That being said, to read this book is not an easy venture and the process demands focus and attention from the reader in order to extract the entirety of the value it provides. Though this book is purported to be a ""lucid layman's introduction to quantum theory"", it is difficult to appreciate many of the mathematics presented without some non-trivial existing conceptions of classical physics such as kinetic and potential energies, rotational motion, Coulomb's law, and the mental agility to follow algebraic reformulations and substitutions of terms in equations performed on most every formula derivation (for brevity, I assume). Admittedly, many of the chapters of the book required my unfaltering attention in addition to multiple traversals over the content in a somewhat staggered manner. I often read each section twice by default, thrice usually, repeatedly consulted previous chapters when I inevitably discovered my conception of aforementioned theories was lacking, and often chose to re-read sections I had read the previous day as a review before starting on the next section. Many of the topics covered-- such as pilot waves, anti-particles, radioactive decay (via weak-nuclear force), and mesons (strong nuclear force)-- we're still just out of my reach, even after substantial effort. I say all this to suggest that this book is not for leisure reading, and if a reader approaches it as such (without sufficient background in quantum physics foundations) they will be almost certain to not appreciate its contents. I picked up this book to get a stronger mathematical conception of the fundamental theories of quantum physics and that is what it delivered, but not without significant effort on my part; succinctly put, this is a ""morning book"".In conclusion, Gamow's ""Thirty Years that Shook Physics"" is a remarkably eloquent book illustrating the foundational conceptions of seminal quantum theorists and their theories, at both the high-level and mathematical levels of abstraction. I would recommend this book to anyone who has a passion for physics and/or understanding physical reality more deeply. Though many will set this book down with more questions than when they started, readers will without a doubt (assuming the willingness to endure the initial struggle each and every theory presented demands) achieve a greater understanding of the underpinning of quantum theory, and the incredible and revolutionary advances made by the likes of Planck, Bohr, Dirac, Pauli, De-Broglie, Fermi, Heisenberg, Einstein, and many others during the wonderfully prolific decades of 1900 - 1930. These physicists, their theories, and magnificent conceptions are  the giants  whose shoulders all modern quantum theories, theorists, and experimentalists stand."

Good to remember the actual name for search engines or when doing book recs, yes?Anyway, this is a great book that does not talk down to you. It mentions actual equations (fairly easy ones), which can be incredibly hard to find in a book aimed at general audiences/pleasure reading, but if those aren't to your taste there is plenty of equation-free material and it is easy enough to skim read over the equation bits. I always appreciate a book that doesn't assume the reader is a moron but doesn't take 10 pages to get to the damn point or swim in highly technical language either, and because of this if you have read other popular physics books this one will almost certainly have different material for you to enjoy. It has a bit about de Broglie waves as a precursor to Schrodinger's waves that I have yet to see anywhere else."
34,048624895X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/998218-astrotama,5,This is one of my all time favorite popular books on physics! I read it when I was 15 yrs old and the stories (and the physics!) have inspired me since then!
35,048624895X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7852031-annie-kate,4,"I first read this book several decades ago and enjoyed it hugely this second time as well. It is a history of early 20th-century physics organized around some of the major contributing scientists.With personal knowledge of the physicists involved, Gamow is able to share not only the physics (in simple terms) but also the atmosphere of the time.For physicists, immersed in mathematical theories, who can no longer see the forest for the trees, this book gives a quick overview of the beginnings of quantum theory. For anyone trying to understand some of the most important ideas in the recent history of science, this book provides a fairly accessible introduction containing only a small amount of mathematics. Recommended for those studying physics as well as those interested in the history of science."
36,048624895X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11375563-michael-huang,5,"Discussed the 30 years of fast advancement of quantum theory, with some equations and quite a bit of human stories of the scientists. 	1. Planck: There is an equal partition theorem derived from Newtonian mechanics: in a large number of particles, the energy will be shared equally on average. (Energy is equal. Larger particles will thus be slower.) The resulting distribution of energy vs particle number is later derived by Boltzmann. The distribution of EM radiation from black body is qualitatively similar and can be explained if radiation frequency is not continuous but discrete. Planck postulated this discreteness and got the constant named after him.	2. Bohr: the classic principle of least action states that particle from A to B the total action (energy x time) is smallest or largest of all trajectory. This is adapted to say the action of the electron going through its orbit in a complete cycle (m*v*2πr) must be integer multiple of h. This explains the atomic radiation spectra. 	3. Pauli developed the exclusion principle. He also speculated on neutrino which he calls neutron. Fermi later gave the diminutive to Pauli’s neutron because it’s not massive. They are so elusive that to filter out half of neutrinos requires light-years thick of iron!	4. De Broglie. The wave theory of light can show that in total internal reflection, the light actually goes out of the glass, which can be verified by placing another glass several wavelengths away and see the light. De Broglie extends this to particles and considers them having a “pilot wave”. The same effect happens and particles can now get over energy barriers classical mechanics won’t allow them to.	5. Heisenberg. There is a nice explanation of the uncertainty principle. Classic trajectories are idealized lines with no width. Measurement of atomic particles (think cloud chamber) gives a trajectory a width. The minimum width is determined by the uncertainty principle. And the wave function also gives the predicted trajectory a width.	6. Dirac: So far, quantum theory is incompatible with relativity. With relativity, if you multiply time (ict) it is indistinguishable from another space dimension. Yet in Schrodinger’s equation, there is asymmetry as the spatial dimensions have 2nd order derivatives and the time 1st order. There were efforts to bring time to 2nd order and didn’t work. Dirac tried to make the spatial dimension’s derivative 1st order. In so doing, the math allowed for antiparticles which explained cosmic ray observations. 	7. Fermi: in explaining beta emission, Fermi made the simplest assumption that probability is proportional to all participating component’s wave function at a particular point. This agrees with observation and now allows all kinds of particle transformations. 	8. Yukawa: the strong nuclear interaction is effective only when neucleons come in close contact (about 10^-18cm). Once this happens, breaking the bond takes ~10Mev. Initial attempt to explain this is with electrons exchanging between atomic shells and the math of “exchange force” was created. But it didn’t work for electrons. Yukawa calculated that it takes a particle 207 more massive to do it. This is dubbed meson in the end. Later it was discovered that there are two types of meson, a pi type and a mu type (pion and muon).What I like most about Gamow’s book (beyond that it’s clear and to the point) is that he’s not shy of using equations, which is so much clearer."

I just wasn't cut out to be like the physicists George Gamow writes about at the turn of the century that turned classical physics on its head.Though some people say this book is directed at laymen, you really should have some physics background to appreciate it. It starts with the ultraviolet catastrophe prediction which led to the rethinking light as photons and ultimately the birth of quantum mechanics. Later, Niels Bohr applied the same thinking to atomic structure.George Gamow was a Russian physicist and contemporary of many of the famous physicists in this book. He offers up a lot of the history of the science, as well as humorous anecdotes of those involved firsthand at the revolution in physics that occurred at the beginning of the twentieth century.Do yourself a favor and only get the version that includes the 1932 parody of ""Faust"" if you read this book.I cannot recommend it to non-physicists, but this is my second time reading this book and I find not only quantum mechanics fascinating, but George Gamow's matter-of-fact way of describing the problems and how those scientists came up with their radical ideas to model what we observe in nature."
38,048624895X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39637934-randomdots,4,"Geroge Gamov has done really well to make a topic, like quantum mechanics, as simple as possible. It covers some prominent events between 1900-1930 that shaped the course of modern physics. Besides explaining quantum theory laconically, it also shows the funny sides of some famous physicists.Overall, if you want to know the very basics of quantum theory without being overwhelmed by its complexity, it should be your go-to book."

41,048624895X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10812762-courtney,4,"Thirty Years that Shook Physics is a book written by a scientist about scientists...to scientists. While I enjoyed this book, and found the history fascinating, there was a lot that went over my head. The book is chock full of formulas, equations, and phrases that run something akin to, ""I don't have space in this book to explain this specific theory, so I am going to assume you already have a functional knowledge of it."" This isn't me complaining; I still enjoyed the book and went into it well aware that I would not understand everything inside of it. I just say this as a warning to anyone else considering reading it. The writing style of the author was incredibly endearing. I really enjoyed looking at history through the eyes of someone who is not a historian by trade. The anecdotes he shared about the scientists--his friends and people he knew well--were funny and to the point, and showed a side of the scientist that I had rarely seen. There was no skimping on the science however! Gamow still dealt carefully with all of the specific discoveries that were made during these thirty years, and in a technical way. Even though I didn't understand all the specifics, I still felt at the end of it that I had a half-way decent grasp on what kind of a change had occurred during the 30 years he talks about. It was a good read, and I recommend it!"

He really tries to intuitively explain the physics but I think it won't hurt to have some general knowledge about physics and quantum physics before reading this book. Sometimes he misses the point and don't follow up, which was a bit frustrating but in general very enjoyable and funny read. "
43,048624895X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21843217-ahlam,4,"I picked this book up at a sale event in our public library. I am an engineer so I have meager to nill knowledge of quantum physics. So I was really curious but a little bit anxious to read about the subject. However this turned out to be a fascinating journey through stories about some of science rock stars who revolutionized physics in the early 20th century. Here you find bits and pieces of their personalities and their scientific achievements. The book also offers a relatively easy to understand fundemental principles of the quantum theory that broke every basic classical notion of space, time, and motion that were well established and subject to common sense. Just like how earth was flat to ancient people but certainly not to Magellan. Just like how theory of relativity showed that at very high velocities and very large distances things do not behave as ""they should have"". Quantum physics takes you to to the scale electrons neutrons protons and neutrinos. And shows you how things really work. Absolutely loved this book and will definently come back to it again.

These thirty years are considered very important in the history of Quantum physics. The author, himself a great scientist, gives in detail the part played by other great scientists Max Planck, N. Bohr, W. Pauli , De Broglie, W.Heisenberg, Dirac, Fermi and Yukawa in the development of quantum physics. If you want to learn about quantum physics, this book will help you learn the basics about it, and at times it is is funny too when it describes some of the incidents related to these scientists. I had a good laugh when reading about Pauli's very funny third principle of things breaking down in laboratories in the presence of theoretical physicists. When a scientist's experiment went wrong, he wrote a letter to Pauli. Pauli wrote back that he was in the train at that time and the train had a brief halt at the station in the city where the experiment was being conducted, suggesting the failure of experiment due to his presence in the city station at that time. Really good humor !"
45,048624895X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12269600-gary-patella,5,"This book does an excellent job of explaining the various achievements in quantum physics over a critical thirty year period. Although this book was first published in 1966 (nearly 50 years ago), no new developments have been made in quantum physics since that time. While that can be disheartening, it also makes this old book surprisingly relevant.Gamow's ability to explain difficult physical concepts is well-known from his stories about Mr. Thompkins. However, this book explains the concepts without the child-like aspects, and focuses on important figures in quantum physics.The Faust play at the end is entertaining for physics enthusiasts, even if it is somewhat lacking as a play overall. But Gamow was not the playwright, and decided to just add it for entertainment purposes at the end, so I cannot criticize him for that.The only criticism I could give is that there should have been a separate chapter on Erwin Schrödinger, as well as a second chapter on Richard Feynman.Overall, this is a book worth reading for those that have an interest in quantum physics."

I can't claim to understand everything that was discussed in this book, but I do now have some understanding of why Schrodinger and Heisenberg came up with different methods but identical conclusions on wave mechanics of particle motion. I hope this book has provided me with a good foundation for further reading on the theory and history of quantum mechanics. "

It goes from Planck to Dirac with some notes on particle physics. These last chapters are a bit dated though, missing the more recent QED, QCD, electroweak theory, and standard model. Plus misses more recent quantum mechanics like entanglement and the EPR argument which lead to it, plus there is no discussion of alternative interpretations. In Search of Schrödinger's Cat, or Quantum Realities is a better start I think. "

I am one of the people in favor of making education entertaining, but others in the group believe equally strongly in the principle of no pain, no gain.I'm pleased to see here that the late George Gamow is a firm upholder of the contrary principle. Forget French conversation: everything, including quantum mechanics, can be presented in a way that is at the same time hilariously amusing and very instructive! He does a splendid job of walking you through the early decades of the quantum revolution, cleverly mixing anecdotes about his old friends (Bohr, Pauli, Dirac and others) with some quite sensible physics. At the end, I had learned several interesting things I hadn't known before. For example, I'd read a couple of weeks ago in Pais's biography of Einstein that Bohr had been able to derive the Rydberg constant from first principles but not understood how it was done; Gamow's explanation was both easy to follow and reasonably mathematical. All the same, it's hard not to give preference to the anecdotes. I think my favorite was the following one about Dirac:Dirac was notoriously shy with women, so his colleagues were surprised when they discovered that he had married the sister of Eugene Wigner, another famous physicist. In those pre-internet days, gossip got around more slowly. A visitor, who hadn't yet heard the news, turned up at Dirac's house one day and could hardly believe his eyes when he saw an attractive woman sitting comfortably on the living-room sofa, obviously behaving as though she was very much at home there.""I'm sorry,"" stammered Dirac, ""I should introduce you.

62,048624895X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85723871-thomas-dietert,5,"Given a recent revelation that I know virtually nothing about how (or what) physical reality is comprised (of) at a most fundamental level and my subsequent pursuit of acquiring such conceptions, before reading this book I had read a series of pop-sci books on the nature of quantum physics, particle physics, quantum electro-dynamics, and the like. Most of the books in that series presented substantial historical context, high-level overviews, and a web of explicit and implicit interconnections between the discoveries and formalizations of such ubiquitous and fundamental notions about how physical reality ""works"" at quantum (indivisibly small) scale. None of these books provided me the insight that I obtained into the inner-workings of such theories as this book did, and I am so glad that I decided to read ""Thirty Years that Shook Physics"" when I did-- lest I wallow in the characteristic hand-wavingly vague, confounding, and imprecise explanations of such theories presented by most of modern pop-sci publications.In this brilliant work, George Gamow presents a linear, historical narrative and exposition of the inception of, elaboration upon, and impact of the aforementioned theories on the field of physics in the early 20th century, supported with insightfully clear figures, diagrams and drawings, and (most notably) the precise mathematical underpinnings that necessarily serve as the foundation for building a more coherent and intuitive conception of the theories at a high level. Furthermore, since Gamow participated in this revolutionary trio of decades as a seminal contributor and prolific collaborator, the book is peppered with amiable and cheerful anecdotes that permit unique insight into the lives, personalities, and blatant humanity of the physicists who revolutionized our understanding of the quantum.A few of my most favorite ideas presented in the book are as follows:  Max Planck  postulated that light must be quantized due to an inaccurate conclusion of a thermodynamical thought experiment (The Jeans Cube) suggesting that, if the Equipartition Principle holds true for light (as it does for gas) and if frequencies of light waves are infinite such that the total energy of a closed system of electromagnetic waves should be distributed across these infinite frequencies, then (put simply) your fireplace hearth would readily explode with the violence of the hottest star soon after you ignited the logs. Since this obviously is not the case in reality, Planck postulated that the energy able to be stored in electro-magnetic waves must decrease inversely with respect to frequency, and that the amount of energy contained by the wavr  must  be an integer multiple of the (subsequently computed) Planck constant. Wolfgang Pauli  formulated the Pauli Exclusion principle which, in its full form, is a bit more interesting than the usual form taught in University level Chemistry courses. The full extent of the principle counters the notion that ""two electrons share a single atomic orbit"" (originally quantified by Sommerfeld with three parameters) is not completely accurate: Instead, a fourth quantum number is needed to characterize the orbits precisely, known as an electron's ""spin"", and that only two electrons can share the same orbit only if they have opposite spin. Furthermore, since electrons can be thought of like a very tiny negatively charged particle spinning on an axis, the magnetic moment produced by these oppositely spinning electrons make it so that the pair of electrons with opposite spin that share an orbit described the original 3 quantum numbers do not actually share the same orbit at all-- the magnetic moment produced by each electron will repel the other, shifting the orbits enough for it to be incorrect to say that the two electrons have the same orbit! George Gamow  found that it is not only electrons that abide by the more precise interpretation of the Pauli principle (that is, that electrons have atomic spin, that only two can ""share"" an orbit, and that they exist in a structured form on different ""energy levels"" [particle interpretation] or ""atomic shells"" [wave interpretation]), but that both protons and neutrons also have atomic spin, and that the structure of the atomic nucleus can also be described by protons and neutrons existing on differing, structured energy levels (or ""nuclear shells"").

Though many will set this book down with more questions than when they started, readers will without a doubt (assuming the willingness to endure the initial struggle each and every theory presented demands) achieve a greater understanding of the underpinning of quantum theory, and the incredible and revolutionary advances made by the likes of Planck, Bohr, Dirac, Pauli, De-Broglie, Fermi, Heisenberg, Einstein, and many others during the wonderfully prolific decades of 1900 - 1930.

66,048624895X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11375563-michael-huang,5,"Discussed the 30 years of fast advancement of quantum theory, with some equations and quite a bit of human stories of the scientists. 	1. Planck: There is an equal partition theorem derived from Newtonian mechanics: in a large number of particles, the energy will be shared equally on average. (Energy is equal. Larger particles will thus be slower.) The resulting distribution of energy vs particle number is later derived by Boltzmann. The distribution of EM radiation from black body is qualitatively similar and can be explained if radiation frequency is not continuous but discrete. Planck postulated this discreteness and got the constant named after him.	2. Bohr: the classic principle of least action states that particle from A to B the total action (energy x time) is smallest or largest of all trajectory. This is adapted to say the action of the electron going through its orbit in a complete cycle (m*v*2πr) must be integer multiple of h. This explains the atomic radiation spectra. 	3. Pauli developed the exclusion principle. He also speculated on neutrino which he calls neutron. Fermi later gave the diminutive to Pauli’s neutron because it’s not massive. They are so elusive that to filter out half of neutrinos requires light-years thick of iron!	4. De Broglie. The wave theory of light can show that in total internal reflection, the light actually goes out of the glass, which can be verified by placing another glass several wavelengths away and see the light. De Broglie extends this to particles and considers them having a “pilot wave”. The same effect happens and particles can now get over energy barriers classical mechanics won’t allow them to.	5. Heisenberg. There is a nice explanation of the uncertainty principle. Classic trajectories are idealized lines with no width. Measurement of atomic particles (think cloud chamber) gives a trajectory a width. The minimum width is determined by the uncertainty principle. And the wave function also gives the predicted trajectory a width.	6. Dirac: So far, quantum theory is incompatible with relativity. With relativity, if you multiply time (ict) it is indistinguishable from another space dimension. Yet in Schrodinger’s equation, there is asymmetry as the spatial dimensions have 2nd order derivatives and the time 1st order. There were efforts to bring time to 2nd order and didn’t work. Dirac tried to make the spatial dimension’s derivative 1st order. In so doing, the math allowed for antiparticles which explained cosmic ray observations. 	7. Fermi: in explaining beta emission, Fermi made the simplest assumption that probability is proportional to all participating component’s wave function at a particular point. This agrees with observation and now allows all kinds of particle transformations. 	8. Yukawa: the strong nuclear interaction is effective only when neucleons come in close contact (about 10^-18cm). Once this happens, breaking the bond takes ~10Mev. Initial attempt to explain this is with electrons exchanging between atomic shells and the math of “exchange force” was created. But it didn’t work for electrons. Yukawa calculated that it takes a particle 207 more massive to do it. This is dubbed meson in the end. Later it was discovered that there are two types of meson, a pi type and a mu type (pion and muon).What I like most about Gamow’s book (beyond that it’s clear and to the point) is that he’s not shy of using equations, which is so much clearer."

I just wasn't cut out to be like the physicists George Gamow writes about at the turn of the century that turned classical physics on its head.Though some people say this book is directed at laymen, you really should have some physics background to appreciate it. It starts with the ultraviolet catastrophe prediction which led to the rethinking light as photons and ultimately the birth of quantum mechanics. Later, Niels Bohr applied the same thinking to atomic structure.George Gamow was a Russian physicist and contemporary of many of the famous physicists in this book. He offers up a lot of the history of the science, as well as humorous anecdotes of those involved firsthand at the revolution in physics that occurred at the beginning of the twentieth century.Do yourself a favor and only get the version that includes the 1932 parody of ""Faust"" if you read this book.I cannot recommend it to non-physicists, but this is my second time reading this book and I find not only quantum mechanics fascinating, but George Gamow's matter-of-fact way of describing the problems and how those scientists came up with their radical ideas to model what we observe in nature."

It covers some prominent events between 1900-1930 that shaped the course of modern physics. Besides explaining quantum theory laconically, it also shows the funny sides of some famous physicists.Overall, if you want to know the very basics of quantum theory without being overwhelmed by its complexity, it should be your go-to book."

While I enjoyed this book, and found the history fascinating, there was a lot that went over my head. The book is chock full of formulas, equations, and phrases that run something akin to, ""I don't have space in this book to explain this specific theory, so I am going to assume you already have a functional knowledge of it."" This isn't me complaining; I still enjoyed the book and went into it well aware that I would not understand everything inside of it. I just say this as a warning to anyone else considering reading it. The writing style of the author was incredibly endearing. I really enjoyed looking at history through the eyes of someone who is not a historian by trade. The anecdotes he shared about the scientists--his friends and people he knew well--were funny and to the point, and showed a side of the scientist that I had rarely seen. There was no skimping on the science however! Gamow still dealt carefully with all of the specific discoveries that were made during these thirty years, and in a technical way. Even though I didn't understand all the specifics, I still felt at the end of it that I had a half-way decent grasp on what kind of a change had occurred during the 30 years he talks about. It was a good read, and I recommend it!"

He really tries to intuitively explain the physics but I think it won't hurt to have some general knowledge about physics and quantum physics before reading this book. Sometimes he misses the point and don't follow up, which was a bit frustrating but in general very enjoyable and funny read. "

So I was really curious but a little bit anxious to read about the subject. However this turned out to be a fascinating journey through stories about some of science rock stars who revolutionized physics in the early 20th century. Here you find bits and pieces of their personalities and their scientific achievements. The book also offers a relatively easy to understand fundemental principles of the quantum theory that broke every basic classical notion of space, time, and motion that were well established and subject to common sense. Just like how earth was flat to ancient people but certainly not to Magellan. Just like how theory of relativity showed that at very high velocities and very large distances things do not behave as ""they should have"". Quantum physics takes you to to the scale electrons neutrons protons and neutrinos. And shows you how things really work. Absolutely loved this book and will definently come back to it again.

These thirty years are considered very important in the history of Quantum physics. The author, himself a great scientist, gives in detail the part played by other great scientists Max Planck, N. Bohr, W. Pauli , De Broglie, W.Heisenberg, Dirac, Fermi and Yukawa in the development of quantum physics. If you want to learn about quantum physics, this book will help you learn the basics about it, and at times it is is funny too when it describes some of the incidents related to these scientists. I had a good laugh when reading about Pauli's very funny third principle of things breaking down in laboratories in the presence of theoretical physicists. When a scientist's experiment went wrong, he wrote a letter to Pauli. Pauli wrote back that he was in the train at that time and the train had a brief halt at the station in the city where the experiment was being conducted, suggesting the failure of experiment due to his presence in the city station at that time. Really good humor !"
75,048624895X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12269600-gary-patella,5,"This book does an excellent job of explaining the various achievements in quantum physics over a critical thirty year period. Although this book was first published in 1966 (nearly 50 years ago), no new developments have been made in quantum physics since that time. While that can be disheartening, it also makes this old book surprisingly relevant.Gamow's ability to explain difficult physical concepts is well-known from his stories about Mr. Thompkins. However, this book explains the concepts without the child-like aspects, and focuses on important figures in quantum physics.The Faust play at the end is entertaining for physics enthusiasts, even if it is somewhat lacking as a play overall. But Gamow was not the playwright, and decided to just add it for entertainment purposes at the end, so I cannot criticize him for that.The only criticism I could give is that there should have been a separate chapter on Erwin Schrödinger, as well as a second chapter on Richard Feynman.Overall, this is a book worth reading for those that have an interest in quantum physics."

I can't claim to understand everything that was discussed in this book, but I do now have some understanding of why Schrodinger and Heisenberg came up with different methods but identical conclusions on wave mechanics of particle motion. I hope this book has provided me with a good foundation for further reading on the theory and history of quantum mechanics. "

Plus misses more recent quantum mechanics like entanglement and the EPR argument which lead to it, plus there is no discussion of alternative interpretations. In Search of Schrödinger's Cat, or Quantum Realities is a better start I think. "

90,048624895X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,4,"One of my current projects is about using speech recognition to build educational software, and there is a long-running discussion in our group about whether learning should be fun (for more background, see this review). I am one of the people in favor of making education entertaining, but others in the group believe equally strongly in the principle of no pain, no gain.I'm pleased to see here that the late George Gamow is a firm upholder of the contrary principle. Forget French conversation: everything, including quantum mechanics, can be presented in a way that is at the same time hilariously amusing and very instructive! He does a splendid job of walking you through the early decades of the quantum revolution, cleverly mixing anecdotes about his old friends (Bohr, Pauli, Dirac and others) with some quite sensible physics. At the end, I had learned several interesting things I hadn't known before. For example, I'd read a couple of weeks ago in Pais's biography of Einstein that Bohr had been able to derive the Rydberg constant from first principles but not understood how it was done; Gamow's explanation was both easy to follow and reasonably mathematical. All the same, it's hard not to give preference to the anecdotes. I think my favorite was the following one about Dirac:Dirac was notoriously shy with women, so his colleagues were surprised when they discovered that he had married the sister of Eugene Wigner, another famous physicist. In those pre-internet days, gossip got around more slowly. A visitor, who hadn't yet heard the news, turned up at Dirac's house one day and could hardly believe his eyes when he saw an attractive woman sitting comfortably on the living-room sofa, obviously behaving as though she was very much at home there.""I'm sorry,"" stammered Dirac, ""I should introduce you. This... this is Wigner's sister."""

92,048624895X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85723871-thomas-dietert,5,"Given a recent revelation that I know virtually nothing about how (or what) physical reality is comprised (of) at a most fundamental level and my subsequent pursuit of acquiring such conceptions, before reading this book I had read a series of pop-sci books on the nature of quantum physics, particle physics, quantum electro-dynamics, and the like. Most of the books in that series presented substantial historical context, high-level overviews, and a web of explicit and implicit interconnections between the discoveries and formalizations of such ubiquitous and fundamental notions about how physical reality ""works"" at quantum (indivisibly small) scale. None of these books provided me the insight that I obtained into the inner-workings of such theories as this book did, and I am so glad that I decided to read ""Thirty Years that Shook Physics"" when I did-- lest I wallow in the characteristic hand-wavingly vague, confounding, and imprecise explanations of such theories presented by most of modern pop-sci publications.In this brilliant work, George Gamow presents a linear, historical narrative and exposition of the inception of, elaboration upon, and impact of the aforementioned theories on the field of physics in the early 20th century, supported with insightfully clear figures, diagrams and drawings, and (most notably) the precise mathematical underpinnings that necessarily serve as the foundation for building a more coherent and intuitive conception of the theories at a high level. Furthermore, since Gamow participated in this revolutionary trio of decades as a seminal contributor and prolific collaborator, the book is peppered with amiable and cheerful anecdotes that permit unique insight into the lives, personalities, and blatant humanity of the physicists who revolutionized our understanding of the quantum.A few of my most favorite ideas presented in the book are as follows:  Max Planck  postulated that light must be quantized due to an inaccurate conclusion of a thermodynamical thought experiment (The Jeans Cube) suggesting that, if the Equipartition Principle holds true for light (as it does for gas) and if frequencies of light waves are infinite such that the total energy of a closed system of electromagnetic waves should be distributed across these infinite frequencies, then (put simply) your fireplace hearth would readily explode with the violence of the hottest star soon after you ignited the logs. Since this obviously is not the case in reality, Planck postulated that the energy able to be stored in electro-magnetic waves must decrease inversely with respect to frequency, and that the amount of energy contained by the wavr  must  be an integer multiple of the (subsequently computed) Planck constant. Wolfgang Pauli  formulated the Pauli Exclusion principle which, in its full form, is a bit more interesting than the usual form taught in University level Chemistry courses. The full extent of the principle counters the notion that ""two electrons share a single atomic orbit"" (originally quantified by Sommerfeld with three parameters) is not completely accurate: Instead, a fourth quantum number is needed to characterize the orbits precisely, known as an electron's ""spin"", and that only two electrons can share the same orbit only if they have opposite spin. Furthermore, since electrons can be thought of like a very tiny negatively charged particle spinning on an axis, the magnetic moment produced by these oppositely spinning electrons make it so that the pair of electrons with opposite spin that share an orbit described the original 3 quantum numbers do not actually share the same orbit at all-- the magnetic moment produced by each electron will repel the other, shifting the orbits enough for it to be incorrect to say that the two electrons have the same orbit! George Gamow  found that it is not only electrons that abide by the more precise interpretation of the Pauli principle (that is, that electrons have atomic spin, that only two can ""share"" an orbit, and that they exist in a structured form on different ""energy levels"" [particle interpretation] or ""atomic shells"" [wave interpretation]), but that both protons and neutrons also have atomic spin, and that the structure of the atomic nucleus can also be described by protons and neutrons existing on differing, structured energy levels (or ""nuclear shells""). That is to say that neutrons and protons each have their own nuclear shells overlaid upon one another, and that there are a certain number of each particle permitted on each level such that the nucleus remains stable. Werner Heisengberg  presented a clear and ingenious thought experiment that serves as the foundation of the famous  Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle , yielding the undeniable conclusion that we cannot discover both the velocity and position of a particle with a single classically mechanical measurement (due to interesting qualities of both the mechanism of interaction between the particle and the photon performing the measurement, and the physical limitations of the measurement of the measuring photon by the theodolite). Gamow does a wonderful job illustrating this thought experiment through a full page diagram and lucid derivation from assumptions to conclusions. Instead of doing a poor job of summarizing it here, I will point the interested reader to Fig. 24 on page 108, and the section in which it resides called ""Discarding Classical Linear Trajectories"".There are many more theories and conceptions presented within these pages that, for lack of better terms,  blew my mind , but in the interest of brevity I elect to not include any more of these incredible insights but to instead reiterate the point that Gamow fills this text to the brim with approachable yet dense expositions of these revolutionary ideas and theories of quantum physics conceived throughout the duration of the thirty-year quantum spring, and it is a truly exciting and deeply humbling experience to read from cover to cover. It is most certainly the mathematics of these quantum theories-- which Gamow readily demonstrates for virtually every theory presented in depth-- that I developed such a strong appreciation for this book. That being said, to read this book is not an easy venture and the process demands focus and attention from the reader in order to extract the entirety of the value it provides. Though this book is purported to be a ""lucid layman's introduction to quantum theory"", it is difficult to appreciate many of the mathematics presented without some non-trivial existing conceptions of classical physics such as kinetic and potential energies, rotational motion, Coulomb's law, and the mental agility to follow algebraic reformulations and substitutions of terms in equations performed on most every formula derivation (for brevity, I assume). Admittedly, many of the chapters of the book required my unfaltering attention in addition to multiple traversals over the content in a somewhat staggered manner. I often read each section twice by default, thrice usually, repeatedly consulted previous chapters when I inevitably discovered my conception of aforementioned theories was lacking, and often chose to re-read sections I had read the previous day as a review before starting on the next section. Many of the topics covered-- such as pilot waves, anti-particles, radioactive decay (via weak-nuclear force), and mesons (strong nuclear force)-- we're still just out of my reach, even after substantial effort. I say all this to suggest that this book is not for leisure reading, and if a reader approaches it as such (without sufficient background in quantum physics foundations) they will be almost certain to not appreciate its contents. I picked up this book to get a stronger mathematical conception of the fundamental theories of quantum physics and that is what it delivered, but not without significant effort on my part; succinctly put, this is a ""morning book"".In conclusion, Gamow's ""Thirty Years that Shook Physics"" is a remarkably eloquent book illustrating the foundational conceptions of seminal quantum theorists and their theories, at both the high-level and mathematical levels of abstraction. I would recommend this book to anyone who has a passion for physics and/or understanding physical reality more deeply. Though many will set this book down with more questions than when they started, readers will without a doubt (assuming the willingness to endure the initial struggle each and every theory presented demands) achieve a greater understanding of the underpinning of quantum theory, and the incredible and revolutionary advances made by the likes of Planck, Bohr, Dirac, Pauli, De-Broglie, Fermi, Heisenberg, Einstein, and many others during the wonderfully prolific decades of 1900 - 1930.

De Broglie extends this to particles and considers them having a “pilot wave”. The same effect happens and particles can now get over energy barriers classical mechanics won’t allow them to.	5. Heisenberg. There is a nice explanation of the uncertainty principle. Classic trajectories are idealized lines with no width. Measurement of atomic particles (think cloud chamber) gives a trajectory a width. The minimum width is determined by the uncertainty principle. And the wave function also gives the predicted trajectory a width.	6. Dirac: So far, quantum theory is incompatible with relativity. With relativity, if you multiply time (ict) it is indistinguishable from another space dimension. Yet in Schrodinger’s equation, there is asymmetry as the spatial dimensions have 2nd order derivatives and the time 1st order. There were efforts to bring time to 2nd order and didn’t work. Dirac tried to make the spatial dimension’s derivative 1st order. In so doing, the math allowed for antiparticles which explained cosmic ray observations. 	7. Fermi: in explaining beta emission, Fermi made the simplest assumption that probability is proportional to all participating component’s wave function at a particular point. This agrees with observation and now allows all kinds of particle transformations. 	8. Yukawa: the strong nuclear interaction is effective only when neucleons come in close contact (about 10^-18cm). Once this happens, breaking the bond takes ~10Mev. Initial attempt to explain this is with electrons exchanging between atomic shells and the math of “exchange force” was created. But it didn’t work for electrons. Yukawa calculated that it takes a particle 207 more massive to do it. This is dubbed meson in the end. Later it was discovered that there are two types of meson, a pi type and a mu type (pion and muon).What I like most about Gamow’s book (beyond that it’s clear and to the point) is that he’s not shy of using equations, which is so much clearer."

While I enjoyed this book, and found the history fascinating, there was a lot that went over my head. The book is chock full of formulas, equations, and phrases that run something akin to, ""I don't have space in this book to explain this specific theory, so I am going to assume you already have a functional knowledge of it."" This isn't me complaining; I still enjoyed the book and went into it well aware that I would not understand everything inside of it. I just say this as a warning to anyone else considering reading it. The writing style of the author was incredibly endearing. I really enjoyed looking at history through the eyes of someone who is not a historian by trade. The anecdotes he shared about the scientists--his friends and people he knew well--were funny and to the point, and showed a side of the scientist that I had rarely seen. There was no skimping on the science however! Gamow still dealt carefully with all of the specific discoveries that were made during these thirty years, and in a technical way. Even though I didn't understand all the specifics, I still felt at the end of it that I had a half-way decent grasp on what kind of a change had occurred during the 30 years he talks about. It was a good read, and I recommend it!"

So I was really curious but a little bit anxious to read about the subject. However this turned out to be a fascinating journey through stories about some of science rock stars who revolutionized physics in the early 20th century. Here you find bits and pieces of their personalities and their scientific achievements. The book also offers a relatively easy to understand fundemental principles of the quantum theory that broke every basic classical notion of space, time, and motion that were well established and subject to common sense. Just like how earth was flat to ancient people but certainly not to Magellan. Just like how theory of relativity showed that at very high velocities and very large distances things do not behave as ""they should have"". Quantum physics takes you to to the scale electrons neutrons protons and neutrinos. And shows you how things really work. Absolutely loved this book and will definently come back to it again.

These thirty years are considered very important in the history of Quantum physics. The author, himself a great scientist, gives in detail the part played by other great scientists Max Planck, N. Bohr, W. Pauli , De Broglie, W.Heisenberg, Dirac, Fermi and Yukawa in the development of quantum physics. If you want to learn about quantum physics, this book will help you learn the basics about it, and at times it is is funny too when it describes some of the incidents related to these scientists. I had a good laugh when reading about Pauli's very funny third principle of things breaking down in laboratories in the presence of theoretical physicists. When a scientist's experiment went wrong, he wrote a letter to Pauli. Pauli wrote back that he was in the train at that time and the train had a brief halt at the station in the city where the experiment was being conducted, suggesting the failure of experiment due to his presence in the city station at that time. Really good humor !"
105,048624895X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12269600-gary-patella,5,"This book does an excellent job of explaining the various achievements in quantum physics over a critical thirty year period. Although this book was first published in 1966 (nearly 50 years ago), no new developments have been made in quantum physics since that time. While that can be disheartening, it also makes this old book surprisingly relevant.Gamow's ability to explain difficult physical concepts is well-known from his stories about Mr. Thompkins. However, this book explains the concepts without the child-like aspects, and focuses on important figures in quantum physics.The Faust play at the end is entertaining for physics enthusiasts, even if it is somewhat lacking as a play overall. But Gamow was not the playwright, and decided to just add it for entertainment purposes at the end, so I cannot criticize him for that.The only criticism I could give is that there should have been a separate chapter on Erwin Schrödinger, as well as a second chapter on Richard Feynman.Overall, this is a book worth reading for those that have an interest in quantum physics."

I am one of the people in favor of making education entertaining, but others in the group believe equally strongly in the principle of no pain, no gain.I'm pleased to see here that the late George Gamow is a firm upholder of the contrary principle. Forget French conversation: everything, including quantum mechanics, can be presented in a way that is at the same time hilariously amusing and very instructive! He does a splendid job of walking you through the early decades of the quantum revolution, cleverly mixing anecdotes about his old friends (Bohr, Pauli, Dirac and others) with some quite sensible physics. At the end, I had learned several interesting things I hadn't known before. For example, I'd read a couple of weeks ago in Pais's biography of Einstein that Bohr had been able to derive the Rydberg constant from first principles but not understood how it was done; Gamow's explanation was both easy to follow and reasonably mathematical. All the same, it's hard not to give preference to the anecdotes. I think my favorite was the following one about Dirac:Dirac was notoriously shy with women, so his colleagues were surprised when they discovered that he had married the sister of Eugene Wigner, another famous physicist. In those pre-internet days, gossip got around more slowly. A visitor, who hadn't yet heard the news, turned up at Dirac's house one day and could hardly believe his eyes when he saw an attractive woman sitting comfortably on the living-room sofa, obviously behaving as though she was very much at home there.""I'm sorry,"" stammered Dirac, ""I should introduce you. This... this is Wigner's sister."""

122,048624895X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85723871-thomas-dietert,5,"Given a recent revelation that I know virtually nothing about how (or what) physical reality is comprised (of) at a most fundamental level and my subsequent pursuit of acquiring such conceptions, before reading this book I had read a series of pop-sci books on the nature of quantum physics, particle physics, quantum electro-dynamics, and the like. Most of the books in that series presented substantial historical context, high-level overviews, and a web of explicit and implicit interconnections between the discoveries and formalizations of such ubiquitous and fundamental notions about how physical reality ""works"" at quantum (indivisibly small) scale. None of these books provided me the insight that I obtained into the inner-workings of such theories as this book did, and I am so glad that I decided to read ""Thirty Years that Shook Physics"" when I did-- lest I wallow in the characteristic hand-wavingly vague, confounding, and imprecise explanations of such theories presented by most of modern pop-sci publications.In this brilliant work, George Gamow presents a linear, historical narrative and exposition of the inception of, elaboration upon, and impact of the aforementioned theories on the field of physics in the early 20th century, supported with insightfully clear figures, diagrams and drawings, and (most notably) the precise mathematical underpinnings that necessarily serve as the foundation for building a more coherent and intuitive conception of the theories at a high level. Furthermore, since Gamow participated in this revolutionary trio of decades as a seminal contributor and prolific collaborator, the book is peppered with amiable and cheerful anecdotes that permit unique insight into the lives, personalities, and blatant humanity of the physicists who revolutionized our understanding of the quantum.A few of my most favorite ideas presented in the book are as follows:  Max Planck  postulated that light must be quantized due to an inaccurate conclusion of a thermodynamical thought experiment (The Jeans Cube) suggesting that, if the Equipartition Principle holds true for light (as it does for gas) and if frequencies of light waves are infinite such that the total energy of a closed system of electromagnetic waves should be distributed across these infinite frequencies, then (put simply) your fireplace hearth would readily explode with the violence of the hottest star soon after you ignited the logs. Since this obviously is not the case in reality, Planck postulated that the energy able to be stored in electro-magnetic waves must decrease inversely with respect to frequency, and that the amount of energy contained by the wavr  must  be an integer multiple of the (subsequently computed) Planck constant. Wolfgang Pauli  formulated the Pauli Exclusion principle which, in its full form, is a bit more interesting than the usual form taught in University level Chemistry courses. The full extent of the principle counters the notion that ""two electrons share a single atomic orbit"" (originally quantified by Sommerfeld with three parameters) is not completely accurate: Instead, a fourth quantum number is needed to characterize the orbits precisely, known as an electron's ""spin"", and that only two electrons can share the same orbit only if they have opposite spin. Furthermore, since electrons can be thought of like a very tiny negatively charged particle spinning on an axis, the magnetic moment produced by these oppositely spinning electrons make it so that the pair of electrons with opposite spin that share an orbit described the original 3 quantum numbers do not actually share the same orbit at all-- the magnetic moment produced by each electron will repel the other, shifting the orbits enough for it to be incorrect to say that the two electrons have the same orbit! George Gamow  found that it is not only electrons that abide by the more precise interpretation of the Pauli principle (that is, that electrons have atomic spin, that only two can ""share"" an orbit, and that they exist in a structured form on different ""energy levels"" [particle interpretation] or ""atomic shells"" [wave interpretation]), but that both protons and neutrons also have atomic spin, and that the structure of the atomic nucleus can also be described by protons and neutrons existing on differing, structured energy levels (or ""nuclear shells""). That is to say that neutrons and protons each have their own nuclear shells overlaid upon one another, and that there are a certain number of each particle permitted on each level such that the nucleus remains stable. Werner Heisengberg  presented a clear and ingenious thought experiment that serves as the foundation of the famous  Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle , yielding the undeniable conclusion that we cannot discover both the velocity and position of a particle with a single classically mechanical measurement (due to interesting qualities of both the mechanism of interaction between the particle and the photon performing the measurement, and the physical limitations of the measurement of the measuring photon by the theodolite). Gamow does a wonderful job illustrating this thought experiment through a full page diagram and lucid derivation from assumptions to conclusions. Instead of doing a poor job of summarizing it here, I will point the interested reader to Fig. 24 on page 108, and the section in which it resides called ""Discarding Classical Linear Trajectories"".There are many more theories and conceptions presented within these pages that, for lack of better terms,  blew my mind , but in the interest of brevity I elect to not include any more of these incredible insights but to instead reiterate the point that Gamow fills this text to the brim with approachable yet dense expositions of these revolutionary ideas and theories of quantum physics conceived throughout the duration of the thirty-year quantum spring, and it is a truly exciting and deeply humbling experience to read from cover to cover. It is most certainly the mathematics of these quantum theories-- which Gamow readily demonstrates for virtually every theory presented in depth-- that I developed such a strong appreciation for this book. That being said, to read this book is not an easy venture and the process demands focus and attention from the reader in order to extract the entirety of the value it provides. Though this book is purported to be a ""lucid layman's introduction to quantum theory"", it is difficult to appreciate many of the mathematics presented without some non-trivial existing conceptions of classical physics such as kinetic and potential energies, rotational motion, Coulomb's law, and the mental agility to follow algebraic reformulations and substitutions of terms in equations performed on most every formula derivation (for brevity, I assume). Admittedly, many of the chapters of the book required my unfaltering attention in addition to multiple traversals over the content in a somewhat staggered manner. I often read each section twice by default, thrice usually, repeatedly consulted previous chapters when I inevitably discovered my conception of aforementioned theories was lacking, and often chose to re-read sections I had read the previous day as a review before starting on the next section. Many of the topics covered-- such as pilot waves, anti-particles, radioactive decay (via weak-nuclear force), and mesons (strong nuclear force)-- we're still just out of my reach, even after substantial effort. I say all this to suggest that this book is not for leisure reading, and if a reader approaches it as such (without sufficient background in quantum physics foundations) they will be almost certain to not appreciate its contents. I picked up this book to get a stronger mathematical conception of the fundamental theories of quantum physics and that is what it delivered, but not without significant effort on my part; succinctly put, this is a ""morning book"".In conclusion, Gamow's ""Thirty Years that Shook Physics"" is a remarkably eloquent book illustrating the foundational conceptions of seminal quantum theorists and their theories, at both the high-level and mathematical levels of abstraction. I would recommend this book to anyone who has a passion for physics and/or understanding physical reality more deeply. Though many will set this book down with more questions than when they started, readers will without a doubt (assuming the willingness to endure the initial struggle each and every theory presented demands) achieve a greater understanding of the underpinning of quantum theory, and the incredible and revolutionary advances made by the likes of Planck, Bohr, Dirac, Pauli, De-Broglie, Fermi, Heisenberg, Einstein, and many others during the wonderfully prolific decades of 1900 - 1930. These physicists, their theories, and magnificent conceptions are  the giants  whose shoulders all modern quantum theories, theorists, and experimentalists stand."

It mentions actual equations (fairly easy ones), which can be incredibly hard to find in a book aimed at general audiences/pleasure reading, but if those aren't to your taste there is plenty of equation-free material and it is easy enough to skim read over the equation bits. I always appreciate a book that doesn't assume the reader is a moron but doesn't take 10 pages to get to the damn point or swim in highly technical language either, and because of this if you have read other popular physics books this one will almost certainly have different material for you to enjoy.

Planck: There is an equal partition theorem derived from Newtonian mechanics: in a large number of particles, the energy will be shared equally on average. (Energy is equal. Larger particles will thus be slower.) The resulting distribution of energy vs particle number is later derived by Boltzmann. The distribution of EM radiation from black body is qualitatively similar and can be explained if radiation frequency is not continuous but discrete. Planck postulated this discreteness and got the constant named after him.	2. Bohr: the classic principle of least action states that particle from A to B the total action (energy x time) is smallest or largest of all trajectory. This is adapted to say the action of the electron going through its orbit in a complete cycle (m*v*2πr) must be integer multiple of h. This explains the atomic radiation spectra. 	3. Pauli developed the exclusion principle. He also speculated on neutrino which he calls neutron. Fermi later gave the diminutive to Pauli’s neutron because it’s not massive. They are so elusive that to filter out half of neutrinos requires light-years thick of iron!	4. De Broglie. The wave theory of light can show that in total internal reflection, the light actually goes out of the glass, which can be verified by placing another glass several wavelengths away and see the light. De Broglie extends this to particles and considers them having a “pilot wave”. The same effect happens and particles can now get over energy barriers classical mechanics won’t allow them to.	5.

I had a good laugh when reading about Pauli's very funny third principle of things breaking down in laboratories in the presence of theoretical physicists. When a scientist's experiment went wrong, he wrote a letter to Pauli. Pauli wrote back that he was in the train at that time and the train had a brief halt at the station in the city where the experiment was being conducted, suggesting the failure of experiment due to his presence in the city station at that time.

Although this book was first published in 1966 (nearly 50 years ago), no new developments have been made in quantum physics since that time. While that can be disheartening, it also makes this old book surprisingly relevant.Gamow's ability to explain difficult physical concepts is well-known from his stories about Mr. Thompkins. However, this book explains the concepts without the child-like aspects, and focuses on important figures in quantum physics.The Faust play at the end is entertaining for physics enthusiasts, even if it is somewhat lacking as a play overall. But Gamow was not the playwright, and decided to just add it for entertainment purposes at the end, so I cannot criticize him for that.The only criticism I could give is that there should have been a separate chapter on Erwin Schrödinger, as well as a second chapter on Richard Feynman.Overall, this is a book worth reading for those that have an interest in quantum physics."

I am one of the people in favor of making education entertaining, but others in the group believe equally strongly in the principle of no pain, no gain.I'm pleased to see here that the late George Gamow is a firm upholder of the contrary principle. Forget French conversation: everything, including quantum mechanics, can be presented in a way that is at the same time hilariously amusing and very instructive! He does a splendid job of walking you through the early decades of the quantum revolution, cleverly mixing anecdotes about his old friends (Bohr, Pauli, Dirac and others) with some quite sensible physics. At the end, I had learned several interesting things I hadn't known before. For example, I'd read a couple of weeks ago in Pais's biography of Einstein that Bohr had been able to derive the Rydberg constant from first principles but not understood how it was done; Gamow's explanation was both easy to follow and reasonably mathematical. All the same, it's hard not to give preference to the anecdotes. I think my favorite was the following one about Dirac:Dirac was notoriously shy with women, so his colleagues were surprised when they discovered that he had married the sister of Eugene Wigner, another famous physicist. In those pre-internet days, gossip got around more slowly. A visitor, who hadn't yet heard the news, turned up at Dirac's house one day and could hardly believe his eyes when he saw an attractive woman sitting comfortably on the living-room sofa, obviously behaving as though she was very much at home there.""I'm sorry,"" stammered Dirac, ""I should introduce you. This... this is Wigner's sister."""

152,048624895X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85723871-thomas-dietert,5,"Given a recent revelation that I know virtually nothing about how (or what) physical reality is comprised (of) at a most fundamental level and my subsequent pursuit of acquiring such conceptions, before reading this book I had read a series of pop-sci books on the nature of quantum physics, particle physics, quantum electro-dynamics, and the like. Most of the books in that series presented substantial historical context, high-level overviews, and a web of explicit and implicit interconnections between the discoveries and formalizations of such ubiquitous and fundamental notions about how physical reality ""works"" at quantum (indivisibly small) scale. None of these books provided me the insight that I obtained into the inner-workings of such theories as this book did, and I am so glad that I decided to read ""Thirty Years that Shook Physics"" when I did-- lest I wallow in the characteristic hand-wavingly vague, confounding, and imprecise explanations of such theories presented by most of modern pop-sci publications.In this brilliant work, George Gamow presents a linear, historical narrative and exposition of the inception of, elaboration upon, and impact of the aforementioned theories on the field of physics in the early 20th century, supported with insightfully clear figures, diagrams and drawings, and (most notably) the precise mathematical underpinnings that necessarily serve as the foundation for building a more coherent and intuitive conception of the theories at a high level. Furthermore, since Gamow participated in this revolutionary trio of decades as a seminal contributor and prolific collaborator, the book is peppered with amiable and cheerful anecdotes that permit unique insight into the lives, personalities, and blatant humanity of the physicists who revolutionized our understanding of the quantum.A few of my most favorite ideas presented in the book are as follows:  Max Planck  postulated that light must be quantized due to an inaccurate conclusion of a thermodynamical thought experiment (The Jeans Cube) suggesting that, if the Equipartition Principle holds true for light (as it does for gas) and if frequencies of light waves are infinite such that the total energy of a closed system of electromagnetic waves should be distributed across these infinite frequencies, then (put simply) your fireplace hearth would readily explode with the violence of the hottest star soon after you ignited the logs. Since this obviously is not the case in reality, Planck postulated that the energy able to be stored in electro-magnetic waves must decrease inversely with respect to frequency, and that the amount of energy contained by the wavr  must  be an integer multiple of the (subsequently computed) Planck constant. Wolfgang Pauli  formulated the Pauli Exclusion principle which, in its full form, is a bit more interesting than the usual form taught in University level Chemistry courses. The full extent of the principle counters the notion that ""two electrons share a single atomic orbit"" (originally quantified by Sommerfeld with three parameters) is not completely accurate: Instead, a fourth quantum number is needed to characterize the orbits precisely, known as an electron's ""spin"", and that only two electrons can share the same orbit only if they have opposite spin. Furthermore, since electrons can be thought of like a very tiny negatively charged particle spinning on an axis, the magnetic moment produced by these oppositely spinning electrons make it so that the pair of electrons with opposite spin that share an orbit described the original 3 quantum numbers do not actually share the same orbit at all-- the magnetic moment produced by each electron will repel the other, shifting the orbits enough for it to be incorrect to say that the two electrons have the same orbit! George Gamow  found that it is not only electrons that abide by the more precise interpretation of the Pauli principle (that is, that electrons have atomic spin, that only two can ""share"" an orbit, and that they exist in a structured form on different ""energy levels"" [particle interpretation] or ""atomic shells"" [wave interpretation]), but that both protons and neutrons also have atomic spin, and that the structure of the atomic nucleus can also be described by protons and neutrons existing on differing, structured energy levels (or ""nuclear shells""). That is to say that neutrons and protons each have their own nuclear shells overlaid upon one another, and that there are a certain number of each particle permitted on each level such that the nucleus remains stable. Werner Heisengberg  presented a clear and ingenious thought experiment that serves as the foundation of the famous  Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle , yielding the undeniable conclusion that we cannot discover both the velocity and position of a particle with a single classically mechanical measurement (due to interesting qualities of both the mechanism of interaction between the particle and the photon performing the measurement, and the physical limitations of the measurement of the measuring photon by the theodolite). Gamow does a wonderful job illustrating this thought experiment through a full page diagram and lucid derivation from assumptions to conclusions. Instead of doing a poor job of summarizing it here, I will point the interested reader to Fig. 24 on page 108, and the section in which it resides called ""Discarding Classical Linear Trajectories"".There are many more theories and conceptions presented within these pages that, for lack of better terms,  blew my mind , but in the interest of brevity I elect to not include any more of these incredible insights but to instead reiterate the point that Gamow fills this text to the brim with approachable yet dense expositions of these revolutionary ideas and theories of quantum physics conceived throughout the duration of the thirty-year quantum spring, and it is a truly exciting and deeply humbling experience to read from cover to cover. It is most certainly the mathematics of these quantum theories-- which Gamow readily demonstrates for virtually every theory presented in depth-- that I developed such a strong appreciation for this book. That being said, to read this book is not an easy venture and the process demands focus and attention from the reader in order to extract the entirety of the value it provides. Though this book is purported to be a ""lucid layman's introduction to quantum theory"", it is difficult to appreciate many of the mathematics presented without some non-trivial existing conceptions of classical physics such as kinetic and potential energies, rotational motion, Coulomb's law, and the mental agility to follow algebraic reformulations and substitutions of terms in equations performed on most every formula derivation (for brevity, I assume). Admittedly, many of the chapters of the book required my unfaltering attention in addition to multiple traversals over the content in a somewhat staggered manner. I often read each section twice by default, thrice usually, repeatedly consulted previous chapters when I inevitably discovered my conception of aforementioned theories was lacking, and often chose to re-read sections I had read the previous day as a review before starting on the next section. Many of the topics covered-- such as pilot waves, anti-particles, radioactive decay (via weak-nuclear force), and mesons (strong nuclear force)-- we're still just out of my reach, even after substantial effort. I say all this to suggest that this book is not for leisure reading, and if a reader approaches it as such (without sufficient background in quantum physics foundations) they will be almost certain to not appreciate its contents. I picked up this book to get a stronger mathematical conception of the fundamental theories of quantum physics and that is what it delivered, but not without significant effort on my part; succinctly put, this is a ""morning book"".In conclusion, Gamow's ""Thirty Years that Shook Physics"" is a remarkably eloquent book illustrating the foundational conceptions of seminal quantum theorists and their theories, at both the high-level and mathematical levels of abstraction. I would recommend this book to anyone who has a passion for physics and/or understanding physical reality more deeply. Though many will set this book down with more questions than when they started, readers will without a doubt (assuming the willingness to endure the initial struggle each and every theory presented demands) achieve a greater understanding of the underpinning of quantum theory, and the incredible and revolutionary advances made by the likes of Planck, Bohr, Dirac, Pauli, De-Broglie, Fermi, Heisenberg, Einstein, and many others during the wonderfully prolific decades of 1900 - 1930. These physicists, their theories, and magnificent conceptions are  the giants  whose shoulders all modern quantum theories, theorists, and experimentalists stand."

It mentions actual equations (fairly easy ones), which can be incredibly hard to find in a book aimed at general audiences/pleasure reading, but if those aren't to your taste there is plenty of equation-free material and it is easy enough to skim read over the equation bits. I always appreciate a book that doesn't assume the reader is a moron but doesn't take 10 pages to get to the damn point or swim in highly technical language either, and because of this if you have read other popular physics books this one will almost certainly have different material for you to enjoy.

For anyone trying to understand some of the most important ideas in the recent history of science, this book provides a fairly accessible introduction containing only a small amount of mathematics. Recommended for those studying physics as well as those interested in the history of science."
156,048624895X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11375563-michael-huang,5,"Discussed the 30 years of fast advancement of quantum theory, with some equations and quite a bit of human stories of the scientists. 	1. Planck: There is an equal partition theorem derived from Newtonian mechanics: in a large number of particles, the energy will be shared equally on average. (Energy is equal. Larger particles will thus be slower.) The resulting distribution of energy vs particle number is later derived by Boltzmann. The distribution of EM radiation from black body is qualitatively similar and can be explained if radiation frequency is not continuous but discrete. Planck postulated this discreteness and got the constant named after him.	2. Bohr: the classic principle of least action states that particle from A to B the total action (energy x time) is smallest or largest of all trajectory. This is adapted to say the action of the electron going through its orbit in a complete cycle (m*v*2πr) must be integer multiple of h. This explains the atomic radiation spectra. 	3. Pauli developed the exclusion principle. He also speculated on neutrino which he calls neutron. Fermi later gave the diminutive to Pauli’s neutron because it’s not massive. They are so elusive that to filter out half of neutrinos requires light-years thick of iron!	4. De Broglie. The wave theory of light can show that in total internal reflection, the light actually goes out of the glass, which can be verified by placing another glass several wavelengths away and see the light. De Broglie extends this to particles and considers them having a “pilot wave”. The same effect happens and particles can now get over energy barriers classical mechanics won’t allow them to.	5. Heisenberg. There is a nice explanation of the uncertainty principle. Classic trajectories are idealized lines with no width. Measurement of atomic particles (think cloud chamber) gives a trajectory a width. The minimum width is determined by the uncertainty principle. And the wave function also gives the predicted trajectory a width.	6. Dirac: So far, quantum theory is incompatible with relativity. With relativity, if you multiply time (ict) it is indistinguishable from another space dimension. Yet in Schrodinger’s equation, there is asymmetry as the spatial dimensions have 2nd order derivatives and the time 1st order. There were efforts to bring time to 2nd order and didn’t work. Dirac tried to make the spatial dimension’s derivative 1st order. In so doing, the math allowed for antiparticles which explained cosmic ray observations. 	7. Fermi: in explaining beta emission, Fermi made the simplest assumption that probability is proportional to all participating component’s wave function at a particular point. This agrees with observation and now allows all kinds of particle transformations. 	8. Yukawa: the strong nuclear interaction is effective only when neucleons come in close contact (about 10^-18cm). Once this happens, breaking the bond takes ~10Mev. Initial attempt to explain this is with electrons exchanging between atomic shells and the math of “exchange force” was created. But it didn’t work for electrons. Yukawa calculated that it takes a particle 207 more massive to do it. This is dubbed meson in the end. Later it was discovered that there are two types of meson, a pi type and a mu type (pion and muon).What I like most about Gamow’s book (beyond that it’s clear and to the point) is that he’s not shy of using equations, which is so much clearer."

Later, Niels Bohr applied the same thinking to atomic structure.George Gamow was a Russian physicist and contemporary of many of the famous physicists in this book.

Bohr, W. Pauli , De Broglie, W.Heisenberg, Dirac, Fermi and Yukawa in the development of quantum physics. If you want to learn about quantum physics, this book will help you learn the basics about it, and at times it is is funny too when it describes some of the incidents related to these scientists. I had a good laugh when reading about Pauli's very funny third principle of things breaking down in laboratories in the presence of theoretical physicists. When a scientist's experiment went wrong, he wrote a letter to Pauli. Pauli wrote back that he was in the train at that time and the train had a brief halt at the station in the city where the experiment was being conducted, suggesting the failure of experiment due to his presence in the city station at that time. Really good humor !"

Although this book was first published in 1966 (nearly 50 years ago), no new developments have been made in quantum physics since that time. While that can be disheartening, it also makes this old book surprisingly relevant.Gamow's ability to explain difficult physical concepts is well-known from his stories about Mr. Thompkins. However, this book explains the concepts without the child-like aspects, and focuses on important figures in quantum physics.The Faust play at the end is entertaining for physics enthusiasts, even if it is somewhat lacking as a play overall. But Gamow was not the playwright, and decided to just add it for entertainment purposes at the end, so I cannot criticize him for that.The only criticism I could give is that there should have been a separate chapter on Erwin Schrödinger, as well as a second chapter on Richard Feynman.Overall, this is a book worth reading for those that have an interest in quantum physics."

180,048624895X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,4,"One of my current projects is about using speech recognition to build educational software, and there is a long-running discussion in our group about whether learning should be fun (for more background, see this review). I am one of the people in favor of making education entertaining, but others in the group believe equally strongly in the principle of no pain, no gain.I'm pleased to see here that the late George Gamow is a firm upholder of the contrary principle. Forget French conversation: everything, including quantum mechanics, can be presented in a way that is at the same time hilariously amusing and very instructive! He does a splendid job of walking you through the early decades of the quantum revolution, cleverly mixing anecdotes about his old friends (Bohr, Pauli, Dirac and others) with some quite sensible physics. At the end, I had learned several interesting things I hadn't known before. For example, I'd read a couple of weeks ago in Pais's biography of Einstein that Bohr had been able to derive the Rydberg constant from first principles but not understood how it was done; Gamow's explanation was both easy to follow and reasonably mathematical. All the same, it's hard not to give preference to the anecdotes. I think my favorite was the following one about Dirac:Dirac was notoriously shy with women, so his colleagues were surprised when they discovered that he had married the sister of Eugene Wigner, another famous physicist. In those pre-internet days, gossip got around more slowly. A visitor, who hadn't yet heard the news, turned up at Dirac's house one day and could hardly believe his eyes when he saw an attractive woman sitting comfortably on the living-room sofa, obviously behaving as though she was very much at home there.""I'm sorry,"" stammered Dirac, ""I should introduce you. This... this is Wigner's sister."""

182,048624895X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85723871-thomas-dietert,5,"Given a recent revelation that I know virtually nothing about how (or what) physical reality is comprised (of) at a most fundamental level and my subsequent pursuit of acquiring such conceptions, before reading this book I had read a series of pop-sci books on the nature of quantum physics, particle physics, quantum electro-dynamics, and the like. Most of the books in that series presented substantial historical context, high-level overviews, and a web of explicit and implicit interconnections between the discoveries and formalizations of such ubiquitous and fundamental notions about how physical reality ""works"" at quantum (indivisibly small) scale. None of these books provided me the insight that I obtained into the inner-workings of such theories as this book did, and I am so glad that I decided to read ""Thirty Years that Shook Physics"" when I did-- lest I wallow in the characteristic hand-wavingly vague, confounding, and imprecise explanations of such theories presented by most of modern pop-sci publications.In this brilliant work, George Gamow presents a linear, historical narrative and exposition of the inception of, elaboration upon, and impact of the aforementioned theories on the field of physics in the early 20th century, supported with insightfully clear figures, diagrams and drawings, and (most notably) the precise mathematical underpinnings that necessarily serve as the foundation for building a more coherent and intuitive conception of the theories at a high level. Furthermore, since Gamow participated in this revolutionary trio of decades as a seminal contributor and prolific collaborator, the book is peppered with amiable and cheerful anecdotes that permit unique insight into the lives, personalities, and blatant humanity of the physicists who revolutionized our understanding of the quantum.A few of my most favorite ideas presented in the book are as follows:  Max Planck  postulated that light must be quantized due to an inaccurate conclusion of a thermodynamical thought experiment (The Jeans Cube) suggesting that, if the Equipartition Principle holds true for light (as it does for gas) and if frequencies of light waves are infinite such that the total energy of a closed system of electromagnetic waves should be distributed across these infinite frequencies, then (put simply) your fireplace hearth would readily explode with the violence of the hottest star soon after you ignited the logs. Since this obviously is not the case in reality, Planck postulated that the energy able to be stored in electro-magnetic waves must decrease inversely with respect to frequency, and that the amount of energy contained by the wavr  must  be an integer multiple of the (subsequently computed) Planck constant. Wolfgang Pauli  formulated the Pauli Exclusion principle which, in its full form, is a bit more interesting than the usual form taught in University level Chemistry courses. The full extent of the principle counters the notion that ""two electrons share a single atomic orbit"" (originally quantified by Sommerfeld with three parameters) is not completely accurate: Instead, a fourth quantum number is needed to characterize the orbits precisely, known as an electron's ""spin"", and that only two electrons can share the same orbit only if they have opposite spin. Furthermore, since electrons can be thought of like a very tiny negatively charged particle spinning on an axis, the magnetic moment produced by these oppositely spinning electrons make it so that the pair of electrons with opposite spin that share an orbit described the original 3 quantum numbers do not actually share the same orbit at all-- the magnetic moment produced by each electron will repel the other, shifting the orbits enough for it to be incorrect to say that the two electrons have the same orbit! George Gamow  found that it is not only electrons that abide by the more precise interpretation of the Pauli principle (that is, that electrons have atomic spin, that only two can ""share"" an orbit, and that they exist in a structured form on different ""energy levels"" [particle interpretation] or ""atomic shells"" [wave interpretation]), but that both protons and neutrons also have atomic spin, and that the structure of the atomic nucleus can also be described by protons and neutrons existing on differing, structured energy levels (or ""nuclear shells""). That is to say that neutrons and protons each have their own nuclear shells overlaid upon one another, and that there are a certain number of each particle permitted on each level such that the nucleus remains stable. Werner Heisengberg  presented a clear and ingenious thought experiment that serves as the foundation of the famous  Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle , yielding the undeniable conclusion that we cannot discover both the velocity and position of a particle with a single classically mechanical measurement (due to interesting qualities of both the mechanism of interaction between the particle and the photon performing the measurement, and the physical limitations of the measurement of the measuring photon by the theodolite). Gamow does a wonderful job illustrating this thought experiment through a full page diagram and lucid derivation from assumptions to conclusions. Instead of doing a poor job of summarizing it here, I will point the interested reader to Fig. 24 on page 108, and the section in which it resides called ""Discarding Classical Linear Trajectories"".There are many more theories and conceptions presented within these pages that, for lack of better terms,  blew my mind , but in the interest of brevity I elect to not include any more of these incredible insights but to instead reiterate the point that Gamow fills this text to the brim with approachable yet dense expositions of these revolutionary ideas and theories of quantum physics conceived throughout the duration of the thirty-year quantum spring, and it is a truly exciting and deeply humbling experience to read from cover to cover. It is most certainly the mathematics of these quantum theories-- which Gamow readily demonstrates for virtually every theory presented in depth-- that I developed such a strong appreciation for this book. That being said, to read this book is not an easy venture and the process demands focus and attention from the reader in order to extract the entirety of the value it provides. Though this book is purported to be a ""lucid layman's introduction to quantum theory"", it is difficult to appreciate many of the mathematics presented without some non-trivial existing conceptions of classical physics such as kinetic and potential energies, rotational motion, Coulomb's law, and the mental agility to follow algebraic reformulations and substitutions of terms in equations performed on most every formula derivation (for brevity, I assume). Admittedly, many of the chapters of the book required my unfaltering attention in addition to multiple traversals over the content in a somewhat staggered manner. I often read each section twice by default, thrice usually, repeatedly consulted previous chapters when I inevitably discovered my conception of aforementioned theories was lacking, and often chose to re-read sections I had read the previous day as a review before starting on the next section. Many of the topics covered-- such as pilot waves, anti-particles, radioactive decay (via weak-nuclear force), and mesons (strong nuclear force)-- we're still just out of my reach, even after substantial effort. I say all this to suggest that this book is not for leisure reading, and if a reader approaches it as such (without sufficient background in quantum physics foundations) they will be almost certain to not appreciate its contents. I picked up this book to get a stronger mathematical conception of the fundamental theories of quantum physics and that is what it delivered, but not without significant effort on my part; succinctly put, this is a ""morning book"".In conclusion, Gamow's ""Thirty Years that Shook Physics"" is a remarkably eloquent book illustrating the foundational conceptions of seminal quantum theorists and their theories, at both the high-level and mathematical levels of abstraction. I would recommend this book to anyone who has a passion for physics and/or understanding physical reality more deeply. Though many will set this book down with more questions than when they started, readers will without a doubt (assuming the willingness to endure the initial struggle each and every theory presented demands) achieve a greater understanding of the underpinning of quantum theory, and the incredible and revolutionary advances made by the likes of Planck, Bohr, Dirac, Pauli, De-Broglie, Fermi, Heisenberg, Einstein, and many others during the wonderfully prolific decades of 1900 - 1930. These physicists, their theories, and magnificent conceptions are  the giants  whose shoulders all modern quantum theories, theorists, and experimentalists stand."

Good to remember the actual name for search engines or when doing book recs, yes?Anyway, this is a great book that does not talk down to you. It mentions actual equations (fairly easy ones), which can be incredibly hard to find in a book aimed at general audiences/pleasure reading, but if those aren't to your taste there is plenty of equation-free material and it is easy enough to skim read over the equation bits. I always appreciate a book that doesn't assume the reader is a moron but doesn't take 10 pages to get to the damn point or swim in highly technical language either, and because of this if you have read other popular physics books this one will almost certainly have different material for you to enjoy.

It is a history of early 20th-century physics organized around some of the major contributing scientists.With personal knowledge of the physicists involved, Gamow is able to share not only the physics (in simple terms) but also the atmosphere of the time.For physicists, immersed in mathematical theories, who can no longer see the forest for the trees, this book gives a quick overview of the beginnings of quantum theory. For anyone trying to understand some of the most important ideas in the recent history of science, this book provides a fairly accessible introduction containing only a small amount of mathematics. Recommended for those studying physics as well as those interested in the history of science."
186,048624895X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11375563-michael-huang,5,"Discussed the 30 years of fast advancement of quantum theory, with some equations and quite a bit of human stories of the scientists. 	1. Planck: There is an equal partition theorem derived from Newtonian mechanics: in a large number of particles, the energy will be shared equally on average. (Energy is equal. Larger particles will thus be slower.) The resulting distribution of energy vs particle number is later derived by Boltzmann. The distribution of EM radiation from black body is qualitatively similar and can be explained if radiation frequency is not continuous but discrete. Planck postulated this discreteness and got the constant named after him.	2. Bohr: the classic principle of least action states that particle from A to B the total action (energy x time) is smallest or largest of all trajectory. This is adapted to say the action of the electron going through its orbit in a complete cycle (m*v*2πr) must be integer multiple of h. This explains the atomic radiation spectra. 	3. Pauli developed the exclusion principle. He also speculated on neutrino which he calls neutron. Fermi later gave the diminutive to Pauli’s neutron because it’s not massive. They are so elusive that to filter out half of neutrinos requires light-years thick of iron!	4. De Broglie. The wave theory of light can show that in total internal reflection, the light actually goes out of the glass, which can be verified by placing another glass several wavelengths away and see the light. De Broglie extends this to particles and considers them having a “pilot wave”. The same effect happens and particles can now get over energy barriers classical mechanics won’t allow them to.	5. Heisenberg. There is a nice explanation of the uncertainty principle. Classic trajectories are idealized lines with no width. Measurement of atomic particles (think cloud chamber) gives a trajectory a width. The minimum width is determined by the uncertainty principle. And the wave function also gives the predicted trajectory a width.	6. Dirac: So far, quantum theory is incompatible with relativity. With relativity, if you multiply time (ict) it is indistinguishable from another space dimension. Yet in Schrodinger’s equation, there is asymmetry as the spatial dimensions have 2nd order derivatives and the time 1st order. There were efforts to bring time to 2nd order and didn’t work. Dirac tried to make the spatial dimension’s derivative 1st order. In so doing, the math allowed for antiparticles which explained cosmic ray observations. 	7. Fermi: in explaining beta emission, Fermi made the simplest assumption that probability is proportional to all participating component’s wave function at a particular point. This agrees with observation and now allows all kinds of particle transformations. 	8. Yukawa: the strong nuclear interaction is effective only when neucleons come in close contact (about 10^-18cm). Once this happens, breaking the bond takes ~10Mev. Initial attempt to explain this is with electrons exchanging between atomic shells and the math of “exchange force” was created. But it didn’t work for electrons. Yukawa calculated that it takes a particle 207 more massive to do it. This is dubbed meson in the end. Later it was discovered that there are two types of meson, a pi type and a mu type (pion and muon).What I like most about Gamow’s book (beyond that it’s clear and to the point) is that he’s not shy of using equations, which is so much clearer."

I just wasn't cut out to be like the physicists George Gamow writes about at the turn of the century that turned classical physics on its head.Though some people say this book is directed at laymen, you really should have some physics background to appreciate it. It starts with the ultraviolet catastrophe prediction which led to the rethinking light as photons and ultimately the birth of quantum mechanics. Later, Niels Bohr applied the same thinking to atomic structure.George Gamow was a Russian physicist and contemporary of many of the famous physicists in this book. He offers up a lot of the history of the science, as well as humorous anecdotes of those involved firsthand at the revolution in physics that occurred at the beginning of the twentieth century.Do yourself a favor and only get the version that includes the 1932 parody of ""Faust"" if you read this book.I cannot recommend it to non-physicists, but this is my second time reading this book and I find not only quantum mechanics fascinating, but George Gamow's matter-of-fact way of describing the problems and how those scientists came up with their radical ideas to model what we observe in nature."

While I enjoyed this book, and found the history fascinating, there was a lot that went over my head. The book is chock full of formulas, equations, and phrases that run something akin to, ""I don't have space in this book to explain this specific theory, so I am going to assume you already have a functional knowledge of it."" This isn't me complaining; I still enjoyed the book and went into it well aware that I would not understand everything inside of it. I just say this as a warning to anyone else considering reading it. The writing style of the author was incredibly endearing. I really enjoyed looking at history through the eyes of someone who is not a historian by trade. The anecdotes he shared about the scientists--his friends and people he knew well--were funny and to the point, and showed a side of the scientist that I had rarely seen. There was no skimping on the science however! Gamow still dealt carefully with all of the specific discoveries that were made during these thirty years, and in a technical way. Even though I didn't understand all the specifics, I still felt at the end of it that I had a half-way decent grasp on what kind of a change had occurred during the 30 years he talks about.

The book also offers a relatively easy to understand fundemental principles of the quantum theory that broke every basic classical notion of space, time, and motion that were well established and subject to common sense. Just like how earth was flat to ancient people but certainly not to Magellan. Just like how theory of relativity showed that at very high velocities and very large distances things do not behave as ""they should have"".

I am one of the people in favor of making education entertaining, but others in the group believe equally strongly in the principle of no pain, no gain.I'm pleased to see here that the late George Gamow is a firm upholder of the contrary principle. Forget French conversation: everything, including quantum mechanics, can be presented in a way that is at the same time hilariously amusing and very instructive! He does a splendid job of walking you through the early decades of the quantum revolution, cleverly mixing anecdotes about his old friends (Bohr, Pauli, Dirac and others) with some quite sensible physics. At the end, I had learned several interesting things I hadn't known before. For example, I'd read a couple of weeks ago in Pais's biography of Einstein that Bohr had been able to derive the Rydberg constant from first principles but not understood how it was done; Gamow's explanation was both easy to follow and reasonably mathematical. All the same, it's hard not to give preference to the anecdotes. I think my favorite was the following one about Dirac:Dirac was notoriously shy with women, so his colleagues were surprised when they discovered that he had married the sister of Eugene Wigner, another famous physicist. In those pre-internet days, gossip got around more slowly. A visitor, who hadn't yet heard the news, turned up at Dirac's house one day and could hardly believe his eyes when he saw an attractive woman sitting comfortably on the living-room sofa, obviously behaving as though she was very much at home there.""I'm sorry,"" stammered Dirac, ""I should introduce you. This... this is Wigner's sister."""

212,048624895X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85723871-thomas-dietert,5,"Given a recent revelation that I know virtually nothing about how (or what) physical reality is comprised (of) at a most fundamental level and my subsequent pursuit of acquiring such conceptions, before reading this book I had read a series of pop-sci books on the nature of quantum physics, particle physics, quantum electro-dynamics, and the like. Most of the books in that series presented substantial historical context, high-level overviews, and a web of explicit and implicit interconnections between the discoveries and formalizations of such ubiquitous and fundamental notions about how physical reality ""works"" at quantum (indivisibly small) scale. None of these books provided me the insight that I obtained into the inner-workings of such theories as this book did, and I am so glad that I decided to read ""Thirty Years that Shook Physics"" when I did-- lest I wallow in the characteristic hand-wavingly vague, confounding, and imprecise explanations of such theories presented by most of modern pop-sci publications.In this brilliant work, George Gamow presents a linear, historical narrative and exposition of the inception of, elaboration upon, and impact of the aforementioned theories on the field of physics in the early 20th century, supported with insightfully clear figures, diagrams and drawings, and (most notably) the precise mathematical underpinnings that necessarily serve as the foundation for building a more coherent and intuitive conception of the theories at a high level. Furthermore, since Gamow participated in this revolutionary trio of decades as a seminal contributor and prolific collaborator, the book is peppered with amiable and cheerful anecdotes that permit unique insight into the lives, personalities, and blatant humanity of the physicists who revolutionized our understanding of the quantum.A few of my most favorite ideas presented in the book are as follows:  Max Planck  postulated that light must be quantized due to an inaccurate conclusion of a thermodynamical thought experiment (The Jeans Cube) suggesting that, if the Equipartition Principle holds true for light (as it does for gas) and if frequencies of light waves are infinite such that the total energy of a closed system of electromagnetic waves should be distributed across these infinite frequencies, then (put simply) your fireplace hearth would readily explode with the violence of the hottest star soon after you ignited the logs. Since this obviously is not the case in reality, Planck postulated that the energy able to be stored in electro-magnetic waves must decrease inversely with respect to frequency, and that the amount of energy contained by the wavr  must  be an integer multiple of the (subsequently computed) Planck constant. Wolfgang Pauli  formulated the Pauli Exclusion principle which, in its full form, is a bit more interesting than the usual form taught in University level Chemistry courses. The full extent of the principle counters the notion that ""two electrons share a single atomic orbit"" (originally quantified by Sommerfeld with three parameters) is not completely accurate: Instead, a fourth quantum number is needed to characterize the orbits precisely, known as an electron's ""spin"", and that only two electrons can share the same orbit only if they have opposite spin. Furthermore, since electrons can be thought of like a very tiny negatively charged particle spinning on an axis, the magnetic moment produced by these oppositely spinning electrons make it so that the pair of electrons with opposite spin that share an orbit described the original 3 quantum numbers do not actually share the same orbit at all-- the magnetic moment produced by each electron will repel the other, shifting the orbits enough for it to be incorrect to say that the two electrons have the same orbit! George Gamow  found that it is not only electrons that abide by the more precise interpretation of the Pauli principle (that is, that electrons have atomic spin, that only two can ""share"" an orbit, and that they exist in a structured form on different ""energy levels"" [particle interpretation] or ""atomic shells"" [wave interpretation]), but that both protons and neutrons also have atomic spin, and that the structure of the atomic nucleus can also be described by protons and neutrons existing on differing, structured energy levels (or ""nuclear shells""). That is to say that neutrons and protons each have their own nuclear shells overlaid upon one another, and that there are a certain number of each particle permitted on each level such that the nucleus remains stable. Werner Heisengberg  presented a clear and ingenious thought experiment that serves as the foundation of the famous  Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle , yielding the undeniable conclusion that we cannot discover both the velocity and position of a particle with a single classically mechanical measurement (due to interesting qualities of both the mechanism of interaction between the particle and the photon performing the measurement, and the physical limitations of the measurement of the measuring photon by the theodolite). Gamow does a wonderful job illustrating this thought experiment through a full page diagram and lucid derivation from assumptions to conclusions. Instead of doing a poor job of summarizing it here, I will point the interested reader to Fig. 24 on page 108, and the section in which it resides called ""Discarding Classical Linear Trajectories"".There are many more theories and conceptions presented within these pages that, for lack of better terms,  blew my mind , but in the interest of brevity I elect to not include any more of these incredible insights but to instead reiterate the point that Gamow fills this text to the brim with approachable yet dense expositions of these revolutionary ideas and theories of quantum physics conceived throughout the duration of the thirty-year quantum spring, and it is a truly exciting and deeply humbling experience to read from cover to cover. It is most certainly the mathematics of these quantum theories-- which Gamow readily demonstrates for virtually every theory presented in depth-- that I developed such a strong appreciation for this book. That being said, to read this book is not an easy venture and the process demands focus and attention from the reader in order to extract the entirety of the value it provides. Though this book is purported to be a ""lucid layman's introduction to quantum theory"", it is difficult to appreciate many of the mathematics presented without some non-trivial existing conceptions of classical physics such as kinetic and potential energies, rotational motion, Coulomb's law, and the mental agility to follow algebraic reformulations and substitutions of terms in equations performed on most every formula derivation (for brevity, I assume). Admittedly, many of the chapters of the book required my unfaltering attention in addition to multiple traversals over the content in a somewhat staggered manner. I often read each section twice by default, thrice usually, repeatedly consulted previous chapters when I inevitably discovered my conception of aforementioned theories was lacking, and often chose to re-read sections I had read the previous day as a review before starting on the next section. Many of the topics covered-- such as pilot waves, anti-particles, radioactive decay (via weak-nuclear force), and mesons (strong nuclear force)-- we're still just out of my reach, even after substantial effort. I say all this to suggest that this book is not for leisure reading, and if a reader approaches it as such (without sufficient background in quantum physics foundations) they will be almost certain to not appreciate its contents. I picked up this book to get a stronger mathematical conception of the fundamental theories of quantum physics and that is what it delivered, but not without significant effort on my part; succinctly put, this is a ""morning book"".In conclusion, Gamow's ""Thirty Years that Shook Physics"" is a remarkably eloquent book illustrating the foundational conceptions of seminal quantum theorists and their theories, at both the high-level and mathematical levels of abstraction. I would recommend this book to anyone who has a passion for physics and/or understanding physical reality more deeply. Though many will set this book down with more questions than when they started, readers will without a doubt (assuming the willingness to endure the initial struggle each and every theory presented demands) achieve a greater understanding of the underpinning of quantum theory, and the incredible and revolutionary advances made by the likes of Planck, Bohr, Dirac, Pauli, De-Broglie, Fermi, Heisenberg, Einstein, and many others during the wonderfully prolific decades of 1900 - 1930. These physicists, their theories, and magnificent conceptions are  the giants  whose shoulders all modern quantum theories, theorists, and experimentalists stand."

Good to remember the actual name for search engines or when doing book recs, yes?Anyway, this is a great book that does not talk down to you. It mentions actual equations (fairly easy ones), which can be incredibly hard to find in a book aimed at general audiences/pleasure reading, but if those aren't to your taste there is plenty of equation-free material and it is easy enough to skim read over the equation bits. I always appreciate a book that doesn't assume the reader is a moron but doesn't take 10 pages to get to the damn point or swim in highly technical language either, and because of this if you have read other popular physics books this one will almost certainly have different material for you to enjoy.

It is a history of early 20th-century physics organized around some of the major contributing scientists.With personal knowledge of the physicists involved, Gamow is able to share not only the physics (in simple terms) but also the atmosphere of the time.For physicists, immersed in mathematical theories, who can no longer see the forest for the trees, this book gives a quick overview of the beginnings of quantum theory. For anyone trying to understand some of the most important ideas in the recent history of science, this book provides a fairly accessible introduction containing only a small amount of mathematics. Recommended for those studying physics as well as those interested in the history of science."
216,048624895X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11375563-michael-huang,5,"Discussed the 30 years of fast advancement of quantum theory, with some equations and quite a bit of human stories of the scientists. 	1. Planck: There is an equal partition theorem derived from Newtonian mechanics: in a large number of particles, the energy will be shared equally on average. (Energy is equal. Larger particles will thus be slower.) The resulting distribution of energy vs particle number is later derived by Boltzmann. The distribution of EM radiation from black body is qualitatively similar and can be explained if radiation frequency is not continuous but discrete. Planck postulated this discreteness and got the constant named after him.	2. Bohr: the classic principle of least action states that particle from A to B the total action (energy x time) is smallest or largest of all trajectory. This is adapted to say the action of the electron going through its orbit in a complete cycle (m*v*2πr) must be integer multiple of h. This explains the atomic radiation spectra. 	3. Pauli developed the exclusion principle. He also speculated on neutrino which he calls neutron. Fermi later gave the diminutive to Pauli’s neutron because it’s not massive. They are so elusive that to filter out half of neutrinos requires light-years thick of iron!	4. De Broglie. The wave theory of light can show that in total internal reflection, the light actually goes out of the glass, which can be verified by placing another glass several wavelengths away and see the light. De Broglie extends this to particles and considers them having a “pilot wave”. The same effect happens and particles can now get over energy barriers classical mechanics won’t allow them to.	5. Heisenberg. There is a nice explanation of the uncertainty principle. Classic trajectories are idealized lines with no width. Measurement of atomic particles (think cloud chamber) gives a trajectory a width. The minimum width is determined by the uncertainty principle. And the wave function also gives the predicted trajectory a width.	6. Dirac: So far, quantum theory is incompatible with relativity. With relativity, if you multiply time (ict) it is indistinguishable from another space dimension. Yet in Schrodinger’s equation, there is asymmetry as the spatial dimensions have 2nd order derivatives and the time 1st order. There were efforts to bring time to 2nd order and didn’t work. Dirac tried to make the spatial dimension’s derivative 1st order. In so doing, the math allowed for antiparticles which explained cosmic ray observations. 	7. Fermi: in explaining beta emission, Fermi made the simplest assumption that probability is proportional to all participating component’s wave function at a particular point. This agrees with observation and now allows all kinds of particle transformations. 	8. Yukawa: the strong nuclear interaction is effective only when neucleons come in close contact (about 10^-18cm). Once this happens, breaking the bond takes ~10Mev. Initial attempt to explain this is with electrons exchanging between atomic shells and the math of “exchange force” was created. But it didn’t work for electrons. Yukawa calculated that it takes a particle 207 more massive to do it. This is dubbed meson in the end. Later it was discovered that there are two types of meson, a pi type and a mu type (pion and muon).What I like most about Gamow’s book (beyond that it’s clear and to the point) is that he’s not shy of using equations, which is so much clearer."

I just wasn't cut out to be like the physicists George Gamow writes about at the turn of the century that turned classical physics on its head.Though some people say this book is directed at laymen, you really should have some physics background to appreciate it. It starts with the ultraviolet catastrophe prediction which led to the rethinking light as photons and ultimately the birth of quantum mechanics. Later, Niels Bohr applied the same thinking to atomic structure.George Gamow was a Russian physicist and contemporary of many of the famous physicists in this book. He offers up a lot of the history of the science, as well as humorous anecdotes of those involved firsthand at the revolution in physics that occurred at the beginning of the twentieth century.Do yourself a favor and only get the version that includes the 1932 parody of ""Faust"" if you read this book.I cannot recommend it to non-physicists, but this is my second time reading this book and I find not only quantum mechanics fascinating, but George Gamow's matter-of-fact way of describing the problems and how those scientists came up with their radical ideas to model what we observe in nature."

It covers some prominent events between 1900-1930 that shaped the course of modern physics. Besides explaining quantum theory laconically, it also shows the funny sides of some famous physicists.Overall, if you want to know the very basics of quantum theory without being overwhelmed by its complexity, it should be your go-to book."

While I enjoyed this book, and found the history fascinating, there was a lot that went over my head. The book is chock full of formulas, equations, and phrases that run something akin to, ""I don't have space in this book to explain this specific theory, so I am going to assume you already have a functional knowledge of it."" This isn't me complaining; I still enjoyed the book and went into it well aware that I would not understand everything inside of it. I just say this as a warning to anyone else considering reading it. The writing style of the author was incredibly endearing. I really enjoyed looking at history through the eyes of someone who is not a historian by trade. The anecdotes he shared about the scientists--his friends and people he knew well--were funny and to the point, and showed a side of the scientist that I had rarely seen. There was no skimping on the science however! Gamow still dealt carefully with all of the specific discoveries that were made during these thirty years, and in a technical way. Even though I didn't understand all the specifics, I still felt at the end of it that I had a half-way decent grasp on what kind of a change had occurred during the 30 years he talks about. It was a good read, and I recommend it!"

So I was really curious but a little bit anxious to read about the subject. However this turned out to be a fascinating journey through stories about some of science rock stars who revolutionized physics in the early 20th century. Here you find bits and pieces of their personalities and their scientific achievements. The book also offers a relatively easy to understand fundemental principles of the quantum theory that broke every basic classical notion of space, time, and motion that were well established and subject to common sense. Just like how earth was flat to ancient people but certainly not to Magellan. Just like how theory of relativity showed that at very high velocities and very large distances things do not behave as ""they should have"". Quantum physics takes you to to the scale electrons neutrons protons and neutrinos. And shows you how things really work. Absolutely loved this book and will definently come back to it again.

Bohr, W. Pauli , De Broglie, W.Heisenberg, Dirac, Fermi and Yukawa in the development of quantum physics. If you want to learn about quantum physics, this book will help you learn the basics about it, and at times it is is funny too when it describes some of the incidents related to these scientists. I had a good laugh when reading about Pauli's very funny third principle of things breaking down in laboratories in the presence of theoretical physicists. When a scientist's experiment went wrong, he wrote a letter to Pauli. Pauli wrote back that he was in the train at that time and the train had a brief halt at the station in the city where the experiment was being conducted, suggesting the failure of experiment due to his presence in the city station at that time.

Although this book was first published in 1966 (nearly 50 years ago), no new developments have been made in quantum physics since that time. While that can be disheartening, it also makes this old book surprisingly relevant.Gamow's ability to explain difficult physical concepts is well-known from his stories about Mr. Thompkins. However, this book explains the concepts without the child-like aspects, and focuses on important figures in quantum physics.The Faust play at the end is entertaining for physics enthusiasts, even if it is somewhat lacking as a play overall. But Gamow was not the playwright, and decided to just add it for entertainment purposes at the end, so I cannot criticize him for that.The only criticism I could give is that there should have been a separate chapter on Erwin Schrödinger, as well as a second chapter on Richard Feynman.Overall, this is a book worth reading for those that have an interest in quantum physics."

I can't claim to understand everything that was discussed in this book, but I do now have some understanding of why Schrodinger and Heisenberg came up with different methods but identical conclusions on wave mechanics of particle motion.

I am one of the people in favor of making education entertaining, but others in the group believe equally strongly in the principle of no pain, no gain.I'm pleased to see here that the late George Gamow is a firm upholder of the contrary principle. Forget French conversation: everything, including quantum mechanics, can be presented in a way that is at the same time hilariously amusing and very instructive! He does a splendid job of walking you through the early decades of the quantum revolution, cleverly mixing anecdotes about his old friends (Bohr, Pauli, Dirac and others) with some quite sensible physics. At the end, I had learned several interesting things I hadn't known before. For example, I'd read a couple of weeks ago in Pais's biography of Einstein that Bohr had been able to derive the Rydberg constant from first principles but not understood how it was done; Gamow's explanation was both easy to follow and reasonably mathematical. All the same, it's hard not to give preference to the anecdotes. I think my favorite was the following one about Dirac:Dirac was notoriously shy with women, so his colleagues were surprised when they discovered that he had married the sister of Eugene Wigner, another famous physicist. In those pre-internet days, gossip got around more slowly. A visitor, who hadn't yet heard the news, turned up at Dirac's house one day and could hardly believe his eyes when he saw an attractive woman sitting comfortably on the living-room sofa, obviously behaving as though she was very much at home there.""I'm sorry,"" stammered Dirac, ""I should introduce you.

242,048624895X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85723871-thomas-dietert,5,"Given a recent revelation that I know virtually nothing about how (or what) physical reality is comprised (of) at a most fundamental level and my subsequent pursuit of acquiring such conceptions, before reading this book I had read a series of pop-sci books on the nature of quantum physics, particle physics, quantum electro-dynamics, and the like. Most of the books in that series presented substantial historical context, high-level overviews, and a web of explicit and implicit interconnections between the discoveries and formalizations of such ubiquitous and fundamental notions about how physical reality ""works"" at quantum (indivisibly small) scale. None of these books provided me the insight that I obtained into the inner-workings of such theories as this book did, and I am so glad that I decided to read ""Thirty Years that Shook Physics"" when I did-- lest I wallow in the characteristic hand-wavingly vague, confounding, and imprecise explanations of such theories presented by most of modern pop-sci publications.In this brilliant work, George Gamow presents a linear, historical narrative and exposition of the inception of, elaboration upon, and impact of the aforementioned theories on the field of physics in the early 20th century, supported with insightfully clear figures, diagrams and drawings, and (most notably) the precise mathematical underpinnings that necessarily serve as the foundation for building a more coherent and intuitive conception of the theories at a high level. Furthermore, since Gamow participated in this revolutionary trio of decades as a seminal contributor and prolific collaborator, the book is peppered with amiable and cheerful anecdotes that permit unique insight into the lives, personalities, and blatant humanity of the physicists who revolutionized our understanding of the quantum.A few of my most favorite ideas presented in the book are as follows:  Max Planck  postulated that light must be quantized due to an inaccurate conclusion of a thermodynamical thought experiment (The Jeans Cube) suggesting that, if the Equipartition Principle holds true for light (as it does for gas) and if frequencies of light waves are infinite such that the total energy of a closed system of electromagnetic waves should be distributed across these infinite frequencies, then (put simply) your fireplace hearth would readily explode with the violence of the hottest star soon after you ignited the logs. Since this obviously is not the case in reality, Planck postulated that the energy able to be stored in electro-magnetic waves must decrease inversely with respect to frequency, and that the amount of energy contained by the wavr  must  be an integer multiple of the (subsequently computed) Planck constant. Wolfgang Pauli  formulated the Pauli Exclusion principle which, in its full form, is a bit more interesting than the usual form taught in University level Chemistry courses. The full extent of the principle counters the notion that ""two electrons share a single atomic orbit"" (originally quantified by Sommerfeld with three parameters) is not completely accurate: Instead, a fourth quantum number is needed to characterize the orbits precisely, known as an electron's ""spin"", and that only two electrons can share the same orbit only if they have opposite spin. Furthermore, since electrons can be thought of like a very tiny negatively charged particle spinning on an axis, the magnetic moment produced by these oppositely spinning electrons make it so that the pair of electrons with opposite spin that share an orbit described the original 3 quantum numbers do not actually share the same orbit at all-- the magnetic moment produced by each electron will repel the other, shifting the orbits enough for it to be incorrect to say that the two electrons have the same orbit! George Gamow  found that it is not only electrons that abide by the more precise interpretation of the Pauli principle (that is, that electrons have atomic spin, that only two can ""share"" an orbit, and that they exist in a structured form on different ""energy levels"" [particle interpretation] or ""atomic shells"" [wave interpretation]), but that both protons and neutrons also have atomic spin, and that the structure of the atomic nucleus can also be described by protons and neutrons existing on differing, structured energy levels (or ""nuclear shells""). That is to say that neutrons and protons each have their own nuclear shells overlaid upon one another, and that there are a certain number of each particle permitted on each level such that the nucleus remains stable. Werner Heisengberg  presented a clear and ingenious thought experiment that serves as the foundation of the famous  Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle , yielding the undeniable conclusion that we cannot discover both the velocity and position of a particle with a single classically mechanical measurement (due to interesting qualities of both the mechanism of interaction between the particle and the photon performing the measurement, and the physical limitations of the measurement of the measuring photon by the theodolite). Gamow does a wonderful job illustrating this thought experiment through a full page diagram and lucid derivation from assumptions to conclusions. Instead of doing a poor job of summarizing it here, I will point the interested reader to Fig. 24 on page 108, and the section in which it resides called ""Discarding Classical Linear Trajectories"".There are many more theories and conceptions presented within these pages that, for lack of better terms,  blew my mind , but in the interest of brevity I elect to not include any more of these incredible insights but to instead reiterate the point that Gamow fills this text to the brim with approachable yet dense expositions of these revolutionary ideas and theories of quantum physics conceived throughout the duration of the thirty-year quantum spring, and it is a truly exciting and deeply humbling experience to read from cover to cover. It is most certainly the mathematics of these quantum theories-- which Gamow readily demonstrates for virtually every theory presented in depth-- that I developed such a strong appreciation for this book. That being said, to read this book is not an easy venture and the process demands focus and attention from the reader in order to extract the entirety of the value it provides. Though this book is purported to be a ""lucid layman's introduction to quantum theory"", it is difficult to appreciate many of the mathematics presented without some non-trivial existing conceptions of classical physics such as kinetic and potential energies, rotational motion, Coulomb's law, and the mental agility to follow algebraic reformulations and substitutions of terms in equations performed on most every formula derivation (for brevity, I assume). Admittedly, many of the chapters of the book required my unfaltering attention in addition to multiple traversals over the content in a somewhat staggered manner. I often read each section twice by default, thrice usually, repeatedly consulted previous chapters when I inevitably discovered my conception of aforementioned theories was lacking, and often chose to re-read sections I had read the previous day as a review before starting on the next section. Many of the topics covered-- such as pilot waves, anti-particles, radioactive decay (via weak-nuclear force), and mesons (strong nuclear force)-- we're still just out of my reach, even after substantial effort. I say all this to suggest that this book is not for leisure reading, and if a reader approaches it as such (without sufficient background in quantum physics foundations) they will be almost certain to not appreciate its contents. I picked up this book to get a stronger mathematical conception of the fundamental theories of quantum physics and that is what it delivered, but not without significant effort on my part; succinctly put, this is a ""morning book"".In conclusion, Gamow's ""Thirty Years that Shook Physics"" is a remarkably eloquent book illustrating the foundational conceptions of seminal quantum theorists and their theories, at both the high-level and mathematical levels of abstraction. I would recommend this book to anyone who has a passion for physics and/or understanding physical reality more deeply. Though many will set this book down with more questions than when they started, readers will without a doubt (assuming the willingness to endure the initial struggle each and every theory presented demands) achieve a greater understanding of the underpinning of quantum theory, and the incredible and revolutionary advances made by the likes of Planck, Bohr, Dirac, Pauli, De-Broglie, Fermi, Heisenberg, Einstein, and many others during the wonderfully prolific decades of 1900 - 1930. These physicists, their theories, and magnificent conceptions are  the giants  whose shoulders all modern quantum theories, theorists, and experimentalists stand."

Good to remember the actual name for search engines or when doing book recs, yes?Anyway, this is a great book that does not talk down to you. It mentions actual equations (fairly easy ones), which can be incredibly hard to find in a book aimed at general audiences/pleasure reading, but if those aren't to your taste there is plenty of equation-free material and it is easy enough to skim read over the equation bits. I always appreciate a book that doesn't assume the reader is a moron but doesn't take 10 pages to get to the damn point or swim in highly technical language either, and because of this if you have read other popular physics books this one will almost certainly have different material for you to enjoy. It has a bit about de Broglie waves as a precursor to Schrodinger's waves that I have yet to see anywhere else."

It is a history of early 20th-century physics organized around some of the major contributing scientists.With personal knowledge of the physicists involved, Gamow is able to share not only the physics (in simple terms) but also the atmosphere of the time.For physicists, immersed in mathematical theories, who can no longer see the forest for the trees, this book gives a quick overview of the beginnings of quantum theory. For anyone trying to understand some of the most important ideas in the recent history of science, this book provides a fairly accessible introduction containing only a small amount of mathematics. Recommended for those studying physics as well as those interested in the history of science."
246,048624895X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11375563-michael-huang,5,"Discussed the 30 years of fast advancement of quantum theory, with some equations and quite a bit of human stories of the scientists. 	1. Planck: There is an equal partition theorem derived from Newtonian mechanics: in a large number of particles, the energy will be shared equally on average. (Energy is equal. Larger particles will thus be slower.) The resulting distribution of energy vs particle number is later derived by Boltzmann. The distribution of EM radiation from black body is qualitatively similar and can be explained if radiation frequency is not continuous but discrete. Planck postulated this discreteness and got the constant named after him.	2. Bohr: the classic principle of least action states that particle from A to B the total action (energy x time) is smallest or largest of all trajectory. This is adapted to say the action of the electron going through its orbit in a complete cycle (m*v*2πr) must be integer multiple of h. This explains the atomic radiation spectra. 	3. Pauli developed the exclusion principle. He also speculated on neutrino which he calls neutron. Fermi later gave the diminutive to Pauli’s neutron because it’s not massive. They are so elusive that to filter out half of neutrinos requires light-years thick of iron!	4. De Broglie. The wave theory of light can show that in total internal reflection, the light actually goes out of the glass, which can be verified by placing another glass several wavelengths away and see the light. De Broglie extends this to particles and considers them having a “pilot wave”. The same effect happens and particles can now get over energy barriers classical mechanics won’t allow them to.	5. Heisenberg. There is a nice explanation of the uncertainty principle. Classic trajectories are idealized lines with no width. Measurement of atomic particles (think cloud chamber) gives a trajectory a width. The minimum width is determined by the uncertainty principle. And the wave function also gives the predicted trajectory a width.	6. Dirac: So far, quantum theory is incompatible with relativity. With relativity, if you multiply time (ict) it is indistinguishable from another space dimension. Yet in Schrodinger’s equation, there is asymmetry as the spatial dimensions have 2nd order derivatives and the time 1st order. There were efforts to bring time to 2nd order and didn’t work. Dirac tried to make the spatial dimension’s derivative 1st order. In so doing, the math allowed for antiparticles which explained cosmic ray observations. 	7. Fermi: in explaining beta emission, Fermi made the simplest assumption that probability is proportional to all participating component’s wave function at a particular point. This agrees with observation and now allows all kinds of particle transformations. 	8. Yukawa: the strong nuclear interaction is effective only when neucleons come in close contact (about 10^-18cm). Once this happens, breaking the bond takes ~10Mev. Initial attempt to explain this is with electrons exchanging between atomic shells and the math of “exchange force” was created. But it didn’t work for electrons. Yukawa calculated that it takes a particle 207 more massive to do it. This is dubbed meson in the end. Later it was discovered that there are two types of meson, a pi type and a mu type (pion and muon).What I like most about Gamow’s book (beyond that it’s clear and to the point) is that he’s not shy of using equations, which is so much clearer."

I just wasn't cut out to be like the physicists George Gamow writes about at the turn of the century that turned classical physics on its head.Though some people say this book is directed at laymen, you really should have some physics background to appreciate it. It starts with the ultraviolet catastrophe prediction which led to the rethinking light as photons and ultimately the birth of quantum mechanics. Later, Niels Bohr applied the same thinking to atomic structure.George Gamow was a Russian physicist and contemporary of many of the famous physicists in this book. He offers up a lot of the history of the science, as well as humorous anecdotes of those involved firsthand at the revolution in physics that occurred at the beginning of the twentieth century.Do yourself a favor and only get the version that includes the 1932 parody of ""Faust"" if you read this book.I cannot recommend it to non-physicists, but this is my second time reading this book and I find not only quantum mechanics fascinating, but George Gamow's matter-of-fact way of describing the problems and how those scientists came up with their radical ideas to model what we observe in nature."

It covers some prominent events between 1900-1930 that shaped the course of modern physics. Besides explaining quantum theory laconically, it also shows the funny sides of some famous physicists.Overall, if you want to know the very basics of quantum theory without being overwhelmed by its complexity, it should be your go-to book."

While I enjoyed this book, and found the history fascinating, there was a lot that went over my head. The book is chock full of formulas, equations, and phrases that run something akin to, ""I don't have space in this book to explain this specific theory, so I am going to assume you already have a functional knowledge of it."" This isn't me complaining; I still enjoyed the book and went into it well aware that I would not understand everything inside of it. I just say this as a warning to anyone else considering reading it. The writing style of the author was incredibly endearing. I really enjoyed looking at history through the eyes of someone who is not a historian by trade. The anecdotes he shared about the scientists--his friends and people he knew well--were funny and to the point, and showed a side of the scientist that I had rarely seen. There was no skimping on the science however! Gamow still dealt carefully with all of the specific discoveries that were made during these thirty years, and in a technical way. Even though I didn't understand all the specifics, I still felt at the end of it that I had a half-way decent grasp on what kind of a change had occurred during the 30 years he talks about. It was a good read, and I recommend it!"

However this turned out to be a fascinating journey through stories about some of science rock stars who revolutionized physics in the early 20th century. Here you find bits and pieces of their personalities and their scientific achievements. The book also offers a relatively easy to understand fundemental principles of the quantum theory that broke every basic classical notion of space, time, and motion that were well established and subject to common sense. Just like how earth was flat to ancient people but certainly not to Magellan. Just like how theory of relativity showed that at very high velocities and very large distances things do not behave as ""they should have"". Quantum physics takes you to to the scale electrons neutrons protons and neutrinos. And shows you how things really work. Absolutely loved this book and will definently come back to it again.

Bohr, W. Pauli , De Broglie, W.Heisenberg, Dirac, Fermi and Yukawa in the development of quantum physics. If you want to learn about quantum physics, this book will help you learn the basics about it, and at times it is is funny too when it describes some of the incidents related to these scientists. I had a good laugh when reading about Pauli's very funny third principle of things breaking down in laboratories in the presence of theoretical physicists. When a scientist's experiment went wrong, he wrote a letter to Pauli. Pauli wrote back that he was in the train at that time and the train had a brief halt at the station in the city where the experiment was being conducted, suggesting the failure of experiment due to his presence in the city station at that time.

Although this book was first published in 1966 (nearly 50 years ago), no new developments have been made in quantum physics since that time. While that can be disheartening, it also makes this old book surprisingly relevant.Gamow's ability to explain difficult physical concepts is well-known from his stories about Mr. Thompkins. However, this book explains the concepts without the child-like aspects, and focuses on important figures in quantum physics.The Faust play at the end is entertaining for physics enthusiasts, even if it is somewhat lacking as a play overall. But Gamow was not the playwright, and decided to just add it for entertainment purposes at the end, so I cannot criticize him for that.The only criticism I could give is that there should have been a separate chapter on Erwin Schrödinger, as well as a second chapter on Richard Feynman.Overall, this is a book worth reading for those that have an interest in quantum physics."

Furthermore, since Gamow participated in this revolutionary trio of decades as a seminal contributor and prolific collaborator, the book is peppered with amiable and cheerful anecdotes that permit unique insight into the lives, personalities, and blatant humanity of the physicists who revolutionized our understanding of the quantum.A few of my most favorite ideas presented in the book are as follows:  Max Planck  postulated that light must be quantized due to an inaccurate conclusion of a thermodynamical thought experiment (The Jeans Cube) suggesting that, if the Equipartition Principle holds true for light (as it does for gas) and if frequencies of light waves are infinite such that the total energy of a closed system of electromagnetic waves should be distributed across these infinite frequencies, then (put simply) your fireplace hearth would readily explode with the violence of the hottest star soon after you ignited the logs. Since this obviously is not the case in reality, Planck postulated that the energy able to be stored in electro-magnetic waves must decrease inversely with respect to frequency, and that the amount of energy contained by the wavr  must  be an integer multiple of the (subsequently computed) Planck constant. Wolfgang Pauli  formulated the Pauli Exclusion principle which, in its full form, is a bit more interesting than the usual form taught in University level Chemistry courses. The full extent of the principle counters the notion that ""two electrons share a single atomic orbit"" (originally quantified by Sommerfeld with three parameters) is not completely accurate: Instead, a fourth quantum number is needed to characterize the orbits precisely, known as an electron's ""spin"", and that only two electrons can share the same orbit only if they have opposite spin. Furthermore, since electrons can be thought of like a very tiny negatively charged particle spinning on an axis, the magnetic moment produced by these oppositely spinning electrons make it so that the pair of electrons with opposite spin that share an orbit described the original 3 quantum numbers do not actually share the same orbit at all-- the magnetic moment produced by each electron will repel the other, shifting the orbits enough for it to be incorrect to say that the two electrons have the same orbit! George Gamow  found that it is not only electrons that abide by the more precise interpretation of the Pauli principle (that is, that electrons have atomic spin, that only two can ""share"" an orbit, and that they exist in a structured form on different ""energy levels"" [particle interpretation] or ""atomic shells"" [wave interpretation]), but that both protons and neutrons also have atomic spin, and that the structure of the atomic nucleus can also be described by protons and neutrons existing on differing, structured energy levels (or ""nuclear shells""). That is to say that neutrons and protons each have their own nuclear shells overlaid upon one another, and that there are a certain number of each particle permitted on each level such that the nucleus remains stable. Werner Heisengberg  presented a clear and ingenious thought experiment that serves as the foundation of the famous  Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle , yielding the undeniable conclusion that we cannot discover both the velocity and position of a particle with a single classically mechanical measurement (due to interesting qualities of both the mechanism of interaction between the particle and the photon performing the measurement, and the physical limitations of the measurement of the measuring photon by the theodolite). Gamow does a wonderful job illustrating this thought experiment through a full page diagram and lucid derivation from assumptions to conclusions. Instead of doing a poor job of summarizing it here, I will point the interested reader to Fig. 24 on page 108, and the section in which it resides called ""Discarding Classical Linear Trajectories"".There are many more theories and conceptions presented within these pages that, for lack of better terms,  blew my mind , but in the interest of brevity I elect to not include any more of these incredible insights but to instead reiterate the point that Gamow fills this text to the brim with approachable yet dense expositions of these revolutionary ideas and theories of quantum physics conceived throughout the duration of the thirty-year quantum spring, and it is a truly exciting and deeply humbling experience to read from cover to cover. It is most certainly the mathematics of these quantum theories-- which Gamow readily demonstrates for virtually every theory presented in depth-- that I developed such a strong appreciation for this book. That being said, to read this book is not an easy venture and the process demands focus and attention from the reader in order to extract the entirety of the value it provides. Though this book is purported to be a ""lucid layman's introduction to quantum theory"", it is difficult to appreciate many of the mathematics presented without some non-trivial existing conceptions of classical physics such as kinetic and potential energies, rotational motion, Coulomb's law, and the mental agility to follow algebraic reformulations and substitutions of terms in equations performed on most every formula derivation (for brevity, I assume). Admittedly, many of the chapters of the book required my unfaltering attention in addition to multiple traversals over the content in a somewhat staggered manner. I often read each section twice by default, thrice usually, repeatedly consulted previous chapters when I inevitably discovered my conception of aforementioned theories was lacking, and often chose to re-read sections I had read the previous day as a review before starting on the next section. Many of the topics covered-- such as pilot waves, anti-particles, radioactive decay (via weak-nuclear force), and mesons (strong nuclear force)-- we're still just out of my reach, even after substantial effort. I say all this to suggest that this book is not for leisure reading, and if a reader approaches it as such (without sufficient background in quantum physics foundations) they will be almost certain to not appreciate its contents. I picked up this book to get a stronger mathematical conception of the fundamental theories of quantum physics and that is what it delivered, but not without significant effort on my part; succinctly put, this is a ""morning book"".In conclusion, Gamow's ""Thirty Years that Shook Physics"" is a remarkably eloquent book illustrating the foundational conceptions of seminal quantum theorists and their theories, at both the high-level and mathematical levels of abstraction. I would recommend this book to anyone who has a passion for physics and/or understanding physical reality more deeply. Though many will set this book down with more questions than when they started, readers will without a doubt (assuming the willingness to endure the initial struggle each and every theory presented demands) achieve a greater understanding of the underpinning of quantum theory, and the incredible and revolutionary advances made by the likes of Planck, Bohr, Dirac, Pauli, De-Broglie, Fermi, Heisenberg, Einstein, and many others during the wonderfully prolific decades of 1900 - 1930. These physicists, their theories, and magnificent conceptions are  the giants  whose shoulders all modern quantum theories, theorists, and experimentalists stand."

Good to remember the actual name for search engines or when doing book recs, yes?Anyway, this is a great book that does not talk down to you. It mentions actual equations (fairly easy ones), which can be incredibly hard to find in a book aimed at general audiences/pleasure reading, but if those aren't to your taste there is plenty of equation-free material and it is easy enough to skim read over the equation bits. I always appreciate a book that doesn't assume the reader is a moron but doesn't take 10 pages to get to the damn point or swim in highly technical language either, and because of this if you have read other popular physics books this one will almost certainly have different material for you to enjoy. It has a bit about de Broglie waves as a precursor to Schrodinger's waves that I have yet to see anywhere else."
274,048624895X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/998218-astrotama,5,This is one of my all time favorite popular books on physics! I read it when I was 15 yrs old and the stories (and the physics!) have inspired me since then!
275,048624895X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7852031-annie-kate,4,"I first read this book several decades ago and enjoyed it hugely this second time as well. It is a history of early 20th-century physics organized around some of the major contributing scientists.With personal knowledge of the physicists involved, Gamow is able to share not only the physics (in simple terms) but also the atmosphere of the time.For physicists, immersed in mathematical theories, who can no longer see the forest for the trees, this book gives a quick overview of the beginnings of quantum theory. For anyone trying to understand some of the most important ideas in the recent history of science, this book provides a fairly accessible introduction containing only a small amount of mathematics. Recommended for those studying physics as well as those interested in the history of science."
276,048624895X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11375563-michael-huang,5,"Discussed the 30 years of fast advancement of quantum theory, with some equations and quite a bit of human stories of the scientists. 	1. Planck: There is an equal partition theorem derived from Newtonian mechanics: in a large number of particles, the energy will be shared equally on average. (Energy is equal. Larger particles will thus be slower.) The resulting distribution of energy vs particle number is later derived by Boltzmann. The distribution of EM radiation from black body is qualitatively similar and can be explained if radiation frequency is not continuous but discrete. Planck postulated this discreteness and got the constant named after him.	2. Bohr: the classic principle of least action states that particle from A to B the total action (energy x time) is smallest or largest of all trajectory. This is adapted to say the action of the electron going through its orbit in a complete cycle (m*v*2πr) must be integer multiple of h. This explains the atomic radiation spectra. 	3. Pauli developed the exclusion principle. He also speculated on neutrino which he calls neutron. Fermi later gave the diminutive to Pauli’s neutron because it’s not massive. They are so elusive that to filter out half of neutrinos requires light-years thick of iron!	4. De Broglie. The wave theory of light can show that in total internal reflection, the light actually goes out of the glass, which can be verified by placing another glass several wavelengths away and see the light. De Broglie extends this to particles and considers them having a “pilot wave”. The same effect happens and particles can now get over energy barriers classical mechanics won’t allow them to.	5. Heisenberg. There is a nice explanation of the uncertainty principle. Classic trajectories are idealized lines with no width. Measurement of atomic particles (think cloud chamber) gives a trajectory a width. The minimum width is determined by the uncertainty principle. And the wave function also gives the predicted trajectory a width.	6. Dirac: So far, quantum theory is incompatible with relativity. With relativity, if you multiply time (ict) it is indistinguishable from another space dimension. Yet in Schrodinger’s equation, there is asymmetry as the spatial dimensions have 2nd order derivatives and the time 1st order. There were efforts to bring time to 2nd order and didn’t work. Dirac tried to make the spatial dimension’s derivative 1st order. In so doing, the math allowed for antiparticles which explained cosmic ray observations. 	7. Fermi: in explaining beta emission, Fermi made the simplest assumption that probability is proportional to all participating component’s wave function at a particular point. This agrees with observation and now allows all kinds of particle transformations. 	8. Yukawa: the strong nuclear interaction is effective only when neucleons come in close contact (about 10^-18cm). Once this happens, breaking the bond takes ~10Mev. Initial attempt to explain this is with electrons exchanging between atomic shells and the math of “exchange force” was created. But it didn’t work for electrons. Yukawa calculated that it takes a particle 207 more massive to do it. This is dubbed meson in the end. Later it was discovered that there are two types of meson, a pi type and a mu type (pion and muon).What I like most about Gamow’s book (beyond that it’s clear and to the point) is that he’s not shy of using equations, which is so much clearer."

I just wasn't cut out to be like the physicists George Gamow writes about at the turn of the century that turned classical physics on its head.Though some people say this book is directed at laymen, you really should have some physics background to appreciate it. It starts with the ultraviolet catastrophe prediction which led to the rethinking light as photons and ultimately the birth of quantum mechanics. Later, Niels Bohr applied the same thinking to atomic structure.George Gamow was a Russian physicist and contemporary of many of the famous physicists in this book. He offers up a lot of the history of the science, as well as humorous anecdotes of those involved firsthand at the revolution in physics that occurred at the beginning of the twentieth century.Do yourself a favor and only get the version that includes the 1932 parody of ""Faust"" if you read this book.I cannot recommend it to non-physicists, but this is my second time reading this book and I find not only quantum mechanics fascinating, but George Gamow's matter-of-fact way of describing the problems and how those scientists came up with their radical ideas to model what we observe in nature."
278,048624895X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39637934-randomdots,4,"Geroge Gamov has done really well to make a topic, like quantum mechanics, as simple as possible. It covers some prominent events between 1900-1930 that shaped the course of modern physics. Besides explaining quantum theory laconically, it also shows the funny sides of some famous physicists.Overall, if you want to know the very basics of quantum theory without being overwhelmed by its complexity, it should be your go-to book."

281,048624895X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10812762-courtney,4,"Thirty Years that Shook Physics is a book written by a scientist about scientists...to scientists. While I enjoyed this book, and found the history fascinating, there was a lot that went over my head. The book is chock full of formulas, equations, and phrases that run something akin to, ""I don't have space in this book to explain this specific theory, so I am going to assume you already have a functional knowledge of it."" This isn't me complaining; I still enjoyed the book and went into it well aware that I would not understand everything inside of it. I just say this as a warning to anyone else considering reading it. The writing style of the author was incredibly endearing. I really enjoyed looking at history through the eyes of someone who is not a historian by trade. The anecdotes he shared about the scientists--his friends and people he knew well--were funny and to the point, and showed a side of the scientist that I had rarely seen. There was no skimping on the science however! Gamow still dealt carefully with all of the specific discoveries that were made during these thirty years, and in a technical way. Even though I didn't understand all the specifics, I still felt at the end of it that I had a half-way decent grasp on what kind of a change had occurred during the 30 years he talks about. It was a good read, and I recommend it!"
282,048624895X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88336520-sarah-naimi,4,"I loved this book as a physicist with solid knowledge of quantum theory. He really tries to intuitively explain the physics but I think it won't hurt to have some general knowledge about physics and quantum physics before reading this book. Sometimes he misses the point and don't follow up, which was a bit frustrating but in general very enjoyable and funny read. "
283,048624895X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21843217-ahlam,4,"I picked this book up at a sale event in our public library. I am an engineer so I have meager to nill knowledge of quantum physics. So I was really curious but a little bit anxious to read about the subject. However this turned out to be a fascinating journey through stories about some of science rock stars who revolutionized physics in the early 20th century. Here you find bits and pieces of their personalities and their scientific achievements. The book also offers a relatively easy to understand fundemental principles of the quantum theory that broke every basic classical notion of space, time, and motion that were well established and subject to common sense. Just like how earth was flat to ancient people but certainly not to Magellan. Just like how theory of relativity showed that at very high velocities and very large distances things do not behave as ""they should have"". Quantum physics takes you to to the scale electrons neutrons protons and neutrinos. And shows you how things really work. Absolutely loved this book and will definently come back to it again. If you are a science enthusiast, you might wanna have this in your library."

These thirty years are considered very important in the history of Quantum physics. The author, himself a great scientist, gives in detail the part played by other great scientists Max Planck, N. Bohr, W. Pauli , De Broglie, W.Heisenberg, Dirac, Fermi and Yukawa in the development of quantum physics. If you want to learn about quantum physics, this book will help you learn the basics about it, and at times it is is funny too when it describes some of the incidents related to these scientists. I had a good laugh when reading about Pauli's very funny third principle of things breaking down in laboratories in the presence of theoretical physicists. When a scientist's experiment went wrong, he wrote a letter to Pauli. Pauli wrote back that he was in the train at that time and the train had a brief halt at the station in the city where the experiment was being conducted, suggesting the failure of experiment due to his presence in the city station at that time. Really good humor !"
285,048624895X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12269600-gary-patella,5,"This book does an excellent job of explaining the various achievements in quantum physics over a critical thirty year period. Although this book was first published in 1966 (nearly 50 years ago), no new developments have been made in quantum physics since that time. While that can be disheartening, it also makes this old book surprisingly relevant.Gamow's ability to explain difficult physical concepts is well-known from his stories about Mr. Thompkins. However, this book explains the concepts without the child-like aspects, and focuses on important figures in quantum physics.The Faust play at the end is entertaining for physics enthusiasts, even if it is somewhat lacking as a play overall. But Gamow was not the playwright, and decided to just add it for entertainment purposes at the end, so I cannot criticize him for that.The only criticism I could give is that there should have been a separate chapter on Erwin Schrödinger, as well as a second chapter on Richard Feynman.Overall, this is a book worth reading for those that have an interest in quantum physics."

I can't claim to understand everything that was discussed in this book, but I do now have some understanding of why Schrodinger and Heisenberg came up with different methods but identical conclusions on wave mechanics of particle motion. I hope this book has provided me with a good foundation for further reading on the theory and history of quantum mechanics. "

It goes from Planck to Dirac with some notes on particle physics. These last chapters are a bit dated though, missing the more recent QED, QCD, electroweak theory, and standard model. Plus misses more recent quantum mechanics like entanglement and the EPR argument which lead to it, plus there is no discussion of alternative interpretations. In Search of Schrödinger's Cat, or Quantum Realities is a better start I think. "
