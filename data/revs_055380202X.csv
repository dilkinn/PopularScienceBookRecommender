It is generally considered a sequel and was created to update the public concerning developments since the multi-million-copy bestseller A Brief History of Time published in 1988. In it Hawking explains to a general audience various matters relating to the Lucasian professor's work, such as Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem and P-branes (part of superstring theory in quantum mechanics). He tells the history and principles of modern physics. He seeks to ""combine Einstein's General Theory of Relativity and Richard Feynman's idea of multiple histories into one complete unified theory that will describe everything that happens in the universe.""تاریخ نخستین خوانش: چهاردهم ماه آگوست سال 2005 میلادیعنوان: ج‍ه‍ان‌ در پ‍وس‍ت‌ گ‍ردو: دن‍ب‍ال‍ه‌ ک‍ت‍اب‌ ت‍اری‍خ‍چ‍ه‌ زم‍ان‌؛ نویسنده اس‍ت‍ی‍ون‌ ه‍اوک‍ی‍ن‍گ‌؛ مت‍رج‍م م‍ح‍م‍درض‍ا م‍ح‍ج‍وب‌؛ ت‍ه‍ران: ح‍ری‍ر ش‍رک‍ت‌ س‍ه‍ام‍ی‌ ان‍ت‍ش‍ار‏‫‏‏، 1383؛ در 326ص؛ مصور؛ شابک 9649334254؛ چاپ دوم 1383؛ ‏‬چاپ سوم 1384؛ چاپ چهارم 1384؛ چاپ پنجم 1386؛ چاپ ششم 1387؛ چاپ هفتم 1388؛ چاپ نهم 1391؛ چاپ یازدهم 1393؛ دوازدهم 1395؛ چهاردهم 1397؛ موضوع کوانتوم از دانشمندان بریتانیایی - سده 21معنوان: کیهان‌ در پ‍وس‍ت‌ گ‍ردو؛ نویسنده: اس‍ت‍ی‍ون‌ ه‍اوک‍ی‍ن‍گ‌؛ مت‍رج‍م: محمد قصاع؛ مشهد: آستان قدس رضوی، شرکت به نشر‏‫ ، 1386؛ در 225ص؛ شابک 9789640207604؛‬‏‬ چاپ دوم 1387؛ چاپ سوم 1388؛ چاپ چهارم 1390؛ عنوان: ج‍ه‍ان‌ در پ‍وس‍ت‌ گ‍ردو؛ نویسنده اس‍ت‍ی‍ون‌ ه‍اوک‍ی‍ن‍گ‌؛ مت‍رج‍م رضا راهدار؛ تهران، برجیس، 1384؛ در 248ص؛ شابک 964963304؛عنوان: جهان در پوست گردو؛ نویسنده استفن هاوکینگ؛ مترجم داوود نعمت‌اللهی؛ تهران معیار علم‏‫، 1392؛ در 267ص؛ شابک 9786005461374؛‬عنوان: جهان در پوست گردو؛ نویسنده: استفن هاوکینگ؛ مترجم: عبدالحسین صبوری؛ تهران شبگیر‏‫، ‏‫1394؛ در 238ص؛ شابک 9786006774114؛ چاپ سوم 1397؛عنوان: جهان در پوست گردو؛ نویسنده: استفن هاوکینگ ؛ مترجم: صمد غلامی؛ تهران ناقوس، ‏‫‏‏‏1396؛ در 266ص؛ شابک 9786004730754؛فهرست مطالب کتاب: یک: تاریخچه مختصر نسبیت؛ دوم: شکل زمان؛ سوم: جهان در پوست گردو؛ چهارم: پیشگویی آینده؛ پنجم: نگهبانی از گذشته؛ ششم: آینده ما؟ پیشتازان فضا یا نه؟ هفتم: دنیای جدید برِین؛یک برآمد بسیار مهم نسبیت رابطة بین جرم و انرژی است؛ ادعای آلبرت اینشتین که سرعت نور باید برای تمام ناظران یکسان باشد ایجاب می‌کند که هیج چیز نمی‌تواند تندتر از نور حرکت کند؛ در نتیجه استفاده از انرژی برای شتاب دادن هر چیز چه ذره باشد و چه سفینه فضائی، بر جرمش می‌افزاید و کار را سختتر می‌کند؛ شتاب دادن یک ذره تا سرعت نور ناممکن خواهد بود؛ زیرا بی‌نهایت انرژی لازم خواهد داشت؛ جرم و انرژی معادل هستند؛ آنطور که در فرمول معروف اینشتاین خلاصه شده ‌است: ای مساوی ام سی دو؛ می‌توان گفت این معادله در فیزیک، تنها معادله‌ ای است که زبانزد خاص و عام است؛ در میان برآمدهای آن، درک این بود، که اگر هسته یک اتم اورانیوم شکافته، و به دو هسته، با جرم‌های تقریباً کمتر تقسیم شود، انرژی بی اندازهٔ زیادی تولید خواهد کردتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 19/03/199هجری خورشید؛ ا. شربیانی"

2,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1868162-nick,3,"Hawking is an exceedingly clear and occasionally quite funny writer, not easy when the topic is quantum physics, etc. I would be lying if I claimed to understand much of this book, especially in the audiobook format in which an exceedingly pleasant British voice hurls a flood of Hawking's words and concepts, one more challenging than the previous one. It might, repeat: might, have been possible to understand this material on a printed page, which in this case included a lot of nifty diagrams, on the presumption that repetition might have helped. But probably not. I did enjoy and generally understand the opening chapter in which Hawking explained the history of physics and our conception of the universe, with a beautiful presentation of the life and work of Einstein, and to a lesser extent his contemporaries and immediate intellectual followers. But after that, when Hawking moved into contemporary physics and the exploration of the cosmos (where he made his own contributions, mind you), I was mostly gasping for air, down for the count, you get the idea. Once I let go of the expectation that I could actually master the material, I kind of enjoyed the periodic appearance of concepts and phrases I had sort-of known about arrive in their natural and proper context, things like string theory, black holes, quanta, Heisenberg principle, nebula, etc. Perhaps more than anything, I enjoyed the ebulliance and delight with which Hawking presents his material, as if it is the simplest and most fun thing ever... which to him, it probably is."
3,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5845484-kelly-enck,5,"Stephen Hawking, stated in, "" The Universe in a Nutshell"" that our history is filled with infinite potentiality and what we ""got” was due to disturbing the quantum field by our ""observations."" Profound, I thought, and pondered about his theory for months. To better understand Dr. Hawking's theory, I read everything on quantum physics I could understand and a pile of books on the brain, Bruce Hood's ""The Self Illusion"" was the most helpful. Below is what I believe correlates with Hawking's theory, It is from the book, The Nature of Personal Reality, by Jane Roberts, (Seth Material) I have included a quote and then how I am seeing life now through a magical lens. ""An examination of your conscious thoughts will tell you much about the state of your inner mind, your intentions and expectations, and will often lead you to a direct confrontation with challenges and problems. Your thoughts, studied , will let you see where you are going. They point clearly to the nature of physical events. What exists physically existed first in thought and feeling. There is no other rule.What if our ""observations"" were first feeling-tone shared by all consciousness focused in physical reality. The cells and organs have their own awarenesses, and a gestalt one. So the race of man also has individual consciousness and a gestalt or mass consciousness of which makes up our physical reality. While physical we follow physical laws, or assumptions. These form the framework for corporeal expression. Within this framework you have full freedom to create your experience, your personal life in all of its aspects; the living picture of the world, your personal life, and to some extent your individual living experience, helped create the world as it is known in your time.It is important before we continue that you realize that consciousness is within all physical phenomena, however. It is vital that you realize your position within nature. Nature is created from within. The personal life that you know rises up from within you, yet is given. period. Since you are part of Being, then in a certain fashion you give yourself the life that is being lived through you."" ~ Jane Roberts, Seth Material.“Although I cannot move and I have to speak through a computer, in my mind I am free.” ― Stephen HawkingWhen I fully realized my entire reality was created by me, and global consciousness, I could chose what to give my attention to for the change I wanted to see. The more you examine your thoughts and feelings the more excited you'll get when what you were thinking about appears. You'll notice ""integrity"" plays a role as well, (even when no one but you knows what good things you've done), because it's ""liking yourself"" that is most important in your ability to thrive without limitations. It only works if you truly believe. Just like Yoda said, “there is no try, only do.”Whatever you hold in your consciousness you put in your reality. If you are thinking about something, it will appear in a similar form. Don't get scared when you notice you have a lot of negative thoughts, about yourself and the world. These types of ""thoughts"" are your current vibration, giving you the reality you have now. Any change towards better inner-feelings about yourself and your surroundings will show up immediately in a in an event confirming your power to create your reality. I am now excited about cleaning up my thoughts -especially my deep inner feelings that were not as great as I wanted them to be. Below are examples of limiting beliefs you may want to remove.Example of limiting thoughts:1. My behavior is hidden in my subconsciousness. 2. My life is a result of my childhood, or Karma, 3. Old age causes illness and regression. 4. People are out to screw me. Or People don't like me.5. I am not smart enough, good enough, someone is better than me.6. My religion is the right one, and so are my beliefs. 7. I have no control over the events in my life.8. I am fat.9. There is something wrong with money. People who have it are greedy, less spiritual than those who are poor. They are unhappier, and snobs.These are all beliefs held by many people. Those who have them will meet them in experience. Physical data will always seem to reinforce the beliefs, therefore, but the beliefs formed the reality.""The ego, which is ever changing based on a flow of new experiences looks out upon physical reality and surveys it in relation to those characteristics of which it is composed at any given time. It makes its judgments according to its own idea of itself."" ~Jane RobertsI try to catch myself in conversation making jokes about myself, and stop it. )When science has proven ""consciousness creates everything in our reality"" our focus will turn to beautiful stories, ideas and breathtaking environments. We will spot giving our attention to garbage news stories filled with violence and fear; because we don't believe what we hold these emotions in our consciousness mind. If I could ask Dr. Hawking one question it would be this:You said that we collapse waves when we observe an event. But what if-- our expectation collapsed the wave, our belief before the form existed. If this is true, consciousness is creating the collapsing of the field based on our inner-emotions, which would make the unpopular words, like ""emotions, feelings and insights"" the most valuable of all our senses. I learned most of my beliefs were secondhand and limiting, so I jumped those fences!I documented my journey in my memoir, ""From Hollywood to God,"" by Kelly Granite Enckhttp://www.amazon.com/From-Hollywood-...I am leaving the link for those, like me, who love to explore the Inner Journey of the Mind!Thanks Stephen for all your years of passion! Love Kelly!"
4,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64966022-himanshu-karmacharya,4,"The purpose of science is not only to answer the most perplexing questions, but also to arouse curiosity in the mind of the readers about the universe. While many books on science do give valuable information, they fail to achieve the latter purpose, as mentioned earlier. This book however succeeds in achieving both.The Universe in a Nutshell is considered as a sequel to Hawking's previous bestseller, A Brief History of Time. The book, as the title suggests, discusses about the history and principles of the physical universe, in a nutshell. The topics are discussed in just the fair amount of detail and simplicity, although there are some topics which are just too advanced to understand.Despite being nearly 2 decades old, the book still holds it value, and readers can give it go if they are curious to know about the universe, but lack lots of free time."

6,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41690792-muthuvel,4,"First of all, I expected the Hawking's electronic voice for narrating the audiobook. Though it might sound silly, I'm more fond of his unique voice.After his international bestseller, A Brief History of Time in 80s, he wanted to propagandize the current frontier we're encountering but this time in a more brief way. The First two chapters serve as a prerequisite for proper understanding. Short but very well explained introductory concepts of Einstein-Relativity stuffs; Maybe because i used to read a lot of books in that subject (I've read more books on relativity than automobile engineering in which I've got a bachelor's recently).Weirdness of Quantum Mechanics and its unification attempts with relativity at the initial conditions of the universe. Time and extra dimensions for the maintenance of consistencies. Some little dip in the chaos theory but too much idea regarding it in this book.Some chapters on his (and his colleagues) attempts on the formulations of the Quantum Gravity theory, then evolving into Super Gravity, then String theories and eventually m-theory atleast for now (Eventually is not the correct usage).Blackhole information paradox and the concepts of imaginary time are correlated to hinder the optimistic possibilities of Time Travel atleast for now. The Paradox is a puzzle resulting from the combination of quantum mechanics and general relativity. I feel personally that this Part needs revisiting again. Even the simple terms and explanations, these are much more complex topics undergoing tedious *theoritical* research currently. He also reassures the readers sarcastically that this might be a part of government cover up for Time Travel Conspiracy; You get to know only when you get to meet one like HG Wells.What I can assure is, that one could get a better view on string theory based M-theory which currently has the higher chance to become the Theory of Everything and the concepts of brane worlds.  And that is my Review in a Nutshell. "

I've been told that Stephen Hawking is not as complicated to read as one might assume. While I did learn a lot from this book, I also was left with a lot more questions. Furthermore, the illustrations were either confusing or totally unnecessary. "

9,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4604686-mike-ogilvie,3,"I really enjoyed A Brief History of Time and so was looking forward to The Universe in a Nutshell and its updated material. I was hoping it would be a ""dumbed down"" version of some of the high-end theoretical physics ideas that I haven't had the time or brain cells to keep up with.While I'm sure the content is dumbed down from Stephen Hawking's level, most of it is covered at a level and speed that kept it out of my comprehension. To be honest I find a lot of modern theories and ideas very skeptical - it almost seems to me that the theories are created and given weight because they might be possible... and that's good enough because to prove otherwise is incredibly difficult. A part of me (no doubt remnants of thinking left there by my college professors) downplays my pessimism and wants to believe them at face value. In this book I was looking to confirm that part, but it just didn't happen. There didn't seem to be any real explanations or support (or maybe it was above my head and I zoned out). It was simply describing the theories (e.g., M Theory) and presenting them as fact. (We used to call this ""hand waving"" in my Physics classes in college - like a magician's hand waving as misdirection.)There were a lot of good parts that were interesting and engaging. Near the end there was a part on the evolution of life on Earth and humans that was really intriguing. It had to do with DNA as a form of evolutionary method of saving data which has now been augmented by humans' ability to store information outside of our DNA now. And I do now have a better understanding of the framework on some modern theories (like multi-dimensions) that I didn't have before. I particularly liked coming to a better understanding of the theory of our perception of reality being a mere projection of 4 dimensions (3d + time) that derives from a ""real"" existence that exists in a 5 dimensional ""membrane"" universe (much like a 3d object casts a 2d shadow). Cool stuff.Maybe I just need a bigger brain."
10,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5361322-ivan-vukovi,4,"I really liked ""A Brief History of Time"" much more.While it isn't that bad (it's actually very good), in comparison with Brief History, it seems only to have many more illustrations and fewer thorough explanations.I understand that Hawking tried to write a popular science book with a branching non-linear structure without depending heavily on what has been said in the previous chapters, but I don't think that's actually possible. At least I honestly doubt it could be done without losing a significant portion of quality and precision.I don't know, I read too much about these kinds of things anyway so I guess I might not be right, it could be just what an intelligent layman without too much time needs. But that's a big maybe. Try it, after all, I put 4 stars up there for a reason."
11,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29509433-amirtha-shri,5,"I do not yet have intellect enough to comprehend the entirety of the book. However, for the extent I managed to understand, I must say it was incredibly brilliant. I didn't begin the book with the expectation of thorough understanding, so there was no disappointment. Furthermore, it was actually a relief that I could get a lot of the stuff in the book considering the fact that it is written by Hawking. I am glad I gave it a try. I will boldly explore science non-fiction from now on.As for the writing, his simple language coupled with complicated theories resulted in a good flow. There is occasional intelligent humour that makes you chuckle in delight and subtle satire that helps you connect with Hawking."

13,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42706900-mahira,4,"About Time TravelWhat really sparked my interest in time travel, was the ascension of The Prophet Mohammad, this makes him the first person to have traveled in time through a black hole. The description of a black hole being mentioned explicitly in a Chapter of Qur'an known as Surah NajamWhen the stars are extinguished. (Qur'an, 77:8)[I swear] by Heaven and the Tariq! And what will convey to you what the Tariq is? The Star Piercing [the darkness]! (Qur'an, 86:1-3)For more visit the link below:https://www.islamicity.org/3517/some-...What is real and what is imaginary? Is the distinction just in our minds?Time must have a beginning in what is called the big bang. Similar arguments show that time would have an end, when stars or galaxies collapse under their own gravity to form black holes.If one follows our past light cone back in time, it will be bent back by the matter in the early universe. The whole universe we observe is contained within a region whose boundary shrinks to zero at the big bang. This would be a singularity, a place where the density of matter would be infinite and classical general relativity would break down.While 10 or 11 dimensions don’t sound much like the spacetime we experience, the idea was that the other 6 or 7 dimensions are curled up so small that we don't notice them; we are only aware of the remaining 4 large and nearly flat dimensions. String theories are not of much use for describing how the energy of a very large number of particles curves the universe or forms a bound state, like a black hole. For these situations, one needs supergravity, which is basically Einstein's theory of curved spacetime with some extra kinds of matter.SpookyThe area formula for the entropy—or number of internal states—of a black hole suggests that information about what falls into a black hole may be stored like that on a record, and played back as the black hole evaporates.Amazing>The most obvious thing about space is that it goes on and on and on. This has been confirmed by modern instruments such as the Hubble telescope, which allows us to probe deep into space. What we see are billions and billions of galaxies of various shapes and sizes. Each galaxy contains uncounted billions of stars, many of which have planets around them. We live on a planet orbiting a star in an outer arm of the spiral Milky Way galaxy.HubbleIt was Hubble who recognized the dramatic implications of this discovery: on the large scale, every galaxy is moving away from every other galaxy. The universe is expanding.It came as a total surprise, and it completely changed the discussion of the origin of the universe. If the galaxies are moving apart, they must have been closer together in the past. From the present rate of expansion, we can estimate that they must have been very close together indeed ten to fifteen billion years ago.THE BIG BANGEinstein's general theory of relativity implied that the universe and time itself must have had a beginning in a tremendous explosion.When the universe is big, as it is today, there are a very large number of rolls of the dice, and the results average out to something one can predict. That is why classical laws work for large systems. But when the universe is very small, as it was near in time to the big bang, there are only a small number of rolls of the dice, and the uncertainty principle is very important.The human race does not have a very good record of intelligent behavior.Endless PossibilitiesThere seem to be various possibilities, depending on the amount of matter in the universe. If there is more than a certain critical amount, the gravitational attraction between the galaxies will slow them down and will eventually stop them from flying apart. They will then start falling toward each other and will all come together in a big crunch that will be the end of the history of the universe in real time.If the density of the universe is below the critical value, gravity is too weak to stop the galaxies from flying apart forever. All the stars will burn out, and the universe will get increasingly emptier and colder. So, again, things will come to an end, but in a less dramatic way.When Copernicus and Galileo discovered that the planets orbit the Sun rather than the Earth, and Newton discovered the laws that govern their motion, astrology became extremely implausible. Why should the positions of other planets against the background sky as seen from Earth have any correlations with the macromolecules on a minor planet that call themselves intelligent lifeAbsolute time defiedIn 1905, the concept of absolute time was overthrown by the special theory of relativity, in which time was no longer an independent quantity on its own but was just one direction in a four-dimensional continuum called spacetime.Dark StarsMichell argued that there could be stars that are much more massive than the Sun and have escape velocities greater than the speed of light. We would not be able to see these stars, because any light they sent out would be dragged back by the gravity of the star. Thus they would be what Michell called dark stars and we now call black holes.The radiation from a black hole will carry away energy, which must mean that the black hole will lose mass and get smaller. In turn, this will mean that its temperature will rise and the rate of radiation will increase. Eventually the black hole will get down to zero mass. We don't know how to calculate what happens at this point, but the only natural, reasonable outcome would seem to be that the black hole disappears completely. So what happens then to the part of the wave function inside the black hole and the information it contains about what had fallen into the black hole?However, according to the picture of one member of a virtual-particle pair falling in and the other member escaping, one would not expect the escaping particle to be related to what fell in, or to carry away information about it. So the only answer would seem to be that the information in the part of the wave function inside the black hole gets lostP-branesAndrew Strominger and Cumrun Vafa made an important advance. They chose to regard a black hole as being made up of a number of building blocks, called p-brane . Recall that one way of thinking about p-branes is as sheets that move through the three dimensions of space and also through seven extra dimensions that we don't notice.Does part of the wave function get lost down black holes, or does all the information get out again, as the p-brane model suggests? This is one of the outstanding questions in theoretical physics today.WORMHOLESBut you might go through a wormhole to the other side of the galaxy and be back in time for dinner. However, one can show that if wormholes exist, you could also use them to get back before you set out. So you might think that you could do something like blowing up the rocket on its launch pad to prevent your setting out in the first place. This is a variation of the grandfather paradox: what happens if you go back and kill your grandfather before your father was conceived?At present our computers remain outstripped in computational power by the brain of a humble earthworm.The brain does not have a single CPU— central processing unit—that processes each command in sequence. Rather, it has millions of processors working together at the same time. Such massively parallel processing will be the future for electronic intelligence as well.The human race has been in its present form for only two million years out of the fifteen billion years or so since the big bangA shocking reality check!Many of us may choose to live a virtual existence? Forming cyber-friendships and relationships!Funniest revelationIt is not clear that intelligence has much survival value. Bacteria do very well without intelligence and will survive us if our so-called intelligence causes us to wipe ourselves out in a nuclear war. So as we explore the galaxy we may find primitive life, but we are not likely to find beings like us.To the naked eye a hair looks like a line; its only dimension appears to be length. Similarly, spacetime may look four-dimensional to us, but appear ten- or eleven-dimensional when probed with very high-energy particles."
14,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32828173-sleepydrummer,3,"We all owe a sacred debt to Stephen Hawking for his theories and contributions to physics. Approaching this book with a mild understanding of basic physics, I simply exhausted myself in his space-time, extra dimensions ""Nutshell"". The amount of energy it took to comprehend a fraction of what I read left me in a swirling vacuum fluctuation. It is an honor to have read Professor Hawking's book. I will tentatively rate three stars simply because the subject matter as presented was mind-numbing, although rightfully this material is five stars."
15,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10848903-abbass-maanna,3,"It was my first ride with Stephen Hawking , and it wasn't bad at all. Reading about your UNIVERSE for the first time, in such a detailed explanation for what the writer aims to tell based on his wide knowledge in Quantum mechanics, theoretical physics and cosmology , necessarily requires a knowledgeable reader in the sciences I've just mentioned so he/she wouldn't be perplexed and then, he would get answers for many questions that may flash in his mind.In addition to the diverse information that one can get from reading this , he quietly doesn't get bored due to Hawking's sense of humor. It is highly recommended for those who care much about the universe and its studies. "

You can notice that Stephen tried his best to explain concepts that are by far not easy to explain. I had to read some of the pages multiple times, until I was almost sure that I understood at least some of the things that were explained. I know that this subject is not for everyone, but even if you grasp half of what this book contains, I believe you will have a much better understanding of the theories that try to explain everything around us.The universe around us is fascinating!"

I am used to listening to scientific materials, most of them in form of debates. But listening to an audio book is nothing compared to reading - you cannot turn back the page or re-read a passage, you cannot make notes with a pencil on the page, you cannot highlight key definitions, aseertions, or conclusions in the text. Eye-sight is also a much more efficient tool in gathering information than the ear. "

19,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19157406-omar-ali,4,"SECTION: HERALD REVIEW/BooksFile: uni.docWords: 712By Omar AliWanted: Nutcracker	The number of books trying to explain science to the 'layman' has simply exploded in the last few years. But Professor Stephen Hawking, Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge University, remains the biggest star in the field. although his first book, A Brief History of Time, sold over a million copies, Hawking is well aware that far too many readers never made it beyond the first few pages. So he says he set out to write ""a different kind of book that might be easier to understand."" Hawking's new book The Universe in a Nutshell is beautifully produced but breaks very little new ground, conveying little more than a 'take it on faith' explanation of what physicists think of the cosmos.	 The first two chapters introduce relativity and the problems of reconciling general relativity with quantum mechanics. While the illustrations are some of the best you will ever see in a science book, there is almost no attempt to try and explain the reasoning that led Einstein to his revolutionary conclusions. These chapters provide a kind of general introduction to the subject and are followed by a series of essays on various aspects of modern cosmology. The discerning reader will come away with some vague understanding that modern physics has rejected the common sense views of time and space, that general relativity and quantum effects somehow need to be reconciled, that there is something very important called the ""uncertainty principle"", (even though it's not as uncertain as you thought: God may not know the position and the momentum of a particle to perfection, but he does know the wave function), black holes exist, naked singularities probably do not and it might all come down to strings that vibrate in 10 or 11 dimensions (but we can't really know for sure till we build a particle accelerator larger than the solar system). 	 The penultimate chapter has some interesting speculation about how life and intelligence may evolve in the future and the final chapter gives a very light introduction to M-theory, which seems to be Hawking's current favourite for a possible ""theory of everything"": one grand framework to explain the known universe, from big bang to big crunch and everything in between (though, like Robert Frost, physicists are still unsure if it will end in fire or in ice). 	Along the way, Hawking tells us several times that he is a positivist, which means he really can't say what all this ""means"", except that it is a mathematical model which fits observations and makes predictions that work. But this philosophical reticence seems at odds with a persistent hopefulness that the full explanation is around the corner. Why should we expect any such total understanding in the near future? Is it not more likely that in science, as in theology, we have only just begun? That our descendants may well see what we cannot even begin to imagine? And their descendants even further? 	The physicist Freeman Dyson has said: ""As a scientist, I live in a universe of overwhelming size and mystery. The mysteries of life and language, good and evil, chance and necessity, and of our own existence as conscious beings in an impersonal cosmos are even greater than the mysteries of physics and astronomy. Behind the mysteries that we can name, there are deeper mysteries that we have not even begun to explore"". It is this awareness that seems to be missing in Hawking's book. (One dare not think that it is missing from professor Hawking himself.) Ultimately, Universe in a Nutshell is a coffee table book that is not detailed enough to teach you anything original and yet far too complicated for many scientific illiterates to follow. But it may well serve as a good introduction and lead the reader to other books that do a better job of actually explaining the physics as well as other mysteries that extend far deeper. "
20,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27195238-menglong-youk,4,"4.25/5 starsThis is the seventh Stephen Hawking's book I've read so far, and I have to confess that the last half of the materials in ""The Universe in a Nutshell"" are pretty difficult to wrap my brain around since most of the topics are about the frontiers of theoretical physics and cosmology. However, I enjoyed reading the first half of the book (where I can understand). I wouldn't dare to be the first to make that joke, but Professor Hawking joked that although he held Isaac Newton's chair as a Lucasian Professor of Mathematics, his is electric and Newton's was not. I will return to this book in the future once I have a better grasp on mathematics for theoretical physics; reading the theory in words alone doesn't help much. "
21,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51920759-vinicius-carvalho,4,"My rating is based on how genius SH is and the innovative and complicated theories he is up to explain to a lay audience. But definitely my choice of media was not wise as getting this information via an audiobook brought my comprehension to less than 50%. If I have the chance to read the illustrated version of the book, I expect to increase my chances of absorbing such fantastic but complicated concepts."
22,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6463881-l,5,"It's natural for our minds to wonder beyond the narrow confines of what's known, hence why not take that chance and adhere to your curious streak?!  This illuminating and enlightening book takes one on the most thrilling venture through space and time, wherein extraordinary marvels lie in wait. The true genius of Stephen Hawking is something that cannot fail to surprise, as this book is filled with pages of diagrams and fantastically detailed images. The complexities, excentricities and ideas of such a man is brilliantly captured in every page, therefore you'll never quite regard space and the universe in the same way ever again. 'It's all a matter of where one places themselves in life's continuous timeline' Here are some of my favourite quotes that I gained inspiration from the book... What keeps one grounded inevitably is slow in its origin That which fluctuates in peaks and troughs isn't generally relative to the common norm 'Politics for the moment, but an equation for eternity!' --Albert Einstein'Nothing puzzles me like time and space. And yet nothing troubles me less than time and space, because i never think of them' --19th century author, Charles Lamb  A scientific theory is a mathematical model that describes and codifies the observations we make. A good theory will describe a large range of phenomena on the basis of a few simple observations and will make definite predictions that can be tested.  --FACT! Creation is hierachal like Dante's inferno, and we're all sinking with a gravitational pull! Time travel is possible with a vast imagination! Does one drift around in various areas (reflection), or move with the time's (progression)?  This book is essential reading for those budding scientists keen to understand more about are universe, as it's packed with fascinating facts from a true legend and clever mind. You may say that there are different expressions to explain the same underlying theory, which is true, however Hawking's is one of the easier to understand and the most informative. The universe in a nutshell guides you on the search to discover those hidden secrets beyond our stratosphere, such as; supersymetry, M-theory, holography and many more while combining other scientists imput. Ideas from Einstein's general theory of relativity, and Richard Feynman's histories are included all in this fantastic compendium of knowledge. I certainly enjoyed reading this book and found it most informative and instructive for my own study purposes.  Next to read: * A brief history of time* Black holes and baby universes and other essays"

The idea behind it -other than making a lit of money- according o the author is to explore some of the topic that were put in late chapters in the aforementioned book that were perhaps not read as well as sharing the later scientific discoveries (the first book was published in 1988, this one in 2001).Just as the first book the Hawking writings in general, the book is mostly easy to understand although it is not as good. In it he takles the follow tooics/questions: Einstein and the theories of special and general relativity, cosmological constant, What is time, String theory, Blackhole radiation, Time travel, Scientific discoveries in the early 20th century such as the existence of other galaxies and Expanding universe, Feyman's interpretation of quantum physics, Does the universe have a beginning or is it infinite?, The anthropic principle, History and future of the universeAstrology and future prediction, Scientific Determinism and uncertainty principle, Blackholes and predictions, Wormholes, Future of humanity, M theory, dark matter, artificial intelligence and Gravitational waves."

28,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83022104-di-na,4,"The book is an attempt to explain the nature of the universe using (mainly) String theory. Hawking is making assumptions along the way while discussing problems of quantum gravity, quantum physics and Einstein’s general relativity. Starting with superstring theory, P-Branes theory and arbitrary time, Hawkins conclude that our universe holds many hidden dimensions impossible for us to observe. The future of computers and genetic engineering could bring us closer to unified theory of everything or maybe this all is a hallucination of the mind? The most fascinating part for me however was discussion of time. We all think we experience time. In everyday thinking, time is being reduced to a level of an individual- linear perception and chains of recalled mind experiences. And here comes my personal admiration for Hawking trying to discuss universal time while dissolving individual perception of the mind. To say, trying to take a look on the universe with a God’s eye "
29,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55881076-robert-cox,3,"As I renew my quest to dominate the world of casual physics, I am again met with the intellectually formidable presence of Stephen Hawkings. This actually has to be my least favorite of the Hawkings authored physics lite book, its lacks the accessibility that the other books inexorably maintained. My Astronomy 101 class (as always) proved integral to my understanding of the mysteries of the universe. I do however respect that Hawking appears to be the dude that can write about science without dragging religion into it unduly. It appears in this work but you can tell he doesn't study science to attack some vengeful God of his youth. Read the Brief/Briefers first. If u like dem reed dis. "
30,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50647721-soheil,4,"While you do need to remember more than a bit of your college's general physics to follow all this book has to offer, you can't find a better book that gives a better concise account of what our universe is, how it works, where it will possibly end up and some of the mystery's still remain in the realm of science.Stephen Hawking (RIP) offers a very understandable read here for those who are curious but lack the strong scientific muscle to understand everything. And that is my review in a nutshell. "
31,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25672215-anamarija,3," I feel kinda bad critiqueing Stephen Hawking, but this book felt like a mess. The ideas weren't really properly explained, it was mostly just: ""Oh, me and Penrose, we proved that..."" and he just tells us what they proved but there is no story behind the ideas, nothing feels personal or enthusiastic, whatever. It also makes it harder to read because that's boring. Also I feel like he wanted to explain too much too fast so the book doesn't feel unified. The illustrations are amazing tho."
32,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/100040541-mustafa-jawad,4,"This is one of the more complex of Hawking's writings. String theory, time travel, and general relativity are not easy to wrap your head around. But Hawking explains it much better than any other author I've read.This version also includes pictures and diagrams, which aid in understanding, as if Hawking's rhetoric wasn't good enough.I won't recommend this to someone who wants to get into science for the first time, but this is great if you're interested in string theory, M theory and general relativity; especially if you're a fan of Stephen Hawking."
33,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69626749-adam-juhasz,4,"I like how the book eases the reader into heavier topics (string theory, time 'travel', multiverse) over time, and it does it in a clear and actually graphical way (hence my 4/5, here and there, maybe a bit too much of said graphical content). Since the book publication, LIGO and LHC produced a number of gravitational, particle discoveries, actually raising some more questions in the process, for supersymmetry, hierarchy question, extension of standard model, but that doesn't diminish anything of its value. On the contrary. Keep curious."

Despite Hawkings efforts, this book was not particularly digestible or friendly to the average reader. It’s not his fault that the concepts he explained were baffling, but I found this book more esoteric than A Brief History of Time even though he was attempting to accomplish the opposite. The latter half of the book focused on more recent developments in Physics and felt so theoretical and removed from reality that I lost interest. The former half, however, provided an interesting history of relativity and quantum theory. First three chapters were for sure the best."
35,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75897725-joel-sam,4,Hawking effectively summarizes the principles of astrophysics with accompanying images and examples. Some of the discussion on brane theory is quite speculative and difficult to understand for the lay reader.

40,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4992372-chels-patterson,3,It’s just a tiny bit out of date and it less in-depth than Hawkins other books 
41,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2244282-mary,4,I’m sure this is good if you can understand it. But I can’t. It has lots of color pictures and diagrams which are helpful. But it seems to be a bunch of unrelated explanations. There’s nothing to tie it all together. Maybe that’s where astrophysics is right now. Also the book is 17 years old. So I decided it wasn’t worth the effort to finish it. I got about half way through.

45,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,2,"This book doesn't do much to clarify Hawking's earlier work. There are more pictures and diagrams, but the narrative is overly abbreviated or unclear. Other books by other writers do a better job of describing the same material (and even Hawking's own theoretical contributions).There are a few observations in this book that stood out as ways of conveying difficult concepts. Spacetime is best viewed not as passive background, for example, but as an active participant ""in the dynamics of the universe."" He makes it clear that there is vacuum energy in space and that it corresponds to matter (with gravitational effects), per Einstein's formula that equates matter and energy. In his glossary, Hawking gives a good definition of mass (quantity of matter in a body, which is it's inertia or resistance to acceleration). Hawking also writes that matter and energy decouple after the big bang. Off hand, this seems to say that underlying matter and energy in the pre-big bang moment there is just one thing. Or, alternatively, he may be saying that ""raw"" energy is the most basic constituent in the universe and that matter flows out of it (after initial cooling), eventually allowing the formation of inorganic (quarks, atoms, molecules) and then, organic compounds. If the latter, this also implies that there is a significant directionality and identity (i.e., what combines with what, and how) that lies at the cosmic core.At the end of this book, Hawking strays a bit by saying that human intelligence is defined by brain size, which makes one wonder about Neanderthals, whales and elephants, and he predicts that after a couple of decades, the computer will be as complex as the human brain. "
46,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42270195-ishmael,4,"This book is aesthetic perfection. It really stands out from the crowd. Try holding a copy in your own hands - it practically calls out to be read. And that's just the front cover. The illustrations that grace every page are remarkable because they manage to explain, with complete lucidity, exactly what the words in the text can't quite say, and yet also bring a smile to my face in a way that I doubted Relativity ever would during my school years. Stephen Hawking is a great guide in the world of popular science. The subject matter isn't easy. In fact, at first glance, it seems so impenetrable that understanding it would be like escaping from a black hole (once you've passed the event horizon). However, he leads the reader through a series of logical steps, with enough interesting asides and amusing anecdotes that it doesn't become just another textbook. He also isn't afraid to think about the really interesting topics, such as time travel, which I though was admirable. One point I would make - it is described as the sequel to A Brief History of Time. However, I would personally recommend reading this one first. Many of the concepts are the same, and the exquisite illustrations make them more easily understandable. "
47,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2728604-dale-gomez,4,"This book describes the things of which dreams are made, and topics philosophers have been questioning for millenia. Open your imagination if you read this book, because you will need it. As Hawkins quotes his good friend and collegue whose name eludes me at the moment, science is imagination in a strait jacket. I couldn't agree more and noticed this very fact in my experiences in the field of science. The best scientist (or at least most likely to be ground breaking) seem to have a bit of a creative bent coupled with imagination. Although Hawkins spares us the details of the bindings, he allows us to enter into the world of imagination required for grasping the implications of modern day theoretical physics. "
48,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3111883-evan,3,"This book serves as a reminder of just how large the gap is between popular science offerings geared towards the masses, shiny magazine articles and Discovery Channel TV shows full of CGI graphics and a taste of the science behind them, and the actual world of theoretical physics. I consider myself something of a 'space geek', but after reading this book it's clear that I am no physicist. While the theories contained within the book are abstract enough on their own to confuse most people, the attempts at explaining the various equations and experiments needed to prove them are enough to require that certain passages be re-read. I'm glad I finished the book, but I fear I won't be joining Dr. Hawking at Cambridge any time soon."
49,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/286571-lee,4,"For the average lay-person, such as myself, this one is a little hard to keep up with at times. I'll admit it; my brain is nutshell-like, and therefore, Hawking's rate of explanation required me to review some concepts several times. But just because you got a bachelor of arts to avoid that math requirement like I did, don't let that stop you from trying to grasp at least 50% of what Hawking is saying here. Absorbing a fraction of genius is better than absorbing none at all all. In fact, I'd wager you'll be grateful there's someone out there light-years ahead of your own intelligence after reading this book."
50,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4774600-alyssa,3,"Eh. This is an okay book. If you are looking for a book that provides good information about the universe I'd say go ahead and read this book! I personally didn't like this book because I couldn't understand it. I only read the first 100 pages. I wasn't going to make myself suffer through another 100 pages. I just really didn't like it. But, It wasn't the worst book in the world. I can say that Stephen Hawking is one of the smartest man on earth. Maybe I would've liked it if he described and explained the material he was covering easier. All in all this book was okay to read, if you understand the concept of everything."
51,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26259694-tauras,3,"It's difficult to rate such books when you're a physicist and generally know most of the topics. Overall, it was a decent book and I'd recommend it for any science enthusiastic with a non-physics background. Yet, the thing is, books like these slowly get outdated just because of new incoming data. Particle physicists have explored and found many interesting things in LHC. Gravitational wave detections created many opportunities to further our understanding of black holes and other supermassive objects. Hot science topics that are very relevant to the context of this book. Now I'm wondering how this book would change after all these things."
