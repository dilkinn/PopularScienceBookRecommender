It was recommended by Professor Tobin of the University of Wisconsin during the course of one of his lectures on Oceanography in The Great Courses series.The title is a little misleading, because the story of mapping the deep is rather sparse. Kunzig tells that story well, but that is only 40% of the book! After telling that story, he goes off Simon Winchester-ish and writes on other oceanographic topics including marine biology, marine chemistry, and the movement of ocean water.All that is good! Come to the book with an informed, but open mind regarding oceanography and you won't regret purchasing it."

As far as I can tell, though, this is a great, serious and stimulating introduction to oceanography for anyone interested in the least understood two-thirds of our planet. A little too much time was spent on life-sciences aspects rather than geophysical ones for my liking, but that's entirely a matter of personal preference - it's all fascinating anyway."
2,0393320634,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7049604-lehaleha,5,"This is an amazing book I would recommend to anybody who likes life, nature and beauty. It is very well written and I was puzzled, dazzled and amused many, many times while I was reading this book. Sometimes it tells a very sad story of barbaric exploitation of this wonder of nature we are not even close to understanding. But somehow this book filled me with gentle hopeful joy after reading. Maybe because it allowed me get a glimpse of a thing of incredible beauty! :)"
3,0393320634,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4289190-nic,4,Excellent. Covers a wide-ranging subject in a clear and understandable manner with just a touch of poetry to the prose.
4,0393320634,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45258156-jamie-z,4,"Although quite a few years old you wouldn't know it from this book (at least not in the beginning). That's because the history of ocean exploration is still important and in this book, very well-researched and presented. I was fascinated to learn how we learned about the bottom of the ocean and what went in to those discoveries. I enjoyed that each chapter was a different topic so you can skip around according to your interests. "
5,0393320634,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6062736-helene,3,"Though this was well written, with humor in places, it was VERY scientific and often above me. There were lots of scientists I had never heard of who, I guess, needed to be mentioned even though their contributions were not really explained. The scientists who did make a significant contribution to this field were personalized and thoughtfully described.I look forward to more explanation and discussion of the book in the weeks to come as part of the Tuesday Academy sessions."
6,0393320634,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79732669-emma-rosen,4,"This was a re-read - I first read it when it came out. Great, accessible oceanography book that goes through scientific developments over time. as a marine biology graduate, I loved the sections on marine life and sustainability"

8,0393320634,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33859589-robert,5,"An excellent layperson's introduction to the science of the deep sea, from biology to wave dynamics and geology. The writing is engaging, and often surprisingly funny."
9,0393320634,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49042068-keko,3,"Occasionally intresting, mostly boring. A parade of names from the field, which overheats your brain. It could have been written better - less details on the people and more details on the ocean. "
10,0393320634,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7300307-kimberly-eyre,3,"This has been the most challenging book I have read all year. The science was incomprehensible to me more often than not. When, however, I did understand it I was often palpably excited. It conveyed information and ideas to me that I had never encountered before. I still cannot believe no one I know ever talks about the varied geography of the ocean floor, about sea floor spread and continental drift, or about pteropods, winged-footed snails. My favourite chapter was 9: Fantastic, Glistening Jellies."
11,0393320634,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47427743-merel-compernolle,4,"""Mapping the Deep"" is an extraordinary book for people with a mild interest in ocean science. It tells the story of the oceans, as well as that of its numerous inhabitants. Along with that, it shows the reader that there is a lot we can still learn about the ocean. But there is more, it also shows that we, land-dwellers, can learn about our world, and even about ourselves, by studying the ocean. I especially liked the fragment about the faunal diversity that exists on abyssal planes and in abyssal trenches, since it shows that disturbance can create new possibilities for life ('Disturbances are the equalizers that allow the underdogs of evolution to survive'). That is a beautiful thought, one we would be wise to consider in our own lives on the surface."
12,0393320634,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212834-hannah-givens,4,"Fascinating and totally readable. There's a history of our efforts to map the deep sea, and chapters about connected topics -- not just the ocean floor, but what we know about currents and ocean layers and how the ocean developed. Really interesting for those with a comprehensive interest, and also full of fun animal tidbits and such. Also, it's kind of sad, but from what I looked up as I went along, the book doesn't seem very out of date. Good for the reader, sad for oceanography. Still, it is fifteen years old now, so double-check anything you might want to bring up elsewhere. And I wish there were more pictures... I Googled most of the animals and such as I went along."
13,0393320634,http://goodreads.com/user/show/699563-jer,3,"It answered just about any question I had about the construction of the oceans... and our planet, for that matter. However, I admit, I couldn't make it though the last 80 pages or so. Just got into details that I, frankly, don't have time to read about.The first few chapters are intense ""must read""s, if you live on this planet. Then... just keep reading till you fall asleep or find yourself daydreaming, then you'll know you've had your fill. Trevor (who gave me the book) felt the same way."
14,0393320634,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3325331-steve,5, This is one of my favorite books. So much so that I keep a copy in my car at all times in the event that I'm stuck waiting somewhere with nothing to read and I'm now on my second copy. I'll confess that unless you have a real serious interest in ocean science you will probably find this a pretty dry read because it has a lot of facts and history without any drama or anything other than that to keep the reader going. My particular favorite chapter is the one about bioluminesence and the way deep ocean creatures use it for feeding and paradoxically others use it for self defense.
15,0393320634,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2093580-mary,3,"I picked this book up at the Monterey Bay Aquarium, a visit that has sparked my renewed interest in the ocean. Although a decade old now, this book recounts some of the more recent discoveries about the depths of the ocean, beginning with the startling fact that we know less about the sea than about many aspects of outer space. The most fascinating chapters come at the beginning and the end, documenting scientific efforts to map the ocean floor and the flow of water around the world. Some of the intervening chapters are uneven, but on the whole, it was an eye-opening read. "
16,0393320634,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4883583-granuaille,4,"I would recommend this book to anyone with an interest in the world around us.A well written book on the development of oceanography, exploring plate tectonics, cod fisheries, climate change (just a little), jellyfish, thermal vents, fertilision of the ocean and much much more.This was a recommended read for Open University course on Oceanography - but it was far from a turgid textbook - it was a delightful light read but packed with information."
17,0393320634,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6931403-manu,5,"This book was one of the best non-fiction books I have read. Many are too scientific and you lose intrest quickly. This one was written in a way that you understood the science , but still had a good time reading the story. I found it a lot better then Other books like the disappearing spoon because of this. The ocean is such an interesting place because we know so little about it. this book explains what we do know about the deep and what here is to discover. Great read for anyone. "
18,0393320634,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4311085-terra,4,"Fascinating stuff, though slightly outdated - I'd love to read an updated version. Part of what made it a good read for me was that I started it while I was doing my open water diving certification, and so I totally got the whole ""it's an amazing alien universe down there!"" thing.Of course, this book is also slightly terrifying: we need the ocean so much and there are so, so many ways to screw it up. DON'T MESS WITH THE THERMOHALINE CIRCULATION, YOU GUYS."
19,0393320634,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2265362-erik-olsen,4,"Iâ€™ve been a student of ocean science for many years, and rarely come across a book that sums up the big issues so comprehensively and so well. Kunzig is a magnificent writer and has deep curiosity about the ocean. The book is filled with characters and ideas that were new to me and I found it deeply fulfilling."
20,0393320634,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15975480-gabriela,4,"Good introduction to ocean natural and exploration history. If you are looking to start learning about natural history or earth systems, this book provides a gentle introduction into the topic. It is not very technical but provides a good overview including a discussion about current ocean biodiversity and over fishing. "
21,0393320634,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1568892-renee,4,This book is great. The first few chapters cover the formation of the oceans and discovery of plate techtonics. He then goes on to cover various biological and ecolgical ocean issues. The first half of the book is stronger but the whole thing is worth reading.
22,0393320634,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13124873-federico-carballo,5,  Excellent book. The author has the incredible gift. He can explain complex things in an easy way and keeps it interesting. I recommend this book to anyone that is interested in basic geology and oceanography. 
23,0393320634,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9213213-fred,4,"One of my occasional nonfiction, accessible science reads. Our world is amazing and this gave me plenty of new glimpses and insights. I found myself hungry for what's been discovered since this was updated in 2000. "
24,0393320634,http://goodreads.com/user/show/159469-rachel-greenough,5,This is a completely fascinating book about the history of oceanography and the science of the world's oceans. Doesn't sound fascinating? Just try it....

27,0393320634,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4864423-marie-schuh,2,Reading for my graduate Oceanography course...this will take a while as we go from chapter to chapter.
28,0393320634,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7700490-helen,5,"Such a wonderful book to dip in and out of. A real shame to see it out of print, so I treasure my copy even more. A favourite read on the beautiful and awe-inspiring depths of our vast oceans. "
29,0393320634,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1017965-mariel-sandico,5,3% - that's how much we know about the ocean. this book will blow your mind.
30,0393320634,http://goodreads.com/user/show/126560-kati-stevens,3,"A little outdated and a little dry in parts, but a good survey of oceanography up through the year 2000."
31,0393320634,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83569392-rod-fisher,4,Fascinating history of ocean exploration up to the 1990's.
32,0393320634,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51678637-yvan,4,Very nice read. From the earth creation to a potential end with the deep sea research in between.
