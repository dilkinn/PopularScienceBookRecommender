Additional notes in my writings, but buy the book for a lot more of course.I knew a graduate student of engineering years ago, who, when I asked him what he was studying, said ""underwater bubble explosions."" Funny, right? Well, it turns out from a tv documentary that icebreaker ships rely on the physics of streaming water bubbles to keep them moving through ice flows. 1/3 of this book explores such apparently arcane questions of chemical and mechanical engineering, usually answered by professionals working in the field, usually from somewhere in the UK.The other, more accessible questions and answers range far beyond those in the book blurb. I do see how the other scientific answers could be overwhelming, if you're not judicious in browsing questions which interest you first. I like to think that a prepared rather than a practical mind is why one man found penicillin from the mold on bread and why some amateurs still find strange inspiration from trivial detail. Anyway, at least one-third of the book should prove fascinating to anyone, which represents a lot more detail than I can or should ever type. -- One person can push a cruise ship around in the water.-- ""Having yourself incarcerated in amber would be the best means of preservaton.""-- If you suck a straw in soda extremely slowly, you get only CO2-- ""sauerkraut has prevented...scurvy in northern winters""-- ""Ethanol inhibits the metabolism of methanol, which may be why drinking 'hair of the dog' can alleviate hangover symptoms-- After failing to kill himself with poison after the Battle of Pompey, Mithridates IV ""had to be stabbed to death""-- ""Pellets from a shotgun can kill a human without penetrating the skin.""-- The astonishing report of Dr. Beaurieux, who was able to get the guillotined head of Languille to focus on him 3 times for 30 seconds by shouting ""Languille!""-- Solanine, concentrated on potato skin, has killed people. ""Peeling removes 30 to 90% of the toxin"", so it's not true that the skin is the best part.-- ""Eating a cigarrette is far more toxic than smoking one.""-- Almost everything eats wasps, including, according to my weird Bulgarian novel, Bulgarians.http://www.newscientiest.com/lastword.nsOne place to sometimes post your own applications of science, even if you do take a certain amount of heat: halfbakery.com"

The questions people asked were pretty cool (excepting the ones about beer, which for some reason was quite a lot of them) but towards the end I felt like the same person must be answering them all under different names because they all had this droning tone to them and went way too in depth on stuff they didn't need to. I felt the different chapters were random and illogical and I had no idea who that Ed guy was who kept adding footnotes to people's answers. However, the question-and-answer format made me continuously want to pick this book up, and that doesn't always happen with non-fiction, so it's got that going for it. A pleasant enough read, but not an exceptional one."
2,0743297261,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8464281-darnell,3,"A mixed bag. There were some good questions and some that were enjoyably odd. But the answers varied in quality - I was most frustrated by the ""How long could you live on only beer?"" one, in which they didn't even try to answer the question, just gave facts about beer."

Good fun to read with some utterly bizarre questions (yes, what would happen if aliens 'stole' the moon?).In a few places the answers went on and on...and then scientists wonder why people assume them to be nerds ;-)"
5,0743297261,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14990510-mary,5,"I’m perplexed as to why this book has a lower rating. It is very informative and seems to be very well researched. If you don’t like to learn random facts, this isn’t the book for you. It answers random questions and individuals with knowledge in the particular answer them.

16,0743297261,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11129403-nicole,4,"A very fun and interesting book with questions I myself have wondered about. Sadly, I loaned this book to a friend and never got it back. I hope that my friend forwarded it on to another to read as it really is a fun way to explore science. "
17,0743297261,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52054138-pinko-palest,2,"I thought this was quite hard to follow at times: some of the explanations are a bit on the technical side for the general reader (and this sort of book is, after all, aimed at the general reader), some of the queries answered are far too trivial, and the american measuring system used doesn't help us Europeans understand what some answers are about"
18,0743297261,http://goodreads.com/user/show/851962-ryan,2,"My notes and quotes:Book that answers readers' questions concerning a whole host of interesting scientific questions. 1. Bruises change color because of the breakdown of red blood cells by white blood cells and the chemicals bilirubin (yellow) and biliverdin (green). The yellow color is the same that causes jaundice in children.2. The darker your liquor the more likely you will have a hangover because of congeners (which give alcohol the intoxicating effect). So clear/light colored drinks like vodka lead to less severe hangovers than whiskey, brandy, etc.3. Your appendix is most useful when you are a developing embryo (immunological function), but continues to work even into adulthood.4. Beheading (via a guillotine, etc.) may in fact be painful because it is likely that brain functioning still occurs possibly up to 25 to 30 seconds after disconnection with the body (although consciousness is probably lost after a few seconds). Many decapitated heads continue blinking after the separation and even respond to their name.5. Cats that have fallen from between 2 and 32 stories have about a 90 percent survival rate. Their terminal velocity is about half as much as a human and their increased flexibility allows them to absorb more force from impact. They are also more likley to survive a fall once it is above 7 stories high (compared to between 2-5 stories). This is thought to be because after such a distance they start to relax, thereby increasing their flexibility and absorption ability when they land."

The most memorable ones have to do with gooey substances - honey, earwax and poo. All, however, delivered completely seriously. For example:[return][return]The surfaces of the incandescent light bulbs where I work become progressively greyer over time. Why?[return][return]This can be explained by the fact that light bulbs work not by emitting light but by sucking dark. 'Dark sucker' theory is too complex to be described here in detail, but it proves the existence of dark, that dark is heavier than light, that dark is coloured, and that it travels faster than light.[return][return]To answer your question, a bulb becomes darker over time because of all the dark it has sucked in. Similarly, a candle, which is a primitive type of dark sucker, has a white wick when new and this becomes black when used, due to all the dark which has been sucked into it.[return][return][Editor's note] Readers should be aware that the revolutionary 'dark sucker' theory has yet to win widespread support from the scientific community.[return][return]Maybe, but I seem to remember something pretty similar in The Third Policeman.[return]"
20,0743297261,http://goodreads.com/user/show/369290-the-other-john,3,"This was a blast from the past that wasn't even in my past. Let me explain. When I was a kid, I loved science. I would often grab a science book from the school or public library and lose myself in a quest to discover how things worked in this world. Of course, that was all kid stuff and once I actually had to work to learn things, I found other things to read for pleasure. But the desire to know still lives within me. I tagged this book a couple of years ago and a few weeks ago I actually checked it out. Does Anything Eat Wasps? is a collection of questions and answers from ""The Last Word"" column in New Scientist magazine. I guess readers can send in a science related question and, if it gets published, other readers will write in with the answer. The questions are the type that pop into one's head at a random moment, or might come up in a conversation while sharing beverages with friends. This collection contains queries from various scientific disciplines, from the inner workings of the human body (""How many different species live on or in the human body?""), to the reaches of outer space. (What would be the effect on the Earth if an alien spaceship came along and dragged the moon away?"") Reading it was quite enjoyable, like reading a kids' science book and discovering a few more secrets of the universe. "
21,0743297261,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2208255-gill,3,"An interesting collection of questions and answers from New Scientist. They are divided into rough sections, and those on animals that I expected to find most interesting were actually of the least interest to me, perhaps because I already knew the majority of the answers and many of those appeared to be rather simplistic. Since the answers are also written by various readers of New Scientist a wide degree of variation in the expertise and slant of the answers is to be expected, but there were some real gems amongst them. I found a number of the ones in the sections Our planet and Our universe brought me new knowledge and information. The queries range from those of a small child, answered very fully and very seriously by a number of knowledgeable and eminent professionals, to the downright obscure - like whether a bee could find its way home after travelling for 10 miles on an underground train; and some large questions dealing with things that could affect the ability of man to survive on this world.An ideal book for dipping into at times when reading may be fragmented and interrupted, and one which parents of inquisitive teenagers might find very useful to have as a reference book."
22,0743297261,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3287733-k,1,"I was really looking forward to reading this book, because I had enjoyed ""The Book of General Ignorance"" so much and this one was very highly rated. But I guess I'm just not smart enough to appreciate it. For example, one of the questions was ""What is the maximum length of a vertical straw with which you can drink cola?"" The answer? ""If you applied an absolute vacuum above a nonvolatile liquid, then the maximum height you could suck it up a vertical pipe would be reached when the hydrostatic head pressure of the column of liquid equals one atmosphere (101,325 pascals). This pressure is given by p x g x h, where p is the fluid density, g is the gravitational acceleration...."" you get the idea. I'll definitely read the second ""Book of General Ignorance"", but this book was disappointingly tedious and I found myself skimming over a lot of the more technical explanations of equations, ratios, etc."
23,0743297261,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21919680-dee-eisel,5,"With all of the health issues I've been having, I wanted something light and silly but also intelligent to read while I was waiting in various doctor holding pens. This filled the bill perfectly. It's made up of letters containing questions posed to the New Scientist magazine. In each case, the magazine consulted experts and got bite-sized answers.I'm unashamed to say I'm a bathroom reader, and this is a great, easy read for those quick in and outs. If you want to have a book on hand for times when you just won't be able to read anything protracted, but don't want to be doing puzzles or reading magazines, this is fantastic. The editors have sprinkled in plenty of humor to make it even more appealing.If you sit down and read it straight through, it's an insanely quick read, in case you're not looking for in and outs. Either way, you'll probably learn something on the way through!Five of five stars."
24,0743297261,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3320405-raj,3,"This is a collection from the 'Last Word' column in New Scientist where readers pose questions, and their peers answer them.I learned a lot of fairly useless information from this book (which is, of course, the best kind ;-) ) and had fun both with the breadth of questions and the knowledge of the general readership. A well-chosen set of questions (including what would happen if aliens stole the moon, whether nature has invented any wheels and how long a person could live on beer alone) keeps you entertained throughout.Oh, and the answer to the titular question is yes, lots of things including birds, badgers, different types of insect and bears. And people too (wasp larvae are quite nice fried apparently)."
25,0743297261,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7355129-feistytiger,3,"I love these little snapshot of information style books, to get some random facts and knowledge. This was good for the information - all submitted by readers (and scientists) to answer pondering questions. This was good in respect that the sorts of questions you can relate to and you get some advice from the expert. It also was credible information - (as their were footnotes of any corrections or updates where needed.)However the style of writing and layout I found a little old fashioned and boring and i did not get into this book as much as i would like. Its a great little book to dip and out of however and i managed to get through this quite quickly. A quirky little book of facts, but didn't hold my interest as much as I would like. "
26,0743297261,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64078-richard,4,"Taking its cue from the popular New Scientist column 'The last word', this book is a collection of the weird and wonderful questions that people have asked of other readers of the magazine. Like the other book 'Why don't penguin's feet freeze', this book takes its title from one of the odder enquiries in the text.Apparently is transpires that actually an awful lot of different things eat wasps, ranging from various creepy crawlies to birds and larger animals.Full of questions that will make you go 'I always wondered that...' and answers that will make you say 'oh, right, now I see!', this book is a little treasure trove of invention and interest!"

When the cat is dropped it will remain suspended and revolve indefinitely due to the opposing forces.""Somehow I think my cat wouldn't see the funny side of it, if I tossed him from our balcony with a slice of toast strapped to his back.

What determines wether we are left-handed or right-handed? Well this book has all the answers to these questions and more! With very interesting questions that could have surprises; in their answers covers all topics from Animals all the way to Technology and more...I personally thought this was a facinating book, with very good questions which i wondered what the answer would be. Some questions weren't so interesting to me so I skipped them but on the other hand it had very good question which would leave me to wander what the answer would be."

Who WAS giving them??!! Just random people, with the occasional expert thrown in on some questions. And multiple, sometimes conflicting, answers to questions. I can get both those things from the internet, thank you very much. There was one question in here that I totally wanted to know the answer to: If a bee is transported far from its native hive, can it find its way back? Or can it join a new hive?Had the same question about an ant that took a ride on my car last summer. HURRAH, AN ANSWER!"

I mean, learning new things and laughing while at it, who can resist! And it somehow comforts me that I'm not the only one asking silly questions, with the difference that I ask them in real life from professors and whatnot instead of with just my name and country (counts almost anonymous with a name like mine)...Trivia buffs, this is your book. Others might not get that much out of it."
32,0743297261,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26546101-melissa-woodall,2,"Some interesting questions I might not have thought of on my own, but seeing them posed totally suddenly wondered myself. The questions are answered by readers of New Scientist magazine, some of them being authoritative experts on the issue, some not so much. So the answers were more ""truthy"" than actual reliable science. They were compelling enough and reasonable enough to be good enough for cocktail party level discussion, but I'd never want to have to rely on them in a situation where accuracy really mattered. "

As usual the book is broken down into handy sections dealing with different topics so if you have a specific interest in one area its very easy to just dip into the parts that interest you but as a book purist I personally read it from cover to cover as i find the books fascinating.Always a good read.

However, I love the format of this book - as opposed to an editor crafting the perfect response to these questions, there are often two or three letters written by scientifically-minded writers, each with their own (sometimes contradictory) opinions. It feels more like a discussions amongst smart friends, and I can safely say there was little in this book I already knew."

280,0743297261,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2162384-townsend,4,"This was a very entertaining book about science compiled from questions asked by some very inquisitive people. Most of the responses to the questions are informative and interesting; some are of dubious scientific value (the theory of ""dark suck"" comes to mind) but rank high in comedic effect. Some of the best questions came from young children, including a question about surfing on molten lava."
281,0743297261,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6192290-shahrun,4,I found most of this book rather facniating reading. The other bits got a bit techical and went over my head. I look forward to reading the other two books in the pack. Not sure if I want to part with this one yet. I do think I may try to get hold of further copies for some other people I know to enjoy. 
282,0743297261,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16856982-joanne-lock,3,"Entertaining read, nice to read when tired as its in sections so you can read a little section before bed! There were some section I wanted to be interested in but really wasnt - the weather is never going to be interesting at that level of detail to me - but most was very good. The fact that people have even though 'I wonder...' in some of these areas is interesting in itself!"
283,0743297261,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8151813-lukas-lovas,4,"Some of the questions (and especially the answers) were quite fascinating. I certainly enjoyed the one about playing bagpipes in helium chamber, or the one about white bubbles forming from dark guiness beer (""In interest of science, I repeated the experiment several times"" :D ) The answers were well formed, often carrying a tone of hilarity, which made for a pleasurable informative reading. "
284,0743297261,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1224893-julie-ferguson,4,"Fascinating, funny, and thrilling. This is a collection of the best questions posed to New Scientist magazine over the last decade. I raced through it, riveted by the questions, let alone the answers. A great read for anyone who has a curious bone in their body. "
285,0743297261,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2085746-laura,2,"Got this for Christmas and the timing was perfect, because it solved the mystery of why my sis-in-law's pumpkin fudge would not set. (Answer: don't use a silicon pan - it retains oil which prevents thickening)."
286,0743297261,http://goodreads.com/user/show/547821-barry,3,"Interesting, often funny. Left me wanting more, which can be a god thing in a book, but in this case reflected a basic insubstantiality. If I'd approached it in a different mood it may well have got 4 stars. *shrugs*"
287,0743297261,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4533585-isaac,4,A lot of these facts were so strange but very interesting. I learned a lot and usually I don't read these type of books but now I might have to read some more of them. The only bad thing is i can't lable this as spoiler alert because there isn't too much that one can spoil. :)
288,0743297261,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9628604-morgan,5,"I really liked this, some questions made me laugh, so sobered me but all the answers fascinated. To see the wealth of knowledge that came from just asking was half of what I found so great about this book."
289,0743297261,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18822414-danny-patrovsky,4,"Great book with lovely little nuggets of information - things I had no idea about and I'm so glad I read this, I feel like I've learned so much! Amazon recommends more by New Scientist which I'm adding to my list right now. "
290,0743297261,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13578125-theodore,5,"I've read many books, some of them comedies, but I can't remember laughing so much as I did with this. Not only does it provide scientific information about many subjects, but it's also written in a humorous way. What else can you ask from this book? Only that it were longer!"
291,0743297261,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46952421-rodger,2,"The quality of the answers to the 101 questions varies widely. They are contributed by website readers and reprinted in this book. Some are terrific -- informative, funny and incisive. Others...not so much. It was difficult to read more than a couple of Q&A selections per day."
292,0743297261,http://goodreads.com/user/show/395295-aaron,3,Interesting trivia is the quickest read around. And this is definitely interesting trivia. 
293,0743297261,http://goodreads.com/user/show/856086-julia,4,This books was a lot of fun. It answers some of those burning questions in a humorous way. It does get a little too technical in places but still very enjoyable.
294,0743297261,http://goodreads.com/user/show/132698-erin,3,Funny and weird science questions with sometimes funny and weird answers. Great for a quick read.
295,0743297261,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1733100-alison,1,"Unless youa re into knowing the true answers, don;t bother!"
296,0743297261,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40536-michelle,3,Started out good but lost momentum.The first 80 or so pages are really good.
297,0743297261,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2307535-suzanne,5,its actually witty and some of the questions you have often wondered as well.

299,0743297261,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2919025-connor-davidson,4,A great fast paced read. The stuff you read in this book is so abstract it is funny.
