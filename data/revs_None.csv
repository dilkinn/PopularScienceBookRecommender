0,None,http://goodreads.com/user/show/104540183-colin-maclennan,5,"This is an excellent book. The author is a science writer for the ""New Scientist"" and as one might expect, the writing is clear and straightforward, apart only from a very occasional lapse into colloquial lanquage. What does ""more mouth than trousers"" mean as a verdict on a supplement? But a real strength of this book is that it is so well laid out. It is broken down into upwards of 50 sections- ""the truth about ......"". making it very easy to find the bit that interests you. It is a pity that the ""Contents"" page missed out on some editing - one or two truths included in the text are omitted from the contents, and one or two are strangely corrupted, as ""The truth about healthy smoking"" !!!There was one place in the book where I was brought up short. ""The truth about recreational drugs"" reports the conclusion of the UK's Independant Scientific Committee on Drugs (ISCD) that alcohol is the most damaging drug of all, with a harm score of 72 (out of 100), compared to heroin at 55, and crack cocaine at 54. Wow, I thought. Does that mean I would be better taking the odd shot of heroin than the occasional glass of wine with dinner? No, that is not quite what is meant, although the writer seems to be suggesting that.The ISCD report distinguishes two types of harm, harm to the individual and harm to society as a whole. Alcohol's high overall harm score is because of the amount of harm it does to wider society - domestic violence, drunken driving and so on. But this book is about the effect on the individual of a range different life style choices. Looking only at harm to the individual, alcohol is not nearly as harmful as heroin or crack cocaine, though it is still quite harmful, even at quite low levels, more so than smoking, which surprised me. But the whole question of how the individual should respond to the wider social impact of a drug is a complex one. My consumption of the odd glass of wine with my dinner is quite irrelevant to the wider social problems of domestic violence, drunken driving, and so on, though it is highly relevant to its harm to my health.The ISCD report in Lancet is not an easy read. It would be good subject for a New Scientist article. Perhaps it was at the time?Overall, a very useful book."

2,None,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45775348-roger-m,5,"Like other reviewers, I found this an easy to read overview of the current scientific research on health. It is very well written for its purpose: conveying scientific information in a one practical, engaging and non- patronising way for lay readers. It may confirm what you already thought but provide scientific corroboration to help improve your conscious and subconscious commitment to adopting healthy lifestyle choices.Recommended"
3,None,http://goodreads.com/user/show/114957082-dragana-ru-i,4,"It wasn’t like a normal self help book. It was very scientific and full of information - about sleep, alcohol, calories, you name it it’s in there. It was very interesting and it was nice to read something that wasn’t always telling you that you’re right for your choices. Sometimes eating 50 chocolate bars and sleeping for 2 hours ISN’T okay! Good book overall. "
4,None,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88265838-matt-hodson,3,"Yep it’s fine. It repeatedly declares that there are no quick fixes and then repeats the usual mantras of fruit, veg and exercise. In that sense it is a serious book and a useful baseline for getting health right. But i can’t say it really changes my life much, let alone saving it. "
5,None,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40169242-daniela,4,Really interesting and finally gave me some scientific evidence of what works and what doesn't and what we don't yet know for sure. It will help you make the decisions you need for yourself and your family.
6,None,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63132456-mrs-susan-farrington,5,ExcellentOne of the best books i have read about health and longevity. Thoroughly recommended. Easy for the average person to read and understand.
7,None,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48922256-anne,4,"I found this book very easy to understand. It was clear, concise and very informative. The writing style is clear and almost in layman's terms. I learned a lot."
8,None,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3350176-jenny-carr,4,"BrilliantWould have given five stars, but the evolution bits were annoying. Loads of common sense here, based on proper clinical trials and evidence."
9,None,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43973467-ian-wilson,4,Good read some useful ideas with some interesting takes on ideas presented elsewhere.
10,None,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67560008-nisha-patel,4,Very interesting and readable although sometimes it does get a bit scientific in some places.
11,None,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69839726-nick,4,"A good generalist book, and easy to read. I prefer more detail."
12,None,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21079183-sian-powell,3,"This book is no fad book promising miracles if you do this or that. It is a look at the best current science regarding how to look after your health. There was not really anything startling new for me. Eat vegetables, exercise and get enough sleep are the main messages. For those who do get confused by some of the conflicting messages we currently get this does cut through some of the headlines to the science underneath."
13,None,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17071958-karim,4,"I could assure you that this book will save your life by improving your lifestyle. I have to admit that this book challenged me personally in many ways. It is based on recent researches; as you all know that scientific facts might change from time to time especially those ones in the medical field. Each year new theories and trials disproves and debunk the older ones. For instance, it was thought that saturated fats is not good for you but not anymore. I am glad that I had the time to read this book during the lockdown. You will certainly learn more about dieting, exercising, vitamins & minerals, sleeping benefits and much more. This book can save you (if you want to be saved) and will encourage you to get rid of your sedimentary lifestyle ;) "
