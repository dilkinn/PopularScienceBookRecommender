0,0809058405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57901-jerzy,3,"Most of the book is a collection of examples commonly seen in other pop math books: how a particular gambling game or con trick lets the house win most of the time; tricky things about Bayes' Theorem and Simpson's Paradox; how raising the price by 40% and then lowering the new price by 40% does not give you back the original price; the difference between statistical correlation and causation; etc.I hoped the book would be an in-depth look at where innumeracy stems from and how to prevent it. There is a chapter about this, but it's not the meat of the book. He mentions standard things like poor math education, psychological blocks like ""math anxiety"", and popular misconceptions that math is just cold spiritless arithmetic. He does propose a few solutions here and there, like getting more non-mathematicians writing about math and highlighting the warmth and passion of the subject to get rid of negative stereotypes... but this is definitely not an overarching policy to improve the standing of math in this country like I'd been hoping.But I do really like his idea of placing more emphasis on estimation in schools, and especially that people should build personal mental libraries of collections of things for every power of 10 up to at least a trillion. (In other words, you should be able to visualize how many is a thousand of something vs a million of something vs a trillion of something. For example, the stadium in our town seats 1,000 people; a wall nearby has 10,000 bricks; etc.) It would be handy for people to be able to judge for themselves whether or not a number cited in the newspaper is realistic.Another cool idea is his (logarithmic) risk scale or safety scale. For example, if 1 out of every 5,300 Americans dies in a car crash each year, then driving a car has a low safety index of log(5300) = 3.7. If 1 out of 800 die due to smoking annually, then smoking has an even lower safety index of log(800) = 2.9. If only 1 in 5 million US kids is kidnapped each year, the safety index is a much higher 6.7, and so on. If newspapers and TV started to use this kind of scale, it would be an easier way for people to compare the relative risk of various activities.I also liked his discussion of coincidences - for example, hearing in the morning that vivid details of your previous night's dream match what you hear on the news. Assuming that there's only a one-in-ten-thousand or one-in-a-million chance of this happening on a given night, over the course of a year in a big country like the USA you'd still get plenty of people to whom this happens simply due to plain chance - not any sort of ESP or anything. So the fact that this has occasionally happened to you or someone you know should not be surprising in the least.The author goes on to bash more pseudoscience in detail; I agree with him but doubt that anybody who believes that stuff in the first place is going to be convinced otherwise by something as simple as facts and math. (Anyway, reasonable people often believe total crap too. It cracks me up that, at one point, phrenological exams were commonly a precondition of employment in big corporations!)There's also an interesting comment about ""winners"" and ""losers"". A given coin toss has a 50% chance of landing on heads and 50% of tails, and in the long run if you toss a coin many many many times, the ratio (number of heads) / (total number of tosses) will approach 1/2. HOWEVER! That only applies to the ratio - the absolute difference between (number of heads) and (number of tails) is NOT guaranteed to approach zero. If an initial large absolute difference arises due to chance, it's not likely to go away. So if Harry is betting heads and Tom is betting tails, and after the first 100 tosses Harry just happens to be ahead 60 to 40, Harry is likely to stay ahead for a long time. The next 100 tosses are likely to split about 50-50, so he'd end up ahead 160-140, and so on; at 1000 tosses Harry's still most likely to be ahead 510-490. The ratio keeps getting closer to 1/2 (60/100 = .6, but 510/1000 = .51), but not the absolute difference. This doesn't mean that one side or the other is necessarily likely to get that far ahead - but if someone DOES, by pure chance, then they're likely to stay ahead. Perhaps in real life some people end up treated like ""winners"" or ""losers"" in general because they've ended up on the wrong side of the difference in wins; Harry here always seems to be ahead of Tom, even though Tom and Harry are each successful at only about half the things they attempt.Another good section is about reward and punishment. Say that each of us tends to perform at some mean level on a particular task (for example, if I throw darts, assume I'll tend to hit near the bullseye 10 times out of 50). I may do particularly well or particularly poorly (40/50 or 0/50) in one session, but the next time I'm still most likely to be back around my mean score of 10/50. So if I do poorly today I'm likely to do better tomorrow; and if I do well today I'm likely to do worse tomorrow. This is called regression to the mean. Now, if we reward good performance and punish poor performance, and regression to the mean occurs, we are likely to assume that punishment causes improvement while praise causes a lapse - even if the punishment or reward had no effect on the next day's performance.Finally, he also says mathematicians tend to have a particular sense of humor - they take things literally when they're not meant to be, or they take a premise to extremes with comical result. And indeed it makes sense that this kind of play is exactly what you do when solving math problems or coming up with proofs. See, Katie? My puns and bad jokes aren't pathological - I'm just studying!"
1,0809058405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2326621-lisa,1,"On page 94, Paulos bemoans the fact that people attribute combination to causation: ""...when people reason that if X cures Y, then lack of X must cause Y."" But just a few pages later, on 108, he states: ""In short, there is an obvious connection between innumeracy and the poor mathematical education received by so many people. [...] Still, it's not the whole story, since there are many quite numerate people who have had little formal schooling."" For those who are only as bright (or dim) as Paulos, he's skipping a step here - he's comparing students with a bad education to students with no education, which doesn't follow even his own logical rules he's set forth. He is trying to segue into other reasons for innumeracy, but fumbles, because to make the strongest logical statement, he should have said, ""Still, it's not the whole story, since there are many quite numerate people who have had such poor mathematical education.""I'm a linguist, not a mathematician, but there is a need for good logic in both fields. I believe I'm not being nit-picky to say that his poor control over logic is a deterrent to finishing his book about the poor state of logic in America. Or maybe, it just proves his point even more strongly... So, I'm on page 108 of 180, and I refuse to read any further. Additionally, I will never pick up any book by Paulos again, nor will I read anything he recommends. "
2,0809058405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45836-blaker,2,"Let's say there was a <1% chance that I would buy an unknown book after stumbling randomly upon it on a bargain shelf (something I haven't done in almost a decade after perusing dozens of such shelves in that time), and then a 30% chance that I would then like that book (giving myself some credit for taste while taking into account the vast quantities of extant crap). Those are two dependent scenarios, meaning I'd have to multiply them to get the likelihood that I ever might have liked this book, which comes out to .3%. As Mr. Paulos probably would have warned me (>95% chance), I should have trusted the percentage and skipped the book.It's a breezy enough introduction to the problem of innumeracy, but ultimately it has less to do with its subtitle -- Mathematical Illiteracy and its Consequences -- and more to do with Mr. Paulos flaunting his intellectual superiority via a litany of schizoid statistical and probabilistic scenarios. It feels like a precursor to Malcolm Gladwell, what with his ""Did you know. . ."" and ""You may think X, but really Y. . ."" I can't help but lament that Gladwell must have been just a tyke when this was written because he could have offered some much needed focus and social relevancy to the author. Even had Paulos focused more on the last word of that subtitle, the consequences and implications, this might have felt more worthwhile. As is it felt like little more than a talent show.Paulos actually admits that mathematicians have a deserved reputation for arrogance, and also that he was attracted to math mainly because it gave him a way of feeling superior to others (p. 99). Both traits are obvious here, and in that sense I have to think that he is one of the least effective ambassadors that Math could have wound up with. His arrogance is particularly off-putting when casually insulting educators (a population to which I belong) and also when dismissing dreams; though I accept his point about their predictability, I respect the human mind enough to acknowledge we probably don't understand exactly how they work yet.He does offer some important reminders and warnings about the misuse of statistics, probability and averages -- really interesting were two of the last points he makes, about the difference between statistical significance and practical significance, and then introducing his unique and highly useful safety logarithm. But each of these topics could have benefited from a much deeper treatment, with both more examples and a more structured argument of how the problem affects us and what we can do to prevent it. Similarly, the first two chapters could have been condensed into an introduction.Basically, this book was not well organized at all, especially puzzling coming from a ""coldly rational"" mathematician. To put it in terms Paulos might appreciate, it was about 35% useful and 65% gloating crap.Not Bad Reviews@blakerosser1"
3,0809058405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26454539-thef7pawn,2,"Never judge a book by its cover or, in this case, by its title. The author purports to explain numerical illiteracy (""innumeracy"") and the consequences of it. However, he skates from there to explaining formal logic, probability theory, estimations, critiques of psuedo-science, and then to the reasons why so many people just don't like math. Although his points are valid, and at times slyly humorous, the tone is at times condescending and and self-pitying. I wanted to like this book but the opening pages nearly made me quit reading. The author engaged in dry parlor tricks like estimating the number of grains of sand on earth. Clever, but impractical. If you, like me, were looking for a book describing how experts manipulate numbers to advance specious public policy, this book isn't for you. It barely scratches the surface. If that makes me ""innumerate,"" so be it."

6,0809058405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2765549-jonathan,3,"An easy little read about mathematical illiteracy. The author, it is eventually revealed, was a mathematical prodigy as a child, and still takes immense pleasure in doing things like deftly computing the volume of all the blood in the world in terms of how deep it would fill Central Park, or how fast human hair grows in miles per hour. He seems genuinely surprised that there might be people for whom these questions are not interesting.He also has some ideas for improving the state of mathematical education, some of which seem plausible and some of which seem downright wacky. For instance, I think we can all agree that math education has been biased towards the rote memorization of formulas and terms at the expense of fluency and ""playful"" exploration of numerical and geometrical concepts. On the other hand, his suggested solution is hiring mathematicians as full-time staff in every school to oversee the teaching of math and to rotate in as teachers, which seems quite heavy-handed.The best parts of this book are the bits on probability and patterns. A little discrete math is all it takes to have a toolset for evaluating all kinds of claims, and the author's analysis of the popular pseudoscientific fads of his day are applicable to all sorts of poppycock that happens now.In the end though, it's hard to say just who this book is for. It feels less like a friendly exhortation directed to the mathematically illiterate (or innumerate in the author's parlance) than a jeremiad more likely to be read by the literate, explaining why the hoi polloi are so easily duped by cheap parlor tricks. There's a occasional air of smug superiority, and the author suggests outright that the innumerate students of today are just too lazy to learn about math. "
7,0809058405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35450686-discospacepanther,4,"Sitting in an independent coffe shop, sipping a latte and listening to the soundtrack to The Phantom Menace or Taylor Swift’s 1989 is a great way to devour John Allen Paulos’s Innumeracy: Mathematical Illiteracy and Its Consequences.I picked up this short volume after hearing it repeatedly praised by Matt Dillahunty—a speaker whose ability to cut through bullshit is legendary—so I had some pretty high expectations.Innumeracy is a quick read, and Paulos takes aim at poor education, poor media presentation of facts, lazy thinking, as well as pseudoscience (which sits at the confluence of these three factors). Nothing is dealt with in great depth—the writing mostly acts as a primer for the reader to not accept face value assertions—and leaves it to the reader to heed the warning and educate themselves.Apart from his rather frustrating and parochial aversion to the metric system, John Allen Paulos writes rather engagingly. Some of the examples chosen have become much more familiar to the general public in the years since this book was first published, but that should be taken more as an indicator of this work’s influence than its lack of originality.However, there is another distracting stylistic element that distracts from the universality of the message: the author’s writing is permeated with a difficult-to-ignore Amerocentrism—from bringing Reagan into every chapter (betraying the book’s era of origin as well as the author’s—perfectly justifiable—distaste for that US president) to using baseball or basketball as the source of clichéd statistical examples. The author doesn’t waste any opportunity to establish his credentials as an AMERICAN, and the reader can feel quite bludgeoned by it.Though the Amerocentrism isn’t sufficent to damage the quality of the writing, I had to deduct one star for the ridiculous adherence to American Customary Measures—no-one who wants to be taken seriously globally as a thinker should be avoiding the metric system.This is a great book that works as a good companion to Sagan’s The Demon Haunted World, which delves more into the why of people believing weird things rather than Paulos’s focus on how lack of mathematical competence leads to errors or exploitation."
8,0809058405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4826004-kirsten,3,"I already believe that numbers are beautiful and just make sense but it's always nice to read a book that agrees with you. The author does a great job of putting perhaps non-intuitive concepts in perspective. (For example, when describing magnitude he says, a million seconds is about eleven and a half days, but a billion seconds is almost thirty-two years! I had never thought of it quite like that.) He also does a great job pointing out the negative impact of innumeracy on society in general - how misunderstandings about things like coincidence and cause and effect can lead to harmful beliefs and behaviors about things like the pseudosciences, gambling, and healthcare. Overall a very readable book that could have a big impact if only the right people would read it."
9,0809058405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5871312-michelle,3,"Innumeracy is a great book for the era of Ebola panic (even if it is quite dated). Paulos expounds on mathematical concepts as they relate to everyday life - the true nature of particular risks, gambling chances, and understanding extremely large and small numbers. There are a lot of mathematical puzzles (always fun) and real-world examples of the (mis)application of seemingly abstract concepts. There's also some overlap with Thinking, Fast and Slow regarding cognitive blocks to thinking mathematically.But Paulos comes off as a bit disparaging of ""innumerates"" - this is definitely not a book for them, but more for those in the know to tsk-tsk at the state of mathematical literacy. It is certainly sad, though, how little progress the American public has made in this domain since this book was originally published. Evidenced by today's popular obsessions and myth-making, educating on these concepts remains a difficult task indeed."
10,0809058405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4404773-mary-slowik,4,"Quick, essential reading.While it hasn't completely killed my interest in coincidences, it tried valiantly to do so. The author's anger at the popularity of pseudosciences (astrology, mediums, fortune-telling, etc.) comes across pretty clearly, and it's hard not to agree with him. In fact... it's impossible to disagree with him in certain sections, since he's using cold, hard mathematics. (He'd hate that I used the adjective 'cold,' there...)I don't have much more to say beyond the fact that this would make worthwhile reading for just about everyone. There are a lot of innumerates out there. It's difficult to follow him in certain passages if you're not taking notes or have a calculator handy, but for the most part he uses tight, compressed, powerful writing, boiling everything down to the essence.Many of the examples used are adorably dated, late-80's and early-90's."
11,0809058405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2239377-joel,5,"This book speaks for itself. I mean, people should understand mathematics beyond, like, knowing how many shoes they need for how many feet they have. "
12,0809058405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/101529-gabriel,3,"As a math teacher, I think about the subject of societal constructs against math a lot. I think about how often phrases like: ""I gave up on math a long time ago,"" ""I was never good at math,"" ""I don't need any math for what I do,"" or ""What's so important about insert precalculus topic here  anyway"" can be uttered with less backlash than saying Shakespeare is hard or various other difficult reads (those tend to get arguments of, ""but it's worth it in the end"" or similar). So I picked up this book cheap a long while back thinking that this would talk about the various branches of math and how knowing math is important, especially in today's data driven age.I wanted a personal essay that dove into the general ideas of math and illuminated for the innumerate the immense possibilities of logical thinking and got a treatise on the importance of estimation, big numbers, and statistics. This book is full of specific examples of how poor number sense and poor statistical sense can lead to misinterpretations ... but it never felt like enough. I kept wanting more from the book - more passion, more generalized ideas, more generalized concepts, more examples of everyday math folks ignore when saying they ""can't"" do math - and didn't get it. Which means, I think, I came into the book with expectations beyond what the author could offer. What's present is well written - albeit the examples are short and explained so quickly that it took me, a high school math teacher who just taught basic probability, a couple of rereads per section to fully follow the logic - and entertaining. It's also slightly dismissive of the innumerate; tending towards the ""lukewarm water"" (a la The Bible's ""Revelations"" letter) of anger. Either get boiling hot and talk about how innumeracy can translate into stupidity OR move the dial to the other side and focus on the dangers of misunderstanding the concept (or listening to purposeful misinterpretations) without mentioning a willful ignorance of math. Trying to walk the line between the two extremes just fell flat for me.Maybe there's another book out there that will better suit my wants. Something that will go beyond the statistics and bring up grids/graph theory/person hours/tax brackets/etc. else we tempt the pedagogical gods to saying ""math must be a path to stats"" (right now it's the equally false ""math must be a path too calculus""). Why don't we dive into the possible sources of our society's math phobia/reverence? Why do we allow the myth that only smart people can ""do math"" (a phrase as silly as ""do science"")? Where did that myth come from? What is the fallout from that myth? Why do we allow the myth that calculus is an end-goal for math to exist? Gatekeeping is not healthy ... where did this come from and what cycles does that perpetuate? I want a book heavier on the social science view of mathematics in culture. This book is simply quite a few examples of logical fallacies that are easy to fall into without a clear understanding of the conceptual underpinnings of statistics + a chapter of big numbers and making sense of them. It's good, but not what I want."
13,0809058405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1734486-gina,2,"There are some good ideas and points in here. If part of the book's purpose is to raise the comfort level of the reader with certain concepts, then there are probably too many places where it throws in a formula too quickly, causing less numerate minds to glance away.I do appreciate the author's clear love of math, and there are several good examples. There are also things he misses. For example, one of the sections focuses on normal fluctuations, like how one shooter in a basketball game may have a good streak and then a bad streak without either having a lot of significance. That's true to a point, but there are many factors that can affect that besides normal ups and downs - amount of practice, sore muscles, more aggressive guarding. Part of making math relevant should be getting away from pure math, but then when it is applied you can't just ignore the factors that are not easily broken down into math. He does acknowledge that to some extent, but the book still has various frustrations."
14,0809058405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13058964-doug,5,"I read this when first published in the late 80s and was then struck by how important the ideas in were to everyone. I'd not thought of the book again until reading Factfulness by Rosling. Although sometimes a bit of a slog and with a few dated references, Innumeracy remains a must-read for anyone who values rational thinking about the world around them."

What about trillions? Modern Homo sapiens is probably less than 10 trillion seconds old.4/ Two strangers from opposite sides of the United States sit next to each other on a business trip to Milwaukee and discover that the wife of one of them was in the tennis camp run by an acquaintance of the other. This sort of coincidence is surprisingly common. If we assume each of the approximately 200 million adults in the United States knows about 1,500 people, and that these 1,500 people are reasonably spread out around the country, then the probability is about one in a hundred that they will have an acquaintance in common, and more than ninety-nine in a hundred that they will be linked by a chain of two intermediates.5/ There’s always enough random success to justify almost anything to someone who wants to believe. 6/ Some would-be adviser puts a logo on some fancy stationery and sends out 32,000 letters to potential investors in a stock index. The letters tell of his company’s elaborate computer model, his financial expertise, and inside contacts. In 16,000 of these letters, he predicts the index will rise, and in the other 16,000, he predicts a decline. No matter whether the index rises or falls, a follow-up letter is sent, but only to the 16,000 people who initially received a correct ‘prediction.’ To 8,000 of them, a rise is predicted for the next week; to the other 8,000, a decline. Whatever happens now, 8,000 people will have received two correct predictions. Again, to these 8,000 people only, letters are sent concerning the index’s performance the following week: 4,000 predicting a rise; 4,000, a decline. Whatever the outcome, 4,000 people have now received three straight correct predictions. This is iterated a few more times until 500 people have received six straight correct ‘predictions.’ These 500 people are now reminded of this and told that in order to continue to receive this valuable information for the seventh week they must each contribute $500. If they all pay, that’s $250,000 for our adviser.7/ There is a strong general tendency to filter out the bad and the failed and to focus on the good and the successful. Casinos encourage this tendency by making sure that every quarter that’s won in a slot machine causes lights to blink and makes its own little tinkle in the metal tray. Seeing all the lights and hearing all the tinkles, it’s not hard to get the impression that everyone’s winning. Losses or failures are silent.8/ Because people usually focus upon winners and extremes whether they be in sports, the arts, or the sciences, there’s always a tendency to denigrate today’s sports figures, artists, and scientists by comparing them with extraordinary cases. A related consequence is that international news is usually worse than national news, which in turn is usually worse than state news, which is worse than local news, which is worse than the news in your particular neighborhood.9/ Coincidences or extreme values catch the eye, but average or ‘expected’ values are generally more informative10/ Astrology maintains that the gravitational attraction of the planets at the time of one’s birth somehow has an effect on one’s personality. This seems very difficult to swallow, for two reasons: (a) no physical or neurophysiological mechanism through which this gravitational (or another sort of) attraction is supposed to act is ever even hinted at, much less explained; and (b) the gravitational pull of the delivering obstetrician far outweighs that of the planet or planets involved. Remember that the gravitational force an object exerts on a body – say, a newborn baby – is proportional to the object’s mass but inversely proportional to the square of the distance of the object from the body – in this case, the baby. Does this mean that fat obstetricians deliver babies that have one set of personality characteristics, and skinny ones deliver babies that have quite different characteristics? These deficiencies of an astrological theory are less visible to the innumerate, who are not likely to concern themselves with mechanisms, and who are seldom interested in comparing magnitudes.11/ Most diseases or conditions (a) improve by themselves; (b) are self-limiting; or (c) even if fatal, seldom follow a strictly downward spiral. In each case, intervention, no matter how worthless, can appear to be quite efficacious. This becomes clearer if you assume the point of view of a knowing practitioner of fraudulent medicine. To take advantage of the natural ups and downs of any disease (as well as of any placebo effect), it’s best to begin your worthless treatment when the patient is getting worse. In this way, anything that happens can more easily be attributed to your wonderful and probably expensive intervention.If the patient improves, you take credit; if he remains stable, your treatment stopped his downward course. On the other hand, if the patient worsens, the dosage or intensity of the treatment was not great enough; if he dies, he delayed too long in coming to you. In any case, the few instances in which your intervention is successful will likely be remembered (not so few, if the disease in question is self-limiting), while the vast majority of failures will be forgotten and buried. Chance provides more than enough variation to account for the sprinkling of successes that will occur with almost any treatment; indeed, it would be a miracle if there weren’t any ‘miracle cures.’ 12/ What’s wrong with the following not quite impeccable logic? We know that 36 inches = 1 yard. Therefore, 9 inches = ¼ of a yard. Since the square root of 9 is 3 and the square root of ¼ is ½, we conclude that 3 inches = ½ yard!13/ Not being able to conclusively refute the claims does not constitute evidence for them.14/ If you walk down the main street of a resort town any summer night, for example, and see happy people holding hands, eating ice-cream cones, laughing, etc., it’s easy to begin to think that other people are happier, more loving, more productive than you are, and so become unnecessarily despondent. Yet it is precisely on such occasions that people display their good attributes, whereas they tend to hide and become ‘invisible’ when they are depressed. We should all remember that our impressions of others are usually filtered in this way and that our sampling of people and their moods are not random.15/ Any given individual, no matter how brilliant or rich or attractive he or she is is going to have serious shortcomings. Excessive concern with oneself makes it difficult to see this and thus can lead to depression as well as innumeracy16/ Bad things happen periodically, and they’re going to happen to somebody. Why not17/ Remember that rarity in itself leads to publicity, making rare events appear commonplace. Terrorist kidnappings and cyanide poisonings are given monumental coverage, with profiles of the distraught families, etc., yet the number of deaths due to smoking is roughly the equivalent of three fully loaded jumbo jets crashing each and every day of the year, more than 300,000 Americans annually. AIDS, as tragic as it is, pales in worldwide comparison to the more prosaic malaria, among other diseases. Alcohol abuse, which in this country is the direct cause of 80,000 to 100,000 deaths per year and a contributing factor in an additional 100,000 deaths, is by a variety of measures considerably more costly than drug abuse. It’s not hard to think of other examples (famines and even genocides scandalously underreported), but it’s necessary to remind ourselves of them periodically to keep our heads above the snow of media avalanches.18/ Very intelligent people can be expected to have intelligent offspring, but in general, the offspring will not be as intelligent as the parents. A similar tendency toward the average or mean holds for the children of very short parents, who are likely to be short, but not as short as their parents. If I throw twenty darts at a target and manage to hit the bulls-eye eighteen times, the next time I throw twenty darts, I probably won’t do as well. This phenomenon leads to nonsense when people attribute the regression to the mean as due to some particular scientific law, rather than to the natural behavior of any random quantity. If a beginning pilot makes a very good landing, it’s likely that his next one will not be as impressive. Likewise, if his landing is very bumpy, then, by chance alone, his next one will likely be better. Regression to the mean is a widespread phenomenon, with instances just about everywhere you look.19/ Judy is thirty-three, unmarried, and quite assertive. A magna cum laude graduate, she majored in political science in college and was deeply involved in campus social affairs, especially in anti-discrimination and anti-nuclear issues. Which statement is more probable? (a) Judy works as a bank teller. (b) Judy works as a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement. The answer, surprising to some, is that (a) is more probable than (b) since a single statement is always more probable than a conjunction of two statements. That I will get heads when I flip this coin is more probable than that I will get heads when I flip this coin and get a 6 when I roll that die.20/ We find that detail and vividness vary inversely with likelihood; the more vivid details there are to a story, the less likely the story is to be true21/ Choose between a sure $30,000 or an 80 percent chance of winning $40,000 and a 20 percent chance of winning nothing. Most people will take the $30,000 even though the average expected gain in the latter choice is $32,000 (40,000 × .8). What if the choices are either a sure loss of $30,000 or an 80 percent chance of losing $40,000 and a 20 percent chance of losing nothing? Here most people will take the chance of losing $40,000 in order to have a chance of avoiding any loss, even though the average expected loss in the latter choice is $32,000 (40,000 × .8). Tversky and Kahneman concluded that people tend to avoid risk when seeking gains, but choose risk to avoid losses.22/ An item whose price has been increased by 50 percent and then reduced by 50 percent has had a net reduction in price of 25 percent. A dress whose price has been ‘slashed’ 40 percent and then another 40 percent has been reduced in price by 64 percent, not 80 percent. The new toothpaste which reduces cavities by 200 percent is presumably capable of removing all of one’s cavities twice over, maybe once by filling them and once again by placing little bumps on the teeth where they used to be. The 200 percent figure, if it means anything at all, might indicate that the new toothpaste reduces cavities by, say 30 percent, compared to some standard toothpaste’s reduction of cavities by 10 percent (the 30 percent reduction being a 200 percent increase of the 10 percent reduction). The latter phrasing, while less misleading, is also less impressive, which explains why it isn’t used. The simple expedient of always asking oneself: ‘Percentage of what?’ is a good one to adopt. If profits are 12 percent, for example, is this 12 percent of costs, of sales, of last year’s profits, or of what?23/ According to government figures released in 1980, women earn 59 percent of what men do. Though it’s been quoted widely since then, the statistic isn’t strong enough to support the burden placed on it Without further detailed data not included in the study, it’s not clear what conclusions are warranted. Does the figure mean that for exactly the same jobs that men perform, women earn 59 percent of the men’s salaries? Does the figure take into account the increasing number of women in the workforce, and their age and experience? Does it take into account the relatively low-paying jobs many women have (clerical, teaching, nursing, etc.)? Does it take into account the fact that the husband’s job generally determines where a married couple will live? Does it take into account the higher percentage of women working toward a short-term goal? The answer to all these questions is no. The bald figure released merely stated that the median income of full-time women workers was 59 percent of that for men.24/ If each of the ten items needed for the manufacture of something or other has risen 8 percent, the total price has risen just 8 percent, not 80 percent. As I mentioned, a misguided local weathercaster once reported that there was a 50 percent chance of rain on Saturday and a 50 percent chance on Sunday, and so, he concluded, ‘it looks like a 100 percent chance of rain this weekend.’ Another weathercaster announced that it was going to be twice as warm the next day since the temperature would rise from 25 to 50."
19,0809058405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18980203-charles-eliot,2,"In ""Innumeracy"", John Allen Paulos argues that the level of mathematical illiteracy in the United States is shocking and unacceptable, that innumeracy has real and pernicious negative effects, and that it is promoted by poor teaching.It's a pity: I share Paulos's love for mathematics, and I agree with the message of ""Innumeracy"", but I find his approach glib and pompous. At one point he says he finds it hard to write at length, preferring brevity and concision. That's all well and good, but it can lead to being condescending and dismissive, to grumpy ranting instead of a full and detailed argument. (In extreme cases it can even lead to intellectual bullying: ""I know better than you, you're an idiot, convincing you is not worth my trouble, so I'm just going to bellow a bit"". Thankfully Paulos doesn't go this far, but he does hint in that direction from time to time.)Much of the same territory is covered better, and without the ranting, by Nate Silver in ""The Signal and the Noise"", and Leonard Mlodinow in ""The Drunkards Walk"".

24,0809058405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30485647-kevin,4,"Today’s book review is for: “Innumeracy: Mathematical Illiteracy And Its Consequences“, written by John Allen Paulos. The book is an overview of what the author believes are some of the symptoms (and solutions) of “innumeracy” (the math equivalent of illiteracy) in America. Paulos is a Professor of maths at Temple University (or was at the time of the publication). He is a bit of a math prodigy (at the very least precocious) and is kind of a cross between Richard Feynman, Malcolm Gladwell and Levitt & Dubner. Feynman – as a teacher – in converting technical (math) concepts into relatable images, Gladwell in writing for “the general public” consumption, and Levitt & Dubner (of “Freakonomics” fame) in both of the above plus quirky examples to illustrate his point.  This book is a quick (fast read) and short (135 pages) overview of some main concepts in math and how they are poorly taught / translated / communicated to the general public and, hence, the general distaste for maths during school and its avoidance post-formal education whenever possible.  Paulos’ proposition is that because maths are poorly taught, the general public grows up with a fear (and avoidance) of math for the rest of lives. One of his proposals is to take retired advanced math users (mathematicians, engineers, scientists) and have them teach in schools because the current maths teachers aren’t very good (for a number of reasons) – pun intended.  The author also reviews math concepts: scale (big and little), fractions, ratios, statistics, probabilities and pseudo-sciences. This overview / review is the strength of the book as it reminded me of many of the areas of math I’ve long since forgotten (for lack of use).  So, is this book any good? Does it make you feel numerate or innumerate? Does it help with the issue raised (innumeracy)? Yes. Both. And, no, or at least I don’t think so. Once I could get past the author’s ego / superiority complex, I actually quite enjoyed the book. It is a fast read and he does use his examples in a clear and sometimes humorous fashion. The text made me feel numerate. The work through examples innumerate. A few of the paragraphs had to be re-read to make sure I followed the explanations for why he was doing a particular calculation. For example, how many days is a million seconds? The author says eleven-ish. So, then how long is a billion seconds? Again, thirty something years. Now, the author actually worked out the numbers and provided the answers. The problem? Well, for me, the answer is 11(-ish) thousand days. I would never arbitrarily convert days to years. Not that I couldn’t; just that I wouldn’t. Why would I, unless specifically asked? And, for most purposes, I would have ball-parked it (1,000 days is almost 3 years, times 11 is “about” 33 years). It would not be entirely accurate, but even then, the author didn’t state he was accounting for leap years in his own calculations. His point was we “all” know how much a second is. What we don’t know (have a feeling for) is how big a number is a billion (or a million). My point is I’m not sure if my reaction means I’m personally numerate or innumerate. And, finally, simply pointing out a problem isn’t the same as offering a viable solution. I don’t think placing retired math users in schools is a workable solution. Teaching (across all of the non-adult years) is an art as much as it is a skill. Yes, you must be grounded in the material, but you must also be enthusiastic (about the subject and teaching) and relatable. I’m not convinced there is a vast pool of retired engineers and scientists just dying to teach grammar, middle and high school students (and each group has different requirements).  Final recommendation: Strong to highly recommended. As an overview of maths topics for the general public, I think this is a very valuable book. It is brief and has interesting examples. It is probably too simple for folks with college level math skills. It is probably too difficult for the truly innumerate. But, I think there is a wide, flat(ish) bell shaped curve of folks out there (probably 2 standard deviations on either side of the mean) who would gain from reading this book. Those below the mean because the writing and examples are clear and can be followed along with. Those above the curve, because the book will remind you how much you’ve forgotten since leaving school. I just wish the author had been a bit less patronizing of us non-math prodigies. "
25,0809058405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80750585-claudia,2,"Innumeracy is defined as 'unfamiliar with mathematical concepts and methods; unable to use mathematics; not numerate' {as per dictionary.com}.I had been reading an article a couple months ago about what could be basically called the mathematical illiteracy of our society. The difficulty that not only our youth are experiencing when dealing with any but the most basic of math skills but how this has been an on-going problem for decades. That dealing with numbers strikes terror in the minds of people today and according to this book - which is dated and having been published in 1988 - is due to our education. Not to denigrate any person willing to be an educator but even they are being failed by the system that is teaching them. Too many are not mathematically capable nor are they interested in teaching mathematics beyond the basics. Teaching schools showed little to no interest in providing a solid base while textbooks at that time were more lists of terms and names. And at each level of math education, the lack of an adequate background and foundation increases leaving more and more people disenchanted. When someone is actually ""mathematically inclined', the university levels are usually among the best but in too many cases, it is far too late for the majority. Math graduates are immediately scooped up by financial institutions, engineering, accounting and other such careers and rarely ever education.Paulos does give the interesting idea of having those retired from those professions possibly providing some classes but in turn, it would require them to return to college for a teaching certificate which most are unwilling to do.There are misconceptions regarding numbers and Mr. Paulos seems to take quite a lot of joy finding the most quirky situations to provide an example. Like below:A questionable stock broker sends out 16000 letters saying a stock will rise and 16000 letters saying it will fall. The stock falls so to the 16000 that got the initial falling letter, he sends out 8000 saying another stock will rise and 8000 that it will fall. This time the stock goes up so to the 8000 rising stock, he does the same again for 4000 and then to those 2000 and 1000 and finally to the last 500, he sends a letter saying he was right the previous 7 times and for $500, he'll tell you what is going to happen next. See the con? He's playing with the numbers and making a killing financially.Paulos talks about mathematical incompetence when looking at probability, scientific notation, polls and surveys, pseudoscience, games of chance, coincidence, logic, word problems, statistics, how questions and word problems are framed. That correlation and causality are not equal. And each area is liberally doses with some bizarre examples - how to figure how many miles per hour does human hair grow? How many 3-flavor cones can Baskin Robbins create with their 57 flavors without the repetition of a flavor within the cone? I must admit that Mr. Paulos and his constant influx of quirky situations and examples kept amusing and interesting (what next?) what could have easily been a very dry book. But I must admit I was looking for a bit more on what causes innumeracy and what could be done to stem this continual loss because these lacks are a drain on society. Resources could be distributed more efficiently. The focus on Core could be more productive. Enthusiastic people could go into various careers where they may make a difference if only they had that solid mathematical base needed for a few college credits.Look at newspapers and magazines and on-line games where sudoku are offered. I like the mental exercise they provide. When I get a 5* and 6* done, I can take pride. When I tell others about doing sudoku puzzles, the usual comment is 'oh, I can't do math.' These puzzles are not math - in my opinion. Solving them would be no different if letters were used, colored blocks, or various symbols. That numbers are utilized, they are automatically 'mathematical' and it scares people off. It's truly sad.And as computers take over more and more of the calculations needed during our lives, I don't see where this lack is going to be dealt with in the near future.Oh, human hair grows at .00000001 mph. Baskin Robbins triple scoops 26,970 variations"
26,0809058405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1041468-jerry-smith,3,"Quick, easy read despite the fact that this is essentially a book about mathematics, albeit the high levels of innumeracy that inflict most of our thoughts and discourse. I am totally on board with this and am probably one of the people referred to in the early pages here i.e. I hated maths at school and although I strive for an understanding of probability and stats in everyday thinking, anything complex hurts my brain somewhat.However, I think that Paulos is spot on here. Although written a couple of decades ago, the lessons are even more applicable today with the rise in the internet, short attention spans, cries of fake news, lack of critical thinking and the appalling feeling that everyone's opinion is equally vlid and that experts and hard facts are something to be suspicious of.I very much dislike that many people apparently have no understanding of even the most basic concepts of what is likely to be the case, what is probable, that correlation isn't causality and so on. This book addresses these fallacies, and others, at a fairly basic level and it is replete with anecdotes that make the more obtuse references clearer.It just seems a little dated to me. There are references to the work of Tversky and Kahneman that are covered in more detail in Michael Lewis's book but are nevertheless relevant here. I would like to see an update on the text (maybe I have an older edition) to cover the age of misinformation peddled by the denizens of the internet but that criticism is somewhat unfair and not the fault of the book. References to Reagan certainly give an impression of the context in which this was written.This sort of book is important. In many ways, stats and, especially, probability, are widely misunderstood and misapplied and we should all make ourselves more aware of how these things work. I fear that most people won't, and will continue with the thought that maths is an esoteric, impenetrable subject with limited, if any, relevance to day to day living. Actually the reverse is true and anything that contributes to an increase in critical thinking skills is OK by me. "
27,0809058405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15020212-boosh,4,"I think perhaps the best part of this book is that it exists - the very concept of innumeracy, just hearing the word, is one of those things that blows a hole wide open in your mind. The author does a great job of explaining how and why math is important and how we can suffer without a good understanding of it. The writing style is casual and engaging, and the examples are relevant and interesting. I have a few relatively minor complaints, which keep it from being 5 stars, but don't keep it from being an amazing, must read book. For one, the author is a bit soap-boxy, and despite his expressed hope in the beginning that his tone is not scolding, he does come off as a bit condescending, much like he is a contemporary of Dawkins. But, that doesn't mean he isn't right, and for those who enjoy the acerbic comedy of George Carlin, it wouldn't be a problem at all. My other complaint is that some of his arguments are poorly structured, but I am willing to forgive it because he is not really making any arguments that any reasonable person who would be reading the book would need to be air tight. They are just examples to carry fairly obvious, unarguable points, so their relevance is more important than their quality. Finally, a few careless and condescending comments about women in science with merely the ""required"" mention of the underlying sexism behind the reduced ratio of women in STEM left a sour taste in my mouth and makes me hesitant to google the author for fear of another Hitchin's style character take down. Anyway, those issues are minimal compared to the enormous value this book can bring by painting a broad picture of the various social consequences of a lack of mathematical fervor in our culture. It certainly made me want to learn calculus..."
28,0809058405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2108589-mark,2,"I read Jordan Ellenberg's How Not to be Wrong: The Power of Mathematical Thinking immediately before reading Innumeracy and there's a fair amount of overlap between the two. They both mention or discuss, for example, the birthday problem (why it only takes 23 people to have a 50% chance of two of them sharing a birthday), the ""Baltimore stockbroker"" scam, whether there's really such a thing as a hot hand in basketball, expected value (how much is that lottery ticket expected to be worth?), the law of large numbers, regression to the mean (why, for example, really tall parents usually have kids that are shorter than they are), and polling, elections, and the non-transitivity of voters' preferences (Condorcet's voting paradox). The big difference is that while Innumeracy may have gotten there first, How Not to be Wrong goes into more detail, explains the math much more clearly, and has a writing style that is leaps and bounds better than the one found here. Plus, How Not to be Wrong also goes into other interesting topics, like the real-world applications of non-Euclidean geometry. My recommendation: skip this and read Jordan Ellenberg's book instead."
29,0809058405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32494239-kudakwashe-mawunganidze,3,"This book was first published in 1988 and thus some of the examples require a priori familiarity with the historical context of that time. The book is about innumeracy and how it affects a lot of people and thus is used against them whether be it in pseudoscientific activities, gambling, and some common games. The author covers the main principles of math, with very common examples to aid in the understanding of the reader that may be innumerate. He then goes on to explain probability and coincidence, then he uses the previous two main subjects to explain and dismiss pseudoscience, which leads into him explaining why people fall into innumeracy. In closing he reiterates the concepts of statistics, and explains the benefits of not being innumerate especially in a society that aims to manipulate the innumeracy of people for profit. I found this book very interesting. Its main ideas are relevant even more-so today when more people are at risk of innumeracy and are targeted by various media in a way that exploits their innumeracy. I think it would be interesting if there could a be a newer edition of this book with updated examples to bring to light how innumeracy is taken advantage of in a way that can be relevant for the new generations who may not relate to some of the examples in the book. "
30,0809058405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86403606-kevin,5,"	Innumeracy is a book about how to not be ignorant of numbers and math. It focuses on statistics, as they are more prominent in our world than other types of math. The book starts off by explaining what it means to be innumerate. It then goes on to give examples of “innumerates.” Afterwards, it develops the idea of mathematical ignorance, and how it pervades the everyday life of most people. It talks about how people wrongly wear it as a badge of honor. It then goes on to explain how to not be innumerate, and gives several suggestions.	The word that this book can be described by is innumeracy, and all variations of it. The definition of innumeracy is being illiterate with numbers, both in the book and in a dictionary. This word is important in the book because it is what the book is about. It impacts the tone by making it sound more scholarly, more intelligent.	I greatly enjoyed this novel. It was educational, and I learned a good amount of information. It was complete, and left me feeling more knowledgeable. The book was intriguing, and had many real world examples that put what it was teaching into perspective. It explained the math that I needed to understand the concepts in the book. I like this book, and recommend it to anyone with the time to read it."

What distinguishes this from other such literature is that Paulos attempts top diagnose the root cause. His assessments are reasonable (taught as an abstract not applicable subject, the teachers don't understand it, kids don't learn it as puzzles), and I've made similar observations over my lifetime.Despite an occasional dose of dated references (gotta do something about that Strategic Defense Initiative) and mild sexism (suggests women avoid chem and econ classes because of math), this is a helpful look into why and how people understand numbers.My takeaway is to return to the fun parts of math that attracted me to the subject in the first place (puzzles and games), and an incentive to explain concepts to newcomers.A fast read, recommended to people who fear numbers but shouldn't. (So, everyone.)"
32,0809058405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5818273-alex,4,"Weighing in at 135 pages, the interesting-things-learned-per-page of this title is exceedingly high. There are simple examples to explain mathematical concepts (such as the difference between combination and permutation). There are insightful illustrations of how mathematics can save money (how many tests would you need to run on a room of 50 people to discover the one person with a disease? How many tests to find out if *anyone* in the room had the disease? The answers are surprising). How much weight should you put into getting back a positive reading on a test at the doctor's office? (it depends on the base rate of that disease in the population). For that matter, how mathematically literate is your doctor? If player 1 has the best average score in both halves of a season, is it possible for player 2 to have a higher average overall? Surprisingly - yes.All these stories and more contained within. Still as relevant in 2018 as it was in 1988. Highly recommend."
33,0809058405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34650950-mohammed-ghoul,5,"Innumeracy is the norm rather than the exception, especially so in countries with a crappy educational system, the average person (even the highly educated ones) is literally scared of mathematics. This off course results in people easily falling for pseudoscience and believing BS like horoscopes etc. this is in reality only a small part of the gigantean underlining problem of scientific illiteracy. This book is one my favorites for addressing this subject and simply demonstrating very useful math ideas that are perceived usually as rather complex. It also analyses several pseudoscientific claims not in a debunking fashion but rather to show the underlying mathematics behind these tricks and how they appear to work. the book is well written especially considering the relative fortitude of the topics it discusses."
34,0809058405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68566766-austin-sechrest,3,"Innumeracy brings to light many of the common mathematical and statistical errors that laypeople tend to make. While any book on such a topic will be relatively dry, Paulos does a good job of bringing in real-life examples to prove that math is not simply an esoteric discipline but rather something that everybody should understand.His explanations at times ignore common psychological principles in favor of a strictly mathematical analysis of situations, which in my opinion does a disservice to the applicability of some of his better arguments. That said, the analytical focus puts a critical lens on probabilistic principles we frequently encountered.It is essentially an intro stats class with less formulas and more interesting explanations. It’s not the most compelling read in the world, but teaches valuable lessons nonetheless."
35,0809058405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3964636-matt,3,"This book's ok. It's an interesting collection of mathematical demonstrations, though many of them, like the how-many-people-do-you-need-to-have-a-matching-birthday demonstration, have been through the wringer of pop consciousness so many times that they've reached repost quality. Not necessarily the book's fault though, since it's quite old. A lot of the ideas, including calculations of probability when speaking of psychic phenomenon, sound a lot like Richard Dawkins speaking, or any of the other popular debunkers of the late 2000's.I agree with the general idea that a baseline mathematical knowledge is important for understanding and building models of the real world, but overall the book didn't cover any exciting new ground. Once again though, maybe that's just because the book is somewhat old."
36,0809058405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86377461-jack-binzer,4,"I was hoping for a sort of social scientific analysis of the societal effects that mathematical illiteracy perpetuates, and there is some of that to an extent, but about 60% of the book is a lot of hypothetical scenarios about chance and probability. Also, Paulos focuses overwhelmingly on statistics, and doesn't mention any benefits of being good at algebra, calculus, geometry, fractals, etc. which I was hoping that the book would include.Nonetheless, I enjoyed reading this book very much and it is a very quick read. Paulos mentions how writing isn't his favorite, but he does a very good job writing the book and making it very interesting to read. This book is definitely off the main road for most genres, and for that reason, I think most people would enjoy the book. "
37,0809058405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21201326-joe-koelsch,3,"This book, like “How Not to be Wrong,” sets out to describe some of the most common examples of innumeracy and their consequences. Each of these examples is presented with real-world context that adds a richness to the mathematical ideas. However, the narrative structure of the book often falls flat, leaving only the mathematical concept to engage the reader. While most is presented in a way that a layperson can grasp, there are whole sections that devolve into esoterica. The effect, like a web md description, leaves the reader questioning his or her own innumeracy rather than providing any real helpful remedy."

In the day and age of fake news and the continued lack of critical thinking, this book will lay it all out. Sometimes it gets a bit too detailed in the numbers and calculations, but let that wash over you and remember the big takeaways. Even for me, an old engineer who has worked professionally in numbers for many years, it was a refreshing and poignant read."

My only issue with it is that for the first 70 pages or so the book mainly consists of mathematical principles (used later) along with several anecdotes--but not much coherent analysis of what innumeracy looks like or how to deal with it. Fortunately, the rest of the book past that deals with the main point quite well. Paulos examines several kinds of innumeracy (faulty logic, misunderstanding of statistics, etc.), where they come from, and, most importantly, why they are problematic."

An updated version of How to Lie with Statistics, but with a condescending tone that will turn off those who would benefit most - the innumerate.There were a number of anecdotes that were interesting and informative, but the way pseudoscience, astrology, etc. is treated means that the open minded and the fence-sitters will be pushed even further away from numeracy. That leaves this book as one that actually exacerbates the problem of innumeracy and ends up nothing more than a circle jerk for the numerate."

63,0809058405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34650950-mohammed-ghoul,5,"Innumeracy is the norm rather than the exception, especially so in countries with a crappy educational system, the average person (even the highly educated ones) is literally scared of mathematics. This off course results in people easily falling for pseudoscience and believing BS like horoscopes etc. this is in reality only a small part of the gigantean underlining problem of scientific illiteracy. This book is one my favorites for addressing this subject and simply demonstrating very useful math ideas that are perceived usually as rather complex. It also analyses several pseudoscientific claims not in a debunking fashion but rather to show the underlying mathematics behind these tricks and how they appear to work. the book is well written especially considering the relative fortitude of the topics it discusses."
64,0809058405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68566766-austin-sechrest,3,"Innumeracy brings to light many of the common mathematical and statistical errors that laypeople tend to make. While any book on such a topic will be relatively dry, Paulos does a good job of bringing in real-life examples to prove that math is not simply an esoteric discipline but rather something that everybody should understand.His explanations at times ignore common psychological principles in favor of a strictly mathematical analysis of situations, which in my opinion does a disservice to the applicability of some of his better arguments. That said, the analytical focus puts a critical lens on probabilistic principles we frequently encountered.It is essentially an intro stats class with less formulas and more interesting explanations. It’s not the most compelling read in the world, but teaches valuable lessons nonetheless."
65,0809058405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3964636-matt,3,"This book's ok. It's an interesting collection of mathematical demonstrations, though many of them, like the how-many-people-do-you-need-to-have-a-matching-birthday demonstration, have been through the wringer of pop consciousness so many times that they've reached repost quality. Not necessarily the book's fault though, since it's quite old. A lot of the ideas, including calculations of probability when speaking of psychic phenomenon, sound a lot like Richard Dawkins speaking, or any of the other popular debunkers of the late 2000's.I agree with the general idea that a baseline mathematical knowledge is important for understanding and building models of the real world, but overall the book didn't cover any exciting new ground. Once again though, maybe that's just because the book is somewhat old."

Also, Paulos focuses overwhelmingly on statistics, and doesn't mention any benefits of being good at algebra, calculus, geometry, fractals, etc. which I was hoping that the book would include.Nonetheless, I enjoyed reading this book very much and it is a very quick read. Paulos mentions how writing isn't his favorite, but he does a very good job writing the book and making it very interesting to read. This book is definitely off the main road for most genres, and for that reason, I think most people would enjoy the book. "

Each of these examples is presented with real-world context that adds a richness to the mathematical ideas. However, the narrative structure of the book often falls flat, leaving only the mathematical concept to engage the reader. While most is presented in a way that a layperson can grasp, there are whole sections that devolve into esoterica. The effect, like a web md description, leaves the reader questioning his or her own innumeracy rather than providing any real helpful remedy."

Sometimes it gets a bit too detailed in the numbers and calculations, but let that wash over you and remember the big takeaways.

Fortunately, the rest of the book past that deals with the main point quite well.

I clearly understood the outline of the book when I was reading, although many subtitles in the chapters overwhelmed me. I don’t know why the author mentioned them. What are the morals, lessons, or coherency? The book was written in 1988 and the second edition was published in 2000. Since then, I believe there are many books about innumeracy and pseudoscience were published, such as How Not to Be Wrong: The Power of Mathematical Thinking and Bad Science. Thus, the book is not a must-read nowadays. However, the book indeed is thought-provoking, making me reconsider my ability of dealing numbers, triggering more enthusiasm of mathematics, and most of all, recognizing biased perceptions I repeat constantly.The first time I read the book I only understood half of it, the second time I understood more, and I believe I will comprehend more after each more time. As the author suggested, one way to be less innumerate is through continuous practice on different mathematical questions. The book exercised my brain muscle which I haven’t operated for some time. Brain, as an organ can be developed without limitation should not be wasted. It’s a trait distinguishes humankind from other species after all. Mathematics, as one of the greatest humankind’s concrete discover of the universal rules deserves better understanding of its beauty. I could feel the passion and eagerness the author tried to convey and became more curious and interested to know more about the mathematics. My goal of reading the book is perfectly fulfilled."

120,0809058405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86403606-kevin,5,"	Innumeracy is a book about how to not be ignorant of numbers and math. It focuses on statistics, as they are more prominent in our world than other types of math. The book starts off by explaining what it means to be innumerate. It then goes on to give examples of “innumerates.” Afterwards, it develops the idea of mathematical ignorance, and how it pervades the everyday life of most people. It talks about how people wrongly wear it as a badge of honor. It then goes on to explain how to not be innumerate, and gives several suggestions.	The word that this book can be described by is innumeracy, and all variations of it. The definition of innumeracy is being illiterate with numbers, both in the book and in a dictionary. This word is important in the book because it is what the book is about. It impacts the tone by making it sound more scholarly, more intelligent.	I greatly enjoyed this novel. It was educational, and I learned a good amount of information. It was complete, and left me feeling more knowledgeable. The book was intriguing, and had many real world examples that put what it was teaching into perspective. It explained the math that I needed to understand the concepts in the book. I like this book, and recommend it to anyone with the time to read it."

What distinguishes this from other such literature is that Paulos attempts top diagnose the root cause. His assessments are reasonable (taught as an abstract not applicable subject, the teachers don't understand it, kids don't learn it as puzzles), and I've made similar observations over my lifetime.Despite an occasional dose of dated references (gotta do something about that Strategic Defense Initiative) and mild sexism (suggests women avoid chem and econ classes because of math), this is a helpful look into why and how people understand numbers.My takeaway is to return to the fun parts of math that attracted me to the subject in the first place (puzzles and games), and an incentive to explain concepts to newcomers.A fast read, recommended to people who fear numbers but shouldn't.

There are simple examples to explain mathematical concepts (such as the difference between combination and permutation). There are insightful illustrations of how mathematics can save money (how many tests would you need to run on a room of 50 people to discover the one person with a disease? How many tests to find out if *anyone* in the room had the disease? The answers are surprising). How much weight should you put into getting back a positive reading on a test at the doctor's office? (it depends on the base rate of that disease in the population). For that matter, how mathematically literate is your doctor?

It focuses on statistics, as they are more prominent in our world than other types of math. The book starts off by explaining what it means to be innumerate. It then goes on to give examples of “innumerates.” Afterwards, it develops the idea of mathematical ignorance, and how it pervades the everyday life of most people. It talks about how people wrongly wear it as a badge of honor. It then goes on to explain how to not be innumerate, and gives several suggestions.	The word that this book can be described by is innumeracy, and all variations of it. The definition of innumeracy is being illiterate with numbers, both in the book and in a dictionary. This word is important in the book because it is what the book is about. It impacts the tone by making it sound more scholarly, more intelligent.	I greatly enjoyed this novel. It was educational, and I learned a good amount of information. It was complete, and left me feeling more knowledgeable.

How many tests to find out if *anyone* in the room had the disease? The answers are surprising). How much weight should you put into getting back a positive reading on a test at the doctor's office?

It focuses on statistics, as they are more prominent in our world than other types of math. The book starts off by explaining what it means to be innumerate. It then goes on to give examples of “innumerates.” Afterwards, it develops the idea of mathematical ignorance, and how it pervades the everyday life of most people. It talks about how people wrongly wear it as a badge of honor. It then goes on to explain how to not be innumerate, and gives several suggestions.	The word that this book can be described by is innumeracy, and all variations of it. The definition of innumeracy is being illiterate with numbers, both in the book and in a dictionary. This word is important in the book because it is what the book is about. It impacts the tone by making it sound more scholarly, more intelligent.	I greatly enjoyed this novel. It was educational, and I learned a good amount of information. It was complete, and left me feeling more knowledgeable. The book was intriguing, and had many real world examples that put what it was teaching into perspective. It explained the math that I needed to understand the concepts in the book. I like this book, and recommend it to anyone with the time to read it."
211,0809058405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1800600-nathan,4,"One of countless books written for those who struggle dealing with numbers in any form. What distinguishes this from other such literature is that Paulos attempts top diagnose the root cause. His assessments are reasonable (taught as an abstract not applicable subject, the teachers don't understand it, kids don't learn it as puzzles), and I've made similar observations over my lifetime.Despite an occasional dose of dated references (gotta do something about that Strategic Defense Initiative) and mild sexism (suggests women avoid chem and econ classes because of math), this is a helpful look into why and how people understand numbers.My takeaway is to return to the fun parts of math that attracted me to the subject in the first place (puzzles and games), and an incentive to explain concepts to newcomers.A fast read, recommended to people who fear numbers but shouldn't. (So, everyone.)"
212,0809058405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5818273-alex,4,"Weighing in at 135 pages, the interesting-things-learned-per-page of this title is exceedingly high. There are simple examples to explain mathematical concepts (such as the difference between combination and permutation). There are insightful illustrations of how mathematics can save money (how many tests would you need to run on a room of 50 people to discover the one person with a disease? How many tests to find out if *anyone* in the room had the disease? The answers are surprising). How much weight should you put into getting back a positive reading on a test at the doctor's office? (it depends on the base rate of that disease in the population). For that matter, how mathematically literate is your doctor? If player 1 has the best average score in both halves of a season, is it possible for player 2 to have a higher average overall? Surprisingly - yes.All these stories and more contained within. Still as relevant in 2018 as it was in 1988. Highly recommend."
213,0809058405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34650950-mohammed-ghoul,5,"Innumeracy is the norm rather than the exception, especially so in countries with a crappy educational system, the average person (even the highly educated ones) is literally scared of mathematics. This off course results in people easily falling for pseudoscience and believing BS like horoscopes etc. this is in reality only a small part of the gigantean underlining problem of scientific illiteracy. This book is one my favorites for addressing this subject and simply demonstrating very useful math ideas that are perceived usually as rather complex. It also analyses several pseudoscientific claims not in a debunking fashion but rather to show the underlying mathematics behind these tricks and how they appear to work. the book is well written especially considering the relative fortitude of the topics it discusses."
214,0809058405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68566766-austin-sechrest,3,"Innumeracy brings to light many of the common mathematical and statistical errors that laypeople tend to make. While any book on such a topic will be relatively dry, Paulos does a good job of bringing in real-life examples to prove that math is not simply an esoteric discipline but rather something that everybody should understand.His explanations at times ignore common psychological principles in favor of a strictly mathematical analysis of situations, which in my opinion does a disservice to the applicability of some of his better arguments. That said, the analytical focus puts a critical lens on probabilistic principles we frequently encountered.It is essentially an intro stats class with less formulas and more interesting explanations. It’s not the most compelling read in the world, but teaches valuable lessons nonetheless."
215,0809058405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3964636-matt,3,"This book's ok. It's an interesting collection of mathematical demonstrations, though many of them, like the how-many-people-do-you-need-to-have-a-matching-birthday demonstration, have been through the wringer of pop consciousness so many times that they've reached repost quality. Not necessarily the book's fault though, since it's quite old. A lot of the ideas, including calculations of probability when speaking of psychic phenomenon, sound a lot like Richard Dawkins speaking, or any of the other popular debunkers of the late 2000's.I agree with the general idea that a baseline mathematical knowledge is important for understanding and building models of the real world, but overall the book didn't cover any exciting new ground. Once again though, maybe that's just because the book is somewhat old."

Also, Paulos focuses overwhelmingly on statistics, and doesn't mention any benefits of being good at algebra, calculus, geometry, fractals, etc. which I was hoping that the book would include.Nonetheless, I enjoyed reading this book very much and it is a very quick read. Paulos mentions how writing isn't his favorite, but he does a very good job writing the book and making it very interesting to read. This book is definitely off the main road for most genres, and for that reason, I think most people would enjoy the book. "
217,0809058405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21201326-joe-koelsch,3,"This book, like “How Not to be Wrong,” sets out to describe some of the most common examples of innumeracy and their consequences. Each of these examples is presented with real-world context that adds a richness to the mathematical ideas. However, the narrative structure of the book often falls flat, leaving only the mathematical concept to engage the reader. While most is presented in a way that a layperson can grasp, there are whole sections that devolve into esoterica. The effect, like a web md description, leaves the reader questioning his or her own innumeracy rather than providing any real helpful remedy."

It was educational, and I learned a good amount of information. It was complete, and left me feeling more knowledgeable. The book was intriguing, and had many real world examples that put what it was teaching into perspective. It explained the math that I needed to understand the concepts in the book. I like this book, and recommend it to anyone with the time to read it."

What distinguishes this from other such literature is that Paulos attempts top diagnose the root cause. His assessments are reasonable (taught as an abstract not applicable subject, the teachers don't understand it, kids don't learn it as puzzles), and I've made similar observations over my lifetime.Despite an occasional dose of dated references (gotta do something about that Strategic Defense Initiative) and mild sexism (suggests women avoid chem and econ classes because of math), this is a helpful look into why and how people understand numbers.My takeaway is to return to the fun parts of math that attracted me to the subject in the first place (puzzles and games), and an incentive to explain concepts to newcomers.A fast read, recommended to people who fear numbers but shouldn't.

There are simple examples to explain mathematical concepts (such as the difference between combination and permutation). There are insightful illustrations of how mathematics can save money (how many tests would you need to run on a room of 50 people to discover the one person with a disease? How many tests to find out if *anyone* in the room had the disease? The answers are surprising). How much weight should you put into getting back a positive reading on a test at the doctor's office? (it depends on the base rate of that disease in the population). For that matter, how mathematically literate is your doctor? If player 1 has the best average score in both halves of a season, is it possible for player 2 to have a higher average overall? Surprisingly - yes.All these stories and more contained within.

This book is one my favorites for addressing this subject and simply demonstrating very useful math ideas that are perceived usually as rather complex.

Not necessarily the book's fault though, since it's quite old. A lot of the ideas, including calculations of probability when speaking of psychic phenomenon, sound a lot like Richard Dawkins speaking, or any of the other popular debunkers of the late 2000's.I agree with the general idea that a baseline mathematical knowledge is important for understanding and building models of the real world, but overall the book didn't cover any exciting new ground.

I clearly understood the outline of the book when I was reading, although many subtitles in the chapters overwhelmed me. I don’t know why the author mentioned them. What are the morals, lessons, or coherency? The book was written in 1988 and the second edition was published in 2000. Since then, I believe there are many books about innumeracy and pseudoscience were published, such as How Not to Be Wrong: The Power of Mathematical Thinking and Bad Science. Thus, the book is not a must-read nowadays. However, the book indeed is thought-provoking, making me reconsider my ability of dealing numbers, triggering more enthusiasm of mathematics, and most of all, recognizing biased perceptions I repeat constantly.The first time I read the book I only understood half of it, the second time I understood more, and I believe I will comprehend more after each more time. As the author suggested, one way to be less innumerate is through continuous practice on different mathematical questions. The book exercised my brain muscle which I haven’t operated for some time. Brain, as an organ can be developed without limitation should not be wasted. It’s a trait distinguishes humankind from other species after all. Mathematics, as one of the greatest humankind’s concrete discover of the universal rules deserves better understanding of its beauty. I could feel the passion and eagerness the author tried to convey and became more curious and interested to know more about the mathematics. My goal of reading the book is perfectly fulfilled."

I like math, feel comfortable with the material, and could enjoy reading about it but felt patronized and distracted during this read."
289,0809058405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52146013-michael-coca,5,"Having liked math in school, I take for granted the usefulness of understanding basic mathematical concepts but overlook the social effects of poor understanding of math, which Mr. Paulos makes clear are powerful and wide ranging. The book itself is brief and easy to read, credit to the author for making such a strong case in such a short book. It's tragically funny in parts. Good read."
290,0809058405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8171625-seth,4,I enjoyed the second half a lot more than the first half. I think he failed to consider some very important truths that would keep math from being the ultimate answer to our problems. The second half was much more what I was looking for in the book. I appreciated some of his arguments for the importance of math in today's society. 
291,0809058405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19677315-jordan,3,"While I agree with much of what Paulos says, I think he could benefit from some considerations of psychology and individual context. Some of his examples of ""easy"" estimations rely on background knowledge that not everyone would have, and at several points he seems to be fighting against the human brain's penchant for pattern recognition. Informative and short, if not super engaging."
292,0809058405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3701841-kevin-knowles,4,"As someone who's definitely innumerate, I really enjoyed the examples Paulos gave about common errors since statistics are often held up as fact when they are incredibly manipulative. The weakest section was the solutions since, while the math holds up, the public policy doesn't. Still, it's great for taking selections depending on what type of innumeracy one encounters."
293,0809058405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60608044-jose,5,"GREAT READINGAs the reader is able to acknowledge, numbers are everywhere in our lives, we can not deny them or think we can live without them. The proper leverage of numbers in our life will give us a complete feeling of fullfillness. Getting to know how to reason numbers is also very important for humanity in order to a quick reaction or in order not to."
294,0809058405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42116571-simon,4,"A fairly accessible book for the innumerate or failed university maths students. A call to challenge and think more deeply about stats, polls and ""what are the chances of THAT happening?"" claims. Gets a little complex in places but you can skip any bits you choose to, without losing the plot (fugurately or literally!)."
295,0809058405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46140-cathy,4,"John Allen Paulos explains how innumeracy causes people to make illogical statements with all kinds of mathematical problems. This confusion is caused by poor math teachers. Therefore, as a teacher, bring in probability and reasoning into your teaching. This was an interesting read, eventhough I skimmed a great deal of it. I read this book back in 2002 when I was still teaching."
296,0809058405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82854918-adam-shirey,4,"A good book on mathematical (il)literacy for the layperson. Personally, having taken courses on and done work with combinatorics, statistics, conditional probability, etc., it was a bit less interesting. I'd suggest it for someone who wants to get a better grasp on concepts that may not be intuitive."
297,0809058405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/114429576-min-han,4,"The purpose of the book is clear: Rising the notion of innumerate prevalence and the consequences caused. I clearly understood the outline of the book when I was reading, although many subtitles in the chapters overwhelmed me. I don’t know why the author mentioned them. What are the morals, lessons, or coherency? The book was written in 1988 and the second edition was published in 2000. Since then, I believe there are many books about innumeracy and pseudoscience were published, such as How Not to Be Wrong: The Power of Mathematical Thinking and Bad Science. Thus, the book is not a must-read nowadays. However, the book indeed is thought-provoking, making me reconsider my ability of dealing numbers, triggering more enthusiasm of mathematics, and most of all, recognizing biased perceptions I repeat constantly.The first time I read the book I only understood half of it, the second time I understood more, and I believe I will comprehend more after each more time. As the author suggested, one way to be less innumerate is through continuous practice on different mathematical questions. The book exercised my brain muscle which I haven’t operated for some time. Brain, as an organ can be developed without limitation should not be wasted. It’s a trait distinguishes humankind from other species after all. Mathematics, as one of the greatest humankind’s concrete discover of the universal rules deserves better understanding of its beauty. I could feel the passion and eagerness the author tried to convey and became more curious and interested to know more about the mathematics. My goal of reading the book is perfectly fulfilled."
298,0809058405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90976316-tyler-mangini,3,"A decent refresher on the importance of appropriately applying probability to our every day decisions. Paulos often talks down to those he calls “innumerate”, however, which was off putting. Didn’t feel like a message that could be easily shared to convert those he had labeled as not understanding. "
299,0809058405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12658999-anthony-faber,5,"A reread. Still a great book, and non math people will get things out of it. I noticed a few minor errors but I'm just a nit-picker. For example, in the poem of the man going to St. Ives, the man could have met the man with 7 wives, etc. by overtaking them, so the answer may not be 1."
