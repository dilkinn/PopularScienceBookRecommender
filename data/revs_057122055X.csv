0,057122055X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2822490-sheffielder,1,"A disappointing book given the author's previous excellent track record.The author should definitely have consulted a computer scientist before writing the early chapters, as he has completely misunderstood what a ""universal"" computer (= Turing machine) is, and some of the material is simply wrong. A universal computer is definitely NOT capable of simulating ""any conceivable machine"" - when used in this context, the word ""universal"" is a technical term, and means only that any other Turing machine behaviour can be simulated. It is easy to envisage machines that cannot be simulated by a universal computer, e.g. true random number generators, and machines equipped with non-recursive oracles.Similarly, the argument presented that physical arrangements of matter (e.g. Elvis) must be duplicated throughout the universe is logically invalid, since it is based on the assumption that if a container can hold at most N items, then each item can only occupy one of N positions in that container. But this is only true if the container is full. For example, a box may only hold 12 apples when full, but when it's empty you can place a single apple anywhere you want within it (and as Chown points out, the universe is nowhere near being full). Since multi-body systems can be chaotic, the exact initial placement of matter needs to be taken into account, and we're told by Chown that this was essentially random. In a chaotic system, even a tiny difference in initial conditions can lead to systems becoming unrecognisably different as time passes. So the argument presented that different regions of the universe are ""guaranteed"" to have evolved identically is a logical non-starter."

2,057122055X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4331887-steve,3,"If you already have a basic grasp of cosmology and fancy a highly (and I mean highly) speculative detour away from established theories into the realm of fringe topics such as whether we might be living in a computer simulation or where we might begin to look for a possible message from the creator of our universe, then you should find this an entertaining enough read, even if you question some of the conclusions. At times it risks straying into theological territory, but not in a Bible-bashing way - for example, Chown relays the proposal of one physicist that the purpose of life might be to create an omnipotent and omniscient super-intelligence. That's the kind of book this is. It has its faults - several glaring grammatical errors towards the end, and it's also strangely repetitive in parts, making it feel somewhat disjointed. Despite that, it's hard not to find the concepts he relays fascinating. Just don't expect to learn too much from it."
3,057122055X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2976142-thomas-edmund,3,"This book came to me by an unusual route - a friend from up north sent it to us thinking it was ours (the bookmark in it was a plane ticket with my wife's name on it) we had never heard of it.Nonetheless I gave the book a read, the premise seemed great and one of my goals is to read non-fiction outside of my usual (special) interests.Overall the book was lackluster. I found myself struggling a little with the physics, although at the same time I suspect someone well qualified in the area would probably have a better understanding that what was presented here. Thusly one questions who this book is for?The 2nd and 3rd sections were the strongest, the 1st felt like an endless repetition of the question: If there was a big bang why is the universe so consistent? "
4,057122055X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/277552-matt,4,"I really liked it at first. It's definitely interesting stuff, and goes a long way to try and make current theories understandable, but the line between likely-but-untested theory and madcap-but-interesting is perhaps a little too blurred for the sake of making the book a good read. It's not clear, for example, how many people take Wolfram's simulation theory seriously, or between the competing theories on Inflation, false vaccuum vs colliding branes, etc. So it's really interesting stuff, and very readable, but it's not a very good guide to scientific consensus. My 3-star rating's probably a little unfair, in retrospect. "
5,057122055X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53483800-alyson-walton,3,"A little upset that I didn't find this book as interesting as other books I've read by the same author. I'm not sure if this is my fault or not but this wasn't as pleasurable a read as others. if I had to pick a favourite part, this would be the section about omega. I wouldn't want to out anyone off reading this but I would look at other titles first."
6,057122055X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/97575265-anthony,3,Interesting ideas although I must admit to being somewhat disturbed at the prospect of spending eternity in a computer generated universe with a happy Hitler.
7,057122055X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5945208-kriegslok,4,"Sadly I never really took much interest in science at school and mathematics was and still is something of an enigma to me. I got stuck into the so called social sciences, however, the more disillusioned I've become with these the more fascinated I am by the world of the natural sciences. A while ago I decided I needed to try to get my head around Quantum Theory which is how I came across Marcus Chown with his Quantum Theory Cannot Hurt You. That book did hurt my head and gave me an idea of the complexity of the subject, however, I did get some of it and it wetted my appetite for further reading in the field. While Quantum Theory proves that science fact is at least as strange as the wilder science fiction, if not more so, The Never Ending Days of Being Dead goes into overdrive to outdo the whackiest of SF. Chown explores all sorts of what I would term ""Wild end of the spectrum"" thories that are apparantly not incompatible with current science modelling. These range from parallel universes to our existence being possibly no more than as part of a computer simulation. It is difficult to see in a lot of this where the science stops and the philosophy takes over, although perhaps it is more a case of the two becoming enmeshed and a bluring of the line between disciplines! A large part of this book went over my head despite my best efforts, however, it made me think and posed some interesting challenges as well as the frequent feeling that some people working in the field have lost all sense of reality behind. The problem is the whole book seems to be challenging our very notions of comfortable reality - which according to cutting edge reseach and the slamming of bits of raw matter together at very high speeds is actually pretty much a subjective illusion that makes it possible for our highly under evolved selves to cope with daily life on this baffling lump of rock in an infinitely baffling cosmos which we know a surprising amount about, or at least enough to know it's one damn wierd place! Once you've read a bit on this subject matter picking up a mug of tea is never going to be quite the same again!"
8,057122055X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5867447-sarah,1,"Abandoned at 41%.Nothing new here in terms of content or presentation - which is fine, the thing about this end of physics is you can read it again and again and again with the eventual hope of some of it making sense.For me, I'm beginning to find physics without maths too woolly. It's not that I actually want tensor calculus in my bedtime reading, but when you've battled through learning it that way, reading it as qualitative description is somehow much less satisfying. This, clearly, is a fault with me, not the book.The real reason this got abandoned was the persistent description of quantum behaviour as 'schizophrenic'. I get that this is popular science, and so we're going to use a popular metaphor. But I think that as a science communicator, you should appreciate accuracy over what is a popular but damaging misconception.What really got me, though, was the repetition of 'schizophrenic behaviour'. Page after page after page after page. Surely a different word/phrase could have been found. If the phrase had been (mis)used once or twice, I'm sure I would have ignored it. But it simply got to the point that I decided that if it was used one more time, I'd put the book down. It got used one more time. So I put the book down, with more relief than regret."
9,057122055X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5906609-robert-batchelor,0,"A really fascinating book. Chown has a very insightful yet plain-speaking writing style which makes the innermost workings of Quantum Theory and the structure of the universe almost accessible. While in some places I think he could have gone into more detail, it would be unreasonable to expect the full details of this branch of physics in a popular science book. Often the full gravity (excuse the pun) of what the chapter is detailing is not revealed till the end of said chapter so sometimes the book reads almost like a thriller with the reader not quite sure how the movement of particles in a cloud chamber (for instance) will have any effect on the universe around them until it is revealed in the last few paragraphs.Altogether it is a very good book, but some of the ramifications of the ideas contained within it are mind-blowing to say the least. The book is a surprisingly satisfying read considering its whole message is that we still actually know remarkably little about the universe."
10,057122055X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13065012-mark-edon,5,"A wholly remarkable book. I like to think I read a lot of popular science but I still found plenty I'm here that was quite fresh to me. Marcus has realised that narrative mad analogy are both powerful and dangerous and so puts a lot of effort into searching out and perfecting the most illuminating and least confusing he can. He usually succeeds. Take a good grip on your view of the universe, it is about to be spun around and twisted about. I particularly appreciated the discussion of Godel which for the first time helped me understand what all the fuss was about. Think of it as a kind of total perspective vortex in book form and you won't be far wrong. A highly recommended read."
11,057122055X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89664-tim,4,"This is a geeky, cutting edge physics book. Very, very interesting (if you like that sort of thing). One of his calculations proves that if you walk 10^10^28 meters, you will run into yourself (how cool is that!!!) Another of his examples shows that the purpose of life may be to create God (instead of the other way around- that people at the moment just before the Big Crunch will have the energy required to essentially create The Matrix, thus, be God)."
12,057122055X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10570928-francisco-luis-ben-tez,4,"Una vez más Chown acerca el mundo cuántico al lector, prescindiendo de su complejo artefacto matemático. Aunque esta vez va más allá, al franquear fronteras de la física que van más allá de lo que la ciencia convencional acepta. El título es de por sí toda una declaración de intenciones: ""Los días interminables de estar muerto"", prepárare para un viaje a Multiversos, el Punto Omega y los pensamientos de Stephen Wolfram."
13,057122055X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27539140-mrsmamfa,3,"Finally finished this book, to say I've taken my time with it is an understatement. Such an interesting and at the same time complicated read, I feel like my head is about to explode from all the complex theories and ideas. Otherwise I loved it and definitely recommend it to anyone interested in physics, astronomy, SETI and more "
14,057122055X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1246141-iain,4,"Fascinating stuff about the ""latest"" questions about the universe. A nice amount of detail is given, but I couldn't help wanting some more. It also felt a little optimistic; I would have enjoyed some more conflicting opinions. Other then that, a real thought-provoker."
15,057122055X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32759349-tharmaraj-rajandran,4,A lovely read with not too much physics or astronomy jargon. Neither is it bogged down by heavy mathematics. It had a delicious style of writing too. Filled with thoughts and ideas that truly provokes the mind.
16,057122055X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2123513-janine,4,"Mindblowing, putting science into perspective"
17,057122055X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7552095-liz,3,"Really excellent ideas, but I do have some trouble with understanding the concepts involved. This is nothing to do with the book, rather, my own abilities! Fascinating all the same."
18,057122055X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/925926-sarah,3,"pop physics.OKA bit dumbed down I guess.Not the best ""pop"" quantum physics book I've read by a long shot"
19,057122055X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2597994-redbear,1,Read the first two chapters and lost interest. Normally I find this kind of stuff fascinating but for whatever reason not in the mood to finish this book. Nothing to do with the book.
