0,0671872346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/210421-bart,5,"I cannot recall the last time I enjoyed a book of any kind this much.There is a stark difference between the way a book like this was written in 1990 and the way such books are written just 25 years later. The author, then, had two assumptions: His reader did not know very much, and his reader was very intelligent. M. Mitchell Waldrop, subsequently, explains with brevity and sophistication every idea.Today's equivalent, a catastrophe like The Upright Thinkers, assumes the opposite: Today's reader knows everything, because of Google, and today's reader is a moron with a chipmunk's attention span. Therefore, stay in the first-person and make it glib!Anyway, here are some examples from the wonderful Complexity:It's essentially meaningless to talk about a complex adaptive system being in equilibrium: the system can never get there. It is always unfolding, always in transition. In fact, if the system ever does reach equilibrium, it isn't just stable. It's dead. And by the same token, there's no point in imagining that the agents in the system can ever ""optimize"" their fitness, or their utility, or whatever. The space of possibilities is too vast; they have no practical way of finding the optimum. The most they can do is change and improve themselves relative to what the other agents are doing. In short, complex adaptive systems are characterized by perpetual novelty. (p. 147)andHolland, however, saw such top-down conflict resolution as precisely the wrong way to go. Is the world such a simple and predictable place that you always know the best rule in advance? Hardly. And if the system has been told what to do in advance, then it's a fraud to call the thing artificial intelligence: the intelligence isn't in the program but in the programmer. No, Holland wanted control to be learned. He wanted to see it emerging from the bottom up, just as it did from the neural substrate of the brain. (p. 185)andIt's a lot like the difference between solids, where the atoms are locked into place, and fluids, where the atoms tumble over one another at random. But right in between the two extremes, he says, at a kind of abstract phase transition called ""the edge of chaos,"" you also find complexity: a class of behaviors in which the components of the system never quite lock into place, yet never quite dissolve into turbulence, either. These are the systems that are both stable enough to store information, and yet evanescent enough to transmit it. These are the systems that can be organized to perform complex computations, to react to the world, to be spontaneous, adaptive, and alive. (p. 293)This book is an intellectual experience that delights."

Now to me, it is merely an out of date popularization. It has only a qualitative description and few specifics. The science of that time and its pollyanna praise of invisible hands seems quaint now. Book from a different time that impressed a very callow younger me. I will leave the five-star rating out of respect for my impressionable younger self. I am still interested in the topic of complexity here is a 2020 video by Sean Carroll on the topic.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__aFw..."
2,0671872346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1257705-emily,1,"What can I say about this book? Complexity is one of my favorite topics - the world is made of individual agents reacting to limited local factors, and their interaction produces sophisticated emergent systems. Awesome. And this book manages to make it seem like a boring administrative task.Maybe I'm coming to this book too late. I've been seeing the world through complexity-colored glasses for years, so this book seemed plodding. Dull. No matter the discipline, Waldrop barely manages to capture the basics of complex systems. Maybe they were a difficult, new topic when this book was written in 1992. Maybe the ideas of the Santa Fe institute (WTF? Who cares?) have already managed to permeate all of academia enough to make it seem stupid. But I doubt it. More likely, this guy was trying to make a story out of an understanding that most scientific disciplines already have.This book is not an exploration of ideas: it's a history of academia - of one institute that apparently lays claim to the idea of emergence, and the old White guys who think they're revolutionary by thinking about it.Ugh, a pet peeve - Waldrop seems to think that the order of complex systems is somehow antithetical to evolution. Where did you come up with this nonsense? It's a huge revelation for him when someone comes close to reconciling them. The awesome thing about emergent systems is that the complexity comes about through evolution at the individual level! Have you even been listening?Anyway. Search Google for emergence, emergent systems, complex adaptive systems, flocking or schooling behavior, evolutionary algorithms, cellular automata, neural networks, self-organizing systems, or PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING ELSE REALLY COOL, and you'll get a better idea of complexity than this book would give you."
3,0671872346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/576548-jason,5,"This book tells the story of the people, places and events involved in the creation of the science of complexity. The story is told well and I found it difficult to put down. This is the only book that, upon finishing it, I have decided to re-read immediately... note: I am a geek quite enamored with fractals, chaos, and all things complex."
4,0671872346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4024817-otto-lehto,4,"The Santa Fe Institute is an influential interdisciplinary research institute. Since its inception in 1984, it has managed to bring together brilliant physicists, biologists, computer scientists, and economists under the novel banner of complexity (or complex adaptive systems) research. Intended for a popular mid-brow audience, Waldrop's book is a gossipy narration of the brief history of that institute, the people behind it, and the wild ideas it has nurtured. It wisely focuses on the brilliant and eccentric minds behind the institute - and there is no shortage of them at SFI! The cast is full of oddball luminaries, from the Nobel-prize winning physicist Murray Gell-Mann to the renegade evolutionary biologist Stuart Kauffman and the influential duo of heterodox economists, John Holland and W. Brian Arthur. The proverbial ""camera and mic"" are constantly pointed at one or more of the central characters. Helpfully, the chapters are structured around their life stories, ideas, and passions. The upside is that the reader gets an intimate journalistic account of their life stories. This makes the story flow smoothly and the book is quite a page turner. The downside of the journalistic narration is that the science is presented as a function of their passions and mostly taken as gospel. The author manages to explain the basic ideas of complexity science quite well but he lacks a certain amount of critical distance that belongs to popular science. While I am fully on board with complexity, this book makes it all sound a bit too evangelical. As someone who is actively working on the science of complexity, this book is ridiculously useful. But most people are not working in this field, so what can they expect to get out of it? I think that for anyone who is interested in scientific breakthroughs it is a unique and wonderful document that lifts up the curtain to how the academic sausage is made. And it offers some psychological insights into the driving passions of ambitious scientists. On the other hand, the fact that it focuses mostly on the sociology and administration of running an academic institute undoubtedly makes it disappointing to many readers. And since it uncritically hypes up the underlying science and even commits occasional scientific errors and misunderstandings (especially in the realms of economics and evolutionary theory), it is only middling as a scientific introduction to the ideas of complexity. But overall it deserves high praise for the groove of its prose, the excitement of its tone, the importance of its subject matter, and its unique level of access to world class thinkers. I hope that the book inspires people to see the importance of the work done at SFI. It is my fervent hope that developing better models of self-organization and complex adaptive systems can be used to develop a new language of a unified 21st century science. But this can only happen if people are able to connect strands of cutting edge research across disciplinary boundaries. This is why we need institutes like SFI - to cross those boundaries, to bridge those disciplines, and to remind people of their place in the cosmos as emergent phenomena between the quarks and the stars."
5,0671872346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30541335-jimmy-ele,5,"One of those books that kicked a door open into a whole other realm of a science that I have been looking for my whole life. Emergence, Complex Adaptive Systems, Ecology, Chaos Theory, Simplicity, Neural Networks, Embryology, Cell growth, Evolution, Computer Programming, Immunology, Artificial Intelligence, Human Intelligence, Mathematics, Economies, Earthquakes, Power Laws, Statistics, Physics, Stocks, (and several other subjects I am leaving out due to not wanting to overdo the review) are touched upon with great insight. What is most striking about this book is how well it is told and the great clarity in which it unfolds. Scientists are painted as fully fleshed out human beings and the science is perfectly translated to be understandable to the layman. For me this book is a life changer in the sense that I plan on studying this interesting science very thoroughly. By page 256 I knew I had to order my own copy. I know that this will be a book that I will continue to go back to as a reference. I feel that it plays an important role as the cornerstone for the building and expansion of my mental library as well as my physical library on the supremely interesting subject of Complexity."
6,0671872346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/867442-tyler,2,"Skims over the science in favor of messianic praise for the rogue theorists who began the Santa Fe institute.Reads like an article from Sports Illustrated or Rolling Stone. Skimmed through the second half, and decided not to finish it.Not much substance, but an interesting story if you are interested in the history behind the Santa Fe Institute. "
7,0671872346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/863801-ade-bailey,5,"I've shelved this under philosophy. May move it to a new bookshelf on complexity and emergence. It's a popular book, breezily written, made economics sexy to me, and helped me get a focus on my emerging attraction to complexity theory. It is mightily recommended."
8,0671872346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20134650-coop-williams,4,"A soft 4 stars, maybe 3.75 stars. Against my hopes, this book was much more storytelling than actual theory. So I skimmed a fair chunk. But Waldrop does do a fine job of putting the reader into the midst of exciting breakthroughs and intense brainstorming sessions. The scholastic culture portrayed in the book is so attractive, I toyed with going to an SFI workshop (it costs a few grand nowadays to attend). I loved the way these scientists from various fields (economics, physics, CS) exchanged ideas and battled. The book gives a pretty good intro treatment of the various theories going at SFI in the 60's-80's. The concept of cellular automata representing a ""phase transition"" from order to chaos was new to me, as was the whole business with autocatalytic polymers. Maybe too much ink was spilled over Brian Arthur's economic theories, which honestly still seem kinda crackpot nowadays. I'm very skeptical of how much you can learn from an ABM economy simulation without knowing what you're looking for first. But this is a book that revels in the unorthodox, so it's fitting."
9,0671872346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/589941-r-z,5,"This is the story of the creation of the Santa Fe Institute and the personalities and thinking of the scientists who came together to explore disciplines that just might relate to their own. So we have mathematicians, physicists, biologists, computer programmers and analysts, chemists, astronomers, and many more giving workshops and lectures to one another to explore what lies between order and chaos. (A car key is simple. A car is complicated. A car in traffic is complex.) This book is about complexity.Author Waldrop tells stories and explores the personalities of the men and women who made the Santa Fe Institute happen, thereby creating a tale that enlightens the reader on many intellectual levels. This book was written in 1992, but it is timeless."
10,0671872346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17583642-melissa-sherowski,4,this was my first introduction to Complexity Theory. good general overview but probably outdated by now. i read it in college....
11,0671872346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42959018-shawnleezx,5,"I read this book mostly to see how a group of scientists could manage to bootstrap something completely novel, or even alien, to the mainstream community. Our era for science has been very different from the old science world. In the old times, aristocrats are scientists, while in our times, science is mostly supported by application induced benefits form corporations and the government. It is not very clear to me how basic research is done in this system. This book gives a fair good description of the process.One scientific aspects that might be overlooked by most people is that the development of the ideas says a lot about the idea than the technical monograph. The current reviewing process forces the authors to conceal the development and the limitation of ideas. Such processes are revealed somehow in such biography, or stories.The book also show show Sante Fe Institute works, which is not obvious by reading their website."
12,0671872346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29438400-nixie,5,"This book is brilliant. It braids together stories of multiple scientists, illuminating their respective areas of research one by one, into a tale of an unusual institute of Santa Fe. Despite the main topic, complexity theory, being not the simplest thing around, the author introduces it bit by bit, never boring you with too many technicalities but also never delving into too much of historical details about the particular figures.Although it is a bit dated by now (which makes it even more of a history book as opposed to popular science one), this book is still very thought-provoking. Going to the meta-level of synergy between disciplines as different as economics and physics is just... the best kind of tingly in the brain. I believe every person who reads this book will see parallels and patterns in their own field(s) of expertise."
13,0671872346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7257488-fred-rose,3,"This is an old book, on my shelf, so finally skimmed it. It's really more a narrative of the people involved in creating the field of complexity economics. From that standpoint, it's a great story of how people interact and how ideas percolate. It's as relevant and true today as it was then. If you want to get a better understanding of what complexity economics is today, read some books by the people covered in this book, like Brian Arthur, or some of the work done at the Santa Fe Institute. I'm more interested in how this might apply to Grand Challenge (Wicked problem) research.."
14,0671872346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1709962-jon,4,"This book is what introduced me to the concepts of emergence and complexity theory. It's easy to read, and follows various scientists from disparate disciplines as they discover and investigate this oddly pervasive concept of complexity. Emergence and complexity theory have changed the way I look at the world, and this book sparked my interest to learn more. If you are curious about complexity theory, this book is a nice introduction."
15,0671872346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11643313-david,5,"I read this many years ago when Chaos thoery was all the rage. The book came out in 1992, I probably read this in 1997. This lays out the case for Complexity and introduces the main players at teh Santa Fe Institute. I found this utterly fascinating. "
16,0671872346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/685053-brent,5,"A wonderful book that describes the founding of the Santa Fe Institute and the origins of complexity science. After reading it, my response was, ""this is what I want to do."""
17,0671872346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16185528-emily,2,"Less a book about complexity and more about the men who developed the science in the 1960s-1980s. This is fine, if you're interested in that, and the book does give you somewhat of a taste of academic life--papers being rejected, having to apply for funding, the balance between research and administration. But as a working post-doc scientist myself it was hard not to notice that the author heavily romanticizes his subject themselves, evidentally unaware of the insane amount of privilege these researcher had in terms of being able to afford extensive education, being able to afford to dither constantly and change their minds therein, being able to afford to sit around having grand-if-nebulous ideas while grad students do their computer programming for them, one of them even being able to afford to not finish his PhD during three years of post-doc work before finally being held accountable for the validity and applicability of his grand ideas by a thesis committee. The author treats them simply as special, brilliant people, too important to care if their wives don't want them to be up at all hours of the night programming, or to make due with the less-than-the-best astronomy program they think they deserve and need. Certainly the book deals with intelligent men who made notable contributions to an emerging field, but seems ironically unaware of the complex forces--beyond the idealized drive to understand an idea--that brought these men to the top of their field. Malcom Gladwell's book Outliers deals with this well. This book makes professional science look like a free, grand adventure for irascible dreamers in love with great ideas, who occasionally have to apply for funds or have their work criticized by others, and maybe that's what it was for these men, but that's not what it's like for most people. If there were any women or minorities with similar grand ideas working at the same time as these men, it certainly wasn't like that for them. Instead, the book provides a rosy picture of what doing science is like with a very important caveat (When You Are A White Man In The 1960s Who Has Money And Respect) complely ignored. So, unfortunately, it doesn't tell the reader much about complexity science *or* about scientific life. "
18,0671872346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58498-brook,5,"This book was published 24 years before the date of this review. With a focus on complexity in nature (to include the cell, neural networks, natural selection and evolution, gene expression, and other topics), it is interesting to see how much we have progressed since then, and to see which ""new"" names in the book from 1992 are sage old guard today. This is probably not a ""beach read"" for most people. However, the author, himself an accomplished scientific writer (to distinguish him from those who are journalist first, interested party second), does such an *excellent* job of explaining in layman's terms some very complicated concepts and models, that it makes everything in the book both accessible and interesting. Those in the applied sciences will probably be familiar with the results, 24 years later, of the organizations and projects outlined in the book, but this might be interesting to them as well, for a ""how did we get here"" brief historical look.For those with no formal training in chemistry, biology, physics, etc (like the reviewer), this is a wonderful introduction to the modern intersection of computing, neural networks, and genetic complexity can combine with something as seemingly disparate as the expansion of the universe.The book made this reviewer excited to see the results of professional collaboration, of lab work, and to reference projects from the 80s and 90s and understand their significance today. At the time the author was probably writing this book, a Macintosh Powerbook had a 16MHz processor and 2MB minimum RAM. The portable machine I type this on has a 3.00GHz processor and 8GB RAM, an increase of 187x and 4000x respectively. To know that they were limited for what we would consider almost trivial simulations by hard performance limits puts into perspective, for the hundredth time, just how much compute is available to the home user today, and the quite literally mind-boggling amount available to research institutions in today's supercomputers. If you have a background or interest in evolution, a real convergence of computing and the natural world in the fields of biology or physics, or investigating complexity and chaos in the parenthetical list at the top of this review, then pick up the book.This was a library borrow. I will be purchasing a copy for home. "
19,0671872346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51321294-jack,4,"If you want to look smart, carry this book with you onto a plane or into a park and start reading because wow that title is a mouth full!I forget how I discovered this book. It was mentioned in another book (I believe Flash Boys by Michael Lewis), and I decided to request it from my library, and I am very glad that I did. This book covers a wide range of topics and how they intersect. Everything from Machine Learning to Artificial Life to Economic Theory. It is a story how the leaders of these fields came together in a very unexpected way to bring about a new way of science in their fields. It is a story about the importance of interdisciplinary studies and the advantages that diversity in thinking can bring to a project. And it is also a fascinating story about several very smart people and how they came to be doing and loving the work that they do.I recommend this book if you like books such as those written by Michael Lewis. Waldrop does a great job of breaking down some very advanced scientific and mathematical material into bite-size chunks that the average reader can comprehend. That being said, do not read this book if you do not enjoy science, mathematics, and computing and do not have a somewhat advanced understanding of the fields. I do and in a very nerdy way found this book to be quite the page-turner.In conclusion, do not let the title intimidate you. This is more of a story about people than about Complexity and Order and Chaos. Go into the book with an open mind expecting to learn something new through learning about people. The only reason I have given 4 and not 5 starts is because the book did tend to drag on a bit towards the end."
20,0671872346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/100507140-matt-lowe,5,"This has been one of my favourite reads in years. It’s a long book that discusses a lot of history in linking the science together, but it’s the most fantastic introduction to what is probably the most important science of the 21st century, Complexity.It covers all manner of branches of early Complexity science and makes a strong case for just why they’re so important, be it Systems Thinking, Chaos Theory, Neural Networks, Ecology, Physics or Economics.In addition it provides a really interesting story about the origins of the Santa Fe Institute and some of its early contributors. In a lot of ways it reminds me of the writing style of Michael Lewis and books like ‘Moneyball’, using relatable anecdotes to explain the core scientific ideas.If you want the hardcore science and mathematics of Complexity this isn’t the book for you, this book is absolutely intended to be a thorough and entertaining introduction to the topic and it does that very well, providing all manner of reference points for those who want to go deeper into the topic. That said, it’s also not so light on the science that it dumbs the topic down like many modern authors seem to do. I highly recommend this book, especially if you want to understand the Complexity world that exists in the 21st century."
21,0671872346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/897874-bruce,3,"The science of complexity is presented here as an emerging discipline, not to say the discipline of emergence -- oh, and adaptive behavior, nonlinear dynamics, and the unseen forces that drive ecosystems to the edge of chaos (which is not as bad as it sounds). Waldrop covers the development of the new paradigm by interconnecting professional biographies of the leading theorists with the establishment of their interdisciplinary Santa Fe Institute, a place devoted to the exploration of complexity. It's a solid conceit, since the conjunction of hero-philosophers, thought experiments, and an organization-protagonist always leaves the reader someone or something to puzzle out or root for.The ""emergence"" in complexity can be defined as repeated interactions of a few very simple rules or elements in a way that leads to an unpredictable outcome. One example might be Darwinian: mutations in the context of reproductive self-interest and competition leading to adaptation and survival. Another might be games like chess or Go, in which the further out you get from the opening position, the more difficult it becomes to reverse engineer the processes that led to the current state. More like Go than chess is John Conway's cellular automata The Game of Life, a fun model comprised of only four rules which fully govern the retention, removal, or placement of checkers onto an infinite grid. Depending on your starting setup, successive rounds run as a movie will showcase a multitude of (emerging) configurations, ranging from regular blocks to gliders that fly across the game board to other objects which themselves generate other animate, stable figures. The outcome of Conway's game depend heavily on initial conditions. A population of cells that is either too densely packed or too spread out will rapidly achieve the stasis of an unchanging board. Conversely, spacing of cells in such a way that produces equal numbers of ""births"" and ""deaths"" will yield an incessantly boiling soup. Somewhere on the border of a frozen, cold order and noisy, hot chaos resides a disequilibrium that mimics life. This Goldilocks zone is the home of unpredictable, but recognizable change, a place where individual figures like gliders, spaceships, blinkers, traffic lights, and other, far more complicated animations can emerge.Nor are cellular automata the only complex constructs with Goldilocks zones. Fluid dynamics appear governed by similar principles, whether occurring in the churning vortices of planetary and stellar atmospheres or the incessant drip of a leaky faucet. Let infinite grains of sand pour onto a table and they will gradually raise a pile, the sides of which cascade at random times and in random quantities (albeit describable in the gestalt by a power law). Similarly understandable yet unpredictable is the behavior of earthquakes, the result of constant fluxions in neighboring tectonic plates. You'll find like transitional volatility in chemistry where solids become liquids, gases, and plasmas; in biology where cells become organs become systems become competing organisms; in economics where tech startups become monopolies and stocks boom or bust (to hell with neoclassicists' nonsensical, if mathematically precise, equilibria); and in pretty much any system with individual elements whose behavior and environment are interdependent. All this constitutes the ""complexity"" that we experience day to day and which the Santa Fe Institute's fellows and residents study.As visualizations of Conway's game suggest, computer modeling is an essential tool for the study of complexity. Befitting a field that emerged alongside the evolution of computing power, Waldrop offers a number of amusing anecdotes. So complexity pioneer John Holland is described at page 190 graduating from programming a 1960's Whirlwind to the IBM 701 to a Micromind to a Commodore 64 (""quite a step up"" because ""the Commodore would let me play games"") to -- look out! -- the mighty Apple II. As the author explains, ""True, it wasn't much more than a bunch of circuit boards in a black box that could be hooked up to a teletype machine for input and output. It had no screen. But it did have 8 kilobytes of 8-bit memory. And it only cost $3000.""Waldrop chronicles a great deal of scientific ferment, but the end result so far appears to more in the realm of building a precise language to allow classification and ultimately recognition of unpredictable, unstable systems, to make them easier to study if not to be tamed. That said, both the science and Santa Fe fellows have matured significantly in the last 25 years (my edition of this book was updated in 2008). In the early days of the institute,there were a lot of evocative computer models that were too hopelessly vague to apply to anything practical,... and a great deal of abstract hand-waving. According to one joke from the time (that was not quite a joke), if somebody came in and said, ""I had oatmeal for breakfast,"" everyone would say, ""Oooooo! What's the theory of oatmeal?"" (p. 366) Fundamentally, complexity is simple: big, powerful effects can follow from lots of little connections. The whole is greater than the sum of its parts. The devil arises from the interactions of the details, if not the details themselves. Easier said than understood, and here Waldrop says it repeatedly. I wonder if the author found it as difficult to conclude his book as to reach a conclusion. It's not a killer, though; the various complex questions under study and analogies offered to explain complexity as a field probably benefit from the various retellings.On finishing, my oatmeal theory is that Complexity shares a lot in common with hot porridge. It's hearty, lumpy, fast-filling and fatiguing, yet ultimately satisfying. In case you're wondering, I'm summarizing my impressions of the book here. As Waldrop makes clear, it's still too early to speak for the science."
22,0671872346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3181491-ella,1,"The title is somewhat misleading. I read this eons ago, but as I pack up things to give away, I may as well review those I remember or scribbled in. My reaction to pulling this one out of the box was ""ugh, why didn't I give this away long ago?"" What was supposed to be a general science introduction to the science of complexity is, in fact, the story of the people -- scientists and mathematicians -- who started the Sante Fe Institute. There was little science in this book. So if looking for information and education regarding complexity theory, then this is the wrong book. If you want a shiny (think People Magazine) gloss of some science stars, then you've got the book! Despite the year this was published, there were decent general audience books on chaos theory. At the time Mitchell, Strogatz and Scott Page had books out. Of course there are many these days. In fact, in wondering why I bought this one, I think I was seduced by Melanie Mitchell's blurb. I was sorely disappointed."
23,0671872346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51781581-dio-dwianto,4,"For me this is a creative way to make science more interesting: by writing the story about the scientists and their endeavors to define a new kind of science, disrupting the status quo while they're at it. I got into this book interested in the issue of economic complexities (e.g. stock market crash) and was deeply engrossed reading about all the same analogies in all branches of science. From its sister branches in social sciences, its cousins in natural sciences, even in the (relatively) fledgling computer science. It appears that all of the phenomenons in life, when stripped to the bare, share the same philosophical essence. It never ceases to amaze me what the great minds in science could come up with. How the hell did they think of that? You could also get insights into the intricacies of academic life."
24,0671872346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13511586-justin,4,"Complexity is a great combination of storytelling and science. It offers an overview of some of the key elements of complexity science, as well as the story of how the Santa Fe Institute came to be. While the narrative can drag on at times, the passion and excitement from the people that cobbled the institute together is palpable, and added some entrepreneurial energy to the book. A strength of this book is how it builds up the science over time: a description of one scientist's work followed by how someone else came across it at a workshop and then how they built on it to explain one more element of complexity. Rather than just explaining complexity head on, it brings you through the whole process of discovery, which allows you to see the connections and how different facets build upon each other. It felt like a much deeper exploration."
25,0671872346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4968716-robert,2,"I had to drop this book. It started out fine as a good story of how the Santa Fe Institute was founded and the initial players in this saga. Then, as more actors are being introduced, the book just becomes more and more monotonous. It’s all about this incredibly geeky scientists with megalomaniac ambitions to “understand the whole universe”, to unveil the secrets of the mind, the brain and life itself with their incredibly reductionistic theories. It is an old book already, so 90’s! and it shows it’s age in its style and in the ideas is trying to portray. At this point I’m not to sure if the “science” of complexity has really gotten anywhere, or if chaos theory came to have any further relevance in the new Millenium. But It doesn’t really matter, at least not to me."
26,0671872346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9835813-joe,5,"I read this when it was first published back in the early 90’s. Along with Gleick’s “Chaos” book, these books literally changed my life and almost lead to an academic career. Going a bit deeper than Gleick, this book reads almost like a thriller - chronicling the early beginnings of the Santa Fe Institute (SFI) and the emergence of complexity sciences. I loved the pacing of the book as well as the noble quest to unify seemingly different but related sciences. A great book that’s aged well. My interest in Complexity remains to this day. If you enjoy the subject, consider signing up for the SFI Complexity Explorer program and take some online classes. "
27,0671872346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5385261-brendan,5,"If you're looking for a rigorous history of complexity theory, this isn't it. This book is a love letter to academia, a romp through the early development of complexity theory at the Santa Fe Institute. An insight into the people who came together to share ideas from different disciplines and explore a new science. If you already see the world as a network of complex systems and emergent behaviour, then this book may be too pop-science for you. If not, read it immediately. It will change the way you see the world."
28,0671872346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75675449-michal,2,"What a waste of time and potential this book was. The book tries to deal with complexity science, a new, broad and ill-defined domain which attracted scientists with varying backgrounds: physics, economics, biology. Instead of showing ideas in complexity it shows how certain scientists got on to this idea. This therefore reads mich more like a really bad biography of some obscure people than a science book. "
29,0671872346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/186015-mike-s,3,"The book has a lot of interesting information about complexity, but it spends a lot of time on the people involved, I would have liked it if the book was more to the point and spent far less time on biographies. The book would be far better at half the length. I'm sure there are better books on Complexity, I'll be looking for them. "
30,0671872346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2770067-gerald-isaac,5,"Not the book I thought I was getting but still interesting.I thought this was about complexity theory. It was about the personalities that created this field instead.I suppose the area of study is too immature to have an actual book written purely about methods and findings. It hopes to be the history of what,perhaps, may be known some day."
31,0671872346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43625402-philip,4,"An enjoyable and readable ramble through the development of complexity as a science. Focusing equally on the science, politics, organisations and character development. At times it was hard to see the bigger picture of how smaller events affected the wider science, and it was hard to see the concrete impacts of the field itself outside the small world of Santa Fe."
32,0671872346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28653745-tathagat-varma,4,"A great introduction to the beautiful world of complexity...along with a detailed peek into the creation of its most famous institution, Santa Fe. At times the book gets a bit too heavy, especially since there are no accompanying diagrams, etc., so it could be a bit of a challenge, but overall, a great book."
33,0671872346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51059211-maris,5,Absolutely wonderful! Reading this made me happy! A narrative-driven overview of both science but also the relevant people's lives in the making of Santa Fe's complexity science institute - and a whole new scientific field. Warmly recommend to anyone who feels like being inspired by some very driven people <3
34,0671872346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7167875-stephen-antczak,4,"This book really educated me on the concepts of order and chaos and complexity. Definitely loaded with fascinating ideas across a wide swath of sciences. Nicely written, definitely a worthy follow-up to Chaos by Gleick. The only issue I had was that it was a little difficult to keep straight who was who, and who contributed to which ideas, and how they all worked together."
35,0671872346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85584217-lance-johnson,5,"This is a wonderful book. Truly, wonderful. I love the subject matter, the way the book is structured, and the author's style in delivery. The book follows a number of people whose paths intertwine to help encourage a shift in the style of scientific thinking away from linear reductionist thinking towards emergent properties in nonlinear dynamical systems. Each person's story is recounted in such a touching manner that you would almost think that it was fiction, crafted rather than chronicled. Each person's work is explained in an understandable manner, and the implications of there discovers are made palpable so that the reader can join them in the sense of discovery. I recommend this book to anyone interested in science. It is probably one of my top ten favorite books now. "
36,0671872346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5964946-nathan-wisnoski,3,"An interesting and well written history of the origins of the Santa Fe Institute and it’s key players in the 80s. However, the lofty philosophizing of the second half of the book was less compelling. "
37,0671872346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28459200-george,1,"Disappointing; a biographical review of people involved in the early stage's of complexity's development rather than the theory itself, also US biased. A modern, and more accessible book is by Prof George Rzevski, including many practical applications - 'Managing Complexity'."

49,0671872346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5180850-sid-johnson,5,"Very enjoyable read, both for the “more than an intro” to Complexity, artificial life, emergence, complex economics, complex adaptive systems, and agent-based modeling (no math required!), and for the human side of the people interacting in their own adaptive system, the Santa Fe Institute. A page-turner, and when finished, my copy was well-underlined. It left me wanting a sequel to catch up on progress since 1992. "
50,0671872346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26555422-shashwat-singh,4,"This is a very good introduction to Complexity Theory... which is a new field of science which is very very important. The book goes into the people, the theory and experiments of complexity theory. The Sante Fe Institute is where complexity theory was worked on and major breakthroughs made in understanding it through simulations.In its gist, its the study of complex adaptive systems where individual agents interact with each other to self organize spontaneously to create incredibly complex system. The forces of adaption also play a role. The field tries to answer such questions like ""how did this incredibly rich, diverse, and complex world come about"" and ""Why do we have life, and how did we come about"". Essentially, what the field is getting at is that there are properties in how the world works that actually result in galaxies, life, economies etc. There is something like a mathematical propensity for self organization and the emergence of complex structures. This leads to the relative order we see.A big part of this is emergence. You can't predict the behavior of a system from individual components. The system acquires new properties at each level of complexity. I.e there's no way you could have foretold the richness of human culture by looking at a bunch of tissue.... Complex systems are more than the sum of their parts. This is not an easy read unless you have a strong background in computer science or biology or physics. I don't, so there were parts of the book I had to read a few times over to grasp it. I strongly recommend this book even if it may be difficult at times. This book delves deep into how our world works.If you've read Anti-Fragile... this book is kind of the foundational knowledge behind that book. Reading this has helped me gain a better understanding of the ideas of change, robustness, and anti-fragility.In terms of practical take-aways, there are some major takeaways you can take-1) Change is a constant part of complex systems. There's a small zone between the boundary of chaos and order (i.e complete chaos and dead stability) where complex systems emerge. This is the world we live in. There's enough order that systems and complexity can emerge, but at the same time things are in flux, constantly evolving and changing. Basically what this means is that change is a constant part of our world, and internalizing that is key to live well considering we live in a complex world. Never assume things will remain the same and learn to constantly expect it.2) You need an interdisciplinary approach to solving anything but the simplest problems. The world is extremely interconnected. Solving major problems involves understanding the many factors involved. I.e if you want to solve issues such as global warming, you have to look at all aspects of it, from psychology, business, politics, the science of global warming itself, the stakeholders involved, etc. Hence the importance of an interdisciplinary approach to life. The same applies to business.3) We are part of complex ecosystems. An example the book gave is that star employees that are poached away often perform worse in their new jobs. That's because the ecosystem is completely different... and the ecosystem in their first job is what allowed them to do well. Basically, this means that you shouldn't assume you're doing well or badly just because you're a hard worker, smart, or you suck. There could be many other factors involved. Hence, deeply analyze the systems you're in to see how they affect your performance, and then put yourself in systems and situations that are ideal for success. "
51,0671872346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48164585-b-i-h,5,"The book wrote about the establishment of santa fe institute, together with the development of complexity research. Several branches of complexity could be understood from this book, for example: artificial life, neuron network and genetic algorithms, increasing return, phase transition, the edge of chaos, to name a few. "
52,0671872346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/146297-paul,5,"One of the best books about science, complexity, economics I've read. It's also a great yarn."
53,0671872346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90084664-katherine-h-long,5,"Fascinating but mind bogglingEven though I do not have the scientific background to absorb this book, I thoroughly enjoyed trying. I remain in awe."
54,0671872346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20735143-yaaresse,0,"I thought this might be an introduction to complexity theory. Instead, it's about the founding of the Santa Fe Institute and consists mainly of anecdotes about the founders of that think tank. Waldrop writes about them like they are some kind of misunderstood and unappreciated rock stars, so it starting feeling like a profile piece for a magazine designed to glorify the personalities rather than explain the concepts. Wrong topic, wrong reader. The history of the Santa Fe Institute's roster or PhD's isn't going to mean much to me until I can better understand what the work is they are trying to do. It's a little like going on about the stars of the opera world to someone who isn't familiar with opera. "
55,0671872346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11509598-alex-lee,3,"This is an odd book. It explains complex ideas in the form of a narrative. Most of the book surrounds the founding and the characters embedded in the Santa Fe Institute drama, but all of that is by way of organization and presentation in what is basically a disorganized jumble of information. Really, this is almost like a fiction book for the presentation of ideas. Waldrop however only presents the ideas, he doesn't really critique them. Nor does the people in the book seem to do that, since they operate mostly on faith. I am surprised by how dry but also how precise Waldrop is. He really did some work to put this together.All in all this book follows the ideology of super-science by taking these conjectures on mathematical obscurity and speculative faith. Still, it's an interesting that this science would be ""emerging"" much like the models it suggests, a combination of chaos and order.The synopsis is really misleading though since it only promises answers, much like this post-empirical science, but it can't deliver them. Not yet, and maybe not ever. My impression upon completion is that we've taken lots of information and tossed many words around, but we still aren't sure what any of it means. It's ironic that the Santa Fe Institute was started to stop reduction and yet, we are practicing it here, just on a wider domain. There is very little critique of the tools are being used even while the effects of the general scientific practices are themselves questioned. My point is the questioning is very incomplete as is the subject matter of this book. Not the fault of the author, but I suspect that this book is put out as part of the propaganda of the institute to try to garnish more attention to themselves and what they are doing."
56,0671872346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7069868-john,3,"Caveat: I bought this book in a used bookstore by accident. I thought it was a book by Melanie Mitchell, who also has a book entitled Complexity. On the positive side, this book presents an interesting picture of the founding of the Sante Fe Institute. Although I am moderately familiar with the complexity field, I did learn a few things by the clever placement of emphasis on certain points, though the presentation remained non-technical. I also thought the book did a good job at presenting personal conflicts and difficulties in a way that took nothing away from the subjects personally, which I thought was deftly handled.On the negative side, which is why the book I gave the book three stars, is hinted at in some of the other reviews: some called it slow, and other called it fawning. I think the problem is that the description is kind of breathlessly enthusiastic, proceeding to describe the subjects continually with high energy. Over a sustained period, this can make even a short amount of text seem very long, and an ordinary description sound unduly favorable. For this reason, I found that I got the most out of the text by reading it for short periods, one anecdote or description at a time. By adding the pace the book itself lacks, I think the average reader might find it quite enjoyable.Overall, I'm glad that the Santa Fe story was told in such an accessible and (in small bites) inspiring way."
57,0671872346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27432833-eg-gilbert,5,"This book is from 1992, but it came along at the perfect time for me. It's basically the contemporaneous scientific history of one of my favorite topics: emergence.Written as a narrative, it describes the academic community self-organizing in the 1980's to establish an interdisciplinary branch of science devoted to dynamic systems, with the Santa Fe Institute as its catalyst. A dominant property of these systems is a small set of simple rules leading to highly complex, completely unknowable outputs and behavior.The reader is given a careful and thorough description of the various theories and hypotheses in play at the time, in a way that is technical but understandable without knowing advanced mathematics.As the scientists modify and enhance their concepts over time, we walk those same paths with them and we're able to follow the evolution of their thought thanks to the solid background preparation.We are given first-person accounts by quotes from the actual characters in the story, complete with an insider's view of academia and the institutional forces that create an inherent barrier to interdisciplinary collaboration.If you're interested in fractals, swarms, and emergent behavior, this book is a compelling read. Plus it devotes several pages to Craig Reynolds's ""Boids""!"
58,0671872346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6960625-verity-bracken,5,"A biographical account of the founding of the Santa Fe Institute that introduces the basic scientific concepts researched at the institute in its early days.This book really resonated with me. I've been running into the phrase ""complexity"" in other books and articles I've been reading so it was nice to finally read something on Complexity Science. I will have to re-read it because a bunch of the science went over my head but all in all it was a fairly accessible volume. I have a visual arts background and was drawn to the arts because it seemed like a good way to receive an interdisciplinary education during the specialty-program orientated late nineties. It sort of worked but most of my formal education was limited to the humanities, with a few introductory courses in the soft sciences thrown in for good measure.The sciences have always interested me but even in high school they were so stuffy and hyper specialized that it turned me off. Now I've got a whole list of science related things I want to go learn about and I'm not as intimidated by the idea because this book talks about a number of people who started their studies in things like Philosophy and Anthropology and then moved into Mathematics and Computer Science. "
59,0671872346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3391082-5dd,4,"This book served as my introduction to complex adaptive systems. I read it in 1994 and have been fascinated by the subject ever since. It's well written and engaging, and follows the established popular science formula of threading technical explanations of topics in science and math into a series of stories about the people who are developing and expanding upon those topics. It seemed a little disjointed at times, but the scientific explanations were generally clear and quite good. In fact, Waldrop's description of genetic algorithms was good enough that I was able to code-up a simple GA and solve a few pretty interesting optimization problems without having to reference any textbook on the subject at all. That was also my introduction to genetic algorithms, which is another subject that I find fascinating. "
