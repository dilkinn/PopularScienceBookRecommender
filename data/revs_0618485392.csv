0,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/127127-michelle,5,"A Devil's Chaplain is an excellent collection of Dawkin's writing, ranging across the topics of genetics, memetics, pseudoscience, religion, terrorism and the nature of life itself. This is a field trip through Dawkin's mind, including letters to the prime minister, introductions to the books of others, and pieces that have appeared in popular print. His eulogy for his good friend Douglas Adams is particularly touching, and no less so is his treatment of his late rival, Stephen Jay Gould. But the best is saved for last, with his incredible piece entitled A Prayer for my Daughter, in which he tries to prepare his young child for the world of deception that lies ahead, and arm her against it. This is the quintessential introduction to Dawkins, and shows that he is more than just an outspoken advocate of humanism and reason - he is a loyal friend, an attentive father, a loving husband, and when the ocassion calls for it, a fierce champion for the truth. If you have never read Dawkins before, I would highly recommend that this is where you start. "
1,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2091350-mary-storm,5,The essay on Postmodernism is a delightful skewering of that pretentious twaddle dished out in so many social science departments.
2,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4196379-hellen,3,"Okay, this review is going to be a little about the book as a whole and a lot about an irritation about one of Dawkins' habits.First off, the good stuff. My favorite essays were The Great Convergence, The 'Information Challenge', the eulogies for Douglas Adams and Hamilton and lastly Good and Bad Reasons for Believing (A Prayer for My Daughter), which is how I found out about this book in the first place. It was heart warming to see how Dawkins' passion, which so often is expressed in a stern voice towards religion, creationists and apologists, translates into equally powerful warmth when speaking about people he respects.The format was nice, though the content is nothing new really if you've read all of Dawkins books before, or even just a few. Now for the other 95% of the review.It can be very disappointing when someone you respect opposes your own views. It is even more disappointing however, when your ideals and opinions are being portrayed a certain way; not just unflattering, but simply falsely. I'm referring to the following fragment, which is the sole reference Dawkins uses to categorize feminism as a relativism in the chapter 'What is True?': ""Women's Studies students are now being taught that logic is a tool of domination ... the standard norms and methods of scientific inquiry are sexist because they are incompatible with 'women's ways of knowing'... These 'subjectivist' women see the methods of logic, analysis and abstraction as 'alien territory belonging to men' and 'value intuition as a safer and more fruitful approach to truth.""Oh, come on now. I don't doubt that are feminists who believe such things, same as that I don't doubt there are atheists who have irrational ideas about other things than religion, but to present a single quote with such (thankfully!) rare an opinion, is just using a straw man and beneath someone I respect as much as Dawkins.The misrepresentation is not all of it. The source used, at the time of publication of A Devil's Chaplain is at the time of publication already a nearly 35 year old book (first published in 1970), probably only used because of the religious term in the title (""Professing Feminism""), which nota bene is a book written by feminist scholars who try to distantiate the academic feminism from the nonsense in women's studies they've come across, which is totally admirable (note also how the students referred to in the quote are not even called feminists).Another point of criticism of the choice of just this quote is that the quote isn't just not representable, but also against what many feminist scholars strive for. Yes, there is in part the promoting of the female representation in history, which was up till recently largely absent, similar to accounts from poorer classes and other races, and there's also the earning respect for feminine (not necessarily female!) qualities. These goals are however more prominent in older waves of feminism. In more modern times, you see the cutting loose of human qualities from their ""masculine"" and ""feminine"" labels, to make them accessible for everyone (e.g. to facilitate the acceptance of men very involved in the care of their children, the ambitious woman, the stay-at-home father, the female president). I'm sure that I am biased as I work in academia (not women's studies - by the way, is it even still called women's studies..?), but the feminism I am in contact with most does adopt empiricism and would never attach itself to a statement as the one above, because it's exactly the dichotomy it tries to get away from. And as an atheist reading this book, retracting rationality from me is pretty much as grave an insult as they come.Sadly, I find Dawkins doing this another time in ADC. Later in the book, there's another exotic quotation presented in a context where sure, it is just quoted from a ""feminist 'philosopher'"" and mentioned in the company of other apparently ""feminist truths"" (they were news to me) such as Newton's Principia being a rape manual (?) and E=mc2 being a 'sexed equation' (?!). ""The privileging of solid over fluid mechanics, and indeed the ability of science to deal with turbulent flow at all, she attributes to the association of fluidity with femininity. Whereas men have sex organs that portrude and become rigid, women have openings that leak menstrual blood and vaginal fluids ... From this perspective it is no wonder that science has not been able to arrive at a successful model for turbulence. The problem of turbulent flow cannot be solved because the conceptions of fluids (and of women) have been formulated so as necessarily to leave unarticulated remainders.""If you've read the previous of my review on why such quotations are an issue carefully, I'm sure you can pinpoint yourself what exactly is the issue with the quote above.This is not a matter of cutting off unpopular limbs to distantiate myself from those that are exposed to criticism, but basically what happened here is the equivalent of a Christian lumping all atheists together with Hitler, or using a church bulletin distributed within a village with 100 inhabitants in some edge of the world as a source for the definition of Christian beliefs. Criticism against feminism, totally fine. But do it in the same thorough way as you treat anything else you're looking at critically; thorough, use representative sources, no cherry picking, and report transparently. And really, there's no room for that in Dawkins' work. So either stick to atheism or write a book dedicated to criticizing feminist theory. And I think we all agree we'd prefer him to spend his precious time on his own fields, where he's of the greatest value."
3,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2747498-arun-divakar,4,"A retired senior bureaucrat from the Kerala administrative service had once written a column about how people are being exploited in the name of their beliefs. In his words, almost 60% of the population wakes up every day with this tinny little voice ringing at the back of their minds - ’Somebody please con me !’ And so on television we have advertisements for seashells that can fix all problems, powders that help you seduce anyone you want, magicians who will bestow all the good things in life on you…yada yada. Voices like Richard Dawkins’s are quite rare to come by in the oceans of such obvious nonsense and yet it is a relief to know that such thinkers are active in the public space. The book is a collection of his essays that give us a glimpse into his mind which is tuned to the voices of science and reason and is quick to point out the illogical and idiotic things that one encounters in life.The essays in the book cover a lot of ground with genetics, evolution and general science making a lot of appearances. Dawkins does not hold his fire when he deals with creationist theories, quacks and alternate medicine. There is a scathing essay in which he makes mincemeat out of alternate medicine. There are also reviews of books, eulogies and the occasional autobiographical piece in here. Two of the articles are really outstanding. The first is Dawkins’s piece for The Guardian as a response to the death of famed novelist Douglas Adams. This article is not well thought through, it is not elaborate and neither is it objective. It is a knee jerk reaction from a man who has lost a dear friend and colleague and hence it is a very touching piece in an otherwise dispassionate book. The second is Dawkins’s letter to his daughter as she enters her teenage years. It is a candid observation on the nature of beliefs and how much a rational mind can help you in understanding the world better. He does not bash religion and beliefs all that brutally here but tells his daughter to make an informed choice when she feels equipped for it. Unlike his other articles, he does not elucidate things to a great extent and sticks to a bare bones evaluation of thought processes that might help an adult live a no-nonsense life.This is more of a sneak peek at Dawkins’s enormously productive oeuvre and ergo recommended. "
4,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/166376-david,5,"This collection of essays, written before Professor Dawkins succumbed to the pomposity that is sadly so often an accompaniment to fame, and started to confuse intellect with wisdom, is one of my favorites. Most of the thirty or so essays in the book display the charm, erudition, and clarity of exposition that are characteristic of his earlier work, though some of the pieces dealing with religion prefigure his subsequent descent into shrillness and condescension. The tone of the final essay, ""A Prayer for my Daughter"" (Good and Bad Reasons for Believing) is blessedly free of any hint of shrillness, however. His eulogy to Douglas Adams is particularly affecting, but if I had to pick a favorite, it would probably be the hilarious skewering of the pomo set in ""Postmodernism Disrobed"". An easy target, granted, but Professor Dawkins's demolition job is masterful."
5,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2064133-jon,2,"I prefer it when Dawkins sticks to the science and leaves out the philosophy, not because I think he's so incorrect, but because I think his arrogance distracts from his correctness."
6,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27781063-dyary-abubakr,4,"I think now I know why I love Dawkins. It's not because he completely changed my view of life (or we can say destroyed it) when I was only 18 nor because of how beautiful his writing style is nor even due to how much knowledge he possesses. It is merely because he is a teacher. He actually ""wants"" you to learn and make you understand in the most straightforward and transparent ways he can afford. He doesn't try to sound sophisticated and write vaguely to make himself look important. He doesn't use big and complicated words to hide his ignorance behind them. He uses a poetic and beautiful language to feed you the intriguing knowledge on a plate of simplicity.  He devoted a chapter talking about those sophists who have nothing worth of knowing but want to be considered as respectful academics. He says: ""Suppose you are an intellectual impostor with nothing to say, but with strong ambitions to succeed in academic life and collect a coterie of reverent disciples and have students around the world anoint your pages with a respectful yellow highlighter. What kind of literary style would you cultivate? Not a lucid one, surely, for clarity would expose your lack of content.""As his usual job, Nietzsche condensed all these charlatans, these priests of unclarity in a single sentence: ""They muddy the water to make it seem deep.""Dawkins despises these wannabe academics and makes it his mission to show you how complicated scientific concepts can be presented in an understandable and comprehensible way.I now realize why these men (Sagan, Dawkins, Tyson, Feynman..etc) are considered to be prophets of science. It is because of their incredible ability to write as they are your friends, sitting beside you, explaining to you the world through the lens of science. And it was this book that opened my eyes to this obvious yet hidden fact. This book is different from Dawkins's other books. You don't find him attacking religion and god as he usually does, although if there is an actual miracle, it would be Dawkins writing a book without doing that at all. This book is a personal note; it is close to him on a personal basis. It contains many special things about his life, from his eulogies to his deceased friends to his letter to Juliet, the daughter whom he devoted the book to for her eighteenth birthday. Here you find a different Dawkins. A kind-hearted, as he often is, Dawkins. Above all, you find out how humble and down to earth he is; this was another hidden thing I discovered through the book. Do give it a try if you already know him, and if you hadn't known him already; because he is very close to leave us for good. So close that I fear not finishing this review without hearing that he passed away."
7,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5963979-jim-razinha,4,"Richard Dawkins more often than not is labeled arrogant, whther in print, in lecture or in person. Having read, listened and talked to Dawkins, I would be hard pressed to argue the contrary. Nevertheless, I still like him and what he has to say, even if I don't understand everything. The Devil’s Chaplain is a collection of essays published in 2003, that according to the backleaf of the paperback, is “an enthusiastic declaration, a testament to the powers of rigorous scientific examination to reveal the wonders of the world.” Well, I think it is a wonderful collection ranging from the pedantic to the candid, from righteous to humble (if you look close, you’ll see this). He can be wittily entertaining and maddeningly academic, but never boring. And he doesn’t pull punches (no expects that anyway).Dawkins grouped his essays into six (actually seven) sections and provides a foreword to each, explaining his choices for inclusion.In “Science and Sensibility” he talks about Darwin (of course). He examines the relativity of truth as related to perspective, with science as the only real truth. He looks at the human ape family tree, ethics in genetic studies, relates his experiences as a jury member (prompting me to rethink the jury concept). Two of my favorite essays in this section look at quackery of new age crystal proponents and a brilliant review of “Intellectual Impostures” by Alan Sokal and Jean Bricmont (published in the US as “Fashionable Nonsense”)offering Dawkins’ Law of Conservation of Difficulty and a web link to a hilarious site: The Postmodernism Generator (http://www.elsewhere.org/cgi-bin/post...” that “will spontaneously generate for you, using faultless grammatical principles, a spanking new postmodern discourse, never before seen.” In “Light Will Be Thrown”, the chapters look at Darwinism’s effect outside biology and Darwinism as a universal truth. He also relates with palpable distaste his experience with the “murky underworld of creationist propaganda.” Within that chapter is a fascinating look at information transfer, one of the best, if dry, reads in the book. In “The Infected Mind”, Dawkins concentrates all barrels on religion. He revisits memes and his view of religions as viruses of the mind. He dismisses claims of the convergence of science and religion, and does a number on the tendency to afford religious spokesmen a “privileged platform”, such as including their opinions in scientific discussions where they have no place.“They Told Me, Heraclitus” is a collection of tributes and eulogies to Douglas Adams, W.D. Hamilton and John Diamond, the last exposing some of the snake oil masquerading as “alternative medicine.”“Even the Ranks of Tuscany” blows the lid off the exaggerated conflict between Dawkins and Stephen Jay Gould. Dawkins freely admits he was neither close friends with Gould nor in agreement on their respective views of evolution, but he was highly respectful of Gould’s scientific approach and laudatory of Gould’s writing. The chapter contains some reviews of Gould’s books, both favorable and unfavorable, and concludes with a sad recounting of a final collaborative effort against the intelligent design movement that was cut short before publication by Gould’s death.After a chapter on Africa, he concludes with a moving letter to his (then) ten year old daughter entitled ""Good and Bad Reasons for Believing"""
8,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1391890-philip,5,"Some excellent essays. A touch too close to being a bit racist here and there, but perhaps that was inaccuracy of language. For the first time I think I actually understand something about evolution. His point about the 98% figure of genetic similarity with chimps was well made. He cited the fact that if you compare two books, there will be a lot of common letters and the figure would suggest similarity. But if you were to compare them sentence by sentence, they would probably share only a tiny fraction of commonality.What I still don’t understand about theorists on evolution is how they still discuss superiority or desirability for breeding in terms of strength, speed, size etc. After many hundreds of thousands of years during which human cooperation in agriculture, shared civilisation and eventually technological change has transformed the success rate of the species, why are qualities of cooperation, constancy or intellect now not also included in the factors that influence natural selection? Perhaps they are. Maybe I should read late Darwin.The idea that atheists just go one God further was also a point well made. Many of us would admit to being atheists when it comes to Mithras, Zeus, Thor, etc etc. Of all the Gods, most people who claim not to be atheists probably only admit a belief in one and thus reject thousands of other. It’s a bit like claiming to be a vegetarian on the grounds that you don’t eat duck, but do eat all the rest of the animal world.The point about cloning and identical twins was made a few too many times, I think, but then it was a collection of essays. It is a point, however, that the non-scientist would find it hard to relate to, since for someone from that starting position the twins are “natural” and the “clone” is not, despite the fact that genetically they represent identical concepts. The position would be really interesting, however, if the twins, or triplets or quads etc arose as a result of in vitro fertilisation and then implantation, and hence were not “natural”."
9,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75533-james,4,"As you would expect, this is a stimulating sets of essays, reviews and recollections from evolution's finest advocate. As an introduction to the theory of evolution, its impact on the other sciences and the necessarily complications for dogmatic thinking in other fields it has created through the ages - and still does - it is first class. His short shrift with 'Intelligent Design' and 'Alternative Medicine' is delightfully to the point.Many of the pieces, though, show a more 'human' side (Dawkins as father, friend or pupil rather than scientist), and it these that make the collection much more than a pop-science anthology. His eulogies, letters and forewords reveal that his ongoing fight to see ""Darwin Triumphant"" is not a matter of intellectual ego, academic oneupmanship or institution-bashing. The fight is about our freedom to choose a life for ourselves."
10,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59699674-michael-bowman,4,"I highly recommend this book. It covers a wide range of topics from various matters of evolutionary biology, memes, religion, postmodernism etc. Classic Dawkins from cover to cover, really providing a rounded, inclusive selection of Dawkins' interests. Many of these essays are both brilliantly written and about extremely interesting stuff!"
11,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75340123-olaf-brungot,3,"The book started out ok, with several good essays. The final chapters with the book reviews and eulogies is mostly the reason why the rating is so low. The last chapter, a prayer for my daughter is recommended reading. All in all, not the best book by Richard. I prefer his science books. "
12,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54518540-cam-lidstone,4,"An excellent collection of Dawkins' essays covering elegant descriptions of evolution; criticisms of religion, pseudo-science, and postmodernism; and beautiful eulogies to Douglas Adams and W. D. Hamilton. As I've said before, Dawkins may be the best science writer. He holds a deep understanding of evolution, uses crisp and novel metaphors to convey abstract concepts, expresses the courage to discuss uncomfortable facts, and always avoids the pitfalls of the curse of knowledge.My favourite essay was Light Will be Thrown his forward to a republishing of Darwin's The Descent of Man. A perfect combination of lucid exposition of evolutionary ideas and appreciation of Charles Darwin, his Dangerous Idea, and remarkable and often prescient insights (preceding Mendelian genetics)."
13,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2268905-chris,4,"I'm not partial to collections of an author's shorter, previous writings. Although they can give an overview of the subject's thoughts, too often they are hodgepodges of ideas better formulated in the author's major published works. Objectively, A Devil's Chaplain: Selected Essays does give the reader general insight into Dawkins' thinking from the groundbreaking The Selfish Gene (1976) until he began writing the greatly important The God Delusion (2006). Practically, most readers will want to pick and choose which items to read in this collection, then, if interested, go to the related major work for a more complete explication.Everything we know of Dawkins is represented here: science, Darwinian evolution, religion, a bit of Africa, book reviews—mostly on books which I suspect few readers will have read. There are also obituaries, a letter to his daughter, and email correspondence with the contradictory evolutionist Stephen Jay Gould. Fans of Dawkins surely will find something of interest.For me, the best essay is the angry newspaper editorial ""Time to Stand Up"", written shortly after the 9/11 attacks. I don't know if this tragedy was the trigger for him to eventually write The God Delusion, but I wouldn't be surprised: that 2001 editorial is a powerful call to change the way we uncritically accept religion.Here's a quote from A Devil's Chaplain that I love—they're not Dawkins' words, but from a teacher he respects—which seems to apply quite well to him, but only wishfully to me since I sit in my chair reading too much:

""I agree with Nietzsche that 'The secret of a joyful life is to live dangerously.' A joyful life is an active life – it is not a dull state of so-called happiness. Full of the burning fire of enthusiasm, anarchic, revolutionary, energetic, demonic, Dionysian, filled to overflowing with the terrific urge to create – such is the life of the man who risks safety and happiness for the sake of growth and happiness.""

"
14,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,4,"A revealing collection of essays by a passionate scientistOne of the wonderful things about this book is the sense that one gets of a distinguished scientist letting his hair down, as it were, and discoursing informally on a number of interesting subjects including some outside his area of expertise. In the game of ""Who would you invite to dinner if you could choose anybody?"" Oxford University Professor Richard Dawkins, author of The Selfish Gene, and other important works on evolution, would be near the top of my list.Not that I agree with everything he says. Indeed, that is part of the fun. Dawkins is adamant on some subjects, religion being one of them. A goodly portion of this book is devoted to letting us know exactly how he feels about the ""God hypothesis,"" ""liberal agnostics,"" and the so-called miracles recognized by especially the Catholic Church. The title of Chapter 3.3, ""The Great Convergence"" (of science and religion), for example, is used ironically. He sees no convergence; in fact, he calls such a notion ""a shallow, empty, hollow, spin-doctored sham."" (p. 151)Clearly Dawkins is not a man to mince words. But his insistence on a restrictive definition of ""God"" as ""a hypothetical being who answers prayers; intervenes to save cancer patients...forgives sin,"" etc., is really the problem. He considers the ""religion"" attributed to scientists like Einstein, Carl Sagan, Paul Davies and others (and even himself!) to involve a misuse of the term, calling such a definition ""flabbily elastic"" and not religion as experienced by ""the ordinary person in the pew."" (p. 147)But what Dawkins is really railing against is the illegitimacy of believing in the supernatural and science at the same time.While I think Dawkins makes a good point with this argument, I think it would be better to make a distinction between fundamentalist religion, which has been, and continues to be, the root cause of much of the horror in the world, and the more progressive varieties which recognize the limitations of the barbaric ""Bronze-Age God of Battles."" See Chapter 3.5 ""Time to Stand Up"" in which Dawkins rightly condemns the hatreds and violent history of the three middle eastern religions. At the same time I think he needs to realize that it is legitimate to define ""God"" as God is defined in, for example, the Vedas; that is, as The Ineffable, which has no attributes, about which nothing can be said.However it is exactly his point that there is no evidence for the God hypothesis and that to partially accept such a notion, or even to be ""agnostic"" is to depart from a purely scientific viewpoint. In this I think the atheistic Dawkins is mistaken. Absence of proof is not proof of absence, period. And as far as religion, per se, goes, I would add that not only is religion part of human culture (for better or for worse), but is also part of the so-called ""extended phenotype"" of human beings, and not something that is going to be argued away. I also have some reservations about his reasons for not debating with creationists. He believes that to debate with them gives them a legitimacy they don't deserve. In Chapter 5.5, he reveals a letter he wrote to Steven Jay Gould expressing such a view. I don't debate creationists either, but my reason is that creationists don't really debate. They have already made up their minds and are not capable of being influenced by evidence. Theirs is purely an exercise in propaganda. Furthermore, as Dawkins discovered himself (in Chapter 2.3 on the Australian film crew that he allowed into his house for an interview), it is often the case that creationists don't play fair.In Chapter 1.5 ""Trial by Jury"" Dawkins presents his reservations about ""one of the most conspicuously bad good ideas anyone ever had."" I understand his demurral, but would like to point out that juries dispense a social justice; that the tribe makes its decisions based on what it perceives as good for the tribe now, not necessarily what's true in an objective or scientific sense.Interesting enough, Dawkins demonstrates his knowledge of other scientific subjects, including physics, and he does it very well. I was particularly impressed with his explanation of entropy and how it effects the evolutionary process in Chapter 2.2. (See especially page 85.) He also does a fine job of elucidating why Lamarckism cannot work without a ""Darwinian underpinning"" since there must be a mechanism for selecting between the acquired characteristics that are improvements and those that are not. (p. 90) Good too is his characterization of genes as constituting ""a kind of description of the ancestral environments through which those genes have survived."" (p. 113)On his tiff with Gould, Dawkins attempts to make amends by reprinting some semi-gracious and mostly positive reviews of some of Gould's books; however it is obvious that his professional and emotional differences with Gould remain.One of the most important points that Dawkins reaffirms here is his belief that we humans, because of our unique insight into ourselves and our predicament, ""can rebel against the tyranny of the selfish replicators."" (p. 11) What Dawkins means is that we do not have to take biology as destiny or to take Darwinism as a template for our morality--a point often missed by his critics. There is much, much more of interest in this refreshingly personal collection of essays by one of our most original evolutionary thinkers, some of it first rate, and some of it rather ordinary; yet taken in total reveals a lot about Richard Dawkins, scientist, science writer, teacher, and human being that I was pleased to learn. Incidentally, the title is from Charles Darwin who speculated on how such a personage might regard ""the clumsy, wasteful, blundering low and horridly cruel works of nature."" (p. 8)That ""devil's chaplain"" here is Richard Dawkins himself who mostly directs his ire toward the stupidities of human beings. --Dennis Littrell, author of “Understanding Evolution and Ourselves”"
15,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4653238-kieran,4,"  What a great collection of essays, for the most part. The only reason I did not hand over five stars is that I got horribly lost in the collection of prefaces to other books and eulogies for people I had never heard of. In saying that, the two pieces on Douglas Adams were wonderful (though I have read them elsewhere). I suppose in their own right these pieces were brilliant, though I am not sure that putting them in this collection gave them the context they deserved! The strong ending, supported by Dawkins' letter to his daughter, did however make up for all of this; the style of writing is reminiscent of his more recent work 'The Magic of Reality'."
16,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1720603-baal-of,5,"An excellent collection of essays by Dawkins. People who accuse him of being belligerent, dogmatic, or militant have clearly either not actually read his work, or they have approached the books with a pre-conceived idea. His writing is lucid and illuminating. His reviews of Gould's work show just how much the differences between them have been exaggerated by people whose intention it is is to discredit evolutionary theory.On a side note, Dawkins had the same gripe about the excess of mind-numbing baseball statistics minutia that marred the ""Wonderful Life"" by Gould that I had."
17,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7138289-mohamedridha-alaskari,4,"What excellent material in this book, first when I started reading this book I found some mysteries I could not understand some of it but then by completing the section one by one I found an explanation of each mystery. This book giving a very clear idea about the sciences, mysteries, myths and reality. His articles make sense for me at most. Most important section is the last one. Very recommended for the skeptics in the science researches. Thank you Richard! "
18,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5015124-david-siemer,3,"As a fan of Dawkins, this is somewhat repetitive with other books I really liked - such as God Delusion and Greatest Show on Earth. I would only recommend this one for serious fans."
19,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7240015-stephen,3,"Charles Darwin mused that a devil's chaplain might write quite a book on the clumsy, wasteful, blundering low, and horridly cruel works of nature. A Devil's Chaplain is not quite that book, however, though it does include a mention of fantastically inefficient bio-planning on nature's part, as well as a paragraph or two on parasitic wasps. Dawkins uses the title to collect various articles, prefaces, and reviews he has written, all pooling in either biology or skepticism. Those familiar with Dawkins will find no surprises: he writes on the role of wonder in science, champions skepticism and evidence-based thinking, addresses religion with teeth bared in the wake of 9/11, and expands on his notion of cultural ideas being transmitted like genes, as ""memes"" -- an originally serious word that is now applied to pictures with words on them, from captioned cats desirous of cheeseburgers to political commentary. There's also a considerable section dedicated to the then recently-late Stephen Jay Gould, with whom Dawkins had professional disputes. (Dawkins defends their relationship as more professional than adversarial.) Because the collection is so varied, it's rather hard to rate; here's a chapter on genes and wasps, there's an appraisal of a novel set in Botswana. Most of the book is on biology and critical thinking, and there he had me; when he moves to morals and culture, however, I found him wanting.I raised my first eye when Dawkins praised Peter Singer, who sees no reason to value a room of babies over a room of puppies, and asserts that religion only sustains itself by having its adherents instill the beliefs in their children. Of course, religions like any other cultural element are maintained through that kind of transmission -- language, for instance. They also sustain themselves, however, by providing something people need or want: meaning at the individual level, and tribal cohesion and (in some cases) some degree of public morality at the social level. Dawkins' understanding of religion as expressed here is simplistic, but part of his argument is fair: material facts should be believed on the basis of evidence, not desire or authority. Dawkins writes at the beginning that one bit of an advice a devil's chaplain can provide, looking at the spectre of nature red in tooth and claw, is that while we are composed of selfish genes, we are not limited by them. Our intelligence gives us the ability to overcome the amoral logic of the jungle (or the savannah, no less savage). On the whole, however, amoral logic seems to have the edge; if a man can't favor a room of babies over a room of animals, there's something vital missing. "
20,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30281185-sajith-kumar,4,"Ever since the untimely decease of Christopher Hitchens, the number of gurus who promote scientific reason and rational thought on a worldwide scale has dwindled by half – to the person of Richard Dawkins. This biologist from Oxford University is forever ready to take up cudgels on behalf of reason and clear thought. Braving brickbats from all corners of superstition like religious fundamentalism, creation theory, intelligent design and alternative medicine. This book is a selection of essays from all articles and lectures, reflections and polemics, book reviews and forewords, tributes and eulogies made by Richard Dawkins in the past quarter of a century. Latha Menon, who compiled the articles, is an editorial consultant who has her background in physics and has worked as editor for Microsoft Encarta encyclopedia project. The title of the volume is that of the first chapter itself, on Charles Darwin, who coined the phrase in a letter to his friend as “what a book a Devil’s Chaplain might write on the clumsy, wasteful, blundering low and horridly cruel works of nature”. Darwin was, of course, referring to the natural process of evolution which is another face of nature, red in tooth and claw.The book covers in a nutshell all the major ideas ever put forward by Dawkins over his literary career spanning several decades as of date. If computer parlance could be borrowed, it may be called a zipped down version of the author’s prodigiously rich output. His advocacy for evolution, promotion of scientific spirit in the society and concerns on education in general is lucidly evident from the diverse nature of essays. Equally visible to the discerning eye is his inborn aversion to religion, creationism and the act of religiously minded parents – of inculcating the principles of the religion they believe in, in the minds of young children – by exploiting the natural gullibility of them at that age. He strongly opines against young children being left to the care of nuns, or by extrapolation, other religious figureheads too. Dawkins’ note to the then prime minister of Britain, Tony Blair, is remarkable for the clarity of thought and presentation of newer scientific ideas that can be easily comprehended by common men and politicians. Right approach to education is stressed in many places. Overhauling of the examination-centric approach is a crying need of the hour on account of the lack of interest and rapidly building up stress on young pupils. The chapter on Sanderson of Oundle School presented the case of an extraordinary headmaster who challenged the notions of established wisdom in school administration by throwing open the school’s labs, library and other points of interest at all times, so that the students were not constrained by non-availability of facilities at a time most convenient to them. His plan reaped rich dividends in moulding a good many students who were extremely talented and scored brilliantly when they eventually appeared for the exams.Humour is a constant companion of the author’s incisive criticism of creationism and established religion. Perhaps that’s why his detractors find his barbs so painful and excoriating. His advice to young children is not to believe anything solely based on the trilogy of tradition, authority and revelation. His style is also marked by the rich variety of examples he comes up with, particularly when genetic transmission of particulars that helped an organism survive better than other members of its clan or species, is discussed. These are very clear-cut and illuminating as to convince most readers other than fundamentalists and highly opinionated people, who would readily believe in religious miracles, but find it hard to convince themselves that man had set foot in the moon. Such individuals combine the obstinacy of religious dogma with skepticism of enlightenment, and thereby producing a lethal combination of ignorance with belligerence. Dawkins’ pointed dig at homeopathy is also evident in more than one chapter. Homeopathy is a sophisticated manifestation of faith healing, which has no valid credentials other than anecdotal evidence of healing, mostly by placebo effect. Still, a lot of people practice the medicine and find gullible patients who are willing to undergo the treatment. But awareness is not far away, when homeopathy will be consigned to the dustbin of charlatanry.The idea of memes as the analog of genes on the intellectual plane was first proposed by the author in the 1970s, which has been granted the status of a new word in English. He takes due credit for the origin of the word. Memes represent an idea, or a cultural element that is transferred from one person to another so as to modify his or her behavior. Like self-replicating genes, memes are also subject to natural selection. Dawkins confidently asserts that while Universal Darwinism is the ubiquitous biological principle, memes have become the theory of human culture. Taking a further step, Dawkins finds similarity with computer viruses, whose replication can also be equated to that of genes and memes. But, the fanciful prediction of computer viruses evolving towards compatibility with and mutual assistance to each other is rather off the mark, attributable to unfamiliarity with the cyber world. However, his simile of religion as a mental virus of faith is prescient and sums up the outrageous acts of the devoted. Scientific reason is touted as the antiviral software in this case.In the tirade against quacks and proponents of alternative medicine, Dawkins summarizes the reasons why people fall in the trap and enunciates remedies by which this can be resisted. Eastern mystics come up with exotic theories in their lore which are claimed to be in anticipation of modern scientific principles invented only in the last century or so. Quantum Mechanics is a favourite pasture for these parasites. Quantum Mechanics is deeply mysterious and hard to understand, so is eastern mysticism. So, eastern mystics must have been talking about quantum theory all along – such goes their skewed reasoning. In the case of alternative medicine, Dawkins ridicules its practitioners for refusing to test their pharmacopoeia through standard, randomized double blind trials. But they consistently shy away from testing by citing pompous and insincere reasons. This forces the book to assert that alternative medicine is a set of practices which can’t be tested, refuse to be tested, or consistently fail tests. If they somehow manage to pass the test, it is no longer alternative – they’d straightaway become mainstream. The book includes Dawkins’ reviews of Stephen Jay Gould’s books. It is no secret that the rivalry between these two luminaries was very intense. However, the author gives a very favourable assessment of Gould’s work, at the same time expressing his reservations on some of the points.The book is divided into seven sections ranging from science, memes, people, memories and personal. Each section is adorned by an individual foreword written by Dawkins himself, in which he explains the background of writing that particular article. All aspects of the author’s literary career are amply covered in this volume. Latha Menon has done a wonderful job in selecting the right articles. The book contains an impressive list of Notes and a commendable index.The book is highly recommended."

Suppose I told you that your dog was dead. You’d be very upset, and you’d probably say, ‘Are you sure? How do you know? How did it happen?’ Now suppose I answered: ‘I don’t actually know that Pepe is dead. I have no evidence. I just have this funny feeling deep inside me that he is dead.’ You’d be pretty cross with me for scaring you, because you’d know that an inside ‘feeling’ on its own is not a good reason for believing that a whippet is dead. You need evidence. We all have inside feelings from time to time, and sometimes they turn out to be right and sometimes they don’t. Anyway, different people have opposite feelings, so how are we to decide whose feeling is right? The only way to be sure that a dog is dead is to see him dead, or hear that his heart has stopped; or be told by somebody who has seen or heard some real evidence that he is dead.People sometimes say that you must believe in your deep feelings inside, otherwise you’d never be confident of things like ‘My wife loves me’. But this is a bad argument. There can be plenty of evidence that somebody loves you. All through the day when you are with somebody who loves you, you see and hear lots of little tidbits of evidence, and they all add up. It isn’t purely inside feeling, like the feeling that priests call revelation. There are outside things to back up the inside feeling: looks in the eye, tender notes in the voice, little favors and kindnesses; this is all real evidence.
Aaag he used to be so wise and grand, giving out words to live by. (He remains brave and clear, but you don't necessarily want to look through this windows anymore.)"
22,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66171578-matt-hertel,3,"A Devil's Chaplain is an excellent collection of Dawkin's writings and provides a well-rounded illustration of his personal and professional interactions. Ranging from a eulogy for the late Douglas Adams to forwards for books and personal correspondence with his colleagues, the text provides an intriguing glimpse into some of the more interesting corners of a storied academic's body of work.Dawkins is first and foremost a great scientific mind, but it is in his circle of colleagues and friends that I find a great deal of his personality laid bare. His interactions illustrate the reasoning behind Dawkin's rise to the forefront of personalities which define the small number of people who are trusted with leading a post-religious movement in the western world. Perhaps not to the degree of Hitchens, but certainly apparent, is Dawkin's knack for capturing and summarizing complex and nuanced ideas and presenting them in a way that is both approachable and comprehensive. I have always admired Dawkin's work, but this text creates an appreciation for the man behind that work as well.It could be said that the collection of writings in this text are somewhat unfocused. They meander from topic to topic, so varied that they seem almost random. I think this is a reflection of the breadth of personality that defines a modern renaissance man, as Dawkins could be considered. I appreciated the book because I was already a fan, but I fear that others who are less familiar may struggle to find the interest. The book is very good, and a must read for any Dawkins fan, but I think it falls somewhat short for the average reader. A great book for the right reader, but simply an interesting read for others."
23,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27687885-julio-biason,2,"A better name for this book would be ""Dawkins, by Dawkins"". It's a collection of articles written by Dawkins, selected by Dawkins himself.The first thing I noticed is that, for a ""smart"" person, Dawkins surely can't write. It seems he tries to shove so much stuff in an article that, at some later point, you start asking yourself what the heck was the point he was trying to make to start with.The other thing I noticed is how much he likes to quote other people. The very first article is so full of quotes, it feels like more than half of it is simply quotes. And absolutely a sloppy job in stitching them together.On top of that, there is a constant feeling that Dawkins believes he's ""Neo-Darwinian Prime"": The only person capable of talking about new Darwinian theories, and calling other theories wrong. I have the feeling that, in the foreword for a Stephen Gould book, Dawkins claimed the book was wrong. But, then again, with the mess Dawkins do with its ideas, I'm not actually sure if it was a review or a foreword.And even if, through this book, Dawkins claims that he has a good relationship with Gould, the fact that he keeps claiming he believes Gould theories are wrong, and that general feeling that he's the only one that can claim to be neo Darwinian makes me believe that he, actually, didn't.In general, I'm not even sure if this book gives a good impression of Dawkins."

It is not an easy read for someone who only really reads mystery novels. But as someone who has always been fascinated by science and have always wondered how the story of creationism survived, I was delighted reading the most thoroughly explained details behind evolution. Dawkins has taken the pain to simplify the complexity of the science behind every bit of evolution. It is still not easy to grasp but every bit of it made me go ""wow!"" There is so little that I know about genetics. But I learned a lot of the concepts from this book. The reading experience even involved me searching online to read more and understand some of the terms Dawkins used casually. The book isn't just about science and evolution. There are a couple of emotional eulogies, very moving ones too.I strongly recommend everyone who has ever questioned the truth about creationism to read this book. I am sure creationists wouldn't want to believe evidence of evolution anyway. But if you have an open mind, definitely give it a go."

Why do we tolerate quackery in our discussions of real topics? Why do we respect beliefs that have no scientific foundation? Enough said. I like Dawkins and agree with most of what he espouses. He has a lot of good stories and for the most part is fairly entertaining, but the main point is pretty repetitive. 3 Stars "

36,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/285565-rebecca,5,"This book is a collection of Dawkins's essays, book reviews, forewards, eulogies, letters, etc. from the past 25 years. The 32 essays are organized thematically into different sections such as ""Science and Sensibility,"" which is Dawkins's magnificant ode to science and reason, and ""The Infected Mind,"" which forms the bulk of his polemic against the virus-like persistence of religion. Other chapters discuss such varied topics as 'alternative' medicine, genetic information content, the flaws of the trial by jury system, postmodernism, the different brands of Darwinism that various biologists ascribe to, cultural relativism, Moore's Law, cloning, and Africa as Dawkins's personal birthplace as well as the cradle of humanity. Despite the wide breadth of these topics, Dawkins does an excellent job of synthesizing them all together to form a coherent vision of his intellectual passions. Like any great scholar, Dawkins understands his material well enough to tailor it to whatever specific audience he happens to be writing for, in this case the general public. Without trivializing or oversimplifying, Dawkins is able to explain biological ideas of great complexity for someone with only a modicum of scientific background (like me!). More than that, he does so in a way that grips the reader's interest and attention. After reading this book, I felt that I had spent time in the presence of a truly great mind, a mind unafraid of tackling questions that others gloss over and of expressing his opinions straightforwardly and logically. On top of his great skill with prose, Dawkins is a gifted explainer – he finds exactly the right metaphors and exactly the right examples to illustrate a principle clearly, and as a result, I think anyone who reads this book will end up learning a lot about biology and the way that scientists think, even if they aren't scientifically inclined.""Good and Bad Reasons for Believing,"" the final essay in this book, is an open letter that Dawkins wrote to his daughter when she was 10. It's a beautiful ending to the collection because it represents a genuine sharing of wisdom, a lesson not in what to think, but in how to think about the world. I highly recommend this book for anyone, religious or not, scientifically inclined or not. "
37,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51675760-mark-james,4,"This is a hodgepodge of ideas that have no common link except for the fact that they all emerge from Dawkins' brilliant mind. You'll read his reasons for disliking the modern jury system, several essays delineating disagreements with his respected contemporary Stephen Jay Gould, book reviews, and even a letter to his daughter.I found some essays to be heavy with biological jargon, and therefore not as accessible as others, but they still served as a valued introduction to the daunting complexity of our evolutionary past. I suppose that should be obvious though, as this is a compilation of writing for different audiences."

This letter that would of normally be seen as obsolete inspired Mr. Dawkins to combine a collection of his essays and others essays to explain why we shouldn’t fear science and to describe why naturals selection should not be seen as “wasteful, blundering, low, and horrid cruel works of nature”. His essays range from an homage to headmaster Fredrick William Sanderson that describes his unorthodox teachings. To a chapter dedicated to the book Intellectual Imposters. Mr. Dawkins wit and enthusiasm for teaching and learning from others shines through is this remarkable book. New scientist describes the book as “A rare treat… each essay will grip you at once… [Dawkins is] a master of clear exposition of science and its liberating power” .The Sunday Times hails Dawkins as a “genius for snatching mind-boggling possibilities out of the air”. This is an excellent book to read over vacation due to it short length (248 pages) and captivating debatable topics that will make any science nerd second guess their opinion. "
39,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3748-kalilah,3,"Very interesting if superficial look at aspects of science, philosophy, sociology and of course evolution. The authors passion for his topics is evident and infectious even though at times the arguments and terminology may confuse those not thoroughly versed in the field. There are numerous attacks on religious and other belief systems which do not rely on, or require, evidence so if you are a believer and sensitive about your beliefs or your right to those beliefs, then be warned, this book will probably piss you off. For those not so inclined the sarcastic criticism of organized religion is often quite humorous, (for instance:""The Roman Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation claims the 'whole substance' of the wine is converted into the blood of Christ; the appearance of wine that remains is 'merely accidental', 'inhering in no substance'. Transubstantiation is colloquially taught as meaning that the wine 'literally' turns into the blood of Christ. Whether in its obfuscatory Aristotelian or its franker colloquial form, the claim of transubstantiation can be made only if we do serious violence to the normal meanings of words like 'substance' and 'literally'."")So Enjoy!"

It's about evidence-based beliefs as compared to those from tradition, faith, and authority.  I wish I'd written in.  I should print it and send it to my son.There was only one essay specifically blasting religion, but I must say it had its moments.  For example, regarding religion's tendency toward divisive labeling of ""the others"":

To label people as death-deserving enemies because of disagreements about real world politics is bad enough.  To do the same for disagreements about a delusional world inhabited by archangels, demons, and imaginary friends is ludicrously tragic.


I can't say I understood all the details in the first essays on subjects of a slightly technical shade, but it was a helpful jolt for my mind to see how he disagreed with Steven Jay Gould.  I thought Gould was the last word on evolution, but I now I see--and rejoice to know--lively debate is still ongoing.  Science soars on!

Dawkins’s characteristic style shines throughout the book, on topics ranging from book views and polemic pieces to eulogies and a heartfelt letter though troublingly distant letter to his daughter. My favorites in this books are 2.3, “The Information Challenge”, (the essays are organized into broad sections based on their content, this is the third essay of the second section) which dismantles the information theory argument against evolution; 2.2, “Darwin Triumphant”, which explores whether Darwinian evolution could be a universal concept in a similar manner to gravity; his eulogy for Douglas Adams, 4.2; the whole of section 5, which covers his testy and amiable relationship with Stephen Jay Gould; and of section 6, which is a celebration of Africa through its evolutionary history, the books written about it, and its people. The entire book overflows with passion, both the joyous and the miserable, and with wonders great and small. Each essay is surprising and intriguing, and whether one agrees with the content or not (I generally do), its quality is undeniable."

I felt that the essays more concerned with religion fell off the rails. I found these essays less reasonable and often ugly. This is understandable as some were written directly after September 11 2001 and in a state of anger. I found the letter to his daughter especially off putting. at one point writing that her dog is dead in order to prove a point. Sometimes he writes as though he hasn't a clue about human nature, coming across as a bit hapless.Also, his (perfectly understandable) distrust of relativism is so so rigid and intolerant that it comes off as almost sexist and racist rather than intelligent. I' sure this is unintended but his essays on these matters lack any form of discourse and are more like extended dismissals, making them seem moot.However, the writings on science and secularism completely redeem the books faults."

Here also are moving tributes to friends and colleagues, including a eulogy for novelist Douglas Adams, author of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy; correspondence with the evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould; and visits with the famed paleoanthropologists Richard and Maeve Leakey at their African wildlife preserve.

And though the variety of this collection was novel at first I eventually began to miss the format of his other books maintain the uniformity needed for a concentrated study of a single facet of evolutionary biology. This was an interesting book overall, but in hindsight I might have appreciated it much more so if I had picked it after having read all his other books (which I haven't) much in the same way that fans of a certain author turn to biographies after having finished reading their collected works."

Dawkins admits that while it has yet to be determined who will be victorious on the scholarly battlefield, Gould will always be remembered, at the very least, as the greater writer.Much of the rest of the book was later touched upon in Dawkins's 2006 book

So the sensitive religious people should be warned in case of an offence. It was a really nice collection of essays on various topics. I found some parts with less Biology to be a little boring, probably cause I've already read many books pointing out the negative sides of religions. I read those parts mostly skimming so as not to get bored and abandon the book. But I've noticed that the author's writing style will never not be unappealing to me no matter how many times I've heard the same things.Overall it was a pretty informative book.

It's refreshing to be reminded (however occasionally) that a mind is capable of both being scientific and producing good prose. Yes, some of the issues are out of date, and yes, he is occasionally guilty of emoting and caricaturing when it comes to his favorite thing to hate, and his armchair social science can be quite awful (no, Richard, America is only the ""most religious country in Christendom"" if your world revolves around White Europeans), but ultimately nobody can combine poetry and prose with science like Dawkins.

On the one hand, I found myself wondering, with a degree of pity, how he could get so excited about (to me) largely pointless differences of opinion between himself and other leading biologists - Gould is the obvious example here.

If you agree with him some of the time, you'll probably enjoy the book. This book has more elements of a being something of a social commentary, in terms of his drawing attention to instances of stupidity in the cultures around him. No matter what you think of him, he is insanely lucid and intelligent and definitely ends up telling you a thing or two about things you might not realize you don't know. "

I especially love the Science & Sensibility section in which Dawkins referred to Science as the only real truth, with cool hand, tackling the ape family tree, and the like. Citing examples would spoil the hereticism of the wide caboodle.

To label people as death-deserving enemies because of disagreements about real world politics is bad enough.  To do the same for disagreements about a delusional world inhabited by archangels, demons, and imaginary friends is ludicrously tragic.


I can't say I understood all the details in the first essays on subjects of a slightly technical shade, but it was a helpful jolt for my mind to see how he disagreed with Steven Jay Gould.  I thought Gould was the last word on evolution, but I now I see--and rejoice to know--lively debate is still ongoing.  Science soars on! "
71,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22039713-bob-anderson,4,"This essay collection from Dawkins is a great read, with several gems and high quality throughout. Dawkins’s characteristic style shines throughout the book, on topics ranging from book views and polemic pieces to eulogies and a heartfelt letter though troublingly distant letter to his daughter. My favorites in this books are 2.3, “The Information Challenge”, (the essays are organized into broad sections based on their content, this is the third essay of the second section) which dismantles the information theory argument against evolution; 2.2, “Darwin Triumphant”, which explores whether Darwinian evolution could be a universal concept in a similar manner to gravity; his eulogy for Douglas Adams, 4.2; the whole of section 5, which covers his testy and amiable relationship with Stephen Jay Gould; and of section 6, which is a celebration of Africa through its evolutionary history, the books written about it, and its people. The entire book overflows with passion, both the joyous and the miserable, and with wonders great and small. Each essay is surprising and intriguing, and whether one agrees with the content or not (I generally do), its quality is undeniable."
72,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2784939-eric-orchard,3,"This book begins brilliantly. the esays in the sections Science and Sensibility and Light will Be Thrown are amazing, powerful examples of writing on science, life and culture. I felt that the essays more concerned with religion fell off the rails. I found these essays less reasonable and often ugly. This is understandable as some were written directly after September 11 2001 and in a state of anger. I found the letter to his daughter especially off putting. at one point writing that her dog is dead in order to prove a point. Sometimes he writes as though he hasn't a clue about human nature, coming across as a bit hapless.Also, his (perfectly understandable) distrust of relativism is so so rigid and intolerant that it comes off as almost sexist and racist rather than intelligent. I' sure this is unintended but his essays on these matters lack any form of discourse and are more like extended dismissals, making them seem moot.However, the writings on science and secularism completely redeem the books faults."

In these essays Dawkins revisits the meme, the unit of cultural information that he named and wrote about in his groundbreaking work The Selfish Gene. Here also are moving tributes to friends and colleagues, including a eulogy for novelist Douglas Adams, author of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy; correspondence with the evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould; and visits with the famed paleoanthropologists Richard and Maeve Leakey at their African wildlife preserve. The collection ends with a vivid note to Dawkins's ten-year-old daughter, reminding her to remain curious, to ask questions, and to live the examined life."" (From Amazon)I have to admit that I did not always understand every concept but I enjoyed Dawkins writing and his theory. Since I am not expected to write a paper or put on a lecture (lol) I will continue to read Dawkins."
74,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8396455-john-orman,4,"In this collection of his best essays, Dawkins uses wit and an analytic mind to speak out against pseudoscience, religion, and mysticism. One essay takes on ""crystal power."" As far as religion and science ever converging, Dawkins answers with an emphatic NO!One essay is a moving eulogy written for Douglas Adams in 2001. Quite interesting is his Correspondence with a Darwinian Heavyweight, an exchange of letters between Dawkins and Stephen Jay Gould.Also quite revealing is the author's open letter to his daughter on her tenth birthday, titled ""Good and Bad Reasons for Believing."" It deals with the subject of how we know what we know. The best reason for believing is ""evidence."" Some bad reasons are tradition, authority, and revelation.A very worthwhile venture into the debate between religion and science."
75,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14328341-david,3,"""Devil's Chaplain"" brings together various book reviews, prefaces, eulogies, articles and essays from Richard Dawkins into a single volume. Although none of these essays stray from his familiar areas of expertise there is a different flavor to this work than his other books. Many of the essays feel less formal and as if his personality bleeds through more noticeably than in his books. And though the variety of this collection was novel at first I eventually began to miss the format of his other books maintain the uniformity needed for a concentrated study of a single facet of evolutionary biology. This was an interesting book overall, but in hindsight I might have appreciated it much more so if I had picked it after having read all his other books (which I haven't) much in the same way that fans of a certain author turn to biographies after having finished reading their collected works."
76,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37152-daniel,3,"I read this for Dawkins's correspondance with his academic rival/intellectual equal (essentially, his American counterpart)  Stephen Jay Gould, which was quite interesting. As this book was published shortly after Gould's death, Dawkins included a touching eulogy to the man with whom he clashed academically for three decades, but greatly admired as a dedicated scientist, evolutionary biologist, and friend. Dawkins admits that while it has yet to be determined who will be victorious on the scholarly battlefield, Gould will always be remembered, at the very least, as the greater writer.Much of the rest of the book was later touched upon in Dawkins's 2006 book 
 The God Delusion

77,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5772928-aysun,4,"This book is just as aggressive as I thought it'd be from its name. So the sensitive religious people should be warned in case of an offence. It was a really nice collection of essays on various topics. I found some parts with less Biology to be a little boring, probably cause I've already read many books pointing out the negative sides of religions. I read those parts mostly skimming so as not to get bored and abandon the book. But I've noticed that the author's writing style will never not be unappealing to me no matter how many times I've heard the same things.Overall it was a pretty informative book. I can say that it was time well spent. But I do wish I had read The Greatest Show on Earth instead which has been sitting on my shelf forever."
78,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3735884-stephen-cranney,5,"At the risk of being over the top, Dawkins is hands down the best science writer ever. It's refreshing to be reminded (however occasionally) that a mind is capable of both being scientific and producing good prose. Yes, some of the issues are out of date, and yes, he is occasionally guilty of emoting and caricaturing when it comes to his favorite thing to hate, and his armchair social science can be quite awful (no, Richard, America is only the ""most religious country in Christendom"" if your world revolves around White Europeans), but ultimately nobody can combine poetry and prose with science like Dawkins.

All the same there's some vintage Dawkins in this collection. On the one hand, I found myself wondering, with a degree of pity, how he could get so excited about (to me) largely pointless differences of opinion between himself and other leading biologists - Gould is the obvious example here. But on the other, his almost-angry dogmatism is such fun to read that I have already bought The God Delusion, just for the hell of it, so to speak."
80,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/369112-melody,5,"It would no doubt discomfit Dawkins to know that I revere the words he writes with an almost religious zeal. I love his belligerence, I love his conviction, I love his passion. And I believe he's correct in his science. The closing essay is a letter to his daughter about how to decide what to believe, and it's brilliant. I liked learning more about the alleged feud between Dawkins and Stephen Jay Gould. I found myself taking notes about books mentioned in passing. A delightful book which reinforces all my prejudices."
81,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84487-ron,0,"Richard Dawkins is predictably very opinionated and very certain about just about everything. If you agree with him some of the time, you'll probably enjoy the book. This book has more elements of a being something of a social commentary, in terms of his drawing attention to instances of stupidity in the cultures around him. No matter what you think of him, he is insanely lucid and intelligent and definitely ends up telling you a thing or two about things you might not realize you don't know. "

A must-read for fellow Dawkins fans."

You also need to know Stephen Jay Gould and at least one of his books. And, although I am a big fan of the late, great Douglas Adams, TWO eulogies seems a bit much."

I always find it to be a very well-reasoned militant atheism, so I’m firmly in his camp."

The 32 essays are organized thematically into different sections such as ""Science and Sensibility,"" which is Dawkins's magnificant ode to science and reason, and ""The Infected Mind,"" which forms the bulk of his polemic against the virus-like persistence of religion. Other chapters discuss such varied topics as 'alternative' medicine, genetic information content, the flaws of the trial by jury system, postmodernism, the different brands of Darwinism that various biologists ascribe to, cultural relativism, Moore's Law, cloning, and Africa as Dawkins's personal birthplace as well as the cradle of humanity. Despite the wide breadth of these topics, Dawkins does an excellent job of synthesizing them all together to form a coherent vision of his intellectual passions. Like any great scholar, Dawkins understands his material well enough to tailor it to whatever specific audience he happens to be writing for, in this case the general public. Without trivializing or oversimplifying, Dawkins is able to explain biological ideas of great complexity for someone with only a modicum of scientific background (like me!). More than that, he does so in a way that grips the reader's interest and attention. After reading this book, I felt that I had spent time in the presence of a truly great mind, a mind unafraid of tackling questions that others gloss over and of expressing his opinions straightforwardly and logically. On top of his great skill with prose, Dawkins is a gifted explainer – he finds exactly the right metaphors and exactly the right examples to illustrate a principle clearly, and as a result, I think anyone who reads this book will end up learning a lot about biology and the way that scientists think, even if they aren't scientifically inclined.""Good and Bad Reasons for Believing,"" the final essay in this book, is an open letter that Dawkins wrote to his daughter when she was 10. It's a beautiful ending to the collection because it represents a genuine sharing of wisdom, a lesson not in what to think, but in how to think about the world. I highly recommend this book for anyone, religious or not, scientifically inclined or not. "
127,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51675760-mark-james,4,"This is a hodgepodge of ideas that have no common link except for the fact that they all emerge from Dawkins' brilliant mind. You'll read his reasons for disliking the modern jury system, several essays delineating disagreements with his respected contemporary Stephen Jay Gould, book reviews, and even a letter to his daughter.I found some essays to be heavy with biological jargon, and therefore not as accessible as others, but they still served as a valued introduction to the daunting complexity of our evolutionary past. I suppose that should be obvious though, as this is a compilation of writing for different audiences."
128,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4362419-daniela,5,"“What a book a devils chaplain might write on the clumsy, wasteful, blundering, low, and horrid cruel works of nature”, Writes Charles Darwin half jokingly to his friend when describing the process of natural selection and how imperfect the natural world is. This letter that would of normally be seen as obsolete inspired Mr. Dawkins to combine a collection of his essays and others essays to explain why we shouldn’t fear science and to describe why naturals selection should not be seen as “wasteful, blundering, low, and horrid cruel works of nature”. His essays range from an homage to headmaster Fredrick William Sanderson that describes his unorthodox teachings. To a chapter dedicated to the book Intellectual Imposters. Mr. Dawkins wit and enthusiasm for teaching and learning from others shines through is this remarkable book. New scientist describes the book as “A rare treat… each essay will grip you at once… [Dawkins is] a master of clear exposition of science and its liberating power” .The Sunday Times hails Dawkins as a “genius for snatching mind-boggling possibilities out of the air”. This is an excellent book to read over vacation due to it short length (248 pages) and captivating debatable topics that will make any science nerd second guess their opinion. "
129,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3748-kalilah,3,"Very interesting if superficial look at aspects of science, philosophy, sociology and of course evolution. The authors passion for his topics is evident and infectious even though at times the arguments and terminology may confuse those not thoroughly versed in the field. There are numerous attacks on religious and other belief systems which do not rely on, or require, evidence so if you are a believer and sensitive about your beliefs or your right to those beliefs, then be warned, this book will probably piss you off. For those not so inclined the sarcastic criticism of organized religion is often quite humorous, (for instance:""The Roman Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation claims the 'whole substance' of the wine is converted into the blood of Christ; the appearance of wine that remains is 'merely accidental', 'inhering in no substance'. Transubstantiation is colloquially taught as meaning that the wine 'literally' turns into the blood of Christ. Whether in its obfuscatory Aristotelian or its franker colloquial form, the claim of transubstantiation can be made only if we do serious violence to the normal meanings of words like 'substance' and 'literally'."")So Enjoy!"

It's about evidence-based beliefs as compared to those from tradition, faith, and authority.  I wish I'd written in.  I should print it and send it to my son.There was only one essay specifically blasting religion, but I must say it had its moments.  For example, regarding religion's tendency toward divisive labeling of ""the others"":

To label people as death-deserving enemies because of disagreements about real world politics is bad enough.  To do the same for disagreements about a delusional world inhabited by archangels, demons, and imaginary friends is ludicrously tragic.


I can't say I understood all the details in the first essays on subjects of a slightly technical shade, but it was a helpful jolt for my mind to see how he disagreed with Steven Jay Gould.  I thought Gould was the last word on evolution, but I now I see--and rejoice to know--lively debate is still ongoing.  Science soars on! "
161,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22039713-bob-anderson,4,"This essay collection from Dawkins is a great read, with several gems and high quality throughout. Dawkins’s characteristic style shines throughout the book, on topics ranging from book views and polemic pieces to eulogies and a heartfelt letter though troublingly distant letter to his daughter. My favorites in this books are 2.3, “The Information Challenge”, (the essays are organized into broad sections based on their content, this is the third essay of the second section) which dismantles the information theory argument against evolution; 2.2, “Darwin Triumphant”, which explores whether Darwinian evolution could be a universal concept in a similar manner to gravity; his eulogy for Douglas Adams, 4.2; the whole of section 5, which covers his testy and amiable relationship with Stephen Jay Gould; and of section 6, which is a celebration of Africa through its evolutionary history, the books written about it, and its people. The entire book overflows with passion, both the joyous and the miserable, and with wonders great and small. Each essay is surprising and intriguing, and whether one agrees with the content or not (I generally do), its quality is undeniable."
162,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2784939-eric-orchard,3,"This book begins brilliantly. the esays in the sections Science and Sensibility and Light will Be Thrown are amazing, powerful examples of writing on science, life and culture. I felt that the essays more concerned with religion fell off the rails. I found these essays less reasonable and often ugly. This is understandable as some were written directly after September 11 2001 and in a state of anger. I found the letter to his daughter especially off putting. at one point writing that her dog is dead in order to prove a point. Sometimes he writes as though he hasn't a clue about human nature, coming across as a bit hapless.Also, his (perfectly understandable) distrust of relativism is so so rigid and intolerant that it comes off as almost sexist and racist rather than intelligent. I' sure this is unintended but his essays on these matters lack any form of discourse and are more like extended dismissals, making them seem moot.However, the writings on science and secularism completely redeem the books faults."

In these essays Dawkins revisits the meme, the unit of cultural information that he named and wrote about in his groundbreaking work The Selfish Gene. Here also are moving tributes to friends and colleagues, including a eulogy for novelist Douglas Adams, author of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy; correspondence with the evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould; and visits with the famed paleoanthropologists Richard and Maeve Leakey at their African wildlife preserve. The collection ends with a vivid note to Dawkins's ten-year-old daughter, reminding her to remain curious, to ask questions, and to live the examined life."" (From Amazon)I have to admit that I did not always understand every concept but I enjoyed Dawkins writing and his theory. Since I am not expected to write a paper or put on a lecture (lol) I will continue to read Dawkins."
164,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8396455-john-orman,4,"In this collection of his best essays, Dawkins uses wit and an analytic mind to speak out against pseudoscience, religion, and mysticism. One essay takes on ""crystal power."" As far as religion and science ever converging, Dawkins answers with an emphatic NO!One essay is a moving eulogy written for Douglas Adams in 2001. Quite interesting is his Correspondence with a Darwinian Heavyweight, an exchange of letters between Dawkins and Stephen Jay Gould.Also quite revealing is the author's open letter to his daughter on her tenth birthday, titled ""Good and Bad Reasons for Believing."" It deals with the subject of how we know what we know. The best reason for believing is ""evidence."" Some bad reasons are tradition, authority, and revelation.A very worthwhile venture into the debate between religion and science."
165,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14328341-david,3,"""Devil's Chaplain"" brings together various book reviews, prefaces, eulogies, articles and essays from Richard Dawkins into a single volume. Although none of these essays stray from his familiar areas of expertise there is a different flavor to this work than his other books. Many of the essays feel less formal and as if his personality bleeds through more noticeably than in his books. And though the variety of this collection was novel at first I eventually began to miss the format of his other books maintain the uniformity needed for a concentrated study of a single facet of evolutionary biology. This was an interesting book overall, but in hindsight I might have appreciated it much more so if I had picked it after having read all his other books (which I haven't) much in the same way that fans of a certain author turn to biographies after having finished reading their collected works."
166,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37152-daniel,3,"I read this for Dawkins's correspondance with his academic rival/intellectual equal (essentially, his American counterpart)  Stephen Jay Gould, which was quite interesting. As this book was published shortly after Gould's death, Dawkins included a touching eulogy to the man with whom he clashed academically for three decades, but greatly admired as a dedicated scientist, evolutionary biologist, and friend. Dawkins admits that while it has yet to be determined who will be victorious on the scholarly battlefield, Gould will always be remembered, at the very least, as the greater writer.Much of the rest of the book was later touched upon in Dawkins's 2006 book 
 The God Delusion

167,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5772928-aysun,4,"This book is just as aggressive as I thought it'd be from its name. So the sensitive religious people should be warned in case of an offence. It was a really nice collection of essays on various topics. I found some parts with less Biology to be a little boring, probably cause I've already read many books pointing out the negative sides of religions. I read those parts mostly skimming so as not to get bored and abandon the book. But I've noticed that the author's writing style will never not be unappealing to me no matter how many times I've heard the same things.Overall it was a pretty informative book. I can say that it was time well spent. But I do wish I had read The Greatest Show on Earth instead which has been sitting on my shelf forever."
168,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3735884-stephen-cranney,5,"At the risk of being over the top, Dawkins is hands down the best science writer ever. It's refreshing to be reminded (however occasionally) that a mind is capable of both being scientific and producing good prose. Yes, some of the issues are out of date, and yes, he is occasionally guilty of emoting and caricaturing when it comes to his favorite thing to hate, and his armchair social science can be quite awful (no, Richard, America is only the ""most religious country in Christendom"" if your world revolves around White Europeans), but ultimately nobody can combine poetry and prose with science like Dawkins.

All the same there's some vintage Dawkins in this collection. On the one hand, I found myself wondering, with a degree of pity, how he could get so excited about (to me) largely pointless differences of opinion between himself and other leading biologists - Gould is the obvious example here. But on the other, his almost-angry dogmatism is such fun to read that I have already bought The God Delusion, just for the hell of it, so to speak."
170,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/369112-melody,5,"It would no doubt discomfit Dawkins to know that I revere the words he writes with an almost religious zeal. I love his belligerence, I love his conviction, I love his passion. And I believe he's correct in his science. The closing essay is a letter to his daughter about how to decide what to believe, and it's brilliant. I liked learning more about the alleged feud between Dawkins and Stephen Jay Gould. I found myself taking notes about books mentioned in passing. A delightful book which reinforces all my prejudices."
171,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84487-ron,0,"Richard Dawkins is predictably very opinionated and very certain about just about everything. If you agree with him some of the time, you'll probably enjoy the book. This book has more elements of a being something of a social commentary, in terms of his drawing attention to instances of stupidity in the cultures around him. No matter what you think of him, he is insanely lucid and intelligent and definitely ends up telling you a thing or two about things you might not realize you don't know. "

A must-read for fellow Dawkins fans."

I always find it to be a very well-reasoned militant atheism, so I’m firmly in his camp."

The 32 essays are organized thematically into different sections such as ""Science and Sensibility,"" which is Dawkins's magnificant ode to science and reason, and ""The Infected Mind,"" which forms the bulk of his polemic against the virus-like persistence of religion. Other chapters discuss such varied topics as 'alternative' medicine, genetic information content, the flaws of the trial by jury system, postmodernism, the different brands of Darwinism that various biologists ascribe to, cultural relativism, Moore's Law, cloning, and Africa as Dawkins's personal birthplace as well as the cradle of humanity. Despite the wide breadth of these topics, Dawkins does an excellent job of synthesizing them all together to form a coherent vision of his intellectual passions. Like any great scholar, Dawkins understands his material well enough to tailor it to whatever specific audience he happens to be writing for, in this case the general public. Without trivializing or oversimplifying, Dawkins is able to explain biological ideas of great complexity for someone with only a modicum of scientific background (like me!). More than that, he does so in a way that grips the reader's interest and attention. After reading this book, I felt that I had spent time in the presence of a truly great mind, a mind unafraid of tackling questions that others gloss over and of expressing his opinions straightforwardly and logically. On top of his great skill with prose, Dawkins is a gifted explainer – he finds exactly the right metaphors and exactly the right examples to illustrate a principle clearly, and as a result, I think anyone who reads this book will end up learning a lot about biology and the way that scientists think, even if they aren't scientifically inclined.""Good and Bad Reasons for Believing,"" the final essay in this book, is an open letter that Dawkins wrote to his daughter when she was 10. It's a beautiful ending to the collection because it represents a genuine sharing of wisdom, a lesson not in what to think, but in how to think about the world. I highly recommend this book for anyone, religious or not, scientifically inclined or not. "
217,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51675760-mark-james,4,"This is a hodgepodge of ideas that have no common link except for the fact that they all emerge from Dawkins' brilliant mind. You'll read his reasons for disliking the modern jury system, several essays delineating disagreements with his respected contemporary Stephen Jay Gould, book reviews, and even a letter to his daughter.I found some essays to be heavy with biological jargon, and therefore not as accessible as others, but they still served as a valued introduction to the daunting complexity of our evolutionary past. I suppose that should be obvious though, as this is a compilation of writing for different audiences."

This letter that would of normally be seen as obsolete inspired Mr. Dawkins to combine a collection of his essays and others essays to explain why we shouldn’t fear science and to describe why naturals selection should not be seen as “wasteful, blundering, low, and horrid cruel works of nature”. His essays range from an homage to headmaster Fredrick William Sanderson that describes his unorthodox teachings. To a chapter dedicated to the book Intellectual Imposters. Mr. Dawkins wit and enthusiasm for teaching and learning from others shines through is this remarkable book. New scientist describes the book as “A rare treat… each essay will grip you at once… [Dawkins is] a master of clear exposition of science and its liberating power” .The Sunday Times hails Dawkins as a “genius for snatching mind-boggling possibilities out of the air”. This is an excellent book to read over vacation due to it short length (248 pages) and captivating debatable topics that will make any science nerd second guess their opinion. "

The authors passion for his topics is evident and infectious even though at times the arguments and terminology may confuse those not thoroughly versed in the field. There are numerous attacks on religious and other belief systems which do not rely on, or require, evidence so if you are a believer and sensitive about your beliefs or your right to those beliefs, then be warned, this book will probably piss you off. For those not so inclined the sarcastic criticism of organized religion is often quite humorous, (for instance:""The Roman Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation claims the 'whole substance' of the wine is converted into the blood of Christ; the appearance of wine that remains is 'merely accidental', 'inhering in no substance'. Transubstantiation is colloquially taught as meaning that the wine 'literally' turns into the blood of Christ. Whether in its obfuscatory Aristotelian or its franker colloquial form, the claim of transubstantiation can be made only if we do serious violence to the normal meanings of words like 'substance' and 'literally'."")So Enjoy!"

After reading this book, I felt that I had spent time in the presence of a truly great mind, a mind unafraid of tackling questions that others gloss over and of expressing his opinions straightforwardly and logically. On top of his great skill with prose, Dawkins is a gifted explainer – he finds exactly the right metaphors and exactly the right examples to illustrate a principle clearly, and as a result, I think anyone who reads this book will end up learning a lot about biology and the way that scientists think, even if they aren't scientifically inclined.""Good and Bad Reasons for Believing,"" the final essay in this book, is an open letter that Dawkins wrote to his daughter when she was 10.

It's about evidence-based beliefs as compared to those from tradition, faith, and authority.  I wish I'd written in.  I should print it and send it to my son.There was only one essay specifically blasting religion, but I must say it had its moments.  For example, regarding religion's tendency toward divisive labeling of ""the others"":

To label people as death-deserving enemies because of disagreements about real world politics is bad enough.  To do the same for disagreements about a delusional world inhabited by archangels, demons, and imaginary friends is ludicrously tragic.


I can't say I understood all the details in the first essays on subjects of a slightly technical shade, but it was a helpful jolt for my mind to see how he disagreed with Steven Jay Gould.  I thought Gould was the last word on evolution, but I now I see--and rejoice to know--lively debate is still ongoing.  Science soars on! "
251,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22039713-bob-anderson,4,"This essay collection from Dawkins is a great read, with several gems and high quality throughout. Dawkins’s characteristic style shines throughout the book, on topics ranging from book views and polemic pieces to eulogies and a heartfelt letter though troublingly distant letter to his daughter. My favorites in this books are 2.3, “The Information Challenge”, (the essays are organized into broad sections based on their content, this is the third essay of the second section) which dismantles the information theory argument against evolution; 2.2, “Darwin Triumphant”, which explores whether Darwinian evolution could be a universal concept in a similar manner to gravity; his eulogy for Douglas Adams, 4.2; the whole of section 5, which covers his testy and amiable relationship with Stephen Jay Gould; and of section 6, which is a celebration of Africa through its evolutionary history, the books written about it, and its people. The entire book overflows with passion, both the joyous and the miserable, and with wonders great and small. Each essay is surprising and intriguing, and whether one agrees with the content or not (I generally do), its quality is undeniable."
252,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2784939-eric-orchard,3,"This book begins brilliantly. the esays in the sections Science and Sensibility and Light will Be Thrown are amazing, powerful examples of writing on science, life and culture. I felt that the essays more concerned with religion fell off the rails. I found these essays less reasonable and often ugly. This is understandable as some were written directly after September 11 2001 and in a state of anger. I found the letter to his daughter especially off putting. at one point writing that her dog is dead in order to prove a point. Sometimes he writes as though he hasn't a clue about human nature, coming across as a bit hapless.Also, his (perfectly understandable) distrust of relativism is so so rigid and intolerant that it comes off as almost sexist and racist rather than intelligent. I' sure this is unintended but his essays on these matters lack any form of discourse and are more like extended dismissals, making them seem moot.However, the writings on science and secularism completely redeem the books faults."

In these essays Dawkins revisits the meme, the unit of cultural information that he named and wrote about in his groundbreaking work The Selfish Gene. Here also are moving tributes to friends and colleagues, including a eulogy for novelist Douglas Adams, author of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy; correspondence with the evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould; and visits with the famed paleoanthropologists Richard and Maeve Leakey at their African wildlife preserve. The collection ends with a vivid note to Dawkins's ten-year-old daughter, reminding her to remain curious, to ask questions, and to live the examined life."" (From Amazon)I have to admit that I did not always understand every concept but I enjoyed Dawkins writing and his theory. Since I am not expected to write a paper or put on a lecture (lol) I will continue to read Dawkins."
254,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8396455-john-orman,4,"In this collection of his best essays, Dawkins uses wit and an analytic mind to speak out against pseudoscience, religion, and mysticism. One essay takes on ""crystal power."" As far as religion and science ever converging, Dawkins answers with an emphatic NO!One essay is a moving eulogy written for Douglas Adams in 2001. Quite interesting is his Correspondence with a Darwinian Heavyweight, an exchange of letters between Dawkins and Stephen Jay Gould.Also quite revealing is the author's open letter to his daughter on her tenth birthday, titled ""Good and Bad Reasons for Believing."" It deals with the subject of how we know what we know. The best reason for believing is ""evidence."" Some bad reasons are tradition, authority, and revelation.A very worthwhile venture into the debate between religion and science."
255,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14328341-david,3,"""Devil's Chaplain"" brings together various book reviews, prefaces, eulogies, articles and essays from Richard Dawkins into a single volume. Although none of these essays stray from his familiar areas of expertise there is a different flavor to this work than his other books. Many of the essays feel less formal and as if his personality bleeds through more noticeably than in his books. And though the variety of this collection was novel at first I eventually began to miss the format of his other books maintain the uniformity needed for a concentrated study of a single facet of evolutionary biology. This was an interesting book overall, but in hindsight I might have appreciated it much more so if I had picked it after having read all his other books (which I haven't) much in the same way that fans of a certain author turn to biographies after having finished reading their collected works."
256,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37152-daniel,3,"I read this for Dawkins's correspondance with his academic rival/intellectual equal (essentially, his American counterpart)  Stephen Jay Gould, which was quite interesting. As this book was published shortly after Gould's death, Dawkins included a touching eulogy to the man with whom he clashed academically for three decades, but greatly admired as a dedicated scientist, evolutionary biologist, and friend. Dawkins admits that while it has yet to be determined who will be victorious on the scholarly battlefield, Gould will always be remembered, at the very least, as the greater writer.Much of the rest of the book was later touched upon in Dawkins's 2006 book 
 The God Delusion

257,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5772928-aysun,4,"This book is just as aggressive as I thought it'd be from its name. So the sensitive religious people should be warned in case of an offence. It was a really nice collection of essays on various topics. I found some parts with less Biology to be a little boring, probably cause I've already read many books pointing out the negative sides of religions. I read those parts mostly skimming so as not to get bored and abandon the book. But I've noticed that the author's writing style will never not be unappealing to me no matter how many times I've heard the same things.Overall it was a pretty informative book. I can say that it was time well spent. But I do wish I had read The Greatest Show on Earth instead which has been sitting on my shelf forever."
258,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3735884-stephen-cranney,5,"At the risk of being over the top, Dawkins is hands down the best science writer ever. It's refreshing to be reminded (however occasionally) that a mind is capable of both being scientific and producing good prose. Yes, some of the issues are out of date, and yes, he is occasionally guilty of emoting and caricaturing when it comes to his favorite thing to hate, and his armchair social science can be quite awful (no, Richard, America is only the ""most religious country in Christendom"" if your world revolves around White Europeans), but ultimately nobody can combine poetry and prose with science like Dawkins.

All the same there's some vintage Dawkins in this collection. On the one hand, I found myself wondering, with a degree of pity, how he could get so excited about (to me) largely pointless differences of opinion between himself and other leading biologists - Gould is the obvious example here. But on the other, his almost-angry dogmatism is such fun to read that I have already bought The God Delusion, just for the hell of it, so to speak."
260,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/369112-melody,5,"It would no doubt discomfit Dawkins to know that I revere the words he writes with an almost religious zeal. I love his belligerence, I love his conviction, I love his passion. And I believe he's correct in his science. The closing essay is a letter to his daughter about how to decide what to believe, and it's brilliant. I liked learning more about the alleged feud between Dawkins and Stephen Jay Gould. I found myself taking notes about books mentioned in passing. A delightful book which reinforces all my prejudices."
261,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84487-ron,0,"Richard Dawkins is predictably very opinionated and very certain about just about everything. If you agree with him some of the time, you'll probably enjoy the book. This book has more elements of a being something of a social commentary, in terms of his drawing attention to instances of stupidity in the cultures around him.

It's about evidence-based beliefs as compared to those from tradition, faith, and authority.  I wish I'd written in.  I should print it and send it to my son.There was only one essay specifically blasting religion, but I must say it had its moments.  For example, regarding religion's tendency toward divisive labeling of ""the others"":

To label people as death-deserving enemies because of disagreements about real world politics is bad enough.  To do the same for disagreements about a delusional world inhabited by archangels, demons, and imaginary friends is ludicrously tragic.


I can't say I understood all the details in the first essays on subjects of a slightly technical shade, but it was a helpful jolt for my mind to see how he disagreed with Steven Jay Gould.  I thought Gould was the last word on evolution, but I now I see--and rejoice to know--lively debate is still ongoing.  Science soars on!

281,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22039713-bob-anderson,4,"This essay collection from Dawkins is a great read, with several gems and high quality throughout. Dawkins’s characteristic style shines throughout the book, on topics ranging from book views and polemic pieces to eulogies and a heartfelt letter though troublingly distant letter to his daughter. My favorites in this books are 2.3, “The Information Challenge”, (the essays are organized into broad sections based on their content, this is the third essay of the second section) which dismantles the information theory argument against evolution; 2.2, “Darwin Triumphant”, which explores whether Darwinian evolution could be a universal concept in a similar manner to gravity; his eulogy for Douglas Adams, 4.2; the whole of section 5, which covers his testy and amiable relationship with Stephen Jay Gould; and of section 6, which is a celebration of Africa through its evolutionary history, the books written about it, and its people. The entire book overflows with passion, both the joyous and the miserable, and with wonders great and small. Each essay is surprising and intriguing, and whether one agrees with the content or not (I generally do), its quality is undeniable."
282,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2784939-eric-orchard,3,"This book begins brilliantly. the esays in the sections Science and Sensibility and Light will Be Thrown are amazing, powerful examples of writing on science, life and culture. I felt that the essays more concerned with religion fell off the rails. I found these essays less reasonable and often ugly. This is understandable as some were written directly after September 11 2001 and in a state of anger. I found the letter to his daughter especially off putting. at one point writing that her dog is dead in order to prove a point. Sometimes he writes as though he hasn't a clue about human nature, coming across as a bit hapless.Also, his (perfectly understandable) distrust of relativism is so so rigid and intolerant that it comes off as almost sexist and racist rather than intelligent. I' sure this is unintended but his essays on these matters lack any form of discourse and are more like extended dismissals, making them seem moot.However, the writings on science and secularism completely redeem the books faults."
283,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6275022-kris---my-novelesque-life,4,"4 STARS""The first collection of essays from renowned scientist and best-selling author Richard Dawkins is an enthusiastic declaration, a testament to the power of rigorous scientific examination to reveal the wonders of the world. In these essays Dawkins revisits the meme, the unit of cultural information that he named and wrote about in his groundbreaking work The Selfish Gene. Here also are moving tributes to friends and colleagues, including a eulogy for novelist Douglas Adams, author of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy; correspondence with the evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould; and visits with the famed paleoanthropologists Richard and Maeve Leakey at their African wildlife preserve. The collection ends with a vivid note to Dawkins's ten-year-old daughter, reminding her to remain curious, to ask questions, and to live the examined life."" (From Amazon)I have to admit that I did not always understand every concept but I enjoyed Dawkins writing and his theory. Since I am not expected to write a paper or put on a lecture (lol) I will continue to read Dawkins."
284,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8396455-john-orman,4,"In this collection of his best essays, Dawkins uses wit and an analytic mind to speak out against pseudoscience, religion, and mysticism. One essay takes on ""crystal power."" As far as religion and science ever converging, Dawkins answers with an emphatic NO!One essay is a moving eulogy written for Douglas Adams in 2001. Quite interesting is his Correspondence with a Darwinian Heavyweight, an exchange of letters between Dawkins and Stephen Jay Gould.Also quite revealing is the author's open letter to his daughter on her tenth birthday, titled ""Good and Bad Reasons for Believing."" It deals with the subject of how we know what we know. The best reason for believing is ""evidence."" Some bad reasons are tradition, authority, and revelation.A very worthwhile venture into the debate between religion and science."
285,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14328341-david,3,"""Devil's Chaplain"" brings together various book reviews, prefaces, eulogies, articles and essays from Richard Dawkins into a single volume. Although none of these essays stray from his familiar areas of expertise there is a different flavor to this work than his other books. Many of the essays feel less formal and as if his personality bleeds through more noticeably than in his books. And though the variety of this collection was novel at first I eventually began to miss the format of his other books maintain the uniformity needed for a concentrated study of a single facet of evolutionary biology. This was an interesting book overall, but in hindsight I might have appreciated it much more so if I had picked it after having read all his other books (which I haven't) much in the same way that fans of a certain author turn to biographies after having finished reading their collected works."
286,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37152-daniel,3,"I read this for Dawkins's correspondance with his academic rival/intellectual equal (essentially, his American counterpart)  Stephen Jay Gould, which was quite interesting. As this book was published shortly after Gould's death, Dawkins included a touching eulogy to the man with whom he clashed academically for three decades, but greatly admired as a dedicated scientist, evolutionary biologist, and friend. Dawkins admits that while it has yet to be determined who will be victorious on the scholarly battlefield, Gould will always be remembered, at the very least, as the greater writer.Much of the rest of the book was later touched upon in Dawkins's 2006 book 
 The God Delusion

287,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5772928-aysun,4,"This book is just as aggressive as I thought it'd be from its name. So the sensitive religious people should be warned in case of an offence. It was a really nice collection of essays on various topics. I found some parts with less Biology to be a little boring, probably cause I've already read many books pointing out the negative sides of religions. I read those parts mostly skimming so as not to get bored and abandon the book. But I've noticed that the author's writing style will never not be unappealing to me no matter how many times I've heard the same things.Overall it was a pretty informative book. I can say that it was time well spent. But I do wish I had read The Greatest Show on Earth instead which has been sitting on my shelf forever."
288,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3735884-stephen-cranney,5,"At the risk of being over the top, Dawkins is hands down the best science writer ever. It's refreshing to be reminded (however occasionally) that a mind is capable of both being scientific and producing good prose. Yes, some of the issues are out of date, and yes, he is occasionally guilty of emoting and caricaturing when it comes to his favorite thing to hate, and his armchair social science can be quite awful (no, Richard, America is only the ""most religious country in Christendom"" if your world revolves around White Europeans), but ultimately nobody can combine poetry and prose with science like Dawkins. "
289,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17609571-peter-ellwood,3,"One can scarcely expect a book that contains a number of introductions to other people's books to have quite the sparkle and rigour of, say The Selfish Gene. All the same there's some vintage Dawkins in this collection. On the one hand, I found myself wondering, with a degree of pity, how he could get so excited about (to me) largely pointless differences of opinion between himself and other leading biologists - Gould is the obvious example here. But on the other, his almost-angry dogmatism is such fun to read that I have already bought The God Delusion, just for the hell of it, so to speak."
290,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/369112-melody,5,"It would no doubt discomfit Dawkins to know that I revere the words he writes with an almost religious zeal. I love his belligerence, I love his conviction, I love his passion. And I believe he's correct in his science. The closing essay is a letter to his daughter about how to decide what to believe, and it's brilliant. I liked learning more about the alleged feud between Dawkins and Stephen Jay Gould. I found myself taking notes about books mentioned in passing. A delightful book which reinforces all my prejudices."
291,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84487-ron,0,"Richard Dawkins is predictably very opinionated and very certain about just about everything. If you agree with him some of the time, you'll probably enjoy the book. This book has more elements of a being something of a social commentary, in terms of his drawing attention to instances of stupidity in the cultures around him. No matter what you think of him, he is insanely lucid and intelligent and definitely ends up telling you a thing or two about things you might not realize you don't know. "
292,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31974301-aljohn,4,"This is a tiptop collection of essays written by The RD, however boastful the book has presented itself to be. I especially love the Science & Sensibility section in which Dawkins referred to Science as the only real truth, with cool hand, tackling the ape family tree, and the like. Citing examples would spoil the hereticism of the wide caboodle. RD may sound increasingly full of himself but he actually mastered the art of sometimes losing the overall momentum of the book, thus not afraid of putting on the table honest opinions and sensible ideas. "
293,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/961766-kim,5,"I read this entire book in one sitting, while in a huge hotel lobby, sipping coffee, smelling pinon incense burning, watching the day unfold over the desert in Santa Fe. This is one of the most meaningful books I've ever read, with insightful essays about medicine, god, faith or lack thereof, politics . . . . Well written, engaging, though-provoking - I highly recommended this to anyone questioning their faith in religion,alternative medicine,or other avenues involving great leaps of faith."
294,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21175344-aristotle,5,"The more I read from Prof. Dawkins, the more I marvel at his genius. The book in hand was not really intended to be a book, it is basically a collection of essays and discourses by Dawkins spread over a span of time. He, as always, returns to questioning the meaning of religions, debunking the superstitious flow of thought. He briefs about memetics, quackery and a teeming spectrum of other topics. A must-read for fellow Dawkins fans."
295,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34672471-rena-sherwood,2,"A very uneven affair from the normally brilliant Dawkins. You can see how much better a writer he became as he got older. The older essays seem to go on forever. You do need to be familiar with Dawkins' works and critics in order to get the gist of what he's writing about. You also need to know Stephen Jay Gould and at least one of his books. And, although I am a big fan of the late, great Douglas Adams, TWO eulogies seems a bit much."
296,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/712285-brian-steed,0,"Great read, as Dawkins always is, and as a collection of short pieces it’s much more readable than most of his other books, which tend to be in-depth explanations of evolutionary theory. Dawkins seems to enjoy a “love him/hate him” relationship with the public, mostly because of his militant atheism. I always find it to be a very well-reasoned militant atheism, so I’m firmly in his camp."
297,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1576839-matt,4,"I always avoided reading Richard Dawkins because I thought he seemed inflamatory or something. Which suspicion, after reading this collection of short essays by Dawkins (lent to me by Christina), was confirmed. However, he is also a very smart, fun to read author who logically defends his position on the side of science. I may end up reading more of him. "
298,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/305584-tia,3,"I was torn between liked it and really liked it because well, Dawkins is pretty pompous on occasion. His observations are for the most part insightful and interesting but sometimes I just want to smack him upside the head and remind him that he's preaching to the choir so he can ease off a bit (irony intended)."
299,0618485392,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3941555-carlos,3,"This collection of essays serves quite well to give the reader an insight into some of Dawkins’ major arguments and worldview. Despite treating some very serious subjects, he manages, as he is known to do, to write the essays in such a style that he gets his point across quite readily and without boring the reader in the least."
