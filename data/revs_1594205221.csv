0,1594205221,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3260895-stuart,0,"Here's the deal. If you're a social scientist or a physical scientist (me) who works outside the world of controlled laboratory data, you have to make sense of the world with imperfect experiments. You often have limited data, you can't repeat your experiments, and the differences between your subject and control are sometimes very fuzzy. Yet you have to try to make some inferences even though imperfect data are all you have. How do you do that in an honest and careful way? That's what How Not To Be Wrong is about.How Not To Be Wrong is, in terms of quality of prose, the best written book on applied math and statistics I've ever read. The author has an MFA as well as a math Ph.D., so maybe that's not surprising. The title isn't quite right, though. The book is really about ""how to try to be right even though you know you're going to make mistakes now and then."" That's not as catchy a title, I know. There's a lot of useful and thoughtful material here mixed in with the elegant writing. It's not really a layman's book although it's being sold that way. That's OK. Those kinds of books, like Freakonomics, are usually awful and filled with junk analyses. This one, on the other hand, is filled with good stuff. It isn't a perfect book. There are occasional glitches. That's OK, too. Math geeks, especially math geeks who love a good sentence, will love it. I hope that social scientists and scientists who use (and often abuse) math and statistics read it as well."
1,1594205221,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"This is a wonderful book about mathematics and its application to everyday life. Jordan Ellenberg shows that the certainty that people associate with math is often misplaced; some areas of math are devoted to uncertainty, and that's where things get very interesting.Ellenberg starts the book with a beautiful example of application of mathematics, logic, and thinking out of the box. During World War II, a group of mathematicians working for the Statistical Research Group were given a problem by some Air Force officers. Fighter planes returning from missions were analyzed for bullet holes. The number of bullet holes per square foot were counted. For example, there were 1.11 bullet holes per square foot in the vicinity of the engine, 1.73 in the fuselage, 1.55 in the fuel system, and 1.8 in the rest of the plane. The officers wanted to add some armor to the planes; the question was where? The planes could only support so much weight, and where would additional armor be most advantageous? The officers thought that since the fuselage had the greatest density of bullets, that would be the logical location for more armor. A mathematician named Abraham Wald said exactly the opposite; more armor is needed where the bullet holes aren't, namely, around the engines. Planes with lots of bullet holes in the engine did not return at all!The book discusses the issue of statistical significance. Scientific experiment often use a 95% confidence threshold as an indicator of statistical significance. This means that if a truly random outcome were expected, a positive correlation would be seen only 5% of the time. Ellenberg includes an xkcd cartoon that shows how easy it would be to perform a set of experiments that could come up with statistically significant results like ""Green jelly beans linked to acne! at the 95% confidence level.Some of the section and chapter titles are hilarious. For example, in the chapter titled ""Are you there, God? It's me, Bayesian Inference"", Ellenberg brings up a scary example of the use of ""big data"". Based on a teen-age girl's purchases of unscented lotion, mineral supplements, and cotton balls, the retail store ""Target"" began sending her coupons for baby gear, because of the (correct) inference that she was pregnant. Another great section title is ""One more thing about God, then I promise we're done.""Another interesting title is ""The Cat in the Hat, the Cleanest man in school, and the creation of the universe"", in which Ellenberg reviews some of the probabilistic arguments for and against the existence of god. And I love the famous quote by Richard Feynman: 
You know, the most amazing thing happened to me tonight. I was coming here, on the way to the lecture, and I came in through the parking lot. And you won't believe what happened. I saw a car with the license plate ARW375. Can you imagine? Of all the millions of license plates in the state, what was the chance that I would see that particular one tonight? Amazing!
I also love the chapter title, ""If Gambling is exciting, you're doing it wrong"". Ellenberg describes how several groups capitalized on several state lotteries. Due to some strange lottery rules, it is (was?) possible to reliably make a profit, given enough investment of resources. No illegal shenanigans--the states make money no matter what you do. You could make a profit by taking advantage of the rules, and of the people who buy lottery tickets without a coherent strategy. And, I did not realize that Voltaire made his fortune by taking advantage of state lotteries!Ellenberg brings up the phenomenon of Nate Silver predicting the outcome of the Obama-vs.-Romney election. Silver predicted the probability of both candidates winning state by state, along with the margin of error. By adding up the probable errors, he estimated that he would be wrong by 2.83 states. Critics seemed to have ignored the fact that he was not wrong by this many states--in fact he correctly predicted the outcome in all 50 states!I highly recommend this book to all people who are even vaguely interested in math, probability, logic, and the application to everyday life. This is an excellent book!"
2,1594205221,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24866027-will-once,3,"I so wanted to like this book.It's a topic I enjoy. I flicked through the book and the author was saying things that I agree with. Jordan clearly knows what he is talking about. All the signs were good.So why the 3 stars? Because the book is unfortunately quite dull. There are long sections where Jordan spends ages proving some mathematical point or other, but then he doesn't draw any conclusions from it.He starts with a story about school kids not liking mathematics because they can't see the relevance to their lives ... and then he gives us a book which largely proves that the kids were right. Some of his explanations are linked to something useful and real world, but most are not.And when he does make a point, sometimes he wants to hammer that point in with explanation after explanation. It's as if he is trying to batter us into submission with repeated hammer blows. Yeah, yeah, I got it.The writing varies from quite readable to fairly turgid. At times it feels like we are wading through a text book.The title is a complete misnomer. If you are looking for a practical guide on the use of mathematics, then look elsewhere. This does not tell you how not to be wrong. Please, please, either write a book to fit the blurb or change the blurb. This does not do what is says on the tin.Disappointing. There is a good book in here, but it needs a much stronger edit to make it readable. And it needs to be linked more to real life. So it's a three star for me. The content ought to make it a five star book. The writing and limited conclusions drag it back to three."
3,1594205221,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1188122-kara-babcock,5,"I math for a living. I mathed, both amateurly and professionally, at school. I math quite a bit. And as a math teacher, I like reading ""pop math"" books that try to do for math what many science writers have done for science. So picking up How Not to Be Wrong was a no-brainer when I saw it on that bookstore shelf. I’ve read and enjoyed some of Jordan Ellenberg’s columns on Slate and elsewhere (some of them appear or are adapted as chapters of this book). And he doesn’t disappoint.I should make one thing clear: I mainlined this book like it was the finest heroin. Partly that’s because I just love reading about math, but in this case I was also days away from moving back to Canada from the UK when I started this, and luggage space was at a premium, so I was on a deadline to finish this book. I injected chapters at a time into my veins, revelling in that rush as Ellenberg charismatically and entertainingly explores the math behind a lot of everyday concepts and ideas. Unlike similar attempts, however, Ellenberg doesn’t pull the punches. He’s more than willing to go into the higher-concept ideas behind the math, and when it starts getting too esoteric or academic even for this venue, he’s always ready with a book recommendation for those interested in some further reading.Early in my reading, I tweeted I had already decided to give this book five stars because Ellenberg alludes to Mean Girls in a footnote. (Specifically, he says, “As Lindsay Lohan would put it, ’the limit does not exist!’”) That’s really all you need to know about Ellenberg’s writing style and sense of humour. Actually, I’m not all that enamoured with the footnotes in general; they interrupted the flow of my reading and the symbols used to mark them were slightly too small, so I kept missing them in the text—but that’s a design issue. The content of the footnotes themselves is often informative or, as in the case above, humorous. Ellenberg might be a university math professor, but he also has a sense of humour and an awareness of pop culture that helps to make his writing accessible.I’m impressed by the way Ellenberg effortlessly straddles pure and applied mathematics. The child of two statisticians, he clearly has a good grasp and appreciation of the way applied math drives so many areas of society. From economics to gambling, he makes passionate appeals for informed perspectives over simplistic analogies or fallacies. His first chapter criticizes analogies that promote linear thinking about taxation when the very same economists writing these analogies know that taxation probably isn’t linear. He doesn’t argue for or against an increase in taxes, but rather he points out that it’s wrong to oversimplify the concept when trying to sell it to the public. Is a curve really all that much harder to understand than a line?There’s also some great chapters on odds and the lottery, in which Ellenberg recounts how a group of MIT students set up a legitimate operation to bulk buy lottery tickets from a certain game that actually gave them good odds of winning. They made a profit, because they used math to turn a game of chance into a predictable investment strategy (which is more than we can say for the stock market). So, you know, stay in school kids.But actually, the parts about the lottery that impressed me were more towards the purer end of the math spectrum. Ellenberg started discussing, for example, how best to pick the numbers on one’s tickets so that one could maximize the chance of winning at each tier of prizes. It turns out that it’s possible to represent the way of picking these numbers geometrically (yes, as in pictures) and that it’s related to the way we create error-correcting codes (which allow us to send instructions to spacecraft, and compress data in JPEGs, MP3s, and on discs). He goes into quite a bit of detail about the more advanced concepts behind these ideas. Later, he points out how correlation on scatter plots corresponds to an ellipse—and we know how to deal with ellipses algebraically, which gives us a good toolset for talking about correlation algebraically too.So, How Not to Be Wrong makes an effort time and again to belie the impression that we often get in school that math consists of a series of discrete topics: arithmetic, geometry, statistics, and the dreaded algebra. We teach it that way because it’s easier to lay out as a curriculum and focus on the essential skills of each discipline. And also because we are boring. If you’re lucky, like me, then as a student you’ll start to see the connections yourself. Circles and pi start showing up everywhere, to the point where suddenly you feel like you’re being stalked, and no amount of infinite series or integration is going to save you. But really, good teachers start showing these connections as soon as possible. We fail students and leave them behind because, in our rush to equip them with the skills we’ve been told they need, we rob them of the idea that math is a creative process, instead fostering this false impression that math is a sterile, difficult, procedural slog. If it is, then you might be a computer.Ellenberg never demands a knowledge of integral calculus, of set theory, or of transfinite numbers. What he does demand is an open mind, a willingness to be convinced that not only does math have a useful place in life (it’s pretty obvious to most people that someone needs to know how to math; they just don’t see why it should be them) but that a deeper understanding of the roles and uses of math can enrich anyone’s life. One can be a believer in the power of mathematics without necessarily worshipping at its altar, and it’s this quest for adherents rather than acolytes that makes this popular math book successful. It helps that Ellenberg’s style is witty. It helps that he is passionate without sounding too evangelical. He weaves in enough history, anecdotes, and allusions to demonstrate that mathematicians’ journeys and the development of mathematics as a discipline has been just like everything else in life: alternately dramatic and dull, intense, occasionally acrimonious. We don’t like to admit it, but we mathematicians are people too. And occasionally we’re wrong, very wrong (like those nineteenth-century French eugenicists…). The title here is tongue-in-cheek, and How Not to Be Wrong can’t guarantee your future correctness with great certitude. All it can do is help you think more critically, more logically, but more creatively about the problems and questions that you’ll face in the future. Because mathematics is a tool for helping us to do amazing things. You can be a novice, or you can be a proficient user of this tool, but either way you’ll need to pick it up at some point to do a little handiwork. Don’t fear it: embrace it.Oh, and read this book.

4,1594205221,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10231663-ian,5,"This book was an excellent guide to the many ways in which our intuitions and poorly understood statistical training can lead us astray. One of the areas that it covers is regression to the mean, a concept which pretty much everyone needs to be aware of, since a better awareness of its ubiquity would prevent a lot of errors. Among other things, this concept explains why a successful pilot study is likely to give worse results when rolled out, why a good performance is often followed by a worse performance (and vice versa), why sequels are less successful and so on. The book also explains why a lot of medical research is effectively inconclusive despite statistically significant results and how p-values are generally misinterpreted, so we should take medical research with a large grain of salt. Some of the other areas the author discusses are counter-intuitive. One topical example is that if there are three or more options then unless one option has an absolute majority in its favour then ALL of the options will have a majority opposing them, which explains why politicians can never please everyone. For example, if the government offers three options for reducing the deficit: (a) increase taxes (b) cut health funding (c) cut welfare funding and equal numbers of people favor each option then 66% of people will be opposed to each option, so nothing the government does will please a majority. This book is full of gold for anyone who hasn't encountered some of these concepts before, such as the story of Abraham Wald's insight regarding how the missing bullet holes determined where bombers should be armoured during WWII or how the Laffer curve governs a lot of phenomena rather than linearity or how a zero correlation doesn't necessarily mean that there is no relationship between two variables ( correlation co-efficient does not detect non-linear relationships) or the story of why scientists took so long to be certain of a link between smoking and lung cancer (not because of obstruction by the tobacco companies).Although I am trained both as a mathematician and statistician, you don't need a strong mathematical background to understand and benefit from this book. Most examples require basic arithmetic and the author has a talent for producing crude but enlightening graphics that help to guide the reader's intuitions. In addition to this book, I would recommend pretty much any recent book by Gerd Gigerenzer, whose work shows how scarily ignorant doctors are of how to properly interpret results of medical tests and why mass screening programs do significant harm while not significantly reducing mortality."

It can be a dull and unimaginative concept that only deals with some of the already established formulas. It paved a way for people to live their life hassle-free. It brings the practicality and scientific conclusion on any topic whether it's about calculation for about judging a person. With probability and numbers, it makes us our life comfortable.The author has done a tremendous job to bring out the real-life benefits of Maths. "
6,1594205221,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1991093-maryanne,4,"Where language and math meet is where my head explodes.That's this book.Fortunately, the author has a funny, down-to-earth style that keeps me going even when my eyes glaze over and start to roll back into my head. That has nothing to do with him; it's all me. He and I have a fundamental difference in wiring: he loves numbers and the things they can do. For him they sing. For me, they are instruments of torment and deceit. Let me give you an example. Here's one from page 44 et seq., where he demonstrates that the sum of an infinite string of ones (1+1-1+1-1...) equals zero, except that it might also equal 1. Or maybe it's actually 1/2. You heard me, the sum of an infinite string of whole numbers is a fraction. And they say that numbers are immutable and true and solid, unlike MY stock in trade, words, with their shades of meaning and the ease with which they can be manipulated. HA!But you cannot frighten me away so easily, sir!This is a more challenging book than, say, Nate Silver's, because it gives you the method -- the math -- behind the theories. That should not scare you. It should dare you. Along the way, you'll be confused and befuddled, but you'll also laugh and be intrigued and remind yourself that the ways in which you think you know -- really KNOW -- the world are hopelessly flawed, and this guy can prove it. If nothing else, this book is endlessly valuable for that. "
7,1594205221,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16160897-warpdrive,4,"Enjoyable, entry-level book, particularly recommended to any lover of applied maths who did not get prior significant exposure to the main concepts of statistics and probability calculus.The author writes in a very engaging and conversational manner, and his enthusiasm for maths is quite contagious; I like how he manages to compellingly convey the message that math is a creative process, not a sterile, procedural slog.While the book is designed to be understood by a wide audience, so it is necessarily kept at a pretty popular level (which disappointed me a little bit, to be honest, as I was expecting something more meaty from a purely mathematical perspective), I must nevertheless admit that there are some subjects of the book that are brilliantly explained with lucid clarity: the author's treatment of the application of statistical techniques to number theory is nothing short of fascinating, for example; and his explanations of the basic concept of Bayesian inference, of projective geometry, and of the Buffon needle problem, are masterful. Chapters 18 (when he deals with the concept of axiomatic postulating, deduction and self-contradiction) is a real gem (where, by the way, his neo-Platonist view of mathematics comes to fore, view to which I full subscribe). The final chapter is also great, and it represents a passionate defence of mathematics and rationality as fundamental tools for a sceptical, commonsensical, balanced, realistic view of reality, as opposed to the false ideologically motivated ""certainties"" that permeate some circles (and at which the author pokes some great fun). "
8,1594205221,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,4,Makes a good case for the real world of advantages of having a mathematical understanding and how to work with math concepts. The author argues that math is a very strong version of common sense reasoning which can keep a person sharp and savvy in a complex world.
9,1594205221,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4070035-kartik-narayanan,4,"I am one of those fortunate individuals who cherishes and loves Mathematics, in all its forms. But, I know, a lot of people for whom the Maths is a dreaded specter.Why is that so? Inevitably, this is a problem that arises from the way the subject has been taught. And this is what the book tries to dispel. This book takes us behind the numbers, equations, theories and abstruse concepts to show the practical applications of whatever we have been taught. Along the way, the history of these various ideas are explained as are various anecdotes, which are informative and amusing.This book is written along similar lines to Metamagical Themas and GEB, while not at the same level. Think of this book as a stepping stone to the fore mentioned books.The book deals with concepts that we have been taught in our 11th/12th & Graduation. The author doesn’t really dumb down the concepts – this means that while they have been explained well, the reader really has to concentrate while reading the book.Another facet of this book which made me love it were the lovely quotes from history. A couple of examples are below.When talking about the romantic notion of how mathematicians are portrayed as genius, loner types, the author quotes Mark Twain – “It takes a thousand men to invent a telegraph, or a steam engine, or a phonograph, or a telephone or any other important thing—and the last man gets the credit and we forget the others.”When talking about the need to focus on practical applications, the author quotes Theodore Roosevelt –“It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.”The author, Jordan Ellenberg, is a mathematical prodigy. He has deftly weaved the concepts with good writing to bring out the inherent joy in maths.People interested in Big Data have to definitely read this book. For those who hated mathematics when growing up and now want to figure out what the fuss is all about and those who just want to enjoy a good read, this book is brilliant."
10,1594205221,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11951948-paul,2,"Almost everything that we do these days has some sort of mathematical element to it, from analysis by companies that are looking for patterns, voting, the stock market and ways of winning the lottery.Ellenberg does make some reasonable arguments; I particularly liked the explanations on the three way voting where the favoured guy can end up being eliminated purely because of the first past the post method, and the way that groups were able to exploit a badly designed lottery. And most of the time he does a reasonable job of getting his points across using mathematical explanations and details revealing the hidden maths of every day life. But the book suffers from a lack of direction at times it and it regularly jumps into very complex explanations, which some will find difficult. In this sort of book, you also need to stick to one subject at a time, and it sadly flits back and forth as you go through the book.There are other books out there that are much better at explaining the way that maths affects us."
11,1594205221,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28781546-ana,4,"Having come back to math in my late twenties, this book was comforting and gave me hope that learning the equations and complicated language would not be for nothing. It's also a lot of fun to read."
12,1594205221,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6603759-misericordia-the-serendipity-aegis,5,"Is math really twice removed from our lives? Nope.The very incredibly incredible math story from a math child prodigy (in his day), now a professor (a sensible one! a rara avis!). Fun and readable and readily comprehensible tale making math closer and WAY cooler!Q:“Mathematics is pretty much the same. You may not be aiming for a mathematically oriented career. That’s fine—most people aren’t. But you can still do math. You probably already are doing math, even if you don’t call it that. Math is woven into the way we reason. And math makes you better at things. Knowing mathematics is like wearing a pair of X-ray specs that reveal hidden structures underneath the messy and chaotic surface of the world. Math is a science of not being wrong about things, its techniques and habits hammered out by centuries of hard work and argument. With the tools of mathematics in hand, you can understand the world in a deeper, sounder, and more meaningful way. All you need is a coach, or even just a book, to teach you the rules and some basic tactics. I will be your coach. I will show you how.” (c)"
13,1594205221,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52763346-farhana,5,"This is a very practical, useful, and beautifully-written book on mathematics, particularly about mathematical thinking. I learnt about this book back in 2016 from the review of Bill Gates [https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/How-...]. Since then it had been sitting idly in my to-read list of 2017. However, I finally picked it up at the end of 17. But I wasn't paying enough ""attention""! I believed in its worth but I felt I wasn't being committed enough to the contents of this book! Cause to enjoy a book fully you need not only read it at the RIGHT time but also with RIGHT kind of approach! So, I restarted this book again and again (3times actually) and finally I completed it this time! And the book has finally worked its wonder! The introduction of the book phrases a very common question of ours: ""When will I use this math?"". I realized a part of this when I needed to use matrix multiplications and vectors for completing the beautiful graphics assignment of Ray Tracing! Or on other occasions, when I got messed up with some statistical tool for the purpose of my thesis. Since then I have believed that all these maths have their use somewhere out there and stopped questioning about their existence! Professor Ellenberg's book is not absolutely about practical implementations of maths! But it's more about the elegance and beauty of mathematical thinking and concepts that underlie many common events and observations of modern life. Ellenberg hardly uses any mathematical jargons or calculations. He explains the stuffs so naturally and qualitatively that the book is really a comfortable read! And obviously he never oversimplified or understated any concept! The book starts with the story of mathematician Abraham Wald & World War II when Wald was presented with the problem of how & where to optimally shield the fighting jets so that they could return unharmed - more or less! Wald's mathematical insight beyond the presented data was so simple to think of - yet elegant. Then follows the story of Laffer curve & tax-cuts during the period of President Ronald Reagan. Earlier this year I read nonfiction comics ""Economicx"" where President Reagan's tax-cut policy was heavily criticized. Now presented with the concept of laffer curve and the mathematical stand of economists who support tax-cuts - it was a different picture. In fact, laffer curve is a good example how mathematics either get used or abused in politics. As economist Hal Varian put it, ""You can explain it to a Congressman in six minutes and he can talk about it for six months."" Or as Ellenberg puts it,""It could be the case that lowering taxes will increase government revenue;I want it to be the case that lowering taxes will increase government revenue;Therefore, it is the case that lowering taxes will increase government revenue.""Then Ellenberg plays with the concept of law of large numbers, probability, statistical significance tests, and their real life implications. Then and there comes one of the most interesting parts of the book: Expectation and the story of Cash Winfall. How some lottery cartels (some MIT kids & other math enthusaists) exploited the loophole in the game to win major prizes at the expense of other players. And learning about how the concept of expectation works like a magical tool in lottery mathematics was really amazing! The most mindblowing part was how the concept of projective gemotery from graphics aligns with the concept of picking ""right"" combinations of ticekts to maximize expected return by minimizing risk factors! This was really a new thing to learn - geometry, combination & probaility - how these seemingly different concepts go together! Then there was again the geometry of error-correcting codes like hamming codes from theory of digital signal processing! And this thing always amazes me - how concepts from one field is redefined to solve problems in a seemingly different field! And in the last part the story of Galton, the father of Eugenetics & Darwin's cousin appears again. How he used the concept of correlations and their elliptical nature to introduce the concept of modern fingerprinting (from the idea of principal component analysis) used in criminal investiagtions. And last of all, follows the fallacies and contradictions associated with ""public opinion"" or polls.Overall, this book is an amazing package for both popular and ardent math-lovers or at least for math-enthusiasts! His narratives are so informal, delightful, yet serious! This obviously reflects the command of the author in his field!"
14,1594205221,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3498889-cheryl,2,"(Done - those of you who have already liked this may want to reread now!)I like math. I want to be reminded of how cool it can be, and how relevant. But all the books like this, including this, that I've attempted to read have too much explication of the maths and not enough of what it actually means. For example, a chapter will start by explaining that c + a = a +c and just a paragraph later will expect us to know what a quadratic equation is, what it means, and how to solve it. What I'm saying is, these books need to be vetted by regular ppl... like Ellenberg's reluctant students, perhaps?I'm gonna read it all, even if by 'read' I mean 'skim' for significant portions, because there are interesting tidbits. But gosh. So far so disappointing. -----Ok done. So, the thing is, by 'skimmed' I mean 'read.' And by 'read' I mean 'studied.' And by done, I mean analyzed enough to record all the book-darts you can see below. Oy.What does that footnote about the 'real divide' between statistics and mathematics mean? I always assumed that statistics were a kind of maths, like logic and probability and topology... are those mathematics or am I just so wrong that I need to go back to Jr. High instead of reading books like this?And besides, the title is wrong not only because it misleads about the content, but because the idiom only makes logical sense if it's stated as How to Not Be Wrong. (My son, who is at uni. to be a math teacher at the high school or college level, agrees to the point where it's been not easy to ask him to help me get through the sticky points of this book.)Some bookdarts, mostly from footnotes:InvestigateF.H. King, the inventor, one hundred years ago, of the cylindrical silo.Investigate Winning Ways for Your Mathematical Plays.Investigate Martin Gardner's ""The Laffer Curve"" from The Night Is Large.My son did explain the difference between standard deviation and normal distribution to me, but I need to Investigate for reinforcement->mastery.Investigate Charles Minard's chart of Napoleon's retreat from Russia and Florence Nightingale's 'coxcomb graph' that revealed the high rate of fatal infections re' the Crimean War for early examples of Data Visualization.Investigate Musipedia.org - is it easy enough for me to use? Not likely, but maybe my son could.Investigate Tom Lehrer's ""Lobachevsky.""Two points about the necessity of replication: ""The significance test is the detective, not the judge"" which means that if you get a Significant Result, it means more research is needed, and yet if ""your study measures a four-year-old's ability to delay gratification and then relates these measurements with life outcomes thirty years later, you can't just pop out a replication.""ManyLabs, addressing the problem of insufficiently performed and/or published replication trials, did find, in Nov. 2013, that of the first 13 studies addressed, 10 were successfully replicated. I need to see if I can find out which 3 were *not* happy-making!One thing Ellenberg explained to me that I'd never mastered before: You know how it is that many school classrooms have two kids with the same birthday, even though it's a couple of dozen kids and 365 possible days? Well, the thing is, the relevant number of *pairs* of kids is what matters... when there are 30 people, the possible number of pairs is 435, and each pair has a 1 in 365 likelihood of a match, which is 70% odds.A concept I did find satisfying to read about here was about ""The Triumph of Mediocrity,"" aka 'regression to the mean.' To simplify, any time chance or luck has any influence, over time or over subjects, given time or more subjects, less extreme outcomes will occur. A ballplayer who has a strong season has everything going for him, and he's not going to get stronger and stronger over more seasons because luck is involved. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Larger sample sizes and longer trials will give more valuable data.I really didn't like how the book got more and more about politics and sociology as it went along. For just one example, Ellenberg presents & uses a chart labelled ""Average income within state."" Any of us who have survived middle school know that 'averages' are pretty darn meaningless. And income? Compared to what? Cost of living? Lifestyle including percent urban and number of children/family compared to number of retirees? What? An immediate search with google gives an obviously better data set: https://www.infoplease.com/business-f...... an academic search of any effort would surely give something much more interesting.Speaking of averages, my son, as a youngster, learned about ""box and whiskers"" aka ""box plot."" I wish I had. And I wish it was used more often in the media and popular culture as it seems interesting, easy, useful, unambiguous, and helpful. (But I do need to Investigate for mastery & confidence.)-----------The thing is, even though the final chapter is titled 'how to be right,' Ellenberg never really gives anything. He's stuck at what he told his editor he wanted to do, which is ""... yell at people, at length, how great math is."" A better thing to tell reluctant students is, imo, what Charles Darwin wrote. From Darwin's memoirs:  ""I attempted mathematics, and even went during the summer of 1828 with a private tutor (a very dull man) to Barmouth, but I got on very slowly. The work was repugnant to me, chiefly from my not being able to see any meaning in the early steps in algebra. This impatience was very foolish, and in after years I have deeply regretted that I did not proceed far enough at least to understand something of the great leading principles of mathematics, for men thus endowed seem to have an extra sense.""----------Ok, I admit it. Lots of bookdarts means lots of things to think about. I guess I won't discourage you from reading this. Just, don't try to understand every technicality or divergence, take your time with the bits you do find interesting, and don't have the high expectations that I did."

Brilliant and funny as well as interesting, all mixed in with a touch of that feeling that you are actually learning something and furthering your pursuit of knowledge. 5 stars, great book recommendations throughout as well as a good aid for mathematical concept guidance.

16,1594205221,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5148911-devika,5,"The most amazingly insightful yet simply written book on the importance of math in daily life, simply because math is present even in the most unassuming of places! There are many things that I absolutely loved about the book. First, the discussion on how a Jewish mathematician Abraham Wald helped refine the strategy of placing armour on WW2 Planes with his counterintuitive yet eureka-esque approach. Second, analyses differ because of the way the math is involved i.e. linear vs. curve graph approaches to the same problem yield completely different conclusions (e.g. application of Laffer Curve on learning how to be more like Sweden). Third, and most intriguingly, Pythagoreans believed that beans were the entrapment of dark souls. Fourth, Law of Large Numbers works by diluting outcomes and not balancing/cancelling them out. Another highlight was the Baltimore Stock Broker problem i.e. how people are duped into believing a complete stranger's advice regarding stock investment purely because they end up being the victims of receiving the certain portfolios that have his most accurate predictions. Yet, all along, this Baltimore Stock Broker is just hedging his predictions across stocks by sending different people a different set of predictions. Thus, he's bound to be right for some people at the very least! I've always been a Math geek, but I don't think I truly appreciated the nuances of the subject till now. Even better is how Ellenberg discusses that genius is not the product of an individual's labour but a communal enterprise. The work of different mathematicians spanning generations helps someone build on to the ideas and offer that stroke of insight/genius. Unfortunately, it's the last guy that gets the credit even though he built off of the ideas of others. People always ask - ""when am I going to use this?"" The real and harder question is - ""when am I not going to use this?""There's something in this book for everyone because it offers great perspective on mathematical reasoning in daily life. "
17,1594205221,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28727983-e,3,"The press for this book seems a little overblown. It is decidedly not the ""freakonomics of mathematics."" Rather than hitting a plethora of topics, like Innumeracy and other popular books have done, Ellenberg homes in on just a few: linearity (consider: most trend lines are Laffer curves, not straight lines); inference (consider: an FBI algorithm determines that you are probably a terrorist; what are the odds that you are a terrorist? very very low; false positives almost always vastly outnumber true positives when rare events are in view; take heart next time your doctor tells you that you tested positive for cancer); expectation (takeaway: if you never miss a flight, you spend way too much time in the airport; great discussion of ""expected value""); regression; and existence (or, why Bush won Florida in 2000--because when you have more than one candidate, the majority rarely rules, even when it agrees most with itself--go figure that one out).Biggest takeaways: 1) the Parsons code. Look it up on wikipedia. You can identify nearly every song on earth merely by notating how the notes change in pitch, either up, down, or stationary. Cruise on over to musipedia and check it out.2) correlation is not transitive. Just because A is correlated to B, and B to C, it does NOT follow necessarily that A is correlated to C. I really should have known this, and common sense dictates it, but I'm not sure I'd ever thought of it that way before. For instance, taking niacin is correlated to higher HDL levels; higher HDL levels are correlated with fewer heart attacks. So should taking niacin lower your risk of heart attack? No; it does not. Correlation is not transitive. "
18,1594205221,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,4,"In the preface to Jordan Ellenberg's chunky maths book (441 pages before the notes in the version I read) we are introduced to a hypothetical student moaning about having to work through a series of definite integrals and complaining 'When am I going to use this?' What Ellenberg sets out do is to show how we use mathematics all the time - and how important it is to understand it if we are not to get the wrong idea about the world. We'll see how well he does.It was very interesting to read this book quite soon after Richard Nisbett's Mindware. Both cover how to interact with life better thanks to the support of mathematics. Nisbett drives from the psychology side and improving decision making, while this book drives from the maths. Perhaps surprisingly, How Not to be Wrong is the easier read of the two. Ellenberg has a delightful light touch and is often genuinely funny (it's important to read the footnotes, which Ellenberg, like Terry Pratchett, uses for a lot of his jokes).Along the way he shows us the uses and risks of straight lines in forecasting and understanding data, the power (and danger) of using methods of inference, how to use expected value, the realities of regression to the mean and the interplay between correlation and causality, and some fascinating observations on why traditional statistics can be very misleading when it comes to public opinion. Here it is often not applied to either/or situations, and it's quite possible, for instance, for the public to both support the idea of cutting taxes while simultaneously supporting raising expenditure. Although there are a few cases where we lose the plot and the connection to the real world, mostly this all driven by real world examples - from lotteries where an appropriate strategy can result in big wins to the apparent prediction that everyone in America would be obese before the end of the century.While I don't think is this as practical a book as Nisbett's, it is full of fascination for anyone who likes a bit of applied mathematics, but can't be bothered with the formulae - there is very little that is scary in that line here. What's more, if you have any exposure to scientists, this book contains by far the best explanation of p-values, what they really mean and where they are meaningless that I've ever seen. So would the student from the preface feel after reading this book that there's no need to complain? Satisfyingly for a book that doesn't limit us to predictable mathematical answers, the response is both yes and no. Yes, because it becomes very clear that maths is hugely useful in understanding the world and responding to it. No, because the vast majority of maths you will have suffered at school and may have suffered at university, isn't required here. At least 90 per cent of the content depends on probability and statistics, topics that are rarely covered well enough in the curriculum, given how important they are in getting a grip on reality.Although it felt a bit too long and used US sports rather too often as examples for my liking, this is a book for anyone with an interest in the way that mathematics can give us a better understanding of what's really happening in our complex world."
19,1594205221,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45725089-kylie-burkot,3,"I'm definitely someone very interested in math -- I have a BA in math and I'm pursuing a Master's in Analytics. However, this book got a bit too abstract even for me. I was hoping for more examples of applied mathematics, and while this book definitely had that, there were often theoretical/abstract/historical asides that seemed distracting. I also think there was too much information about mathematicians that wasn't needed; it just detracted from the examples and things got muddled. I would have loved to hear about female mathematicians as well; I understand that they are in the minority, especially in the past. But women mathematicians have contributed a lot to our understanding of math today and I didn't get to hear about any of them.However, I did appreciate Ellenberg's passion for math, especially when applied in everyday contexts. We all use math everyday, even if we don't realize it. He also did a fantastic job of breaking down frequently misunderstood concepts (statistical significance in research, probability and chance, expectation, regression, etc)"

Those who are good at math, and those who aren't.""?Both of those apply to me. Anyone who knows me knows that I hate math, that my mind draws blanks when it comes to anything relating to it. So why did I read this book? It was a book club selection that I wouldn't have picked up otherwise. I respect what Eilenberg is trying to do, which is to make math more accessible. He succeeds to some extent. But he's also trying to appease hard-core mathematicians and math nerds. He can't do both. I wish he had written two books: One for people like me, and one for people like him. I liked his humor and found some stories interesting (the Torah, the plane, and lottery), but I had to skim much of the book because there were figures. As in, actual mathematical equations. I felt like I was in school and reading this became too much of a chore."

Was half expecting a strictly self-help style book prescribing different mathematical models for practical use. Ellenberg does that, but not without giving you the deep dive of the math world as it stands today, outlining its history, and presenting its heroes. He makes the elegant case of how deeply present math is in our everyday lives, and how important it is to do math well. Wish I had read this before taking any math class. "
23,1594205221,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15541333-andrey-s,1,"While math parts of this book were OK and sometimes even pretty good it has many issues.We spend too much time on that lottery example and mostly on parts that are not related to math (why didn't state stopped lottery? If it has nothing to do with differential equations or something like that why would we care?)But the most noticeable problem is the one that you can find in many bad popular science books written in the US. Basically it goes like this ""Some math stuff or physics or whatever and then Hey! Democrats are great and Republicans are poopyheads"". Did you know that Republican senator from whatever state made a dumb decision? Did you know that some stupid republican told that Obama was wrong, but Obama was right (because he is cool)? And most importantly Al Gore should have won in Florida, yes, you will read about that at least three times in each chapter. I'm afraid to think what would have happened if this book has been written after Trump won the elections.And if you are not an American (like me) and you don't care about this stuff, don't worry. North Korea is terrible too (maybe Kim Jong Un is a Republican?). And while we don't go to USSR in this book, which is great, there is mention about Stalin killing 50 billion people, because he is evil of course (I would suggest to author to shit on the history of his own county in the future, being good at math doesn't make you an expert on history, or political science for that matter).And not only when you read these examples you have a feeling that someone trying to shove their political views down your throat, but these also are not very good examples.Let's take one about Syria. There is a guy, authors buddy from university, who was selling T-shirts and he had piles of these T-shirts in his room and he decides to wear them because he is lazy and doesn't want to bother himself with laundry. Everyone thinks that he is the dirtiest guy around because he wears the same T-shirt every day, but actually, he is the cleanest because it is a new T-shirt each day. Сonclusion is that you shouldn't make assumptions if you don't know all the possibilities. Makes sense.So, there were elections in Siria and Bashar Assad won (and Assad is a dictator, evil guy, probably killed many billions of people, maybe he is even a Republican). And voting numbers looked weird, not random enough for the author's taste. Then we are told that while this is not hard evidence it looks like elections were rigged. But isn't it the same situation as few chapters before? There could be other reasons why numbers look that way, but because of the author's political stance, he tells us that Bashar Assad wears dirty T-shirts every day. He could have taken any other elections that were proven to be rigged and show us numbers, but no, this books is about how bad Assad is, math is just for the background.Authors political views have more effect on him than math. This book is not about mathematical thinking, this book is about a political position. And that was not what annotation said it would be. It has some math and that math parts are good, but there are many books that are much better. ""Thinking, Fast and Slow"" for example covers most of this stuff (but with less math in it, unfortunately), ""Algorithms to Live By"" was good too. Read those and skip this one.I've noticed that if a book about science mentions Stalin it would be a bad one, like in this case. Stalin is not an astronomical object, you can't produce Stalin in a particle accelerator, you can't find him in your DNA (if you are not related), that is why you will not find mention of him in books by Neil deGrasse Tyson or Stephen Hawking, in ""Smashing Physics"" or ""The Selfish Gene"", because these are good books about science and Stalin is a historical and political figure and his place is in books about history and politics. So if you open a popular science book and the author tries to convince you that Stalin is evil or that Al ""He actually won In Florida"" Gore has actually won in freking Florida then that book is most probably a crappy one."
24,1594205221,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20465079-tam,4,"It's pretty awesome trying to cram more books as the year is about to end and come across some excellent books like this one. I sincerely wish I had read it/the book had been born earlier. Most of what Ellenberg discussed I have already familiarized myself with, unfortunately, and yet his writing is still so charming that I do not want to put the book down. He stays true to his words, writing simple yet ""profound"" ideas and their applications, not an easy task as I have so often observed books starting out friendly but slowly slipping to the realm of abstractness, not indigestible, but not exactly fun to general audience to follow. Ellenberg shows that mathematicians can stay very abreast with real life, a thing I definitely should learn from. His philosophical ideas about the field, its people and its work ethics, are also valuable."
25,1594205221,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15046955-clara-biesel,5,"This book is just wonderful; funny, insightful, incredibly smart. Jordan Ellenberg lays out the ways people attempt to use math to make things seem simpler than they are, and shows many instances where math is much simpler than you might think. Even the chapter titles are engaging and memorable, like ""what to expect when you're expecting to win the lottery"" or ""Are you there, God? It's me, Bayesian inference."" If you're not certain if it's the sort of thing you'd like, try reading his article for Slate magazine on the mathematical reason on ""why handsome men are such jerks."""

27,1594205221,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5046424-arun,5,"This book is written by someone who knows his Math (being an IMO two time gold medalist (with perfect score) and two times Putnam fellow at Harvard. So one can be rest assured that he wouldn't deceive his reader when it comes to mathematical contents of the book. The gist of the book: It explains how math can be incorporated into the day-to-day activities of common man in a conscious way so that even in the midst of uncertainty one can at least have a principled approach to face it head-on. There are few things I learnt from this book:1. Not all curves are straight lines (beware of the Laffer curve) - This cautions us from extrapolating a relation between two variables (these can be anything) as linear without really understanding the phenomena that you are modeling. For e.g, when you plot a path of a rocket only with very few data points (say until its maxima) then using linear regression one could extrapolate that the rocket is forever going to go up! But there is such a thing called gravity which will make it come back.2. Most math-based innovation in other fields have only few set of mathematical objects and its properties at its core. For e.g. Shannon/Hamming's scheme for finding a balance between adding enough redundancy without sacrificing too much space in transmitting codes are equivalent to Fano plane (the finite geometry with smallest possible set of points (7) and lines (7) that obeys Euclid's axioms - these 7 lines in the Fano plane match to the 7 code words of Hamming code!).3. p-values and null hypothesis - p-value is a guidance (handed down by venerable R.A Fischer and whose usage has been apparently corrupted by later generation statisticians) and not an absolute truth so wield it with care and attention. Also consider using Confidence Intervals to quantify the range where the true value might lie. More than anything, beware of jumping to conclusions about your experiments too soon just because it agrees with what you ""want"" it to be.4. Statistics and Probability is a very important tool of thought. Now with all the craze about Machine Learning, it is even more imperative to learn this subject well so we can discern the right from wrong.Overall, the book is a light read (it does have its share of math but they are woven expertly within the story they are part of) with lots of great references in the bibliography section but after finishing the book it still felt like I bit off more than I could chew.But the Beckett quote at the very end of the book, gives me hope""Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better"""
28,1594205221,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10303390-cindy,5,"I've wanted to just casually read books about mathematics since the first time I watched Good Will Hunting. I realize now that the movie is a little naively pretentious, but it's inspirational, at least in the first half. So here we are, I was inspired to pretentiously read a book about mathematics, and I ended up loving it! It focused heavily on statistics, but it also included various other topics. My favorite part was about prime numbers, which I naturally read out loud to my friends and family. They did not share my delight. Absolutely nobody around me cares about prime numbers. Nobody cares. It's hurtful. But I really think everyone should at least read some chapters from this book, especially the section on how dead fish can correctly assess emotions shown in photos (they can't, and that's the point, the study passed the significance test anyway). The author, Jordan Ellenberg, has a math PhD from Harvard, but what impressed me the most was his writing style. It was lively, funny...sexy? And then I found out he has an MFA in creative writing. Who can even compete? But just when I started getting discouraged, he slipped this passage in there:""What you learn after a long time in math—and I think the lesson applies much more broadly—is that there’s always somebody ahead of you, whether they’re right there in class with you or not. People just starting out look to people with good theorems, people with some good theorems look to people with lots of good theorems, people with lots of good theorems look to people with Fields Medals, people with Fields Medals look to the “inner circle” medalists, and those people can always look toward the dead. Nobody ever looks in the mirror and says, “Let’s face it, I’m smarter than Gauss.” And yet, in the last hundred years, the joined effort of all these dummies-compared-to-Gauss has produced the greatest flowering of mathematical knowledge the world has ever seen. Mathematics, mostly, is a communal enterprise, each advance the product of a huge network of minds working toward a common purpose, even if we accord special honor to the person who places the last stone in the arch."""
29,1594205221,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4504283-eva-thieme,5,"My son, who is planning to major in math, gave me this book to read. Needless to say, I didn’t quite breeze through it as quickly as he did, but nevertheless greatly enjoyed it, even though I didn’t totally understand every last detail. The reason it was so enjoyable: First, the subject matter. As promised, the book shows us how math touches everything we do, with a ton of real-world examples where one might not even suspect math played a role. We get to look at such varied topics as where on a fighter plane to put armor, the infamous Laffer curve and its various applications (such as charting “Swedishness” versus “Libertopia”), what stockbrokers have in common with the Bible, the tricky give and take between causation and correlation, the lottery and how to game it, the problem with voting systems, and even Florentine artists and the theory of modern perspective. There is nothing abstract about this book.“Mathematics is the extension of common sense by other means,” Ellenberg says somewhere early on, and then proceeds to guide us from what even we, the average reader, can understand with our common sense to pretty complex stuff that we never dreamed we’d one day gobble up as excitedly – well, almost - as the next installment of Fifty Shades of Gray.Secondly, we don’t just learn about math, we learn about the history of math, who discovered what, not necessarily in any chronological order, and we learn about people we – or, at least I – haven’ necessarily heard about, like an obscure Frenchman who wanted to figure out the odds of a simple coin toss game and defined the rules of probability in the process. Every once in a while Ellenberg stops to dispense some nuggets of his own philosophy that make you want to rip out the page and post it over your desk, they are so well-said. Like this one: “Math gives us a way of being unsure in a principled way: not just throwing up our hands and saying ‘huh,’ but rather making a firm assertion: “I’m not sure, this is why I’m not sure, and this is roughly how not-sure I am.”Thirdly, Ellenberg is not only a brilliant mathematician but also a brilliant writer. What are the chances to get such a combination (which I’m sure an expected value could be arrived at mathematically)? He has such a wonderful way with words that not only do you find yourself understanding and even caring for more complex mathematical scenarios than you most likely bargained for, you also find yourself greatly entertained in the process. Especially his prolific footnotes (and hand-drawn sketches) had me laughing out loud in many instances. He reminds me of Bill Bryson in that way – another writer who combines science and history in a hugely entertaining way. Here are but a few examples: “I once had an uneasy moment with a colleague in an airport when he made the remark, unexceptional in a mathematical context, that it might be necessary to blow up the plane at one point.” (About mathematical terminology.) “And you can’t deny that there are aspects of the natural world – I’m thinking pandas here – that seem more likely to have resulted from grudging bureaucratic compromise than from the mind of an all-knowing deity with total creative control.” (On the calculation of the likelihood of there being a God.)“Now imagine you’re Filippo Brunelleschi standing out on the flat prairie, the canvas on an easel in front of you, painting the train tracks – anachronistic, okay, but just go with it.” (On how parallel lines are not parallel in plane geometry.)""Sometimes scientists discover the theory and leave it to mathematicians to figure out why it's elegant, and other times mathematicians develop an elegant theory and leave it to scientists to figure out what it's good for. One thing the projective plane [for drawing in perspective] is good for is representational painting. Another is picking lottery numbers."" (On mathematical elegance and its practical utility.)“So our recommendation has an expected value of seven hundred lives saved per year. Over the loud and well-financed complaints of the Eggplant Council, and despite our very real uncertainty, we go public.” (on calculating probability and expected value to make difficult-to-gauge public health recommendations, in this case eating less eggplant if it is suspected to cause heart failure in a percentage of people.)“After two thousand years of scrubbing, the stain was still there.” (On Euclid’s fifth axiom, likening it to a stain in the corner of the floor that one wants to scrub to make the surface nice and clean.)What makes this book such a good read is Ellenberg’s passion for his subject. “The sensation of mathematical understanding – of suddenly knowing what’s going on, with total certainty, all the way to the bottom – is a special thing, attainable in few if any other places in life. You feel you’ve reached into the universe’s guts and put your hand on the wire. It’s hard to describe to people who haven’t experienced it.” I don’t know about you, but that right there, the image of the universe’s guts and me reaching right in there – is enough to make me want to start over and study mathematics as well."

It shows how probability theory and statistics can be used to think clearly and see events in a way that is more accurate and in conjunction with their inherent uncertainty. The book also discusses the inner workings of mathematics as to how different theories are built and how we know their veracity. Although I have always been inclined towards mathematics, this book bettered my intuition, and gave me a few new ones, with regards to the many topics discussed in the book. I give it 5 stars."

All bumpy, rocky, and several fancy terminologies that made me exhausted. I chose to put it down after reading half of it. The education system where I came from never taught me how to THINK mathematically. We were taught to just ACCEPT it, in whatever form it has. I remember how I had questioned the applications of several maths techniques but never received any proper explanation. I quit asking. I let my curiosity wither. This book, because of that, was rather ""bizarre"" at first to me. What, we really have a ""mathematical"" way of thinking, in the sense that we can flexibly train ourselves to adapt to and see the world through? Wasn't the ""maths gene"" set in stone? This concept is too new for me. Putting this book down, I chose to focus on building a more concrete foundation, keeping this newly discovered thought in mind. In this one year, I had taken several classes in statistics, maths, economics, constantly juggling between Stack Exchange, Khan Academy, Quora, and read several other books on related topics. And one day, something dawned on me. I FINALLY understand some examples from the book. I FINALLY understand its logic. I FINALLY can see the interconnectedness between topics. I was amazed.When I come back to this book just now, it presented me with so much joy, exuberance, and beautiful insights. People may think this is a layman book, yet it took me around one year to be able to fully appreciate the delicacy of it. And I recommend people to do the same. Only read this book when you are open to the thought that you can also train yourself to think in a mathematical way. Because I could do it, so you can too."

I especially enjoyed some of the seemingly-irrelevant digressions that Ellenberg makes about math history.It's unfortunate that we can't pass a law requiring everyone to read a book like this and demonstrate that they have a basic understanding of probability and randomness and number in general. It's one thing when general public is fooled by careless use of numbers in the media, but it's a much bigger travesty when ""experts"" seem not to be able to distinguish the signal from the noise. It's quite depressing to know that it's almost certain that a large portion of the research papers in medicine, economics, and social sciences are invalid. Next time that you see a catchy headline about some research in psychology or nutrition, etc. be aware that there is a very good chance that the presented claim is false. If the claim is made by a politician about how good/bad economy/job data/crime rates, etc. are, you can safely assume it's wrong and misleading. "

I even got to type some stuff into google for my own edification: slime mold decision making, Peano axioms, Ramanujan, Hilbert's problems – plus basic concepts of stats that are important to understand – and even mentions of Beckett and DFW – my kind of author, to say the least. Not the best title, but good content."
36,1594205221,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2950483-jeff-stockett,4,"This book won't appeal to everyone. I just had to get that out of the way. I really enjoyed it, but not everyone will.Do you like math? Do you want to see math applied to random every day things? Then you are the audience for this book.  I really enjoyed geeking out about the underlying math in all sorts of things. You can use math to decide when to buy a lottery ticket. (The answer is almost always never. But there are exceptions.) You can use math to see how hot a basketball player is. You can even use math to decide how early you should go to the airport. It's like freakonomics for math. It's a lot of fun."
37,1594205221,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6169985-shaun,4,"My attempts to reconnect with mathematical concepts I had forgotten (or honestly never knew in the first place) led me to this clever book. How Not to Be Wrong is an accurate title. It doesn't assume you're never going to be wrong, but there are certain ways not to be. It centers mostly around the concept of non-linear thinking and how methodology can determine our impression of statistics. Though I'll need extra time to comprehend some points, Ellenberg's writing is very inviting and even when I didn't understand something, I never felt overwhelmed or talked down to. This is a smart, fun read."
38,1594205221,http://goodreads.com/user/show/803323-nancy,5,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It is not one to race through. It is more fun to read in bits and pieces. Jordan Ellenberg manages to bring insights from David Foster to Voltaire as he covers sports, art, gambling, religion, history, finance, probability, statistics and happiness in ways I'd never considered before. Don't miss the connection between choices made by slime mold and non-intuitive outcomes of various voting systems. "
39,1594205221,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69594272-jose-samper,5,"This book is so good that I am going to use to teach a class for freshman who don't intend to take more math courses (of course, i'll add some spice to it). Ellenberg found several fun ways to explain many far reaching concepts of mathematics in a way that is not technical and meaningful. In my opinion, non mathematicians should be able to enjoy math the same way a non-musician enjoys a song. This book helps to build toward that goal. "
40,1594205221,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21537404-paul-conroy,4,"Generally a fun and interesting book, written in an accessible style, suitable for the average reader. He discusses statistics and probability making use of lotteries and elections as examples, and discusses classic conundrums and their solutions. I would have given the book 5-stars except that he had the annoying habit of making sanctimonious political commentary here and there, which was both annoying and distracting."

43,1594205221,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45590874-molly-moody,3,Over my head due to my cognitive decline. Plus my lack of mathematical genius. Very bummed bc I really wanted to learn how not to be wrong in a family where everyone is always right. Oh well.
44,1594205221,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24460839-muriel,5,"The author is having a lot fun with mathematics and words! The book is full of little things like:•	(In a discussion about log, to clarify he meant ‘natural log’) You would use natural log if you are a mathematician, or if you have e fingers. •	(After a discussion on Pythagorean theory) Pythagorean thoughts are part mathematics, part philosophy, part mental illness. You need to read the details on the three parts and decide which is which.•	(Why don’t popular mass market mathematics book give equations or details about the proof?) It’s like you give pre-teens a book on reproductive health and where babies come from, the book tends to wax lyrics about birds & bees, and leave out the hydraulic stuff of how babies are actually made … Similarly, if a mass-market math book included equations, it would ‘shock your modesty’. – Almost fell off my chair upon hearing his analogy between math equations and modesty, unapologetic fun. Could not get enough of this math fun after the first reading, and immediately jumped back to complete a second read before I could write this review :)---------------------He discusses one math topic at a time, but there are some general themes revisited throughout the book. Below are long details about these general themes (towards the end is a list of topics by mathematicians):He shared lots of ideas about math education – current math instruction could be off-putting, if we just try to drill quadratic formula into students without the intuition, or gives an assignment of 30 definite integral without explaining how this stuff would ever be used. On the other hand, he is not a radical ‘reformist’ who wants to exclusively use calculator, and abolish any practice on hand calculation. He’d say you can’t write a sonnet if you have to reach into a dictionary for the spelling of every word. Practicing math question is like building strength and skills via weightlifting or running zigzag preparing for soccer. Weightlifting and running zigzag do not seem as fun as actually playing the soccer, but you can’t go far without these practices. (I like all his analogies above.)He critically points out the ‘cult of genius’ problem – students are turned off whenever they saw someone else advancing ahead of them and thinking themselves are not talented enough – math students look up to better math students, who look up to the IMO winning ones, who look up to mathematicians with a few good theorems, who look up to mathematicians with a lot of good theorems, who look up to Field medalists, who look up to the dead. No one looks into the mirror and say let’s face it I’m a better Mathematician than Gauss?! ( Could not get enough of his math fun :) . People think praising someone ‘hard working’ is because you can’t honestly praise them to be ‘smart’. Unfortunate result: people would fall off the math track because ‘I’m not talented in math’. He corrects ‘Genius is to make things happen’. He laughs – people don’t get turn off and stop studying English just because someone did AP English better. With all this rethinking about 'math losing students to medicine' sprinkled throughout, he acknowledges a worse problem, is that other fields do not have enough math-literate students. The world would be better if we get math-literate politicians, social policies, doctors, everyday citizen, etc. The book is full of his math-loving confession. He debunks the popular myth ‘math melodrama’ in which a fiction writer could easily explain a plot by hand-waving ‘math drove the person crazy’. Also add, to the contrary, math calms down his nerve -- like meditation, math puts him in direct contact with the universe, “it’s here before you, and it would be here after you”. (Isn’t his passion for math touching!)He talked about the other popular myths that math progressed with a few lone geniuses that had no contact with other people at all (he blamed movies like A Beautiful Mind for such misinformation). To the contrary, math progressed with collaborative effort with individuals weaving together efforts to tackle problems. He talked about Theodore Roosevelt’s praising of the person who gets his hands dirty and belittling of the critic who only sits in the library – and rebut that mathematicians in the library contributed far more to the world than acknowledged in Roosevelt’s populist speech. He’d say Abraham Wald, who figured out the way to armor the planes in world war two, never did a practical work, contributed critically to the war effort, a critic that counts. I like his four quadrants for math, simple/complex vs. shallow/impactful. •	Simple & shallow are 1+1=2, it’s so intuitive that we barely talk about this. •	Complex & shallow are hand calculation of 12-digit numbers multiplying each other, it’s tedious and time-consuming, but it won’t shed much light on things even if we put effort into such exercises. •	Complex & impactful are ideas like Fermat theorem, which deserve books of their own.•	Simple & impactful are ideas introduced in his book, likeo	Really old ideas on how to proximate the pi (and he holds it’s meaningless to rote memorizing pi to the hundreds of digits since such memory does not shed light on any math ideas). o	The law of large numbers (vs. the wrong approach of average numbers) – the individual plays do not ‘correct themselves’ or ‘even out’, but they dilute significance of any deviations in small samples. o	The battle on Statistical significance test (should be called statistical detectible instead of significant – and a tangent that math names are frequently existing words preloaded with other meanings – words with baggage) ------------------------------------------He threw in opinionated commentary about other disciplines: •	Social science as haruspicy (entrails reading). •	(After introducing 'regression to the mean' problems affecting social science, medicine, etc) He’d say but mathematicians won’t be fooled by this. •	File drawer problem (or stock broker problem) of the replication crisis. His line – scientists are not malicious villains like a stock broker trying to swine money away from unsuspecting victims, but they are fooling themselves into thinking they have found an effect. •	He loves to discuss voting, from Condorcet’s research, to modern day rank ordered voting in Vermont, to Bush-v-Gore 2000, to Nate Silver’s voting models, back to Condorcet’s personal life, belief in progress and rational thoughts, and end of life after French revolution. He needs to update this book after 2016! •	His likens the formal letter-reading in Justice Scalia, is like Cantor’s formalization of mathematics…•	He talked Voltaire, as member of a group buying French government issued bond-lottery (with a mathematician worked out the odds in their favor of course), got very rich from the positive expected value bond-lottery for the rest of his life. Then he said, you thought Voltaire got rich from writing sketches and essays? ‘Then, as in now, that’s not the way to get rich.’ -------------------------------------- Reading this book is like reading these … why I like audiobooks This book discusses impactful ideas and explaining things clearly like “Thinking, Fast and Slow”, is funny like Steven Colbert. It makes mathematics accessible to mass market reader. Its popularization of a quantitative field does not rely on generating anecdotes about himself (not the Feynman type), is an equal-opportunity attempts to shine lights on many different mathematicians, like the Freakonomics franchise or Sophie’s World (except the author actively conducts frontier research on the subject, and doesn't have a fictional shell).I listened to the audiobook, and his fun voice reading was full of passion for math, clearly beat the Freakonomics series – yes, no one expects Econ guys to be top-notch voice-acting, but Ellenberg also beats Dubner who makes podcast for a living. The other advantage of audiobook – you get to hear his pronunciation of mathematicians’ names (Morgenstein anyone?) … He also throws in German/French sentences from mathematicians (with full emotions), fun!--------------------------------Lastly, Mathematician enjoy talking about mathematicians! I still remember that math professor talks about G.H. Hardy and Srinivasan Ramanujan, with eyes gleaming for the discover and loss of math talent. Ellenberg in this book talks about mathematicians, of course G.H. Hardy and Srinivasan Ramanujan, and many more! •	Abraham Wald (airplane stories, his strong preference for theoretical work, and stubborn refusal to work on applied projects), •	Hotelling (sharp observation on regression to the mean, a hobby to play an entire game of poker in his mind with himself, with his brain keeping all scores, and generating the random sequence of cards obeying probability calculations from observed cards?!) — I regret to only know Wald and Hotelling from lemma and distributions back in the days, their stories are infinitely fun and motivating!•	Pascal (probability and religion - expected utility from religious belief WOW!), •	Poincare, •	Fermat (and theorems filling on book margins), •	David Hilbert (his axiomatic approach to Scalia’s formalism approach to law, his rational belief that led him to hold modern beliefs such as defend hiring female professors saying university is not a bathhouse, his failure to see Nazi for what they are in his later life, his fashion choice to wear socks with sandals lead subsequent generations of mathematicians to adopt this clothing option more than the general public!) •	Bertrand Russell (how he easily dismantled Cantor’s entire book with his paradox, set of all sets that are not members of themselves), •	RA Fisher (significance testing, Bayesian approach, smoking habit and his failure to see smoking evidence for lung cancer, his own daughter admitting not to have sensibility to other people’s feelings), •	Karl Pearson & his son Egon Pearson (confidence internal, how they dueled w/ Fisher), •	Claude Shannon, •	Terence Tao, •	Yitang Zhang (his proof, and stories of him working at subway), •	Buffon’s needle problem (noodle problem, words are fun!) — regret only knowing him as a naturalist before"
45,1594205221,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22356256-kyle,5,"The last few books I have read have started strong and then had somewhat long, less inspiring middles. This book does not suffer from that flaw, and it makes me really appreciate Ellenberg's abilities as an author (and as a mathematician, though I cannot claim any expertise in Ellenberg's actual mathematical domain).The book is an extended way of explaining how we use mathematical ideas every day, but also explaining how these math ideas can prevent us from making mistakes. I was actually aware of almost all of the stories, paradoxes, and pitfalls, but still found Ellenberg's style and explanations helpful or thought-inspiring. He would sometimes view a problem slightly differently than I had, or he would simply go over the argument quickly but effectively. The book broadly covers problems of thinking linearly (in the actual meaning of linear), how to think about making inferences given data, how to view probability and some ways to understand it, the all-important regression to the mean phenomenon, and even some election theory. I was very impressed with his overall tone and treatment of the subjects. (Especially for electoral voting systems. Any author that points out the existence approval voting and correctly stating that Arrow's theorem doesn't apply gets an increase in my respect. Pointing out that IRV can have spoilers and so does not necessarily help third parties is also a bonus inference from his presentation.)Ellenberg does not stray from using real world examples, and I think he tries to choose his examples so that the book is politically neutral, and I think the presentation is fair. That is not to say no opinion could be inferred, but that he does not strawman arguments or use only examples that would favor one side. The book has a lot of fun asides and footnotes, which I always enjoy, as well.I would recommend this book to anyone with an interest in improving how they think about problems in the world. The math involved is all elementary (as in, it does not even require algebra to understand the books points, though I think it would be beneficial, just in gneeral). Ability to do arithmetic is all that is necessary. This is a wonderful volume full of interesting and well-explained problems and how mathematical thinking can help solve them."
46,1594205221,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17187084-sean-goh,3,"Interesting book which alternates between readable and unbelievably dense. Don't beat yourself up if you find your eyes glazing over at certain chapters. Move along. The scattered bursts of humour help liven up the read.___We tend to teach mathematics as a long list of rules. You learn them in order and you have to obey them, because if you don't obey you get a C-. This is not mathematics. Mathematics is the study of things that come out a certain way because there is no other way they could possibly be.Mathematics is the extension of common sense by other means.Non-linear thinking means which way you should go depends on where you already are. A basic rule of mathematical life: if the universe hands you a hard problem, try to solve an easier one instead, and hope the simple version is close enough to the original problem that the universe doesn't object.Working an integral or performing a linear regression is something a computer can do quite effectively. Understanding whether the result makes sense, or deciding whether the method is the right one to use in the first place - requires a guiding human hand. When we teach mathematics we are supposed to be explaining how to be that guiding human hand. Failing to do so essentially trains the student to be a very slow, buggy version of Microsoft Excel.A math teacher's least favourite thing to hear from a student is: ""I get the concept, but I couldn't do the problems"", which the student doesn't know is shorthand for ""I don't get the concept.""How the laws of large numbers works - not by balancing out what's already happened, but by diluting what's already happened with new data, until the past is proportionally negligible that it can safely be forgotten.I blame word problems. They give a badly wrong impression of the relation between mathematics and reality. ""Bobby has 300 marbles and gives 30% to Jenny. He gives half as many to Jimmy as he gave to Jenny. How many does he have left?"" That looks like it is about the real world, but is in reality a arithmetic problem in a not very convincing disguise. It might as well say type ""300 - (300*0.3)- (300*0.3*0.5)="" into your calculator and copy down the answer.Impossible things never happen. Improbable things happen a lot. Highly improbable outcomes shouldn't make you question the outcome of the game.Low powered studies (those that can only detect a pretty big effect) are a special danger in fields where small studies are common and effect sizes are typically modest.For Neyman and Pearson, the purpose of statistics isn't to tell us what to believe, but to tell us what to do. Satistics is about making decisions, not answering questions. A significance test is no more or less than a rule, to tell the people in charge whether to approve a drug, undertake a proposed economic reform, or tart up a website.The significance test is the detective, not the judge. The provocative and oh-so-statistically significant finding isn't the conclusion of the scientific process, but the bare beginning. If the result is novel and important, other scientists ought to test and retest the phenomenon (replication, science's immune system).Uncertain choices with positive expected value require you to be able to withstand the short-term variance. The richer you are, the more risks you can afford to take (c.f. deep stack play in poker). To play the long run you have to be able to stay the course.Savage Hotelling is Savage: ""The thesis of the book, when correctly interpreted, is essentially trivial. To 'prove' such a mathematical result by a costly and prolonged numerical study of many kinds of business profit and expense ratios is analogous to proving the multiplication table by arranging elephants in rows and columns, and then doing the same for numerous other animals. The performance, though perhaps entertaining, and having a certain pedagogical value, is not an important contribution either to zoology or mathematics.""Mathematics is a way not to be wrong, but it isn't a way not to be wrong about everything. Wrongness is like original sin, we are born to it and it remains always with us, and constant vigilance is ncessary if we mean to restrict its sphere of influence over our actions. There is real danger that, by strengthening our ability to analyse some questions mathematically, we acquire a general confidence in our beliefs, which extends justifiably to those things we're still wrong about.Your point is orthogonal to the discussion at hand.Some relationships are transitive. ""Bigger than"" is transitive. Correlation is not transitive, it is more like ""blood relation"". Think of it as sharing DNA. Undecided voters, by and large, aren't undecided because they are carefully weighing the merits of each candidate, unprejudiced by political dogma. They're undecided because they're barely paying attention.The very nature of uncertainty is that we don't know which of our choices will help, like attacking tobacco, and which will hurt, like recommending hormone replacement therapy. But one thing's for certain: refraining from making recommendations at all, on the grounds that they may be wrong, is a losing strategy. Similar to George Stigler's advice about missing planes: If you never give advice until you're sure it's right, you're not giving enough advice.(Berkson's fallacy) The handsomest men in your triangle run the gamut of personalities, from kindest to cruelest. On average, they're about as nice as the average person in the whole population, which, let's face it, isn't that nice. And by the same token, the nicest men are only averagely handsome. The ugly guys you like though - they make up a tiny corner of the ""datable"" triangle, and they have to be pretty darn nice, or you wouldn't notice them at all. The negative correlation between looks and personality in your dating pool is absolutely real. But there is no causal link.In a divided election, sometimes the people speak and they say ""I dunno.""To do mathematics is to be, at once, touched by fire and bound by reason. This is no contradiction: logic forms a narrow channel through which intuition flows with vast augmented force.The lessons of mathematics are simple ones and there are no numbers in them: that there is structure in the world, that we can hope to understand some of it and not just gape at what our sense present to us; that our intuition is stronger with a formal exoskeleton than without one. And that mathematical certainty is one thing, the softer convictions we find attached to us in everyday life another, and we should keep track of the difference if we can."
47,1594205221,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60425121-federico-castillo,4,"Another great math exposition book for the general audience. There several nice insights that are well-explained and placed in real life context. More than that, this book, as with great literature, is timeless. It was relevant in 2014 when it was finished, it is relevant today, and that's the point of math: It will be relevant forever.For example, there is an interesting discussion about how third parties can affect an election in seemingly strange ways. This is exactly what worries people these days, as I write this, with Kanye West apparently seriously running for president. Yes. For posterity, as of August 2020, Kanye seems in the menu.I like his praise for Nate Silver about the 2012 election, since he has proven time and time again to be a legit guy analyst. Even his famous ""Trump has 25% chance of winning"" in 2016 is well explained in this book. Also his comments on the limits of math (he even comments on 2+3=5, which again for posterity, 2+2=4 is the rage in twitter these days) are prescient. He mentions Galton, his useful scientific work, while addressing his dated, racists, views on Eugenics. There is only so much math can do to avoid being wrong.Finally there is also some moral take on the politics of being wrong. One thing I take to heart is that it is ok to be wrong sometimes, the only way to fully avoid it is to do nothing. On the other hand, he argues that stating, and quantifying, your own ignorance is most of the times the morally correct stance. In my opinion this clashes with real life when sometimes (say budget planning) you *need* a number.Anyways, author has good sense of humor and he is of course quite knowledgeable, plus a great explainer. If I'm nitpicking I'd say that this is really about statistics. Strongly recommended to any calculus student though."
48,1594205221,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16310453-patrick,4,"This was very interesting. I learned a lot. I was a math major in college. I'd forgotten or didn't know a lot of this material. The author didn't use a lot of math to talk about the subject and in some ways that was frustrating. The mathematical representation is much more precise than the English description of it, but it scares people off. And he didn't want to do that. What he did do was talk about the application of mathematical ideas to real life situations. This is one area my math training was severely lacking. My college courses were for the most part Theorm - Proof. Very little how is this useful. Differential Equations was especially that way. To this day I have no idea of why I'd ever use a differential equation even though I survived the course. In my graduate studies in business school I took one of the same courses that I took from the Math department: Linear Programming. I finally understood how to make use of what I was learning. This book whet my appetite, but was not in enough depth to really apply anything."
49,1594205221,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28822173-justin,4,"Has some actionable takeaways. That being said, it does seem like it would be hard for people who don't geek out on math to appreciate many of the topics. The author writes energetically and with humor bringing his love of math to the reader."
50,1594205221,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50009187-ainee-ansaari,3,"This book talks about what numbers speak to us. The author mentions a lot of great examples from the field of Mathematics to bolster his arguments. Unfortunately, the facts and theories are very sporadic. It takes a long while for the author to come to a point which often results in the reader losing interest."

The book can easily be read with only high school math, yet offers deep insight. Plus it is pretty fun and unpretentious. I think it would be particularly good for supporting literature in a math course for economist."
52,1594205221,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35196943-malie,5,"Loved this. Entertainingly written and full of actual maths (not a contradiction in terms). So happy I discovered it by chance - in my tiny local library no less! The only thing I didn’t love was the baseball examples, though I accept baseball has some interesting number and probability stuff *stifles tiny yawn*. But it’s not annoying enough to make me want to give a less than five star rating. “To do mathematics is to be, at once, touched by fire and bound by reason.” Recommended for fans of stuff like Thinking, Fast and Slow and the like. "
53,1594205221,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3718830-keshav,5,"Its a bit heavy on the statistics, but seeing as that data science is the pop math or our era it might be justified. Its a fascinating read, and revisiting some old math is exciting. Although the treatment is meant for the lay reader, and indeed anybody with a math course should be able to follow it comfortably, some ideas might feel difficult to get your head around. This is especially since Ellenberg is a tease in revealing secrets, and has meta narratives inside chapters and also groups of chapters. At its most essential, Ellenberg justifiably attacks regressions running amok and numbers misused/misrepresented; painfully detailing representative biases, Bayesian interference and Prospect theory. He also discusses linearity, eccentricity, the prime gap conjecture, Hamming distances, FCC lattices, formal language, AI, of course, gambling. The book is liberally interspersed with histories and stories, and everybody from Kepler to Hilbert to Fischer to David Foster Wallace is present. This was a fascinating and rewarding read! "
54,1594205221,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27495132-godfrey,4,"I really enjoyed this book. It felt disjointed at times but Ellenberg has an impressive ability to string those various pieces together to make a fun, engaging, and profound point. Made me want to read other works by him and writers he cited. Highly recommended.Some favorite quotes below:“If you go to the recovery room at the hospital, you’ll see a lot more people with bullet holes in their legs than people with bullet holes in their chest. But that’s not because people don’t get shot in the chest; it’s because the people who get shot in the chest don’t recover.” (Page 6)“A mathematician is always asking, ‘What assumptions are you making? And are they justified?’” (Page 7)“Mathematics is the extension of common sense by other means.” (Page 13)“It’s not a question of whether adding more armor is good or bad; it could be either, depending on how heavily armored the planes are to start with. If there’s an optional answer, it’s somewhere in the middle, and deviating from it in either direction is bad news. Nonlinear thinking means which way you should go depends on where you already are.” (Page 24)“A basic rule of mathematical life: if the universe hands you a hard problem, try to solve an easier one instead, and hope the simple version is close enough to the original problem that the universe doesn’t object.” (Page 35)“Smaller populations are inherently more variable.” (Page 68)“Coins have no memory.” (Page 74)“That’s how the Law of Large Numbers works: not by balancing out what’s already happened, but by diluting what’s already happened with new data, until the past is so proportionally negligible that it can safely be forgotten.” (Page 74)“It’s easy to think of the qualitative analysis of policy as something you do with a calculator. But the calculator enters only once you’ve figured out what calculation you want to do.” (Page 84)“Your calculator doesn’t have a button for this. Because in order to give a sensible answer, you need to know more than just numbers. What shape do the job-loss curves for men and women have in a typical recession? Was this recession notably different in that respect? What kind of jobs are disproportionately held by women, and what decisions has Obama made that affect that sector of the economy? It’s only after you’ve started to formulate these questions that you take out the calculator. But at that point the real mentor work is already finished. Dividing one number by another is mere computation; figuring out what you should divide by what is mathematics.” (Page 85)“The Baltimore stockbroker con works because, like all good magic tricks, it doesn’t try to fool you outright. That is, it doesn’t try to tell you something false—rather, it tells you something true from which you’re likely to draw incorrect conclusions.” (Page 98)“The more chances you give yourself to be surprised, the higher your threshold for surprise had better be.” (Page 103)“Improbability, as described here, is a relative notion, not an absolute one; when we say an outcome is improbable, we are always saying, explicitly or not, that it is improbable under some set of hypotheses we’ve made about the underlying mechanisms of the world.” (Page 112)“It’s not enough that the data be consistent with your theory; they have to be inconsistent with the negation of your theory, the dreaded null hypothesis. I may assert that I possess telekinetic abilities so powerful that I can drag the sun out from beneath the horizon—if you want proof, just go outside at about five in the morning and see the results of my work! But this kind of evidence is no evidence at all, because, under the null hypothesis that I lack psychic gifts, the sun would come up just the same.” (Page 113)“You don’t send binoculars to do a telescopes job.” (Page 124)“Assuming the truth of something we quietly believe to be false is a time-honored method of argument that goes all the way back to Aristotle; it is the proof by contradiction, or reductio ad absurdum. The reductio is a kind of mathematical judo, in which we first affirm what we wish eventually to deny, with the plan of throwing it over our shoulder and defeating it by means of its own force.” (Page 131)“Data is messy, and inference is hard.” (Page 157)“Like most forms of detective work, this is far from an exact science.” (Page 174)“When you’re faced with a math problem you don’t know how to do, you’ve got two basic options. You can make the problem easier, or you can make it harder. Making it easier sounds better—you replace the problem with a simpler one, solve that, and then hope that the understanding gained by solving the easier problem gives you some insight about he actual problem you’re trying to solve.” (Page 218)“Math, like meditation, puts you in direct contact with the universe, which is bigger than you, was here before you, and will be here after you.” (Page 224)“If you make enough bets with the odds tilted in your favor, the sheer volume of your advantage dilutes any bad luck you might experience.” (Page 230)“If you never give advice until you’re sure it’s right, you’re not giving enough advice.” (Page 357)“And now the source of the phenomenon is clear. The handsomest men in your triangle run the gamut of personalities, from kindest to cruelest. On average, they’re about as nice as the average person in the whole population, which, let’s face it, is not that nice. And by the same token, the nicest men are only averagely handsome. The ugly guys you like, though—they make up a tiny corner of the triangle, and they are pretty darn nice—they have to be, or they wouldn’t be visible to you at all. The negative correlation between looks and personality in your dating pool is absolutely real. But if you try to improve your boyfriends complexion by training him to act mean, you’ve fallen victim to Berkson’s fallacy.” (Page 362)“One of the most painful parts of teaching mathematics is seeing students damaged by the cult of the genius. The genius cult tells students it’s not worth doing mathematics unless you’er the best at mathematics, because those special few are the only ones whose contributions matter. We don’t treat nay other subject that way! I’ve Neve rehearsed a student say, “I like Hamlet, but I don’t really belong in AP English—that kid who sits in the front row knows all the plays, and he started reading Shakespeare when he was nine!” Athletes don’t quit their sport just because one of their teammates outshines them. And yet I see promising young mathematicians quiet every year, even though they love mathematics, because someone in their range of vision was ‘ahead’ of them.” (Page 412)“What you learn after a long time in math—and I think he lesson applies much more broadly—is that there is always somebody ahead of you, whether they’re right there in class with you or not. People just starting out look to people with good theorems, people with some good theorems look to people with lots of good theorems, people with lots of good theorems look to people with Fields Medals, people with Fields Medals look to the ‘inner circle’ medalists, and those people can always look toward the dead. Nobody ever looks in the mirror and says, ‘Let’s face it, I’m smarter than Gauss.’ And yet, in the last hundred years, the joined effort of all these dummies-compared-to-Gauss has produced the greatest flowering of mathematical knowledge the world has ever seen.” (Page 415)“Genius is a thing that happens, not a kind of person.” (Page 416)"

The author then constructs a graph, a view of the world from the perspective of the conservative Cato Institute. It shows ""Swedishness"" along the horizontal axis and ""prosperity"" along the vertical axis. The line thereon is straight, going from upper left ""Libertopia"" to lower right ""Black Pit of Socialism"". Along this line is shown a dot for USA toward the top and a dot for Sweden toward the bottom.Then the author introduces the idea that the curve is should not be a straight line, it should be an inverted parabola with the USA market on the left side approaching the peak which represents and optimum combination of benefits and costs and the Swedes having passed that point and needing to back up. An entirely different message all together! He moves into the famous mainstay of Reagan Republicans (and the Ferris Buhler's Day Off movie as a soul crushing lecture) known as the Laffer curve which compares revenues vs. tax rates. And we're off! And the first part of the book held my interest and moved right along.While the second half got into some interesting topics like the role of adding a third choice to a race between two candidates and the resulting fiascoes versus the ""true will of the people"" a la Ralph Nader and Ross Porot and some discussion of correlation and regression to the mean, the author begins to digress into the history of mathematics and becomes quite wearisome and plodding. So, some highs, some lows, pretty much an average read in my opinion."

I'm not sure how much will stick in my tiny brain, but it certainly influences the way I'll think about probability, expected value, electoral systems, results of scientific studies, how to teach math, and several other topics.Bonus: it's peppered with fantastic anecdotes of adventures (and misadventures) in math.""Every time you observe that more of a good thing is not always better; or you remember that improbable things happen a lot, given enough chances….; or you make a decision based not just on the most likely futures, but on the cloud of all possible futures, with attention to which ones are likely and which ones are not; or you let go of the idea that the beliefs of groups should be subject to the same rules as beliefs of individuals; or simply, you find that cognitive sweet spot where you can let your intuition run wild on the network of tracks formal reasoning makes for it; without writing down an equation or drawing a graph, you are doing mathematics, the extension of common sense by other means. When are you going to use it? You’ve been using mathematics since you were born and you’ll probably never stop. Use it well."" p 437"
57,1594205221,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1969507-r,5,"A great read on the importance of math. It ultimately helps us find the answer to many a high school math students’ favorite question: “when am I ever going to use this?” by showing how mathematical concepts help us understand and how they work in every day situations. I've noticed several comparisons this book has received with Freakonomics and think it's unfair. While Freakonomics makes fast and loose use of statistics to establish its hypothesis and make conjectures, HNTBW shows us how statistics and math can be used to provide a desired outcome, and better yet, solve problems of logic. There's a decidedly more mathematical perspective to the writing of this book.Ellenberg points out the uncertainties of math as it is dependent on its applications by subjective human beings. The book deals with academic themes like linearity, geometry and statistics in a way that keeps you fully engrossed, dealing with touchy subjects like economic policy and income disparities; botched election results and Supreme Court decisions; or by walking us through the logistics of winning the lottery. We also get a hefty dose of mathematical history along the way and somehow it remains an incredibly interesting and engaging read that happens to be full of jokes, the math nerd kind."
58,1594205221,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5887368-ernest,4,"This book is both an exploration about the hidden math that underpins, applies to, and shapes our world, a glimpse at the power of intellectual hunger a passionate yelling about how great math is, and reveals clear yet deep insights into thinking about many ways of the modern world. Yes, this is a book about math and so contains mathy things. But it is within the grasp of a high-school graduate level reader and for those parts that stretch your thinking and understanding (as it did mine), that isn’t a bad thing in a world that dumbs down many concepts into ad sized pieces, fearing to engage people on a sophisticated level.This book deals with simple and profound things, counterintuitive things, non-linear things, numerby things – so many areas of math interlinked in surprising, unexpected, beautiful ways that also shape the way we do (and should) think about things. Instead of being overwhelming, it is marvellous. The asides and sparse footnotes hint at not only a wider mathematical world to discover, but clearly show the author’s profound joy for this subject.This book may not seem to be for everyone, but those willing to be intellectually curious and to stretch their thinking (and perhaps even unexpectedly learn something) can be confident to find much to savour.

I liked this book and gave it four stars because it is both educational and entertaining. Many other reviewers have written quite extensively about the stories and ideas presented in this book, which are all quite interesting and intriguing, especially the one about how the MIT students who were able to win the lottery. I like books that expose the problems we have in our thinking and explain better ways to form our conclusions. This book provides a good mix of anecdotes from the past and more recent times that illustrate how this works and what we can do about it. The Supreme Court Justice (Scalia) and baseball empire and formalism analogies and explanations toward the end of the book were fascinating, and troublesome (Gore didn't win Florida because of this!). People who like math and thinking will enjoy this book. I listened to the audiobook and will review it again in book form, to be able to see the graphs and mathematical equations that he talks about. It was difficult to visualize them while listening. :) "
