0,0767908163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/185251-sabio,3,"When people leave organized religion, they often look for mystical awe elsewhere. Math is a not infrequent haven of new agers who gave up on the tried and true faiths of their parents. Real math takes lots of work, whereas quick mystical attachment takes very little effort. This book shows how many people have read far too much into Phi (1.6180339887 ...) [The Golden Ratio]. The author shows how, Phi is prevalent in nature, but it is not magically so. Phi's prevalence is due simple to the nature of cellular automatons and how they relate to this numeral sequence (sorry, that is another story -- not in this book). When extirpating the superstitious mind, we must be careful not to throw the baby out with the wash. The author heeds this warning well. The book exposes all the false hopes in this number while still confessing some of its power too.All to say, humans will make gods out of anything -- even after they think they have given up their gods."
1,0767908163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,3,"Well, I was expecting something a bit more exciting because of my natural love for Phi, simply because, you know... SPIRALS are EVERYWHERE, Dude.Still, the author does a palatable job of giving me a fairly decent history of mathematics from the focus of the Golden Ratio, the Golden Triangle, the logarithmic spiral, the Fibonacci sequence... all of which is, of course, the same thing, expressed slightly different with a ton of additional cultural significances. No surprise here. This is Phi.However, I did take umbrage against some of the side explanations early on for why ancient or apparently unsophisticated tribes didn't have numbers that counted past four. I mean, sheesh, if we went purely by the mystical importance that the Pythagoreans placed upon the first couple of numbers, we might also believe they couldn't count past five. It's a mistake of the first order, taking a little bit of data and coming to enormous conclusions based on our own prejudices.That's my problem, I suppose, and he does at least bring up the option that the ancient peoples might have been working on a base four mathematical system, but for me, it was too little, too late. I cultivated a little patience, waiting until we get further along the mathematical histories past the Greeks and into the Hindus and the Arabics where it got a lot more interesting, and then firmly into known territory with the Rennaisance. Most interesting, but also rather sparse, was the Elliot wave and the modern applications of Phi. I wish we had spent a lot more time on that, honestly. But as for the rest, giving us a piecemeal exploration of Phi in history, art, and math, this does its job rather well. "
2,0767908163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1122151-jasmine,2,"so I stayed up past bedtime tonight to finish this book, not because I love this book, but because I would give anything to not be reading it anymore and now I'm not. I'm not a platonist. I don't look at concepts made up by humans and say those describe things humans see so they must have a magical relationship to truth. I actually weirdly assume when people make things up those things should be related to what is true so it is a given they will relate to true things. there were parts of this that felt like bible code. I suppose credit where it's due a lot of this is actually debunking the bible codesque shit, but why is it even the focus of a serious book... perhaps because this is not a serious book. ... I mean really the fibonacci sequence describes the birth patterns of rabbits... no it doesn't it describes a word problem about rabbits. if you follow these 5 steps you get an amazing pattern that looks like a Fibonacci sequence by MAGIC. no you get it because you followed 5 steps. I mean I just don't buy any of this as meaningful. "
3,0767908163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5015851-ms-pegasus,4,"Livio's book examines the convoluted history and applications of phi. Like π (pi) it is both a constant and an irrational number. It's derivation is deceptively simple. Imagine a line divided into a longer segment (a) and a shorter segment (b); the dividing point is placed so that the longer segment (a) compared to the shorter segment (b) is proportional to the entire length (a+b) compared to the longer segment (a). In other words, a/b=(a+b)/a=phi.In mathematics, there are many ways to express the same relationship. For example, the above equation can also be written as a/b=(a/a)+(b/a)=phi. Since a/a=1, and b/a is the inverse of a/b, or 1/phi, then phi=1+(1/phi).Another way to look at the equation is to multiply both sides of the equation by phi. Then phi squared=(1 x phi) + 1. If the format of a binomial equation is adopted, then phi squared-phi-1=0. Written with coefficients of one, the equation reads: (1 x phi squared)-(1 x phi)-(1 x 1)=0. Solving the equation using the formula (-b plus or minus (√b squared - 4ac)/2a, where a=1, b=-1 and c=-1) results in the positive solution of phi=(1+√5)/2 or phi=1.6180339887.....Livio addresses the key question about phi immediately. “What is it that makes this number, or geometric proportion, so exciting as to deserve all this attention?” (p.7) Versatility is one answer. Imagine the point dividing segments a and b is instead a hinge. Bend b up so that a line connecting the beginning of segment a and the end of segment b for an isoceles triangle. The triangle forms the first leg of a five-pointed star or pentagram. Connecting the points of the star result in a pentagon. Connect the vertices of the pentagon and the result is a smaller pentagram built around a smaller pentagon. Now fold b so that it is perpendicular to a. A rectangle can be formed. Using b as the dimension of a side, cut away a square, and a smaller proportional rectangle remains. The process can be repeated again and again. The recursive properties suggested by the formula for phi is replicated geometrically by the “golden triangle” and the “golden rectangle.”Livio's book communicates his own sense of excitement to even the dullest student. He explains the rule for generating the Fibonacci Sequence (in case you haven't read the Dan Brown book!). The sequence is as follows: 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233.... Now create from these numbers the sequence: 1/1,2/1,3/2,5/3,8/5,13/8,21/13,34/21,55/34,89/55,144/89,233/144.... The decimal equivalents for that series is: 1.0, 2.0, 2.5, 1.6666, 1.625000, 1.615385, 1.619048, 1.617647, 1.618182, 1.617978, 1.618050.... In other words, each number in the series approaches closer and closer to the value of phi.Livio's book offers much more than a seemingly endless series of numerical games. He calls attention to Fibonacci's pedagogical genius.  “In many cases, Fibonacci gave more than one version of the problem, and he demonstrated an astonishing versatility in the choice of several methods of solution. In addition, his algebra was often rhetorical, explaining in words the desire solution rather than solving explicit equations as we we would today.” (p.94) I have always maintained that there is more than one way to explain mathematics, and the method that appeals to me personally is visual. Two of the videos I found most helpful in understanding the math behind this book were: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X-UA... and https://www.khanacademy.org/math/geom.... The copious historical detail that Livio introduces can at first seem like a bewildering distraction. However, for me it highlighted the vast gulf between arithmetic as a fingers and toes counting exercise, and the study of abstract relationships which so enamored the ancient Greeks. I gained a new appreciation for their achievement from reading this book.Through his scrupulous measurements and application of historical knowledge, Livio dispels many of the myths that surround phi, the so-called “golden ratio.” His examination turns to art, music, and poetry, and he notes how much of this mythology grew out of beliefs about religion and metaphysics that were intertwined with progress in mathematics. Livio's book is meant to appeal to a wide audience. I was attracted to this book after reading THE EIGHT by Katherine Neville, as well as the DA VINCI CODE by Dan Brown. I gained much more than I expected. Despite the complexity of some of the concepts, anyone who has made it through high school math will comprehend his explanations. This is not because you will need that high school knowledge. Rather, when he launches into a theorem or proposition, you will remember that you once knew the references he is citing! Nevertheless, I have to admit that I found the chapter on periodic tilings and the significance of Penrose tiles difficult to understand. A clearer explanation, to me, was the link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTrM-.... Returning to the question of why phi is important, Livio reveals that the recursive pattern appears in nature: The arrangement of leaves around a branch (phytotaxis), and the arrangement of the scales on a pinecone, for example.The effort it took to understand this book was rewarded by the satisfaction of communicating with so many historical minds on this one abstract concept."
4,0767908163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1063661-woodge,4,"Here I go all math geeky again. I picked up this slim book (about 250 pages) a couple years ago and then I started thinking about it and felt compelled to read it. (Voices in my head. You know.) The golden ratio, or phi (pronounced ""fee""), was first discovered by Euclid (remember him from geometry class?). Somewhere around 300 B.C. Euclid--YOU: Whoa-whoa-whoa, wait a minute, Woodge... you actually read another book about math. For fun?! Are you for real? WOODGE: Yeah, you TV Guide-reading eejit! Get yer head out of your ass! This stuff is interesting! YOU: You are frikkin high. WOODGE: Okay, yeah, fine, go back to your latest episode of THE APPRENTICE but I'm talking here so Shut It.Anyway, Euclid put it thusly: A straight line is said to have been cut in extreme and mean ratio when, as the whole line is to the greater segment, so is the greater to the lesser. The resulting ratio is phi, an irrational number equaling approximately 1.6180339887... it goes on forever without repeating a pattern. Phi is said to be the most irrational of irrational numbers. (The most famous irrational number is pi, the ratio of a circle's circumference to it's diameter.) Irrational numbers are called that because they can't be expressed as a ratio of any two rational numbers.YOU: Dude, I'm falling asleep here. WOODGE: Oh, don't be such a baby, the book is much more interesting than the nitty gritty of numbers 'n' stuff. YOU: Huh? Did you say something? Donald Trump was saying something profound.WOODGE: Mm-hm.Anyway, this book was a breeze to read, even I was surprised. It delves into history, art, astronomy, philosophy, poetry, and is full of good quotes and fun historical facts. It also debunks a number of myths associated with the Golden Ratio. Much of this erroneous stuff can be found in other books treated as facts but Mario Livio, a theoretical astrophysicist by trade, gets behind the mumbo jumbo and gives you the straight dope. Maybe you've heard that the Golden Ratio is all over the Parthenon or was a big factor in building the pyramids or was the basis for many of Piet Mondrian's paintings? But that's just wrongedy-wrong-wrong! But some of the diverse places that the Golden Ratio actually does appear includes: the petal arrangements of roses, pentagrams, Platonic solids, the shape of distant galaxies, nautilus shells, and accounting fraud.Much more than just blathering on about a freakin' number, this book gets into history and touches on Euclid, Pythagoras, Alexander the Great, Galileo, Johannes Kepler (and the fact that his mom was arrested for being a witch -- Burn her! Burn her! She's a witch!) and art history, and whether or not God was a mathematician.And of course there's Fibonacci and his series of numbers which have a very close relationship to phi. The Fibonacci series begins 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89... and each successive number is the sum of the preceding two numbers. If you take one of the numbers and divide it by it's previous number you get closer and closer to phi as you go further in the series. Fibonacci numbers are found everywhere; from the number of petals in a flower, to the number of spirals on a pineapple; to phyllotaxis (Greek for ""leaf arrangement""); to the family tree structure of bees, et cetera.I thought it all was pretty cool to tell you the truth.WOODGE: So doesn't that sound pretty cool? WOODGE: Hello? Anybody? "
5,0767908163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3022756-ej-natale,1,"Terrible book. Poorly written. Vague. No direction. This book is more numerology. The author creates loose and thin parallels to Phi, then refutes them. This happens repeatedly throughout the book. The great pyramids might be built based on a ratio similar to phi. Oh, no, maybe not. Oh, these painting might contain phi built into some of the geometry. Oh, wait, nope. They don't. The artist didn't even know what phi is.The content makes no sense.The author goes into lengthy sidebars about art and astronomy that do not play into the material. The author prattels on about Kepler and some of his work and how it related to phi, and then that all of his work was bunk. The author writes at length about how some artist might have based their paintings on the golden ratio, but then writes that the dimensions are off. This book is a waste. It is hoaky.I find it interesting it is pretty much built upon the mythos of the golden ration that Dan Brown built with the ""Da Vinci Code,"" but the author goes out of his way to state that he will not cover the mona lisa. Save your time and money. Do not read this steam pile of self indulgent crap."
6,0767908163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6638317-jill,4,"The Fibonacci sequence (and its consequent relationship to the Golden Ratio) is one of my favourite things. No, really. So I went into this book already interested and somewhat informed. Not sure if that would make a difference, though, because Livio's treatment of this topic is really solid. For one thing, it's clearly written -- which always helps for the artsy reader -- and while formulae and proofs litter the pages, concrete examples and pictures show up frequently. The structure of the book is excellent -- each section moves smoothly and, often, chronologically into the next, while still bring divided by subject. Pretty inspired (though the final chapter seems a bit abrupt, especially at the end). Livio also sees himself as a bit of a detective, using geometry and timeline analysis to check whether work commonly attributed to Golden Ratio influence is actually of that ilk -- and generally, it isn't. It's kinda fun to see a dude who loves this number so much still be critical of its cultish status -- DON'T FUCK AROUND WITH PHI, BITCHES; ain't no real mathematician got time for that.Really informative, surprisingly narrative, and a nice, but critical, love letter."
7,0767908163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25898891-r-k,1,"Am I nerd for voluntarily reading this? Yep. Do I care? Nope.I'm not the brainest person on the planet. Actually, I'm not very geeky at all. But I love to learn. I like to spend time analyzing and picking things apart ; dissecting the material and discussing it with someone. However, not everything enchanted me and this book straight up annoyed me.Essentially, I went into this book expecting to be, I don't know, told about Phi. The discovery, the relevance, the applications and help it provided to the world? Wouldn't you, based on this title? But what I got instead was pages and pages of conspiracy theories of phi and the ""debunking of it"".Review Continued Here"
8,0767908163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5130906-mikael-lind,4,"A fascinating historical expose about how a single number, phi, has (or is believed to have) influenced human creation within such different fields as music, art, architecture and, of course, mathematics of different kind.The book's strength is that you don't have to be a mathematical minded person to be able to understand it. I could follow the mathematical formulas roughly by the mathematical knowledge I gained more than fifteen years ago, but even though I was persistent enough to try to follow Livio's formulas, this is not crucial to the story of the book.I read this book from start to finish in one week, and read nothing but this book - something unusual for me since I usually read 3-4 books at the same time. It's a well-written and sometimes mind-boggling popular science book that makes you interested in the world of mathematics. I highly recommend it!"
9,0767908163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,4,"Phi has some surprising mathematical properties, which are eventually discussed here and there throughout the book.Mostly, this book is a history of mathematics. From the etymology of numbers, to the Pythagorean brotherhood, and the discovery of incommensurability, and finally, to modern day mathematics.The book dispels myths of Phi's use in famous works of art, construction of the pyramids, etc.I find Livio to be a trustworthy author, who prefers demystification over hyperbole, which I respect. But sometimes the drawn out history lesson left my interest to wander. Happily, he would always tie it back to them mathematics, which kept me interested."
10,0767908163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2057893-tim,4,"Mathematical constants make engaging characters in the popular imagination. At least the rash of books for general audiences in this vein published in the last two decades suggests this. Astro-physicist Livio's leading character is a somewhat less well-known constant - those special numbers discovered or created by mathematicians over the centuries. Phi - the so-called Golden Ratio - has been known since Euclid. Geometrically, given a line AB cut by point C, where AC > CB, then locate C on the line so that AC/BC = AB/AC. This equality yields Phi, an irrational number beginning with 1.618. Livio calls Phi the 'most irrational' of irrational numbers since, written as a continued fraction, it consists entirely of ones and thus converges slower than any other irrational number written as a continued fraction. The character of Phi turns up in many places - for example in construction of the pentagon and pentagram, in Fibonnaci numbers, in mathematical descriptions of the arrangement of buds in a sunflower or leaves on a plant stem, in the shape of galactic spirals. Particularly important in the history mathematics and in Livio's account is the Fibonnaci sequence where the ratio of successive numbers increasingly approximates Phi. In its many appearances Livio conveys the magic of Phi. But Livio is a debunker too. Phi's magic, he argues, lies not in some natural aesthetic known to ancient peoples, artists, musicians, or others. Most such claims for the use of Phi - in the construction of the pyramids, in painting, in music, in architecture, or elsewhere - he shows to be 'number juggling', claims founded on ambiguities in measurement and interpretation without strong psychological foundation. Yet the romance of the Golden Ratio does raise for Livio foundational questions about mathematics. As he asks in his closing chapter, ""Is God a Mathematician?"" Do mathematicians discover constants like Phi and the rest of mathematics all of which enjoy some objective natural or Platonic existence? Or are mathematical constants and the rest of the edifice of mathematics somehow just the creations of brains such as ours? His own conclusion is that ""Our mathematics is the symbolic counterpart of the universe we perceive"" where our perceptual apparatus (collectively as well as individually) is a kind of evolving computer program, a rule-based system which, in interactions with nature - ourselves and the world - generates mathematics, culture, the arts and the uncounted endeavors to which the human presence on this planet gives rise."
11,0767908163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/180214-ob-jonny,4,"This is a great book about number theory in general and is much more than just the discussion of phi, the golden ratio. It is truly amazing to see how often this number and ratio are found in nature. The widths of the spirals of pinecones and various flowers display the ratio as due patterns in the breeding of rabbits. But some of the numerical properties of the number are equally fascinating. For instance 1/phi is equal to 1 + phi. There is also a section on prime numbers which is just as interesting as the discussion about phi and it provides some of the variety to the book I mentioned. For instance, there are some very large prime numbers which are only composed of the number 1. There is an interesting discussion of the longest prime number found. Another thought-provoking discussion is the tendency for numbers starting with the lower digits appearing in nature and statistics. For instance, collections of numbers tend to have 1 as a first digit much more often than 9 and the transition is continuous between 1 and 9. It has something to do with how the range of numbers starting with 1 is much wider than for larger numbers when looking at them on a logarithmic scale. This book will really get you thinking and is especially suited for people interested in number theory."
12,0767908163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2309246-cassandra-kay-silva,5,I was so excited to get this book. I have a minor obsession with the golden section/ratio. I have always somewhere deep in my heart hoped that string theory would turn out to have strings vibrating at ratios or frequencies somehow related to the golden section. Unfortunantly I already knew everything in this book. Nuts~! I was hoping to get some new information. I don't think that is a fair reason to say that the book was not great. It was still really fun. 
13,0767908163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15178714-rosemary-paul,5,"It is a great book. I finished it in 2 days. Very stimulating in that I love books that try to give a relationship between numbers and the nature of reality. PHI 1.6180, not to be confused with PI 1.14159, is considered the Golden Ratio. Discovered by Euclid over two thousand years ago.The book is a captivating journey through art and architecture, botany and biology, physics and mathematics. It tells the human story of numerous phi-fixated individuals, including the followers of Pythagoras who believed that this proportion revealed the hand of God; astronomer Johannes Kepler, who saw phi as the greatest treasure of geometry; such Renaissance thinkers as mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci of Pisa; and such masters of the modern world as Goethe, Cezanne, Bartok, and physicist Roger Penrose. Wherever his quest for the meaning of phi takes him, Mario Livio reveals the world as a place where order, beauty, and eternal mystery will always coexist."
14,0767908163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2074414-christopher-litsinger,1,"My review for this book will consist of the suggestion of a new title: ""In which the author describes in great detail several ways in which the Golden Ratio was documented to be used in art and architecture and then proves those ways to be false with very little detail, and then rambles on for a bit about some other number theory and whether or not God is a mathematician, but generally leaves you somewhat less impressed with Phi than you were to begin with""I'll admit it's not very catchy, but it will give you a far more accurate idea of what you're in for."
15,0767908163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2648205-white,5,This book was given to me by my daughter and son-in-law. Excellent read! I was familiar with the golden ration already from a few of the science reads I have done but this book zeros in on it 100 %. You go from the last page mesmerized by the beauty of all existence with an insurmountable awe with the connection of everything. Not even 4 years of studying philosophy can expose you to the awe of this one book. This book is a mathematical utopia. A must read. 
16,0767908163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/126688-shaw,5,"This was a wonderful book, full of fun thought provoking ideas on the history of knowledge and learning. Two thumbs up, five stars, highly recommended. "
17,0767908163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3210962-mirko,5,"Very good book about mathemathics and the golden ratio (1.618), a number which suprising presence and application is found in art, physics, statistics and many other areas."
18,0767908163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14328341-david,5,"Reading this book was a stimulating experience. Exploring the mathematical principles and theories studied by various past cultures and how they employed them isn't a new idea but this author is uniquely good at it. Other authors in this genre, such as Amir Aczel can sometimes be guilty of spending too much time on sculpting the biography of a math genre and leaving its concepts severely under-explained. Livio however, created what I felt to be an adequate mix between math teaching an math biography. The result for me was to become greatly interested in a genre of study I formerly felt to be too clouded in obscurity for anyone but the balding, quirky, pocket-protector and horn-rimmed glasses wearing geeks of the world to make sense of.I appreciated the sensibility Livio showed in this work, specifically in his loyalty to the scientific method. This genre tends to produce the occasional crank who with a theory that sounds beautiful but fails to stand up to unbiased and rigorous testing. It's admirable when a someone can instead treat their theory with reservations and honestly subject it to a barrage of tests, attempting to disprove it, before presenting it to the world. And while Livio does bring up scores of wild theories proposed throughout history on the relation of the golden ratio, pi, and the Fibonacci sequence to any piece of soul-stirring art, music, or architecture, he faithfully presents the holes and counter-points, reserving his enthusiasm for the truly provable and profound. This book is not meant to disprove the connection between irrational numbers and our sense of beauty, harmony and proportion, but rather to help sift through the weak theories and teach the principles surrounding those that have proven themselves and stood the test of time.The book surveys various people and cultures who employed mathematics in their building, artistic, and musical endeavors in a chronological order, trying to determine how deep their knowledge was and how deliberate their use of higher mathematics. It sorts through the claims made by different authors and researches that individuals from the pyramid builders to the early philosophers to the renaissance painters to the modern artists/musicians perhaps knew of the irrational numbers and incorporated them into their works. Necessary to understanding each group or famous person to which the question of expert mathematical foreknowledge is posed, is a brief study of their biographical information and contributions to history. So this book functions as a nice primer to studying some of these people, especially Euclid, Plato, and Pacioli. As well as studying various people it also spends a couple chapters on the presence of irrational numbers (or our ability to recognize them) in nature. Needless to say, it goes into great detail on each topic. Surprisingly, the level of detail never becomes so intricate that the book loses rhythm & readability, and the author doesn't hide behind the voices of the many people and works he cites throughout this work.I really enjoyed this book and I suppose the purpose of many works of a scientific or scholarly nature - such as this one - are to transfer an understanding or at least stimulate an interest in an idea, and to that end I am quite satisfied with it."
19,0767908163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1635942-kyle-wright,3,"Having expected a book filled to the brim with Phi related information, I feel let down by the end result. Livio's book covers a broad history of mathematics and geometry in general, with instances of phi thrown in where context allows. While I did learn a lot of interesting information about the origins of math, I felt that Livio left little space for the phi-related aspects, which was the primary purpose of my reading this book.When Livio does manage to address phi directly, he does so by debunking preexisting phi-myth. There are numerous instances of claims of phi related architecture, art, writing, and natural phenomenon, and Livio shows that many of these are not true, or at the very least, conjecture with no solid evidence. I wish that instead of spending so much time telling what phi is not and where it isn't found, Livio would have spent more time on instances where phi occurs. If I were to write a book about ""glurbl,"" but spend the whole time telling you that cars aren't glurbl, neither are bowling balls, and despite popular belief, the Guggenheim museum is not a glurbl, by the end you would probably have no better idea of what glurbl is. That is what I felt about most of this book.As the end of the book drew near, Livio managed to eke out a few examples of phi and better explain it's place in mathematics. Overall, however, I thought the book was better as a general overview of the history of mathematics and geometry, with the occasional contextual highlight on phi, than it was a comprehensive tome solely about phi. I was also disappointed that Livio proposed many theories, but he never really took a stand on the issues, instead leaving me with a vague impression that either could be right, and that he didn't care much which it was.While not nearly the impressive book on phi that I had hoped for, Livio managed to present an interesting book on the general history of mathematics and geometry. I suppose that if you are interested in phi, then this is a good first read, as it will help you approach the other books with a more critical mind. Just don't expect this to be a book full of amazing phi occurrences and phenomenon."
20,0767908163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83799658-mina,4,"“Geometry has two great treasures; one is the Theorem of Pythagoras; the other, the division of a lineinto extreme and mean ratio. The first we may compare to a measure of gold; the second we may namea precious jewel.”-JOHANNES KEPLER (1571-1630)The Golden Ratio... Such a peculiar topic. An incommensurable number that seems to be embedded within the very fabric of the universe, making its presence known within every topic; from poetry, art, music and tiling, and unexpectedly enough, within the stock market. Such a number, which has been the reason of awe in many works cannot be simply put, easily explained. In his highly educational and eye-opening book, Mario Livio, a renowned astrophysicist and author, takes the delicate matter into his own hands. ​The Golden Ratio: The Story of Phi, the World’s Most Astonishing Number ​touches upon many pivotal topics, as well as addressing many misconceptions about this aweing number and its appearance. From Mathematics’ birth and the history behind numbers, the speculations surrounding the discovery of the “most irrational number” to its constantly “mind-boggling” correlations with a considerably impressive amount of subject matters, every single page is crammed with knowledge. Claims and ideas are given with the thorough support of examples and evidence, formulae explained with the uttermost attempt at simplification, diagrams aiding the reader with their explanatory images. Sometimes with a language indicating wit and familiarity with the reader, making the book feel like a lengthy but intellectually stimulating conversation with Mario Livio himself, the book becomes more then just numbers and theorems written without feeling or any sort of emotion, and instead, the enthusiasm felt by the author, so clearly translated into words, has a contagious effect on the reader.As I have stated at least twice before, the book covers a lot of ground, making Phi a more universal number then just another component of pure mathematics. The usage of examples governing poetry, art, literature and other subjects, which seemingly aren’t correlated with numerical subjects causes a diverse audience with conflicting areas of interest and expertise to be involved as well. This abundance further strengthens the impact of the Golden Ratio, adding on to its relativity to our universe and lives, every miniscule thing from a mollusc’s shell to not-so-miniscule galaxies being tied together with this one value. A very important component of establishing these intriguing relations, the Fibonacci sequence, is also thoroughly discussed throughout the book. Like the fractals themselves, an in depth search within the areas mentioned, end up with the Fibonacci sequence, and the undeniably connected Divine Proportion, an eternal case of self-similarity. It wouldn’t be shocking nor out of the blue to also say that even fractals are related to Phi, which is also discussed briefly within the book.Along with any numerical data that exists today, the Golden Ratio and its connections have a history, and a captivating one at that. Mario Livio provides the reader with momentous background information, supporting the provided knowledge with the infrastructure of history. Anything discussed in the book is explored within its historical frame and scrutinized with its occupation within the human concept of time and space in mind. An example might be the method in which the topic of pentagrams were handled. Along with its straightforward connection with the golden ratio, being the fact that in regular pentagons the ratio of the diagonal to the side is equal to Phi, it’s ancient meanings were deliberated upon, and the history behind its usage and appearance within the pages of human existence mentioned to argue about the unconscious or purposeful usage of the Divine Proportion by civilizations such as the Sumerians. On the topic of speculations of the discovery and purposeful application of Phi, Livio assigned special importance to the clarification of misinformation. Firstly, the claims of the usage of the Golden Ratio in the building of the Great Pyramids by the Egyptian civilization was rather paramountly expressed, the passing of popularized mistakes acknowledged by proving the claims fruitless and without satisfactory scientific and historical evidence and indications. Not only with the pyramids, but the declarations regarding other prominent artworks and historical artifacts were also meticulously proven false. The rather popular correlation made between aesthetics and the concept of beauty with the golden ratio was also cautiously invalidated notwithstanding its unquenchable public acceptance.It is an undeniable fact that examples to support the reasoning and explanations found were arduously and painstakingly selected, aiming to keep the reader interested. Which, for me, it did. The references made to my favorite authors, poets, and works of literature had me excited, face flushed with their unexpected materialization. One reference had me particularly exhilarated. Along the topics of the pentagram, the extract from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe’s Faust ​was a pleasant surprise. The dialogue between Mephistopheles and Faust himself had livened the passage. Furthermore, the frequent references to Oscar Wilde was also rather gleeful. The integration of poetry to current subjects added onto the atmosphere, further emphasizing the wonders of our cosmos, the mathematical material from which all life emerged becoming somewhat more mystical, more emotional. An extract from the work of William Blake is an appropriate example:To see the World in a Grain of Sand, And Heaven in a Wild Flower, Hold Infinity in the Palm of your hand, An Eternity in an hour.Even though I can surely say that Mario Livio’s ​The Golden Ratio: The Story of Phi, the World’s Most Astonishing Number h​ as impacted my perspective of math and its placement within the human awareness and the creation of all that there is, like any other book, there is always some concepts to touch upon. The majority of the book was considerably fast paced and all-consuming whilst sections on the necessary but rather tedious falsification on the presence of Phi from artworks it was unjustly correlated with was diverting. I found myself disencouraged to continue, since the book seemed to be going on in a tangent about these inaccurate assertions. Rather than talking about artworks which purposely used the golden ratio, a substantial part of the book was dedicated to making the reader soak in information about the reasoning, just to be told that it was, indeed, non-existent. Even though I understand the importance of getting rid of these populer claims, such as the usage of the Golden Ratio in Leonardo Da Vinci’s work, it was repeated far too much. Nonetheless the book picked up its pace again.The clear explanations of formulae used to establish the discussed concepts were clearly stated, and supported with diagrams and examples to help the reader fully understand without skimming through the text with confusion, and inevitable frustration. No matter the complexity of the topics the concepts were considered with the readers in mind. Yet, I still found myself getting lost when words gave way to numbers, and I had to read the numerical discussions a number of times to ensure my understanding and graspBefore the reader was eased into the idea of the Golden Ratio, the introductory segments supplied the reader with a charming framework on the narrative of numbers. I was completely transfixed from the start, the most basic components of mathematics suddenly becoming more than an innate idea, becoming more human. The philosophy behind numbers provided the first glimpse behind the intimidating facade that mathematics has come to wear. Numbers were suddenly not eternal and as ancient as the decay of the false vacuum (which is also mentioned in the book, as expected), and were more like human discoveries, the results of hard work and desperation. The philosophical aspect attributed to numbers also provided a wonderful basis to build the book on. Not only in the beginning, but the mentioning of the Platonic view on math and the “natural selection ideology” in the true fashion of Hegel’s thesis-antithesis-synthesistrilogy at the end of the book was enchanting, to say the least. The appendix placed at the end of the book was also beneficent, periodically acknowledged throughout the book for more supporting calculations and mathematical explanations.“In a letter written on February 27, 1818, the English Romantic poet John Keats (1795-1821) wrote: ‘Poetry should surprise by a fine excess and not by Singularity—it should strike the Reader as a wording of his own highest thoughts, and appear almost a Remembrance.’ Unlike poetry, however, mathematics more often tends to delight when it exhibits an unanticipated result rather than when conforming to the reader’s own expectations.”​ Before I read ​The Golden Ratio,​ for me, the mean and extreme ratio was only present in a logarithmic spiral, was only an aesthetic centered interdependence between two lengths. I have been taken by surprise. Phi has transcended any former meaning. The Golden Ratio is anything but a ratio for the sake of pleasant appearance. The Golden Ratio is the silk that weaves the leaves onto the plant, a constituent of Phyllotaxis, it is found within the inner dimensionality of fractals, in the infinite scales of self-similarity. The Golden Ratio is as atomic as the formation and the structure of quasicrystals, and as cosmic as the spirals of galaxies, from our own to one in another pocket universe. I agree with Luca Pacioli. It is the Divine Proportion."
21,0767908163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5856337-mark,5,"Mario Livio's The Golden Ratio nicely balanced the last book I read about the world's most astonishing number. Actually, it far surpassed it! While Livio debunks the opinion of others that phi is conspicuous in the ancient pyramids and other monumental ancient works of art, his lively discussion of other places where we are surprised to find phi is enlightening and entertaining. Whether you are curious to know more about the golden number, the golden ratio, the golden triangle, rectangle, rhombohedra, golden sequences, or golden trees I heartily recommend this book! If it's been a few years since you finished school and like me you ""returned"" most of the higher math you learned to the teacher, you may have to concentrate to follow some of the math proofs.On a personal level, I am tempted to use Benford's Law in our local community center to engage a few of the local leaders. I hope I can find time in the next few weeks! Also, this book also leaves me wanting to read Livio's latest book ""Is God a Mathematician?"" and a few recent works by others on chaos theory and complexity systems. "

The book discusses the uniqueness of the golden ratio (represented by the Greek letter phi) and how it has fascinated and interested mathematicians, scientists, and artists throughout history. Livio explains how the number is derived, what it represents, and its unique qualities. As much as I already knew about math, even I learned some cool properties about phi. Did you know phi, the square of phi and the reciprocal of phi, all have the same digits to the right of the decimal place?! If that didn’t grab your attention or amaze you, this book isn’t for you. In addition to examining the number itself, Livio gives brief biographies of different mathematicians throughout time and their thoughts about phi. Moreover, Livio investigates all of the rumors about the golden ratio (that the pyramids of Egypt, the Parthenon, and some of Leonardo da Vinci’s paintings were all created with the golden ratio in mind, to name just a few) to determine their veracity. Unlike other pop math books, this book can get a bit technical and “math-y”, so I don’t think the casual reader will find this interesting; but mathematicians and number junkies will. Recommended."

Mario Livio's THE GOLDEN RATIO is not one of those books.It is almost exclusively a history book and, at that, it's not even a history of mathematics so much as a dry-as-dust, rather turgid outline of over-wrought historical efforts by numerologists to prove by any means that architects and artists around the world used the golden ratio in their work.

31,0767908163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7867766-ryan,1,"The scholarship in this book is extremely poor. We should expect better from someone this well credentialed. For all the mystical nonsense and grandiose claims regarding where the Golden Ratio appears in art, this book over compensates and makes the opposite mistake without considering the facts. The author is guilty of the very thing he criticizes. Livio obviously wrote this book with a preconceived idea of what he wanted to be true, and didn't do any serious research before he wrote it. If he had, he would have known that many of his claims about specific artists are completely false. Several examples that come to mind are in reference to Salvador Dalí, Diego Rivera, and Jacques Villon. Livio never makes a final conclusion on whether or not Dalí used the Golden Ratio in his work, but he doesn't mention that Dalí wrote a book called 50 Secrets of Magic Craftsmanship that spends a great deal of time discussing his use of and interest in the Golden Ratio. Dalí even illustrates how to construct Golden Ratio Calipers and how he used pentagons to compose his work, such as in his masterpiece Leda and the Swan. This book has been in print for years, and Livio could have obtained a copy for about $14, not that he'd be interested because those facts don't fit into his narrative. Next, regarding Diego Rivera, Livio dismisses a quote from a Russian artist and lover of Diego's named Marevna, who confirmed that Rivera used the Ratio to compose his work. Images of Rivera's murals with Golden Ratio grids clearly defined are frequently reproduced in books on the artist. Most of the time it's images of Rivera's murals of Detroit industry in Michigan. But Livio probably didn't ever look for evidence confirming that, for he'd have surely come across those images. Next, Livio's discussion of Jacques Villon implies that the artist never used the Golden Ratio in his work and that none of the paintings exhibited in the cubist exhibition ""Section d'Or"" (The Golden Section) ""actually included the Golden Section as a basis for its composition. Rather, the organizers chose the name simply to project their general interest in questions that related art to science and philosophy."" One would think that such a claim would warrant citation. None was given. Livio says nothing further on Villon, yet Villon has verified his interest and use of the Golden Ratio and geometry on many occasions. In a revealing quote, Villon describes his use of it. ""In composing a painting I always begin with a proportion which I then plot...Sometimes I leave to the very end quite visible all these lines of subdivision which may be called the regulating plot...I lean on the golden section to get my initial assurance."" All of these artists used the Golden Ratio in their work. That is an undeniable fact that is not open for discussion or speculation to the contrary. The evidence exists. Yet, Livio's ignorant treatment of this topic brings these things into question and doubt. From an arts perspective, this book is tragic and misinforms an audience that wants genuine information on a topic wrought with misinformation. Livio only offers more of the same. Not recommended. If you want a serious academic study on the history of the Golden Ratio, one needs to read A Mathematical History of the Golden Number by Herz-Fischler or Proportion by Padovan. Don't waste you time on bad scholarship."
32,0767908163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38625911-peter-lanagan,3,"This was a book I really wanted to like.Author Marco Livio describes the history of the Golden Ratio (Phi), an irrational number which has been imbued with special meanings by some. Livio explored the history of the philosophy of mathematics starting with the Pythagoreans and follows developments in mathematical philosophy to the present day. The author uses this history to explore how Phi shows up in nature such as with the distributions of leaves on planets, the spiral of a conch shell, and the arms of galaxies. He makes a point of demolishing some reputed application of the Golden Ratio. The Parthenon's height and base do not form the Golden Ratio. Leonardo's paintings do not obviously incorporate the Golden Ratio. Most of the masters' paintings did not incorporate the Golden Ratio. There is no real evidence that rectangles with sides that form a Golden Ratio are considered more pleasing than other rectangles.Where the book falls short is in its structure. It's a challenge to meld topics as varied as philosophy, mysticism, history, art, architecture, biology, physics, and astronomy into a coherent text. Livio attempts this, but the structure of the text falls short. Some chapters are targeted as a particular topic, such as the use of Phi in art. Other chapters explore one mathematical aspect of the Golden Ratio and attempts to link myriads of topics to that one aspect. This structural inconsistency is problematic and makes pulling these ideas together more difficult (for this reader).There is good information in this book. but the structural inconsistencies make it hard for me to recommend to others."
33,0767908163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2446389-upom,2,"The Golden Ratio turned out to be somewhat interesting, but ultimately tedious book about phi. The book does a decent job of covering what exactly phi is, its fantastic mathematical properties, as well as some of its appearances in nature. That being said, much of the books is a critique of where it DOESN'T appear. Although debunking claims of appearing in the golden pyramids and art is important in scholarship, it certainly takes away from the magic of the number, as well as makes for boring reading for the average math enthusiast. The book's final chapter, ""Is God a Mathematician"" was probably the best part of the book, though somewhat tangential from the topic of phi. It did a good job of outlining the basic question of mathematics' nature in relation to the universe, as well as the answers several philosophers and mathematicians have come up with. Despite this positive, the book ultimately did a very mediocre job of making the topic of phi interesting to the average reader, and even for the average math enthusiast."

I really appreciated the skeptical debunking of a lot of the golden ratio claims made about the Pyramids, Parthenon, and even the Mona Lisa. With that nonsense out of the way what really blew my mind was the ""surprise"" aspect of how the golden ratio turns up in the solutions to other problems. And finally, the last chapter was probably my favorite... the philosophical questions about our perception of a mathematical univers. The most incredible part of the book- the part that will keep me awake, was Benford's Law. I'm still not sure how Benford's Law can even be possible. Seriously.

I confess that I skipped the proofs at the back.

He then goes into a study of the development of the golden ratio, from geometric contructions of pentagons and pentagrams. He also devotes plenty of team to the Fibonacci sequence and its close relation to Phi. It's a solid math book, but does have some amusing asides riddled throughout.

44,0767908163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/782114-nathan-albright,5,"Perhaps the most telling moment in this generally enjoyable book was when the author made the statement that a lot of people point to the ""fiveness"" of the Great Pyramid as being a sign that its architects had some awareness of the golden ratio, also known by the Greek letter phi (Φ) and then cited someone who commented that the Washington Monument was full of 5's too, which is all the more suspicious when one considers that Washington and a great many of our nation's founding Fathers were themselves masons and hence the occult significance of five (since phi is related to the square root of five) as well as pentagons and the pentagram-shaped star of our nation's flag is highly relevant [1].  Rather than making phi less significant, the reverse is true.  This author does his best to rationally celebrate phi and its significance in all kinds of mathematical and natural ways while also critiquing some of the overblown and contrived reflections on phi that exist in writing, and manages to toe a delicate line but nonetheless one that fails to capture the significance of phi to those who are inclined to look for mystical interpretations.  The author seems annoyed at mystics and interested in debunking their influence rather than interested in giving full voice to their interest in this intriguing number.In a bit more than 250 pages the author manages to discuss in narrative terms the history and significance of phi in a variety of interesting ways.  The author begins with a discussion of the long chain of mathematical insight and reasoning that was required before incommensurate ratios and irrational numbers became an area of mathematical inquiry (1) before looking at the pyramids and the Pythagorean brotherhood for the tentative beginnings of the understanding of the golden ratio (2) and trying to debunk some discussions of the Great Pyramid as being consciously modeled on the golden ratio (3).  After this the author debunks some claims about the Parthenon and points to the efforts of early mathematicians to grasp with irrational numbers (4) and the vital importance of Fibonacci in transmitting Arab and Indian mathematical insights to the European world (5).  After this the author discusses the importance of phi to Renaissance painters and mathematicians (6) as well as the way in which the golden ratio was treasured by some later painters and poets who found in phi an inspiring tribute to human insight and understanding (7).  The author then takes a look at the importance of phi in recreational mathematics that involve tiling, an area of somewhat unusual study that has proven fertile in understanding crystalline structure in recent decades (8) before closing with a discussion of whether God is a mathematician (9) and including some appendices that contain some mathematical discussion relating to phi.I can see this book being a generally enjoyable read not only for someone like myself but for others who take a more critical attitude towards those who seek to find phi everywhere and so oversell its ubiquity and importance in the world.  Nevertheless, the author manages to demonstrate that Fibonacci sequences and golden rectangles and spirals are of immense importance in all kinds of scientific fields.  Perhaps most interesting to me was the way in which insights from tiling, where different shapes serve to point out the most efficient patterns for filling a flat surface, are relevant at all for the unusual properties of crystalline structures, a seemingly totally unrelated field.  This book is a reminder, if any reminder is necessary, that areas of study that we think of as unrelated are often deeply connected to others if we will only look at them with the perspective of an interested and curious outsider rather than someone who thinks they understand everything already.  The fact that one ratio can pop up in so many different areas of study suggests that it has a great importance that we ought to pay attention to.[1] See also:https://edgeinducedcohesion.blog/2016...https://edgeinducedcohesion.blog/2016...https://edgeinducedcohesion.blog/2016...https://edgeinducedcohesion.blog/2016..."
45,0767908163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5715619-richard-rogers,4,"The first time I heard of the ""Golden Ratio,"" or the ""Golden Rectangle,"" (the constant known as phi) it was in a Disney cartoon. (https://youtu.be/U_ZHsk0-eF0) Donald Duck in Mathmagic Land was actually a pretty fun video, with lots of cool math. Elementary school me didn't really understand what the ratio was, but it was amazing to see it in so many places, and many of the images stuck with me.Mario Livio is here to destroy that memory. ;)[Phi, if you don't know, is the relationship between two line segments, one longer and one shorter, where the ratio between the two (longer/shorter) equals the ratio you would get if you compared their sum to the longer line (longer + shorter/longer). The number is about 1.618.]One of the things he does best here is debunk many of the supposed uses of the golden ratio in the ancient world up through modern times. Most of the oft-repeated examples of phi in architecture (like the pyramids or the Parthenon) or music or Renaissance art turns out to have very little evidence to support it, and sometimes is just plain wrong. Often, the ratios are merely close to phi, but not close enough to impress; other times, perfect golden rectangles are imposed on buildings or elements of paintings by arbitrarily deciding to include or exclude this edge or that top bit, jiggering it until it fits... The author looks for evidence that the creators of art and architecture have intentionally used the golden ratio, and have said so, finding some examples in the 19th and 20th Century, but little at any other time. He also debunks the notion of it creating the most beautiful rectangles, or reports on researchers who have done so. When given an option, subjects don't choose this shape any more than any other.I found this debunking (much more thorough than I've shown here) a useful contribution to knowledge but the least interesting part of the book. The careful evaluation of paintings and songs (counting measures or inspecting note sequences) that turn out NOT to be examples of anything is a bit of a dead end, dramatically speaking. Good scholarship sometimes leads to dull reading, alas. (3 nerdy stars for this impatient reader. My bad.)The best part is showing the cool stuff about the number and related math: how it emerges in geometry as well as nature; how it can be calculated by a recursive square root or a recursive fraction; how it is useful in certain calculations; and so on. The most interesting thing for me, a non-math person IRL (though I was good at it math things in school long long ago) is how it is related to the Fibonacci series (of ""The Da Vinci Code"" fame). Refresher:1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 etc.You keep adding the last two numbers of the series to create the next number, and that is how the series continues infinitely. Whatever. That's not the cool part. Now, if you take any two numbers and divide the larger by the smaller, you get an approximation of phi. The farther along in the series you go to pick your two numbers, the closer the approximation is. Why? Just cuz. And there are many more amazing connections between phi and Fibonacci, well worth checking out here. That's the part that gets a 5 star review. Good math fun.Livio finishes with a sort of essay about what is truly beautiful in math, which he defines as whatever is surprising. I rather agree. I think this part would have made a better introduction, but I enjoyed the discussion. For example, the explanation, or more like the description, of Benford's Law (how have I never heard of this? Or did I only forget?) is amazing stuff. If you don't know what that is, you gotta google it. Anyway, yes, surprising stuff. And yes, beautiful. For reals. And I still don't get it.Overall, an interesting read. And if you run on to it at Goodwill, like I did (don't judge me) it costs less than your morning coffee. The surprising beauty of the universe, yours for only $2.99......"
46,0767908163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72534681-adam-orford,3,"Less harmonious than its subject. When the author is writing on the golden ratio, the book is interesting. When he is writing on matters directly related to the golden ratio, like its underlying mathematics, or attributed claims about its use in the arts, the book remains interesting. But, like the relationship that is the nominal subject of his work, too often Mr. Livio's paragraphs reflect in on themselves, and ancillary topics are magnified and proliferate like the leaves of a fractal. Sadly, unlike fractals, the book's ideas branch out without any discernible pattern. For a work about a harmonic relationship, there is a remarkable lack of structure.You will read of many fascinating things - Pythagorean numerology, logarithmic spirals, Renaissance art. You will read about Phi, and how it does - and, just as often, does not - crop up in the world. Some of it is tightly written: for example the material on what seems to be the author's main interest, that the alleged implementation of golden rectangles in the arts is a product of late nineteenth and early twentieth century imagination. But this material is hidden late in the book, and more often the writing is scattered and disorganized, both too detailed and too general, in the manner of filler. The most interesting parts are often quotations from other work.Ultimately, although the book should leave you with a more critical inclination towards claims about the use of the ratio in art, it does not do a good job at explaining the uncanny nature of the math. I also found it sloppy to speak interchangeably of phi as an irrational number and as a ratio. The ratio is the relationship, which always produces phi if you divide the two terms. Thus, ~1.618 is to 1.000, as 1.000 is to ~0.618... . In other words: a+b is to a, as a is to b. The way this relationship occurs in rectangular geometry and the natural world are the truly fascinating topics, and this book leaves those things rather lightly described."
47,0767908163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5241251-andrew,3,"Having already read books about e (the logarithmic constant) and i (the square root of -1), I thought I had a pretty good idea what to expect from this book about Φ, the golden ratio. And, mostly, I was correct. While this book is about math, it isn't really a mathematics book, but rather more of a history book, as it explores the history of Φ and how our understanding of it and its applications has developed over time. In some ways, this is a story of surprises, as new discoveries repeatedly show Φ showing up in unexpected fields. This book shows how ""pure"" mathematics, conceived without any practical application in mind, often find later application in science as tools to describe new concepts or phenomenon.The author also makes a heroic effort to debunk many of the myths surrounding Φ (such as the persistent belief that the Egyptian pyramids were built based on this ratio), showing how many of these beliefs are based upon questionable analyses, creative number and measurement selections, and a certain elevation of belief over evidence. But even after dismissing the myths, there remain plenty of fascinating applications of the ratio.This book is written in a very accessible prose, with only minimal math, so it should not be overly intimidating for those who are uncomfortable with math. This is an enlightening trip through the history of this ratio and the mathematical ideas that surround it."

It's written by an Israeli-American Astrophysicist Mario Livio.Although the book is divided into just 9 chapters, the pace felt extremely slow for me. The story is about how humans ""unintentionally"" discovered the Golden Ratio. It's refreshing to hear the usage of this magical ratio not in mathematics, but other areas like philosophy, art, science, and design. The author has definitely done a lot of research on this topic.I was expecting more analysis of the ratio in Art & Design, and the book felt like it's too heavy on the mathematics side. As I've said earlier the pace felt slow. Maybe that's because there are unimportant things here and there. It actually took 2 chapters before the author started talking about the golden ratio. Honestly, I don't want to know about Albrecht Durer's whole life just to understand how the ratio was used during the Renaissance.In conclusion, The Golden Ratio is not only for math nerds but also for those who wanted an in-depth look to know why the number of 1.61803~ occurs regularly in our life. The pace could be a little slow, but some of you may find it rewarding."

I enjoyed many aspects of the book, especially the historical aspects. I thought it was interesting that after showing so many incredible ways that math is ingrained in the universe he basically comes to the conclusion that it is not. He uses some interesting hypotheticals (aliens perceiving things differently and therefore using different math to describe the universe) to point out that you could come up with a different math to describe the universe. He also appeals to evolution showing that although Newtons theory was the only one it still survived by the survival of the fittest. Which isn't truly evolution since it has nothing to do with chance. I think he showed his presuppositions by basically writing an entire book showing how amazing it is that this universe is created mathematically and then finishes by denying all the evidence he just revealed.

That said, once I got past the, ""hmm is this book just marketed inauthentically?"" I actually found it quite interesting and challenging for a mathematic mind! The mention of both Godel's incompleteness theorem AND Hofstadter's Godel Escher Bach were super bonuses.Sweet read! Just don't expect some magic theorem about how like phi lead Jefferson to write the Declaration of Independence. (Upon further investigation this reviewer does notice that a few words in the preamble, ""We"" and ""these"" are of length 2 and 5 respectively, both Fibonacci numbers, so what do I know)."
51,0767908163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16704962-ed-callahan,4,"I read this book out of curiosity and out of a desire to get a firmer grasp on the question of whether mathematics is a creation of man or something discovered by man. I lean in the direction that it is both. I believe it is the language of the universe. As with any language, it has grammar, internal structure, consistencies and inconsistencies (irrational numbers) which are necessary to create, encode, store, and transmit meaning.Livio's presentation is interesting and accessible enough for people normally befuddled by math to comprehend most of it. Theory of Knowledge teachers may find it helpful as background reading for any work they do with their students in Mathematics as Area of Knowledge. IB Math teachers may enjoy some of the examples as classroom activities they could share with their students."
52,0767908163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70644596-brandon,3,"Nonfiction books are always a hit or a miss. Some are very dry or over technical while others are intresting and answer many important questions. This book is right on the line between the two. Do not read this book if you do not want an in depth look into one of the most fantastic numbers ever. Before reading this book I was not sure what the golden ratio was, yet now I could say that I know more than I would ever need to know. When the history behind the golden ratio was being explained it really lost me and wasn't very good honestly. When the book went into explaning why it is important for us it drew me in. I feel so split on whether I like this book or not. Read it if you want don't if you don't. Overall I would have to say that I enjoyed reading it. "
53,0767908163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4184634-liza,3,"I am Continuing to plow through the books we moved to our new home. One of my students gave this to me years ago as an end of year “teacher gift”. I finally carved out the time to read it. Lots of this was interesting. I enjoyed the history and anecdotes of artists and mathematicians (I even did google searches to watch videos of some of the works of art mentioned here). I enjoyed following the geometry constructions and references to Penrose tiles, fractals, Fibonacci numbers. I wish more attention/ research had been done to number discoveries in other civilizations around the world; this read as quite European centric, but that would certainly have made for a lengthier read. Impressive research and quite easy to read for someone who is not a math major."
54,0767908163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69313297-jina,4,"The Story of Phi is an interesting one. I enjoyed the history lesson and seeing just how the Golden Ratio pops up in crazy, unexpected places. Also, how people have tried to force its presence in odd places such as poetry, the construction of a violin and the Egyptian Pyramids. My favourite bit had to be the chapter on all of the formulaic shortcuts that come from Fibonacci series, which is in direct relation to the Golden Ratio. It is interesting how predictable seemingly random numbers can be. Mario does go off on some tangents that seem to go on for too long (particularly about fellow cosmologist, Johannes Kepler), but overall it was a very informative, enlightening read."
55,0767908163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40195648-christopher-nilsson,4,"It would take a long time to go through all the topics in this book, so I'll stick to the main points. It was a bit of a taxing read and a lot to take in. Basically the book shows how phi--the Golden Ratio--appears in nature and has a lot to say about the Fibonacci numbers as well. It debunks a lot of exaggerations and far fetched claims about the Golden Ratio in ancient architecture and art as well.This book isn't for everybody, though. The math formulas in the back of the book are difficult to understand but the basic ideas written in the book are OK and easy enough for most people to grasp. Overall it was OK. "
56,0767908163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74530500-alan-morgan,4,"It was awesome! There were some cool features about fibonnacci numbers that I thought were mind boggling. The book did spend a bunch of time talking about many other theories for Phi's use in history. Most of those theories were refuted in this book. If less time was spent on that, I would have rated higher. But it was interesting to see where Phi was and wasn't used. He also proposed that you couldn't quantify beauty. And therefore Phi can't be beautiful. I feel like my understanding of 1.618 is much better!"
57,0767908163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21309387-kirk-hanley,3,"As a true math geek, I wanted to like this book. Unfortunately, I found it a real slog to get through. While there were occasional ""Wow!"" moments, I mostly found myself asking ""How many more pages?"" If you are interested in the golden ratio and Fibonacci series, you probably would be better off reading entries in the Wikipedia."
58,0767908163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5428297-liza,4,"Livio quotes John Keats writing, “Poetry should strike the reader as a wording of his own highest thoughts, and appear almost a remembrance.” as a comparison to the surprise and beauty one can find in mathematics.For me, this helped in understanding my own adoration for phi and the logarithmic spiral. And on some level, did feel like a mystical recollection of sorts."
59,0767908163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/95539890-fede-casillas,4,"While I was reading it i saw the answer to life biggest questions, then my mind imploded and I became mentally impaired. This book will turn you into a math genius, because, don’t ask me why, you will understand deep stuff. But like drugs, you will wake up with the taste of your dream but remembering nothing. I wish I could post a meme here. "
