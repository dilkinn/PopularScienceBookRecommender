It made the subject of maths and the mathematicians come to life. Maths class at school was not as boring as it used to be, after realizing that Archimedes and Newton were real, flesh-and-blood men.Then I read the book again, while at engineering college. This time around, I was familiar with at least the names of the important mathematicians, and knew a little about their work. After this second reading, I felt more than a little love for the subject of maths, when I learned about the interesting lives that the mathematicians had led, and the often curious ways in which they had created the mathematics that we now took so much for granted. I realized that in the world of the intellect, Cauchy, Riemann, Newton, Liebnitz, Gauss, Abel and all the rest of them were true heroes. Not only that, many of them did their magnificent work in the face of desperate odds against them, like Abel and Galois. Knowing all this made the subject of mathematics come alive to me, and to this day, mathematics remains a thing of beauty to me. For this wonderful gift, I am forever indebted to E. T. Bell's Men of Mathematics. "

2,0671628186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8660547-ka-yap,3,The main intent here is biographical rather than mathematical. But this isn't a very good account. He doesn't distinguish between facts and anecdotes and the author always lets his prejudices get in the way of narrative. I guess it just reflects the times in which it was written. The parts i liked the most of this book were the mathematical parts.
3,0671628186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8325737-philipp,4,"A history of mathematics up to Georg Cantor, who died in 1918, the book itself was published in 1937. Each chapter summarises the life of a mathematician (sometimes two, if their lives are intertwined), with about a quarter of each chapter being reserved for details on one or two discoveries.In tone it reminded be a lot of Russell's History of Western Philosophy - there's the British humor and the strong opinions, some people may be put off by this. It's definitely no unbiased retelling of the history of mathematics (furthermore, about 80 years have passed. Many of these stories may turned out to have been falsehoods by now [and in looking up this book, many of them are, but that doesn't detract from their fun]).Some quotes to show the humor:As a matter of temperament some find the Laplacian conception of an eternally stable solar system repeating the complicated cycle of its motions time after time for ever and ever as depressing as an endless nightmare. For these there is the recent comfort that the Sun will probably explode some day as a nova. Then stability will cease to trouble us, for we shall all quite suddenly become perfect gases.orCauchy's life and character affect us like poor Don Quixote's — we sometimes do not know whether to laugh or to cry, and compromise by swearing.orBut on the utterly imbecilic advice of his physician he began meddling in politics ""to benefit his nervous system."" If ever a more idiotic prescription was handed out by a doctor to a patient whose complaint he could not diagnose it has yet to be exhumed.Some things I learned:- many famous mathematicians were ridiculous child prodigies in their youngest ages, Gauss being the most famous example, discovering formulas at the age of 9, finishing Disquisitiones Arithmeticae at the age of 21 (!!!) in Latin (!!!); William Rowan Hamilton spoke 13 languages by the time he was 13 years old (E. T. Bell gets very angry about this ""waste of time"", he could have been doing mathematics!). It may make you look at your own life with a hint of having already wasted it.- others did terrible in traditional systems - like Poincaré, who nearly failed the mathematical parts of his Bachelor's degree and was only admitted because of his previous mathematical importance- funding of science changed a lot with the French revolution - before that, good mathematicians got their money from benevolent rulers, after that, they either had to give lessons or were (sometimes poorly) employed by universities- transfinite numbers are weird- and much more, it's a long bookThe biggest drawback, and here the book shows its age, is the very dry style of the mathematical parts, maybe I'm too spoiled by pop-science writing, maybe it's the age. Sometimes, the mathematics is rather simple and you wonder why the author takes so much time to expand on these points (the age?), sometimes it's so short that you have to go look it up on Wikipedia. These definitely take their time if you want to read them properly.But then again, to quote the author (on a different occasion):The choice of such phraseology is not merely stereotyped pedantry. There is a reason for its use, and careful writers mean exactly what they say when they assert that “we can find, etc” They mean that they can do what they say.Recommended for: People into mathematics; people who think a book about mathematics is boring (you may want to skip or skim the mathematical parts, but it's your loss); fans of British humorNot recommended for: People without patience, as it took me a few weeks to read this; People who need the truth and nothing but the boring truth"
4,0671628186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17670625-jonathan,3,"3/5 for historical accuracy, 4/5 for culture. Ultimately, 3/5, but still highly recommendable.The only problem I have with Bell is that the characterisation of mathematics may put off some impressionable young mathematician-to-bes. Bell, most likely inadvertently, gives a sense that, if one is not going to be a first-rate, world-class mathematician, then they should not bother taking up the art.On the other hand, Bell's enthusiasm for mathematics is infectious. Many have criticised his tendency to embellish and from a historian's point of view Bell does more harm than good. But as a piece of mathematical culture it remains very important -- think Romance of the Three Kingdoms in Chinese literature, except not as fictionalised. So long as you take some of the historical accounts with a grain of salt, Men of Mathematics will be a pleasure to read, even for the non-mathematician. In fact, I would say that the gravitas Bell attributes to certain eras, ideas and theorems of mathematics is only an approximation, for their universal significance is truly ineffable. So in that sense, Bell is actually being modest.My final qualm with it is that it doesn't really capture the collaborative spirit that is even more pronounced in modern mathematics. In this sense Men of Mathematics is outdated, and perhaps a tad too romantic for my taste. Nonetheless, it is a classic, to inspire at least one more generation of mathematicians (mine!)."

There are many threads running through the book. It shows how mathematics the subject itself evolved from its infancy. But mostly the book is about the mathematician and his work. Before I started the book, I wanted to know the common denominator across these great minds. The only common characteristic that all of them had was a true love for subject. And most of them started learning mathematics from their childhood. To prove the greatness of a mathematician, his works have to be explained. And the author has done a fabulously job of conveying the greatness of each mathematician without too much mathematical details. Mind you there is still plenty of mathematics in each chapter, I would guess about 40%. I didn't understood many mathematical proofs, but still was able to appreciate the contribution of the mathematician.I have been reading this book on and off for more than a year. It is not the lightest book I have read, but definitely one of the best non-fictions I have picked."

Later, however, it is easy to notice that there are several great mathematicians who are curiously omitted simply because they were female, and that some of the biographies have a few liberties taken with them to be more dramatic. As another reviewer said, this is a product of the times in which it was written. Still, a readable overview of the sometimes overly dramatic lives of the greatest male contributors to mathematics, but by now there are many more accurate and complete texts on the history of mathematics."

What strikes out for me is that Bell tries to portray these men as gods; outworldly people capable of doing inhuman tasks. No doubt these men are legends in their own right but this praise is not justified. But I loved reading about the little stories behind these men's lives. Since it was written in the 1930s, the author has been very reserved about lot of things. A similar book written contemporarily would have been much spicier. Because let's face it, people reading this book have a vested interest in Mathematics and know most of the men discussed in the book. We were looking for stories about these men and not an explanation of the math they did, an explanation, which in my opinion. I should rate it 3.5 but since the author did the arduous task of combining so many eras of Mathematics, I'll be generous in the rounding-off. "

We discover a melting pot of lives, poor and rich, happy and sad, uneventful and rich of adventures. It is a pleasure to discover all those mathematicians from that personal-life angle and how mathematical discoveries are made within the socio-political sphere of the Time. It feels, however, that more than simple knowledge in mathematics is needed to truly enjoy this book and the importance of each mathematician's contribution.

20,0671628186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1597857-robert,5,"I recently finished reading Eric Temple Bell’s Men of Mathematics, which looked at the history of mathematics from the days of the Babylonians through to the dawn of the twentieth century. As the subtitle of his quasi-historical work states, Bell looks at “the lives and achievements of the great mathematicians from Zeno to Poincare.” He wrote the book in 1937 and it was posthumously reprinted in 1965, the version I enjoyed reading. Although Bell’s book of biographical sketches inspired many people to study mathematics, historians of mathematics do not consider it as completely accurate. Bell in his preface said he was not writing history, but a summary of the mathematicians’ humanity and their seminal achievements. It is an excellent read and I heartily recommend it.The world’s great mathematicians have played a major part in the evolution of scientific and philosophic thought. Many believe the three greatest mathematicians of all time include Archimedes, Newton, and Gauss. In fact, some historians postulate that if the Greeks took their cue from Archimedes instead of Euclid, Plato, and Aristotle, they might have advanced the era of modern mathematics of Newton and physical science of Galileo during the 17th century by 2,000 years.Modern mathematics began with two great advances - analytic geometry in 1637 with Rene Descartes (1596-1650) and calculus with Sir Isaac Newton (1642-1727) and Gottfried Leibniz (1646-1716) around 1666. Descartes took that final step with his Cartesian coordinate system in building out analytic geometry “with its structure of geometrical proof, discovery, and invention.” Descartes can be said to have invented geometry and he documented his mathematical findings in an appendix to his great work Method (1637). Newton and Leibniz independently developed calculus in order to explain the physics of nature. Both built upon the incredible insight of Archimedes regarding the idea of limiting sums from which the integral calculus emerges.The entire development of mathematics owes its progress to the ongoing battle between the notion of the discrete and the idea of the continuous. The use of the discrete, captured by the numbers 1,2,3,..., attempts to define the natural world atomistically, as individual elements put together to describe the whole. The world of the discrete belongs to algebra, symbolic logic, and the theory of numbers. The continuous, on he other hand, tries to describe nature as undulating, coursing, and flowing phenomena, such as the rise and fall of the tides, the orbits of the planets, and the movement of electricity. Such continuity takes us into the mathematical world of the calculus and to a huge array of applications common to the fields of science and technology - the world of mathematical analysis. Engineers make much use of the tools of mathematics to solve practical problems.The appearance of continuous mathematics can be attributed to Pythagoras’s failed attempt to describe the world solely with discrete mathematics. What we call the Pythagorean Theorem proves the point. If two sides of a triangle have a length of one unit, the diagonal produced with geometry yields an answer of the square root of 2. This number cannot be derived with a finite number of measurements simply because the square root of 2 is an irrational number, a series of never-ending numbers needed to describe the length. Some of the Greeks must have been less tolerant, as the young mathematician who raised the issue of irrational numbers was thrown overboard and killed. The followers of the discrete did not want to be derailed by the ideas of the continuous.Other biographical sketches Bell shares with his readers include:- Fermat, who founded the theory of numbers, shared in the creation of the theory of probability, and developed both Fermat’s Theorem and Fermat’s Last Theorem,- Pascal, who cofounded the theory of probability, invented the first calculating machine, carried on Toricelli’s work on atmospheric pressure, and solved many aspects of the cycloid,- The Bernoulli family, which produced eight mathematicians over three generations, the greatest of which was Daniel who developed principles leading to the conservation of energy postulate and is best known for his work in pure and applied fluid motion,- Euler, who was brilliant in both discrete and continuous mathematics, has never been surpassed as an algorist. He developed a solution to the three-body problem useful for navigation and made mechanics and analytical science,- Lagrange, who was close friends with the great chemist Lavoisier, used methods of approximation to develop six-body solutions in celestial mathematics,- Laplace, who was a mathematical astronomer, proved the stability of the Solar System in his era and developed the theory of the potential, key to understanding the basics of electromagnetism,- Monge, the inventor of descriptive geometry used for all mechanical drawings and graphical methods that helped make mechanical engineering a reality,- Fourier developed the theory of heat conduction, which led to useful ideas on boundary-value problems, concepts critical to the development of electrical engineering and acoustical engineering,- Poncelet developed projective geometry and introduced the principles of continuity and duality,- Gauss, considered the Prince of Mathematicians, applied rigor to mathematical analysis, inventing the law of reciprocity, the method of “least squares” - the Gaussian law of normal distribution of errors in statistics and the associated bell-shaped curve that is familiar to many, developed the laws of biquadratic and cubic reciprocity, discovered the double periodicity of certain elliptical functions, unified cartesian and polar coordinates by noting that multiplication by i has the effect of rotation through a right angle, laid a mathematical theory of electromagnetism and coinvented an electric telegraph, developed differential geometry, and built up conformal mapping,- Cauchy introduced rigor into mathematical analysis and the combinatorial, which led to the theory of groups- Abel and Jacobi jointly developed the theory of elliptic functions and the Hamilton-Jacobi equations contributed to quantum mechanics,- Cayley developed the theory of invariants of great importance to the theory of relativity, the notion of geometry of “higher space” (or of n dimensions), and the theory of matrices, which proved most useful for Heisenberg when he used matrix multiplcation for his work in quantum theory 67 years later,- Weierstrass created a theory of irrational numbers to address the concepts of limits, continuity, and covergence,- Boole’s original work added mathematical logic to the domain of algebra,- Hermite solved the general equation of the fifth degree using elliptical functions instead of radicals, which proved to be impossible as a solution set, and developed the concept of transcendance of the number e (2.71828...),- Kronecker combined the the theory of numbers, the theory of equations, and elliptic functions into one pattern, and- Reimann, one of the most original mathematicians of modern times, defined curvature and recognized its invariance, and devised processes for the investigation of quadratic differential forms, both which found their physical interpretation in Einstein’s theory of relativity.Read Bell’s summary of these great mathematicians and learn about their humanity, appreciate their strengths and frailties, and admire their seminal achievements.Good reading!"
21,0671628186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6922605-greg,4,"It must be difficult to write biographies of mathematicians. Their excellence in math does not mean they are interesting subjects otherwise. However, Bell has a done a very good job. My favorite passages:“Mathematics is the most exact science, and its conclusions are capable of absolute proof. But this is so only because mathematics does not attempt to draw absolute conclusions. All mathematical truths are relative, conditional.” – Charles Proteus Steinmetz“Of all the ancients Archimedes is the only one who habitually thought with the unfettered freedom that the greater mathematicians permit themselves today with all the hard-won gains of twenty five centuries to smoother their way, for he alone of all the Greeks had sufficient stature and strength to stride clear of the obstacles thrown in the path of mathematical progress by frightened geometers who had listened to the philosophers.” (20)“Give me a place to stand on and I will move the earth.” – Archimedes (on levers)Descartes spent his mornings lying in bed thinking, remembering is schoolboy days when the rector told him to do just that, and understanding that the quiet meditation the habit produced was responsible for his philosophy and mathematics. (37)On Newton, “In all the history of mathematicsc Newton has had no superior (and perhaps no equal) in the ability to concentrate all the forces of his intellect on a difficulty at an instant’s notice.” (116)Funny story at the court of Catherine the Great. Denis Diderot was trying to convert to atheism, and Catherine commissioned Euler to silence him, knowing how uncomfortable Diderot was with math. “Euler advanced toward Diderot, and said gravely, and in a tone of perfect conviction: ‘Sir, (a+b to the nth) / n = x, hence God exists; reply!’ It sounded like sense to Diderot. Humiliated by the unrestrained laughter which greeted his embarrassed silence, the poor man asked Catherine’s permission to return at once to France.” (147)Euler calculated the complex mathematics of lunar motion entirely in his head. (150)If you love mathematics, and want to learn the context and lives of the people who contributed to its development, this is a great source.See my other reviews here!"

While the front-matter is enticing and exciting, the rest of the book fails to live up to these expectations. This book manages to make an exciting topic boring and hard to suffer through via a combination of flowery, say-nothing prose and a focus on the people rather than the math.OK, I get it -- for the most part, readers do want people stories over math, but those are not the people who are going to be reading this book.

Gives some history of the mathematician's lives and times along with their most cherished works. Includes people I never even heard of before. For instance, the book talks of Abel, Cauchy, Jacobi and Galois, but it also talks of Newton, Gauss, and Euler. It covers them in chronological order based on the birth date I think. I would have to check again to make sure.Anyway, quite interesting for a novice mathematician or a person into the history of mathematics. I honestly don't know who else would be interested in this book.On the second reading:Men of Mathematics by E. T. Bell is a fascinating account of both the lives and the achievements of the greatest mathematicians in history. Since this is based on historical mathematicians, they don’t attempt to talk about the people that invented the concept of number. The book is split into 29 chapters with an introduction being included in the count. Some of the chapters include more than one mathematician, but most of them are devoted to only one. For instance, the second chapter talks about three Greek mathematicians; Zeno, Eudoxus, and Archimedes. It includes some of the things they developed but most of the book is devoted to the biographical aspect of it. So Zeno is included because of his four paradoxes that argue that motion is impossible, while Archimedes is included because he practically invented the Calculus without inventing it. Eudoxus is the opposite of Zeno in that he developed a method to deal with infinitesimals.This book seems to be Europe-centered in that it jumps from the Ancient Greeks to Rene Descartes. So you won’t find an account of the lives of the great Hindu and Arabic Mathematicians, which is somewhat surprising. Ah well, maybe at the time not a lot was known about them. However, I won’t make too many excuses for Professor Bell. All I can say is that the book is good but incomplete.So it covers Descartes, and the rest of the book is chronological in its treatment. Each person covered has an Epitaph or Epithet summing up their work. Gauss is called the “Prince of Mathematicians”, while the chapter covering the Bernoulli family is called “Nature or Nurture?” Fermat is known as “The Prince of Amateurs” and so on. Here is a list of the mathematicians covered in the book:Zeno, Eudoxus, ArchimedesRene DescartesPierre de FermatBlaise PascalIsaac NewtonGottfried Wilhelm LeibnizThe Bernoulli FamilyLeonard EulerJoseph-Louis LagrangePierre-Simon de LaplaceGaspard Monge and Joseph FourierJean-Victor PonceletJohann Friedrich Carl GaussAugustin-Louis CauchyNikolas Ivanovitch LobachewskyNiels Henrik AbelCarl Gustav Jacob JacobiWilliam Rowan HamiltonEvariste GaloisArthur Cayley and James Joseph SylvesterKarl Wilhelm Theodor Weierstrass and Sonja KowalewskiGeorge BooleCharles HermiteLeopold KroneckerGeorg Friedrich Bernhard RiemannErnst Eduard Kummer and Julius Wilhelm Richard DedekindHenri PoincaréGeorg CantorAs I said earlier, the book does cover some parts of the work they did but the main focus is the biographical point of view.I read this book before 2012, but I do not recall the exact dates.

And it really should have been White European Men of Mathematics. While it is true that most of modern mathematics was discovered by European men *cough* imperialism *cough*, there were some people of color and women who some important work. Like Ada Lovelace, the first computer scientist. Or Emmy Noether, a landmark abstract algebraist whose theories underpin all of modern physics. Or, you know, the Arabs who invented Algebra.

It’s not as if there was a time period to focus on, the book opens on ancient Greece and then skips straight to Descartes.I guess this book is a product of its times. It was written in 1937. Ideas like including women on the merit of their accomplishments weren’t invented yet.Aside from the imperialist and sexist attitude of the author, it was quite enjoyable! For some of it at least. The book is structured as a series of mini biographies of famous mathematicians. There are 23 chapters (intro + 22 mathematicians) from Zeno to Descartes to Gauss to Eisenstein to…if you’re bored already this book is not for you. My main issue is that if you are not already familiar with the characters and their accomplishments, the writing will not make you interested. I know this because I was already familiar with the characters in the 1/3 of the chapters I liked and unfamiliar with the 2/3 of the characters in the chapters I didn’t.I learned some neat tidbits, and some pretty cool math, but mostly I get to say I read the damn thing and have it look impressive on my shelf. Men of Mathematics, where you have to be white, male, and french or german, and a genius as 22 to get a few pages jotted down about you. Oh and you’ll probably die poor and sick and young anyway."

I sincerely doubt that if you don't care about mathematics that you will like this book, but if you do it's a must read. There's humor, interesting personal details and insight contained in Bell's book. Bell has a strong point of view and his language is precise. You can tell he had a lot of fun writing this history. The math is described in a wonderfully succinct way. I'm sure the book is dated in ways that a non-Ph.D. math type like me would never know. But I doubt that there is a better and more engaging introduction to the history of mathematics and its intellectual evolution. "
39,0671628186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16217304-manny-tingplants,3,"Biographical and historical information on most of the prime contributors to mathematics. Arranged roughly chronologically (some lives and careers overlap). I only read Volume I, spanning from Ancient Greece to mid-1800's Europe. Very informative, but take Bell's portraits with a grain of salt. More recent authors have pointed out inaccuracies in his description of certain personalities. See McGrayne's 'The Theory That Would Not Die' for Laplace; Wallace's 'Everything and More' for Cantor, Kronecker, and others; I vaguely remember at least one other author critiquing Bell on other counts."
40,0671628186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9694657-ashish,4,"Although this books has its flaws like the evident sexism and adding a bit of ""masala"" to mystify mathematicians , Eric Bell triumphs in making the reading experience an entertaining one for even the ""not very"" mathematical reader.Many of his phrases made me laugh heartily , like in describing the examiners who failed the great mathematician Galois he says - ""Men who were not worthy to sharpen his pencils sat in judgment on him"".Also some great quotes like ""Intuition (male,female or mathematical) has been greatly overrated.Intuition is the root of all superstition"".This book is worth your time if you are interested in the historical development of mathematical thought."
41,0671628186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8284707-louisa,3,"It would be nice if Mr. E.T. Bell had written a sequel titled ""Women of Mathematics"" with the biographies of Hypatia, Ada Lovelace and other female mathematicians. He did write a few paragraphs about Sophie Germain and dedicated several pages to Sonja Kowalewski, but as the title suggests, this is mostly a men's world (and European men at that - Asian and Middle-Eastern mathematicians are left out as well). Still, this is informative and engaging, a good chronicle of the men who shaped the history of mathematics in Europe. The pages 305 to 336 are missing from my hardcover edition, so be careful when you buy a copy."
42,0671628186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/132592-matthew,4,"This book apparently started John Nash into mathematics. I wish I'd read it earlier, before rather than after graduating, cos it might have made a difference to my choices too. But then I might not have appreciated it. The writing is crisp and coherent, very readable, and insightful. I like biographies, so perhaps I'm biased. However, Bell has his personal bias toward mathematics as the queen of sciences, meaning everything else is of less value than mathematics, which you might not agree with. I'd give it a 3.5 lah."
43,0671628186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26968661-bryn,4,"There are many formatting issues with this very new (less than two weeks old) kindle version of this book. Frequently the number 5 is printed as the letter ""S"" and exponents like 2^n end up as 2n or worse. I feel like the first mathematician to read this ebook. Thankfully the kindle has a way to report typos and formatting errors. The title ""Men of Mathematics"" is really all about MEN in mathematics. I don't think female pronouns get used until chapter 4. The book was originally published in 1936, so it is what it is.Very enjoyable history of mathematics. "
44,0671628186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5785753-pam,2,"This is a book primarily of short biographies on the men, who are known for their work in mathematics. It is not a book about mathematics and I found the limited information on the men's accomplishments in mathematics a disappointment. The biographies are organized in a time line with the earliest men first and is heavy on the most recent men as you would expect. The beginning was interesting but I got really bogged down as the book went on. If you want to know the history of mathematics, this really is not the book for you."
45,0671628186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86362-amar-pai,3,"Although this book is almost comically sexist (a product of its time,) E. T. Bell's grandiose style is entertaining to read & he definitely conveys excitement & provides a lucid overview of history's great (male) mathematicians and their work. He tends to embellish his biographies for dramatic effect, which has led to criticism by other historians of science. But think of it as the truth with colorful bits mixed in...."
46,0671628186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29112-erin,3,"This book took me a long time to read. I found that I could only read one chapter a day. Even I skipped over most of the parts that delved into the mathematical theory, I just wanted to hear about the lives of the men themselves. This book is obviously outdated, but it is clear that the author really loves his subject - although someitmes I think he embellishes the truth to make things more exciting. "
47,0671628186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15816425-john,2,"The author is far too wordy - Math, and the men who discover its secrets can be interesting and fun, Bell makes it dull, and unappealing. I love math, always have. Devoured the ""World of Mathematics"" decades ago in the Fifties, found it difficult to put down; and reveled in Martin Gardiner's columns in Scientific American. but I find this book impenetrable, hidden behind a wall of wordiness.It in no way matches the puff piece description - how very disappointing!"
48,0671628186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11344574-ed,0,"I read this long ago. It is well written, but also completely neglected some very important women of mathematics, like Emmy Noether. Nonetheless, I think it should be read by everyone to get some idea of the breadth of personality and life stories of mathematicians.Then go find out about the women of mathematics."
49,0671628186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18833166-hairuo,4,"1.master read master's composer; 2.they all learn math early; 3. Newton's story of apple is not welcome in masters; 4. Archimedes is greater than Euclid; 5. The most greatest masters in history: Archimedes, Newton, Gauss; 6. The stories of masters seems obey ""the talent code""; 7. The comment in this book is pertinent."
50,0671628186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/873336-susan,4,I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this book. Bell has an engaging writing style. His active voice enlivened the text and brought the biographies to life. I wasn't able to follow most of the math but had some great math conversation with Doug who has a stronger background than me.
51,0671628186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10598105-sheokhanda,4,"I read it because John Nash of the fame of ""A beautiful Mind"" read it. As simple as that and it is a nice collection of mathematicians. My only regret is that I should have read it when I was in 6th or 7th standard."
52,0671628186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6226405-yasiru,0,"I've skimmed through the biographies here a few times (some of which are exaggerated and made colourful in various ways including spinning a narrative at obscure points; for instance, see the one on Galois), but I've never read it through. Should rectify this some day soon."

While i would have loved to see a more coherent story and how mataticians influenced each other, the anecdotes and insights into the lives of such great minds made the book enjoyable and gave me a new perspective on mathematics "
54,0671628186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/419426-craig,4,"Later researchers found a good bit of this to be fiction, but still essential reading for math geeks. "

58,0671628186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5739820-abaasm,4,You need to have a genuine interest in the lives of these mathematicians before you pick up this book to enjoy it.
