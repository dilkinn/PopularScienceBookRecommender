1,0192802836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21843540-safat,4,"I have a bad habit. I tend to be too lenient when it comes to rating books, I’m sort of easily molded by new ideas. I’m trying to amend this. So I’ll not be rating this a 5 star. The term ‘Philosophy of science’ might be a bit puzzling. After all, scientists don’t bother much about philosophy and undergrads of science doesn’t have to take a course in philosophy to do well science. However, there ARE some assumptions and attitudes implicit in scientific activities which scientists don’t talk much explicitly, and which falls within the realm of philosophy rather than science. For example, every objects we examined so far obey the Newton’s laws of motion. Does this rule out the possibility of existence of objects which are not subject to Newton’s laws of motion? Just because we haven’t found out one, does it mean it doesn’t exist? After all, we only investigated a tiny part of the physical world.This book addressed some question which I’ve wondered for several years, and many more ideas of which I didn’t have any clue. Is there any objective existence of the physical world independent of our mind(this I always pondered)? Does causality exist, or is it a fiction of our mind? Is there anything beyond the reach of scientific domain(The ‘subjectivity’ of our consciousness still seems to be fit in this model, but who can guarantee it will continue to remain so ?) It talked about realsim-anti realism and other sort of attitudes towards our observation. If we can’t directly ‘see’ and electron, can we legitimately talk about an electron as real entities? Or do we just invent the idea of electron to make sense of our experimental data?I’m particularly impressed by the ideas of Thomas Kuhn’s ‘The structure of scientific revolutions’, published in 1963. It’s arguably the most influential book in the philosophy of science, which draws its premises from analyzing the history of science. Khun regarded science as rather a ‘social-activity’ practiced by scientists within the framework of a ‘paradigm’, which includes a traditional set of assumptions and methods of enquiry and a overall ‘culture’ regarding how science should be done. This paradigm are overthrown in times of ‘scientific revolutions’, and a new paradigm is adapted. Khun questioned whether experimental scientific data is ‘objective’ at all, or they are ‘theory-laden’? Kuhn generated quite a stir, which continues to this time. I can’t talk enough of Kuhn, there’s too much to talk. All in all, it’s a good book. But sometimes the author tried to over-explain a rather obvious idea, which could be a bit bothering. So I’m cutting one star for talking too much.  "
2,0192802836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20245481-mohamed-al-jamri,2,I gave it five stars when I first read it three years ago. Now I'm giving it two only. This shows how much one can change. 
3,0192802836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13162061-amirography,5,"A deserving 5! I found this book, excellent. The author was well informed on the subject, knew the most controversial aspects and managed to put the most important ones in the book. also Pr. Okasha used different arguments in different fields of science in order to explain different facets of this amazing field. While the book was short, it was accurate, convincing, page-turner, enjoyable. If I want to criticize this work, I would say that the post-script could have been more comprehensive, and an all-rounder. "
4,0192802836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12086858-yousif-al-zeera,3,"The book was overall good (and sometimes great!). All chapters made sense to me and relate to the subject. Chapter #6 (philosophical problems relate to physics, biology and psychology) was an outlier for me and I felt most of it wasn’t necessary as it went into deep discussions around Newton and Leibniz and their theories on space and motion.Nonetheless, the book gave a good introduction into the subject which, most importantly, let you feel more interested into the subject after going through this introduction. "
5,0192802836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38036841-atlas,0,"*mini review*I've left this book unrated because I find it rather hard to rate non-fiction. This book is well-written and I imagine it would be very easy for someone with very little knowledge of philosophy to understand most of it - because of this, I found it a little basic and underwhelming. The book briefly covers a few key debates in the philosophy of science and I admire the author's ability to whittle down these lengthy and complex arguments to a couple of pages. As an overview for a non-philosopher, this book was good.Read my reviews on my blog: http://atlasrisingbooks.wordpress.com"
6,0192802836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7538042-nika-mansouri-ghiasi,5,It was a greaaaat book-suggested to me by a really good friend-It made me think about the aspects of science i hadn't thought of before-to be honest with you a book teaching you how to talk more 'gholonbe solonbe' to others!;)
7,0192802836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27084215-younes-benimam,4,"erall, I think this is a great introduction. It serves as just what it proclaims, ""a very short introduction"". This book equips you with basic tools to understand better the world of ideas and reality because after all, everything we think about is based on a basic assumption about the world, be it scientific or not. I am not well versed in the field to evaluate the accuracy of the content, but what I loved the most about is how Okasha seems very objective in the presentations of the concepts. You read the stance of one school, followed by its critic, then followed by the counter-critic. This is amazing! It helps you learn about something from its various angles and leaves you at the end with the satisfying choice to adhere to what you think is more convincing, or reject everything all together. Here is a very short summary of the ideas in the book to get a glance Chapter 1 deals with basic definitions of what science and philosohy of science are. Science is destenguished by a unique method; experiments. Philosophy of science is the branch of philosophy that questions the methods of science and the epistimological implications that science presents. Then it distenguishes between science and pseudo-science with respect to Karl Poper's approach. Chapter 2 discusses deduction and induction respectively. It is followed by discussing Hume's problem of induction. It states that induction is never going to be rational and thus is problematic when it is used in science. This seems challenging at first sight, yet this does not mean it can never be relied on and Okasha argued that this shouldn't matter since it actually works . Then comes up a discussion on Inference by Best Explanation, which is a from of induction that deals with infering a fact from proofs left after a phenomenon has happened, just as it occured with Darwin when he laid out his theory of evolution. Chapter 3 explains what an explanation in scienceis. To explain something in science can have two aims: 1-To try and act out against the problem. 2-To satisfy our intellectual curiosity. The author also introduced Humpel's model of explanation and its criticism, as well as the problem of causation/correlation in analyzing data. I found Chapter 4 about ""Realism and anti-realism"" the most interesting because it talks about a fundemental issue in science, and something that I always observe when I discuss science with other people. Can science study both observable and unobeservable things? The realists agree while the anti-realists oppose with their arguments which, to be honest, are not easy to rebut. But I stand as realist. Chapter 5 is about scientific revolutions and scientific change. It discusess the importance of the history of science in scientific revolutions, Incommensurability of paradigms, and theory-ladneess of data. Chapter 6 deals with problems in specific fields of science: Lebinz and Newton's debate on absolute space, taxonomy in biology, and the modular mind in cognitive psychology. The last chapter is light and more superficial than the rest. It is about scienticism, the clash between religion and science on evolution, and the absence of value judgment in science. As I mentioned, it was a great introduction. I feel very different as I have access to important scientific concepts than I did before. If you are a non-expert and want basic knowledge to understand how science works, this would be a good book for you. I don't know any other but I think you can trust this one since the author is very credible. Check Samir Okasha. "
8,0192802836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2554323-c,4,"This is the ideal introduction for someone with little to no background regarding the philosophy of science. It is probably too simple for anyone with a bachelors degree in philosophy. Ergo, if you're a science student, who hasn't taken a philosophy course, you may like this book.The book first sets out to show what are the primary philosophical issues regarding science. For instance, what is it that connects biology, physics, and chemistry, but not biblical studies, and witch craft. Is it method? That seems dubious, since advances are often made in the biology, physics, and chemistry, through various methods. The author then focuses on the famous philosopher of science Karl Popper, and his theory of falsification. Popper thought what made a theory scientific was its ability to be falsified. We cannot falsify whether or not God exists outside space and time, therefore it isn't a scientific claim, like the boiling point of water. Of course Popper's theory has its own problems which Okasha points out.The next chapter deals with the difference between deduction, induction, inference to the best explanation, and Hume's critique of science and induction.The following chapter grapples with the debate between materialism, idealism, realism, and anti-realism. Realist believe that there is an independent world, that exists and behaves as science says, regardless of whether or not humans are around to perceive it. E.g., if a tree falls in the woods, and no one is around to hear it, it still makes a sound. Anti-realist believe that science is more instrumentally fruitful, but that there are large parts of the cosmos, or our perceptual tools which are incapable of getting how the universe really is.Finally the book ends talking about particular problems in the sciences, and critiques of Scientism (the belief that science can answer and/or address all questions)."
9,0192802836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1241339-clif,5,"From Oxford comes another little jewel of a book, a model for the efficient use of the English language.Samir Okasha looks at the methods of science and the ideas of critics who ask us to think a bit more carefully before we declare that what science tells us is unquestionably true and objective. The power of science is undeniable in its practicality. The theories that support our modern world of technology are based on reason, reason that suggests experiments whose results either support or undermine ideas about how the world works. But the theories do not come out of a vacuum. Scientists have a definite agenda, a concept they are out to prove, not some purely objective idea that leaps into existence.History shows that it is quite possible to come up with a theory that is false but nevertheless appears to be supported by the evidence. A quite involved theory seemed to explain the motion of planets across the sky, yet a far simpler theory replaced it and remains in use today. We work with the theories we have until something better comes along. Caution is advised before pronouncing any theory as absolute truth, but at the same time it is nonsense to dismiss a theory because it doesn't explain every tiny detail (critics of evolution, take note!)Science rests on inference. If something occurs without fail every time it is tried, then it is quite practical to say that it will always occur. That doesn't mean it will, but to refrain from putting a theory to use because of this extremely small amount of uncertainty would have prevented all the beneficial advances we enjoy in so many areas - from medicine to air travel.A reader might wonder why this book is needed. We know science works, why bother scratching the head over the methodology? It is because we can easily be fooled by assumptions we make. We want certainty and look for it everywhere. Once it appears to be found, we can too easily stop examining what we do, closing off alternatives that may be hidden by our own satisfaction that we can't be wrong.Okasha presents several conundrums of science that have not been decided. He clearly describes contesting views so the reader can weigh the evidence. For example, is there such a thing as absolute space? Newton thought so, Leibnitz didn't, and it's still not settled. In the manner that Einstein loved to use - the thought experiment - a suspended bucket of water is presented that is rotated (something anyone can reproduce) that causes the water to behave in a way that poses the profound question about absolute space. The jury is still out.What of the idea that only what we can directly observe is real? We can all see fossils and agree they are real, but once we get to atomic particles that are only indirectly sensed, is it legitimate to talk of protons and neutrons as real things, or are they entirely a product of the theory we construct about them?Is human thought modular or distributed? Strong evidence is presented for both sides, one of the most interesting for modularity being a simple line drawing with arrowheads, the arrowheads are then inverted with the line length remaining the same. No matter how hard the reader tries, knowing (use a ruler if you will) that both lines are of equal length, your brain will refuse to see it, indicating that our reasoning is walled off from our visual perception in this case.You should be intrigued. In no time at all you've covered the 133 pages effortlessly...but maybe not if you stop to ponder the puzzles presented. If this book doesn't provide the joy of thinking, nothing will!"
10,0192802836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4796031-armin-books,4,"I finished reading the book about a month ago, but I’m reviewing it now. As most Oxford Short Introduction Series books go, this is an easy-to-read, concise guide to the field. Philosophy of science is a very broad subject, so inevitably some corners are cut when you have to fit everything in 144 pages. The book has 7 chapters. The first chapter deals with the question of ‘What science is’. The author gives some illuminating examples from the history of science, mostly from physics and biology. Then, he expounds on the concepts of pseudoscience and Popper’s demarcation criterion. Thereupon, he uses Marx and Freud’s theories as examples of un-falsifiable, pseudo-scientific claims. Chapter 2 starts with defining induction / deduction. Subsequently, he delves into Hume’s problem of induction. When dealing with the problem, he brings about all the answers from different perspectives. Not a single answer is treated as the one true solution to the problem. I guess the reader must make their own mind up. I also liked the discussion on different interpretations of probability. Unfortunately, it’s all too common to equate probabilities with proportions. For example, if you read that the probability of an Australian living to 100 years of age is 1 in 10, then you assume that this is equivalent of saying one-tenth of Australians live to the age of 100. No, they don’t!Chapter 3 goes into more technical stuff like Hempel’s covering law, which states that scientific questions are usually ‘explanation-seeking why questions’. Apparently, the concept of ‘explanation’ in science is not as simple as it may seem. The concept of causality just adds up to problem. I need to read more on these problems. The next chapter is about realism / anti-realism debate among philosophers of science. I’m more inclined towards realism. Even though I always thought this is an obvious fact, when you look more closely, it gets messy and complicated. Still, I think realism is the way to go.Chapter 5 is all about Kuhn, paradigms and scientific revolutions. I may not agree with the extreme interpretations of these ideas, but they sure make you more humble! I suppose understanding the psychological and social underpinnings of science can lead to a less idealistic and simplistic view of how science works. They should not however undermine the value of science. Notwithstanding all its limitations, science is still the best thing we have. Go science! Chapter 6 is comprised of three case studies from physics, biology and psychology. They were all very interesting, but quite limited, and they left me with many unanswered questions. Likewise, the last chapter held much promise, but again was too brief to cover many intriguing ideas about the future of science. I give the book 4/5 stars. I recommend it for those who want a basic introduction to philosophy of science. "
11,0192802836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4331887-steve,5,"A book of this size will never do justice to such an extensive subject as the philosophy of science - but what this covers, it does so extremely well, thanks largely to the author's clear writing and to a good choice of subjects. The fundamentals of induction, explanation, realism and scientific change are all explained intelligibly, arguments are presented with corresponding counterarguments, and where necessary, topics are introduced with the right amount of background information - for example, the debate between scientific realism and anti-realism begins with a summary of the older, more metaphysical debate between realism and idealism; the chapter on scientific reasoning begins with an exploration of the difference between inductive and deductive reasoning, and so on. A chapter on scientific change and the nature of scientific revolutions is particularly enjoyable, introducing the logical positivists and Kuhn's view of science. Another chapter explores some of the more notorious philosophical problems within science, such as the concept of absolute space and the dilemma of biological classification. The final chapter is devoted to a much-needed discussion of the various criticisms often aimed at science, including that old chestnut, scientism. Overall I found this to be an introduction worthy of the name - it was informative, challenging and kept my interest throughout. Suitable for anyone interested in philosophy or indeed any branch of science."
12,0192802836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10781626-error-theorist,5,"This is a fantastic introduction to the philosophy of science. It is very brief and covers a broad range of topics (some rather superficially). So, this is definitely not a thorough introduction, but a very well written primer. This book will acquaint you with the core concepts and debates within the philosophy of science, and whet your appetite for further reading (the author provides a nice list for further reading broken down chapter by chapter). If you're already familiar with the philosophy of science, this may be a highly redundant read. This is a book purely for those wanting to get familiar with the field. "
13,0192802836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,4,"Philosophy of Science: A Very Short Introduction by Samir Okasha“Philosophy of Science "" is the introductory study of the scientific branch of knowledge. If you are curious about how the methods of science work at a basic level this is the book for you. Professor of Philosophy of Science, Samir Okasha embarks upon a brief tour that addresses questions concerning assumptions that scientists take for granted. This 160-page book is composed of the following seven chapters: 1. What is science?, 2. Scientific reasoning, 3. Explanation in science, 4. Realism and anti-realism, 5. Scientific change and scientific revolutions, 6. Philosophical problems in physics, biology and psychology, and 7. Science and its critics.Positives:1.	The Very Short Introduction series is a great way to get introduced to a wide spectrum of topics. 2.	Well written and accessible for the masses.3.	The fascinating topic of philosophy of science.4.	Addresses the tricky question of what science is. 5.	Educational insights on what led to modern physics.6.	Many illustrations that gives the book life.7.	The scientific revolution wouldn’t be complete without the great Isaac Newton.8.	The importance of philosophy within science.9.	The difference between science and pseudo-science. The difficulties of establishing clear demarcations.10.	The value of scientific reasoning backed by examples.11.	The difference between deductive and inductive patterns of reasoning.12.	Thought-provoking insights from Hume. Hume’s problem of induction.13.	The use and power of inference to the best explanation reasoning.14.	An explanation for the subjective interpretation of probability.15.	Hempel’s covering law model of explanation versus the more accepted causality-based accounts.16.	The existing limitations of science are discussed.17.	Realism versus idealism. The arguments for and against.18.	The influential work of philosophy of science, “The Structure of Scientific Revolutions” by Thomas Kuhn. The shift from an old paradigm to a new one.19.	The dominant philosophical movement of the early 20th century, logical positivism.20.	There is an entire chapter dedicated to the philosophical problems in physics, biology and psychology. The author provides three corresponding discussions: Leibniz versus Newton on absolute space, the problem of biological classification, and is the mind modular?21.	The phenomenon of science worship.22.	Interesting take on the tension between science and religion and why that is so.23.	The author provides a comprehensive further reading section.Negatives:1.	Some philosophical topics even at its most basic can be difficult to comprehend and will require repeat readings. The language of science doesn’t necessarily correspond with the language of the layperson.2.	The book feels uneven; that is, some topics are covered with more depth and ease of expertise than others.3.	The author could have done a better job of establishing the existing scientific consensus of the topic of discussion.4.	Never really gets into the classic scientific method. 5.	Charts summarizing or a timeline of philosophical views would have added value to the book. 6.	The Kindle version suffered some editing mishaps.7.	Kindle links are limited to chapter jumping.In summary, the author does an effective job of introducing the key task of the philosophy of science which is to analyze the methods of enquiry used in the various sciences. Philosophy is not everyone’s cup of tea, it can be dry at times and some topics are more esoteric than others. That being said, the author does an overall commendable job of introducing key philosophical topics of scientific interest. Shortcomings aside, if you are interested in this topic it is a worthwhile read."
14,0192802836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3457332-per-yngve-ingensson,4,"A Very Short Introduction to the Philosophy of Science was overall really nicely put together. There is one glaring flaw though. There was no mention whatever of the frequentist / Bayesian controversy. As far as I can recall, probability was mentioned only once in connection to epistemology: rather than saying we know or don't know something for sure, which is bound up with philosophical difficulties, we can assess probabilities of it between 0 and 1 instead. I know it's a ""very short introduction"" after all, but this issue is really important. The other fault I saw was that there was no mention of Roger Bacon or Grosseteste or any other of the 13th century philosophers of science, who produced more than most imagine.Otherwise it was very informative and pretty comprehensive. I did learn new things from it. Like before I was only vaguely aware of what cladism and pheneticism meant and now I know. I have a huge interest in psychology but I didn't even know much about debates around modularity in cognitive psychology until now. I've also gotten more familiar with logical positivism and I can see why it was in some sense attractive for a long time ... you want to believe that the truth is so tidy even if it really isn't. Some was old hat, too. I have a harder time reviewing the content regarding Popper and Kuhn 'cause I knew them for the longest time. But I think it's a pretty sweet book overall."
15,0192802836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40483581-cameron-jones,4,"The author is clear in explaining philosophical problems in science starting from the general questions on the nature of scientific thought and practice to specific problems in some of the sciences. Some of the explanations of ideas could have used simpler language, but it was generally easy to follow. The range of topics dealt with is nice, but, as another reviewer said, I had a sense of uneven coverage. Successes and failures of competing ideas in the debates are explained well, though the current consensus is not always given. Overall a decent introduction to the the kinds of topics explored in the field."
16,0192802836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10100,3,"A lucid introduction to contemporary (general and special) analytic philosophy of science. The only worry I had when reading (actually listening to) the book was that at least to a certain extent simplification of some discussions, which is pedagogically inevitable in a concise introductory work, led to oversimplification. This in some cases could mislead the reader. For example, Popper implicitly branded as a positivist in this book which is at least a very dubious (if not a completely wrong) way of characterising Popper's legacy."
17,0192802836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49485710-christian-hanna,4,"This book was assigned for my philosophy of worldviews and science class.I thought it was overall very good. He does not waste time covering tons of super-basic things that anyone picking up this book should already know. In fact, he does not even define certain terms, going off the assumption that readers will either know these terms or be able to quickly look them up.This was both a pro and a con. It freed up Mr. Okasha to cover a lot of ground in just over 125 pages, delving into depths I would not have thought possible in such a short book. He covers a wide array of topics pertaining to the philosophy of science but he does not remain on the surface while talking about each. The downside of this is that I frequently came across terms I did not understand and I had to look them up. It breaks one's concentration to have to keep stopping and going to find what a term means. I had to do this maybe half a dozen times in the book, so it was not extreme.Samir Okasha is a hardcore evolutionist, but one would not necessarily realize that until about chapter 7 (the last chapter). He does as best a job being objective in his approach as possible, so I tip my hat to him. Overall a good read and I will soon be reading more of the books in this series. "
18,0192802836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/797175-nelson,2,"You might think philosophy is woo-woo, and much of it is (like Hume's assertion that there is no causality). But much of philosophy of science, actually, provides a robust justification for what we do in science, math, and statistics. Studying the philosophy of science enhances understanding of much of the methodology we use.I originally borrowed the Great Courses class on this subject to listen to in my car. Then I ran into some concepts that took some effort to wrap my head around, which is a dangerous activity when executed in the car. So I got this book.The writing was very clear, and helped us grasp difficult concepts. I gave it only two stars because in areas where I know a lot--statistics and religion--he failed miserably.He failed in statistics by (1) not providing the proper statistical definition of probability, and (2) failing to explore the law of large numbers, which is very relevant as an answer to Hume's argument that induction doesn't work."
19,0192802836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51588923-shhhhh-ahhhhh,4,"Good book, though they could have better served the aim of informing the reader about the purpose of philosophy of science if they translated the reasons for rejecting arguments into speech more accessible to laypeople. I caught everything, but I noticed a mild cognitive delay in each instance of the discussion of the reasons for rejection of a particular hypothesis or assumption because they went straight to the jargon (which is fine if you know it, I guess). -1 for the lack of neutrality in handling the issue of the social sciences (and feminism as a sub-discipline therein) and the fundamentally unscientific description of the distinction between disciplines like history, sociology, psychology, and more ""fundamental"" disciplines such as physics. Wouldn't necessarily recommend to anyone unless they're already interested in science, philosophy, or critical theory. "
20,0192802836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2344488-landon,5,"This is an excellent introduction to the study of the philosophy of science, and should be read more than once. I admit that I often have to read books twice in order to really retain the information in them, and this book is no exception (in fact, I think I just finished my third reading, and I still learned from it).The author tackles many of the key issues in the field in an easily accessible manner. In the course of doing so, he introduces the reader to many important philosophers and their ideas. For example, while discussing the question ""what is science?"" in chapter one, the author talks about the ideas of Karl Popper on the demarcation of science from psuedo-science. According to Popper, scientific ideas are falsifiable; if a theory is not falsifiable, then it is not a scientific theory. (To be falsifiable is simply to have the feature that it is at least possible in principle to show the theory to be false with some observation.)Other issues that Okasha covers are: scientific reasoning, explanation, the debate between realists and anti-realists, the nature and importance of scientific revolutions, some specific problems in philosophy of the special sciences, and some various criticisms of science. Each of the chapters is very well written and informative.In the chapter on scientific reasoning, the reader will get a crash course in the difference between deductive and inductive reasoning, and some implications that the difference has. For example, though we all trust induction, this chapter clearly explains David Hume's famous problem of induction, which showed that there is no rational way to justify induction itself. The careful reader will understand this problem and will be offered various solutions that other philosophers have developed.The chapter on scientific explanations uses as its starting point Carl Hempel's famous ""covering law model of explanation"" (otherwise known as Deductive Nomological Explanation). Scientific explanation, according to this view, consists of taking the mystery out of 'why' questions by revealing that the phenomenon in need of explanation is simply an instance of a general law. Okasha clearly explains the basic framework of this type of explanation, and then offers a couple of classic problems with the view. The solution to these problems, he suggests, is to utilize the concept of causality in scientific explanations--something Hempel did not do.Regarding the realism vs. anti-realism debate, Okasha sets the stage by clearly explaining what the two views are. Then he gives the classic argument for realism and the anti-realist's response to that argument. Next he gives the classic argument for anti-realism and the realist's response.On the issue of scientific revolutions, Okasha of course explains the views of Thomas Kuhn, one of the most famous philosophers of science in the 20th century (along with Popper and Hempel). The set-up for the chapter consists of a discussion of the dominant view in the early-to-mid 20th century: that of the logical positivists. Kuhn's ideas are then explored in detail as a direct response to the basic view of the positivists, and then some objections to Kuhn's view are raised, followed by Kuhn's responses to those objections.The next chapter is an exploration of three particular philosophical problems: one in physics, one in biology, and one in psychology. In physics, the debate between Newton and Leibniz about ""absolute space"" is explored. The basic views are explained, and the main arguments for each side are presented. (A much more thorough discussion of this issue can be found in one of the early chapters of Brian Greene's ""The Fabric of the Cosmos"".) Next Okasha turns to the debate in biology between cladists and pheneticists. The debate hinges on the question of how we should classify biological organisms. Pheneticists represent the traditional view, offered by Linnaeus, whereby we group things according to physical characteristics (you'll recall the Kingdom-Phylum-Class-Order-Family-Genus-Species system, whereby the scientific nomenclature of organisms consists of Genus + Species, e.g. Homo sapiens). Cladists think that this is an artificial classification, and that we should instead classify organisms according to their evolutionary history. Lastly, the issue in psychology that is discussed is about the modularity of the human mind. Some scientists (and philosophers) think that the human mind is non-modular--i.e. that it is basically an all-purpose general reasoning tool that applies to various things. Some, on the other hand, think that the mind (and brain) contain areas of specialization (i.e. modules) where specific jobs are performed. For example, some people follow Noam Chomsky in thinking that there is a part of the brain that specifically specializes in language acquisition.In the final chapter, Okasha discusses a few of the various criticism's of science. First, he talks about the pejorative ""scientism"", which is an attitude of undeserved science-worship. Next, he talks briefly about the conflict between science and religion, particularly as it pertains to the evolution-creationism controversy. Lastly, he talks about the controversial idea that science is value-free, and explains why some observers have charged that scientific inquiry and practice is a value-laden affair.Overall, the book is a great read. I'd recommend using a few of the chapters in an introduction to philosophy course (if philosophy of science is one of the topics on the syllabus)."

Also, The book I have, got hand notes in it, seems from a student and it was insightful and really good!The Book asks the question of What is Science ? discusses the Scientific Reasoning, Changes and Revolutions in Science, Philosophical Problems in different Scientific worlds.Very Good Book!"
24,0192802836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59297397-vlad-tanasoiu,3,"This book is a tough one to review. Although addressed to the people having no prior knowledge of the philosophy of science, I bought it with the idea of refreshing my memories, whilst wanting to read a somewhat new exegetical perspective on the texts I've read over the years. The author, Samir Okasha, took upon himself the difficult challenge of presenting the main questions that bothered the philosophers of science for the past 200 years. The book is well-written, offering clear explanations for the theories of philosophers such as David Hume, Carl Hempel, Peter Strawson, Thomas Kuhn, Karl Popper and many more and exemplifying them with historical scientific debates such as the one between Newton and Leibniz on the subject matter of absolute space. Overall I've somewhat enjoyed it, but I cannot ignore the fact that the book faces a serious problem: the lack of a real target audience and the inevitability of being a little superficial (these two being two faces of the same problem). I ascribe this superficiality to the stake of the book: condensing so many complex ideas into 130 pages cannot be a thorough enterprise.Secondly, the reason why I argue for the lack of a real target audience is because I believe that it cannot be truly read and understood by the layperson, since it does assume some prior philosophical knowledge, while it probably does not offer any new information for those who've already studied philosophy of science. All in all, I think the only ones who can enjoy this book in its entirety and reap its benefits are those who have read a book or two of analytic philosophy and are looking to expand their knowledge. If the ideas presented here would've been allowed to develop for 100 pages more, then I think this book could've been worth 5 stars. Since this is not the case, I can only ascribe it three."
25,0192802836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13114220-thu-v-n,5,"This is a very good book if we take its title as a standard “A very short introduction”. I like the way the author introduced about the history of science, the way that arguments are made when weaknesses of a model are premises to introduce another one. However some points I don’t really agree. For example, the author gave examples of the Hempel’s covering law model of explanation’s weakness. First example is:General laws: Light travels in straight lines; Laws of trigonometryParticular facts: Angle of elevation of the sun is 37 degree; Flagpole is 15 metres high=> Phenomenon to be explained: Shadow is 20 metres longHowever, if we swap the explanandum like this:General laws: Light travels in straight lines; Laws of trigonometryParticular facts: Angle of elevation of the sun is 37 degree; Shadow is 20 metres long=> Phenomenon to be explained: Flagpole is 15 metres highThe second explanation is not corrected because the flagpole’s high is not dependent on its shadow’s length but the sun’s angle of elevation. This is the problem of symmetry.Another example is that: a child asks a doctor why the man John does not become pregnant. The doctor said because John take birth-control pills. The answer could fit the Hempel’s covering law model of explanation but the reason the doctor gave is not really relevant because John is the man and a man could not become pregnant. This is the problem of irrelevance. But I think we could take “priority” into account, priority of changeable facts. For example, in the first example about the flagpole, if we compare the flagpole’s height and its shadow’s length, the length of the shadow changes easier than the flagpole’s height i.e. the shadow’s length is dependent. Therefore the flagpole’s pole height takes priority and to be an explanans rather than explanandum, a phenomenon to be explained. Same as the second example about John, the fact that he is a man takes priority compared to the fact the he takes birth-control pills therefore it should be an explanans rather than an explanandum. If in that sense, the Hempel’s covering law model of explanation is still acceptable.Moreover, the author concluded that physics more fundamental than any other subjects or science. In some aspects, it is. However, the evidence and arguments that the author made were not strong enough. At the end, there is nothing more basic than physical particles maybe. But it not make sense, it is more about combination, relation and interaction among these particles. But in general, I really enjoy when reading this book."

(And then how quickly the refutations are conveyed, somewhere, eventually, if only on page B-22!)Little did I know that such skepticism in science*, its process and procedure, was so well founded (and frequently agreed with)!This brief book, in terms of quality, was pretty devoid of opinion and stylistic nuance. That’s okay, though. Like in science (but to an extent!) I wanted only the facts. Here I was exposed to:	Thomas Kuhn! Holy moly. Science as a social reality! Yes. What? Fallibilism as the “taken for granted” position in science? Karl Popper! Data is intrinsically both theory- and value-laden! Thoughts I’d had forever but never in such succinct, concrete words. 	David Hume! The problem of induction. The problem of probability. The Great Taxonomy Debates! Should the sciences be autonomous of one another? (I vote for no.) So yeah: a lot of tangents and a decent Further Reading section. All communicated ably, if averagely.

By contrast, this ""very short introduction"" is a concise, clearly written, engaging little book that moves along briskly and is a pleasure to read. It is aimed at an audience with minimal or no background in the philosophy of science. If you have already taken a class in philosophy of science or have read extensively on the topic, you will probably find the presentation too elementary. However, if, like me, you have had only slight exposure to the topic (even if--or maybe especially if--you are, as I am, a scientist), you will find this book to be a delightful and accessible introduction.Thanks for the book, Daddy. :)"

Okasha's writing is accessible enough for those at a college-reading level, though sometimes indulging in excessive statements. I appreciate his presentation of opposing views, but feel Okasha is too much in favor of one view over the other at times. I don't understand why the title is not ""History and Philosophy of Science"" though, since the book integrates historical topics. Okasha makes it clear that in the past century these two parts have become necessary to analyze science. Nonetheless, the book is helpful, with a nice further reading selection in the back."

Personally I find the last chapter the most interesting, and a more elaborate discussion on the topic of why science holds a higher status in modern society than the arts would have been much appreciated. I personally feel the conclusion was inconclusive, and thus a little disappointing, because of the books determinedly neutral stance, but then I suppose its supposed to be objective.All in all a good read though.

It asks questions that are seemingly easy but, once you look upon them from a different angle, can be extremely intricate, such as: What is science? What counts for as evidence?"
32,0192802836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71646156-nv,2,"Call me an unreasonable, fussy, entitled armchair critic, but I really was expecting more than what would ostensibly be more aptly titled '3 specific philosophies of science'. It's even worse that the 3 philosophies are tackled with all the poetic wonder, deep reflection, and inspiring complexity one might find characteristic of a golden retriever, a very smart one I'll admit, one that can even solve the tower of Hanoi, but you know, it's a golden retriever. I picked up this book to figure out whom to read more deeply, since all I knew before this was Thomas Kuhn and Karl Popper, and thanks to this book I now know that I need to read Thomas Kuhn and Karl Popper. Philosophy of science strikes me as a criminally underrated field of study, in general all the meta-sciences, like epistemology, might be undervalued in an environment where low-hanging fruits under the current paradigm are few and all the big innovation has come from platforms and networked connected ideas, all of which are paradigm shifts in their own right. It also strikes me as criminally underrated as a discipline of science, the deconstruction of axiomatic truths and abstraction of universal principles, critical processes we are only vaguely aware of while we are fed their end-products. I was really hoping to have my mind opened by an introduction to the field that carefully marries the art of imagination, inspiration and phenomenology with the science of logic, experimentation, and empiricism, a field that can trace the evolution of our relationship with the arts and sciences across time and chart a course for how we engage with ideas and truth in the future. Since all of this is sadly lacking in the education system, I came to this book, and with its total absence of imagination, inspiration and lyricism, or organization, flow and even coherence, it might have invariably been the best possible Straussian way to communicate just how poor our current appreciation and ability is with the philosophy of science.

35,0192802836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39773708-clorisu,3,"Takeaway Points:- CH1: What is Science? What is the common feature between the subjects we view as science? Eg. phyiscs, chemistry, biology etc)A: The distinguishing feature of science lies in the particular methods scientists use to investigate the world.What is the philosophy of science?A: The principal task of philosophy of science is to analyse the methods of enquiry used in the various sciences. (ie. To ask questions about science, and the assumptions/foundations scientists take for granted.)What differs science from pseudo-science?A: Karl Popper's principle of falsifiability (omits the possibility of theories ad hoc fitting any empirical data whatsoever -- such as Marx and Freuds)-- A critique is that if poppers criticism holds that theories which have been refuted should be disposed of, rather than attempting to explain away data that appears to conflict with their theories, some important scientific discoveries are rendered pseudoscience which Popper wouldn't concede. (Ie. Leverrier solving Uranus consistently differing from Newton's predictions, but later discovering the gravitational pull was from the then new planet Neptune). So clearly we shouldnt criticize Leverriers discovery as unscientific because it led to the discovery of a new planet, but they did precisely what Popper criticized the Marxists for doing: Beginning with a theory which made an incorrect prediction. Rather than concluding that newtown's theory must be wrong, they stuck by the theory and attempted to explain away the conflicting observations by postulating a new planet.) This example is by no means atypical. It is worth noting nearly every theory in science conflicts with some observations -- finding a theory that fits all the data perfectly is extremely difficult. Little progress would be made if scientists simply abandoned their theories at the first sign of trouble.- The failure of Popper's demarcation throws up an important question: Is it possible to find some common feature shared by all the things we call 'science' and not shared by anything else? Wittgenstein argued there is no fixed set of feature that define what it is to be a 'game' (rather a loose clustered of ressembling features criss crossing). This may be true in science also. (** Note I think this plays into Lyotard's legitimation) If so, a simple criterion for demarcating science from pseudo-science is unlikely to be found.CH2: Scientific Reasoning- Science makes inductions not deductions. From particular instances scientists make inferences regarding the future (regardless of the subset size). Science relies heavily on inductive reasoning.- Hume's problem of induction- Popper claimed scientists only need to use deductive inferences. Although it is not possible to prove that a scientific theory is true from a limited data sample, it is possible to prove that a theory is false.- Perhaps science doesn't claim to yield truth with inductive inferences, but is rather making inferences to the best explanation (abductive inferences) [This is still fallible to hume's problem]- The concept of probability is also shaky. That is, if you take probability to be objective (mind-independent). Some argue that probability is subjective and mind-dependent (a feature of the mind).CH3: Explanation in science- Carl Hempel noted scientific explanations are usually given in response to what he called 'explanation-seeking why questions' [** Highly interesting]- Hempel's law covering model is heavily critiqued- What takes it's place in popularity by modern philosophers is explanation being causality (causality based accounts of explanation). To explain a phenomenon is simply to say what caused it. The link between the concepts of explanation and causality is quite intimate. -- Subject to Hume's critique of causality--- Many philosophers have come to the conclusion that the concept of causality, although philosophically problematic, is indepensable to how we understand the world.- Explanation is mereological, higher order phenomena can't necessarily be explained by foundational sciences like physics or chemistry. Phenomena are multiply realized.CH4: Realism and Anti-Realism- Not in the metaphyhysical sense. But scientific Realism and Scientific Anti-realism (or Instrumentalism)- Realists hold that the aim of science is to provide a true description of the world. Anti-realists hold that the aim of science is to provide a true description of a certain PART of the world - the observable (things which can be directly observed by humans without instruments) part.- Anti-realists hold that deductions made via theories that are unobservable don't really exist, but are just convenients ways of predicting observations. It regards scientific theories as instruments for helping us predit observational phenomena, rather than as attempts to describe the underlying nature of reality.-- So scientists advance theories about unobservable entieis (even though scientific knowledge ios limited to what it can osbere) for the anti realists because they are convenient fictions designed to help predict the behaviour of things in the observable world.-Anti realists hold the belief that we cannot actually attain knowledge of the unobservable part of reality - it lies beyond human ken. On this view, the limits to scientific knowledge are set by our powers of observation.- Realists posit that unobservable entities are 'empirically successful' - they make excellenet predictions about the behaviour of objects in the observable world. According to the 'no miracles' argument; it would be an extraordinary coincidence if a theory that talks about unobservables made accurate predictions about the observable world unless the unobservables actually exist (eg. atoms, electrons, etc.) it is an inference to the best explanation.-- Critique: Historically there are many cases of theories that we now believe to be false but that were empirically quite succesful in their day. (eg phlogiston) How do we know that the same fate will not befall today's theories we take to be true?- Central to the debate between realism and anti-realism is the distinction between things that are observable and things that are not.CH5: Scientific Change and Scientific Revolutions- Kuhn noted that scientific consensus changes over time. Scientific revolutions are periods of great upheavel when existing scientific ideas are replaced with radically new ones. (eg. copernican revolution, darwin, etc).They happen relatively infrequently. Most of the time science isn't in a state of revolution.- A paradigm consists of a set of fundamental theoertical assumptions that all members of a scientific community accept at a given time/- A paradigm not only consists of a theory, but also what an acceptable solution to the problems may look like. In short, a paradigm is an entire scientific outlook - a constellation of shared assumptions, beliefs, and values that unite a scientific community and allow normal science to take place.- To kuhn, normal science involves puzzle-solving. But every paradigm will encounter certain problems - phenomena that it cannot easily accomodate, mismatches btw the theories predictions and the experimental fact,rs and so on. The job of the normal scientisit is to try to eliminate these minor puzzles while making as few changes aspossible to the paradigm.- Kulhn's theoy caused such a storm because it suggests that science isn't progressive or accumulative on the basis of objective evidence, but is rather just sweeping periods of consensus which may be overturned. - He emphasizes the peer pressure of scientists on one another. If a given paradigm has very forceful advocates, it is more likely to win widespread acceptance.- It's thus hard to see how science can be regarded as a rational activity at all. One critic rote: on kuhn's account: theory choice in science was a 'matter for mob psychology'- According to a widely held view, science progresses towards the truth in a linea ffashion, as older incorrect ideas get replaced by newer, correct ones. later theories are thus objectively better than earlier ones. This 'cumulative' conception of science is popular among laymen and scientiists alike, but kuhn argued that it is both historically inaccurate and philosophically naive.- Kuhn questioned whether the concept of objective truth actually makes sense at all. the idea that there is a fixed set of facts about the world, independent of any particular paradigm, was of dubious coherence. he suggested that facts about the world are paradign-relative, and thus change when paradigms change. if this suggestion s rughtm ten it makes no sense to ask whether a given theory corresponds to facts ;as they really are', nor therefore to ask whether it is objectively true. truth itself becomes relative to a paradigm.S- His theory is at odds with the positivst view of science as a rational, objective and cumulative entertaprise.- Early readers took him to be saying that science is an entirely non-rational activity, one characterized by dohagmatice adherence to a paradigm in normal periods, and a sudden 'conversion experience' inr evolutionary periods.- "
36,0192802836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46929317-reading,4,"1.	The important milestones in modern science was pioneered by Copernicus’s astronomy, followed by Kepler and Galilei’s physics, and then Newton’s scientific revolution. In biology, the standing-out event was Darwin’s evolution theory, and Watson and Crick’s discovery of DNA. Philosophy of science is to analyze methods commonly used in various disciplines of sciences. However, science itself is difficult to define. Science may follow Wittgenstein’s proposal that things called science have family assemblies, whereas there is no clear boundary between science and pseudo-science.2.	Although deductive inference is perfect for reasoning, its requirement to be exhaustive, is difficult to achieve in real world. Sciences often deal with using what has been known to predict what is unknown. By definition, those unknown stuff has never been tapped into. On the contrary, inductive reasoning is often used, despite its ultimate problem in generalization. Popper struggled that scientists can only use deductive inference by proving false theories. His argument however does not help in proving true theories, which are presumably more useful.Yet his thought may root from Hume’s view that inductive reasoning is not rational, because it is based on uniformity of nature (UN), which is impossible in real world. To counter Hume’s problem of induction, some resort to the concept of probability. Others, like Strawson, defend that induction itself is a law, of which not necessary to question. Another solution is called inference to the best explanation (IBE), despite that the premises are not deductive. Some use the law of simplicity or parsimony to determine IBE. Such approaches are yet problematic. The problem of the probability approach is that probability can be subjective. In addition, after all the absolute value of probability does not determine its relative strength as evidence (e.g, 90% of the probability can be viewed as high probability comparing to 10%, while also can be viewed as low probability as opposed to 99%). Plus, it is unlikely to truly have the complete number as the denominator, as we have only examined a small part of the universe. 3.	In scientific explanation, Hempel provides a model (the covering law model of explanation) comprising of a general law (explanan), and a particular fact (explanan), such that a phenomenon (the explanandum) is explained. According to this model, explanation and prediction are symmetric. However, it may not follow the causality between the explanans (e.g., shadow is caused by the flagpole’s length and sun shine, but the flagpole’s length is not caused by the shadow length and the sun). 4.	The realists in science propose a true description of the complete world, while the anti-realists propose a true description of a part world that can be observed. Both parties may agree on sciences that can be observed, but when it comes to certain research on unobserved, such as electrons and quarks, disputes emerge. Anti-realists hold that the purpose of theories like kinetics is only for deducing the result, i.e., the kinetics is merely an instrument (hence called instrumentalism). To date, most modern anti-realists holds that the unobserved part must be right, only that it cannot be known. Nonetheless, the unobserved parts, if leading to the empirical success –the correct deduction is proved by obtaining the result, there is a slim chance that the theory is wrong, which is called ‘no miracle’ argument. But that argument can be wrong, as there is a slim, but substantial chance that the theory of phlogiston on combustion is wrong. Even the definition of observable or unobservable is vague. Maxwell argued that observation relies on instruments. Things are called unobservable simply because there is no sound instrument yet; Therefore it is impossible to clearly define ‘observable’. Fraaseen did not see it as a problem. He said it is about a vague concept, which is good for science. For instance, we do not have a clear line to cut ‘bald’ from ‘hirsute’ men, but we can tell the difference. There are further problems such as un-determination, or things can be observed, but never got observed. 5.	Logical positivism is a complex concept basically refers to the proposal that scientific theories must be able to verify through logic calculus, or empirical operation, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical.... It was dominant in the early 20th century. Logical positivists see little value of learning from science history, because they believe that it is more important about the method (context of justification) in testing theories, rather than how theories are raised (context of discovery). They also believe that the best theory should be picked up through observation of objective evidence.On the other hand, Kuhn argues that new theories emerge as science revolution when paradigm shifts. The word paradigm solicits subjective ideas rather than objective justification. As such, history of science is very relevant, and science progress (towards truth) is not linear, but subjected to belief of scientists in each historical stages. To support his view that paradigms are subjective, Kuhn notes that concepts in different paradigm, despite of using same words, are indeed different (holism). As such, paradigms are incommensurable (apples to oranges). How can the theories describing the same object objectively while using totally incommensurable theories? It must be that the paradigms are subject. Kuhn thereby argues that, so called scientific revolutions are paradigm shifting, not replacement of ‘wrong’ ideas by ‘right’ ones. In another word, it is just a new fashion, or a new trend, very much a social activity. Kuhn also argues that there is no purely objective data, as the observation is often described in the language of a certain theory (theory-laden data). Kuhn, as he stated in the postscript of his book, does not intend to make a radical case that science is non-rational at all. Rather, he is just insisting that we should beware of the non-rationality of scientific activities. Kuhn’s theory fosters the Strong program and cultural relativism in humanity and social science. 6.	There are many unsolved controversies in Science. For example, in physics, the relative or absolution space debated between Newton, and Leibniz. In biology, the taxonomy of plants and organisms following the Linnean system, and the recent challenge by the cladists (taxonomy by origin, baboons and human beings in the same category), the pheneticists (similar appearance, baboons and human beings not in the same category), and the evolutionary taxonomists. In cognitive science, whether modularity of mind exists (Chomsky and Fodor). 7.	Scientism; relationship between science and philosophy; between natural sciences and the social sciences; Science and religion; Vaue-free of science (nothing to do with ethics)."

This means that, on one hand, it is very suitable for people that are absolutely ignorant about the subject and, curious about it, want to read something written in a very simple style, not too difficult but still not boring. On the other hand, if you are a Philosophy student like me, you won't have the occasion to deepen your knowledge.In fact, I never studied Philosophy of Science. Since I will soon undertake an exam in Sociology of Science, I wanted to read this knowing that it was going to be a simple work, as I was concerned about having some basis in this field (especially stuff regarding the Vienna circle in relationship with Kuhn). Well, it turned out that the allusions and hints given during other lessons of other subjects, were enough to cover all the notions present in this book.All in all, this is not an ill-written book and I don't think it contains wrong concepts. I think it actually is an interesting introduction, just not suitable for someone who already has some basis in the field."
39,0192802836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/114756902-robert-jere,4,"This is a very short but profound book. It basically does what the cover says. Philosophy of science is the branch of philosophy that considers what science is all about. The book starts by giving a history of philosophy of science. This offers insight into how the view of what science is has changed over the decades. It then moves to consider whether there is such a thing as ""science"". This turns out to be a very hard problem. One of the reasons is that there is no list of characteristics that can be consistently used to determine what qualifies as ""science"". At least not without coming up with unacceptable results. Another interesting topic is the power of scientific explanation. The book presents different views on what kinds of things science can explain. Perhaps the most interesting chapter is the last one. On opposition to science. This chapter considers the views that are skeptical of science. One of these views is that science is full of value judgements and that it's results and methods are heavily influenced by the biases of the practitioners. This is a very good book. "
40,0192802836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76693507-jonathan-bechtel,5,"Very informative and interesting on the questions that arise in the different arenas of philosophy and science. A bit of a refresher, for many of the themes I was somewhat familiar with, induction and deduction for instance. An overall good read and I can see myself referring back to this over many a conversation. Scientism is one of the topics that was brought up in this book and I’m intrigued and perplexed by the very notion of it. I’ve even been accused of following scientism because I championed its successes in the light of faith/religion. I think science as a whole has brought us out of the darkness and into the light, so to speak, but not without the help of philosophy and just plain questioning. I’m by no means a scientist or a philosopher, so my criticism and praise on either topic is to be taken with a grain of a grain of salt, but both subjects fascinate me and finishing the small book just goes to show how deep the issues can go in both subjects. Read it!"
41,0192802836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30087090-rajitha-panditharadhyula,5,"I was given this book to read as part of additional readings for a course, by the time I finished I fell in love with the series that I aim to read many more of these short introduction series.I have noticed that considerable people have mentioned that these books assumption some prior knowledge of the topic, while I would agree partly I do not see that as a drawback. Moreso, I see there are two ways this book can be useful. Firstly for those who have a bleak idea but are not very clear of this topic philosophy of science- for such readers this book is a torchbearer, it helps put the history of science in perspective. Secodnly, for those who are legit beginners, might take longer to read and internalise the concepts as they would need additional readings on specific terminologies which I think is the best way to start studying an area.All in all, I loved the book and I sense this will be my go to book for quick brush-up whenever required."
42,0192802836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63222399-ed,4,"Well balanced and interesting preface for anyone unfamiliar with analysing why and how science works. Might benefit from a few more examples in the problems of philosophy specific to various sciences, since though physics, biology and psychology are mentioned there is only one example of each and many more interesting facets to philosophy of science e.g. medical ethics, natural versus human sciences etc.This does exactly what it says on the tin and if I wasn't already familiar with some of the work mentioned in here it would no doubt be a more effective and thought-provoking read. As it is I still think it is a fruitfully provocative, clear, concise and overall very strong introduction to this area of philosophy (especially the section on scientific realism and the section on the work of Thomas Kuhn)."
43,0192802836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65713934-rohan-dalvi,3,"Some solid content, but I feel like it may have been a little bit *too* introductory. Honestly, I think the book should have been a bit longer - I haven't checked the word count or anything, but I feel I've read some other books in the VSI series that seem to have more content. Perhaps it is just because this is such a broad overview of a bunch different philosophical questions that it can't dive too deep on any one of them. The topics it covers are:Popper's theory of falsifiability, Hume's ""uniformity of nature"" critique of science, types of reasoning (deduction / induction / best-explanation inference), frequentist vs. subjective vs. logical interpretations of probability, Hempel's covering law model and alternative models of scientific explanation, Kuhn's model of scientific revolution, and some problems in philosophy of physics/ biology/ psychology."
44,0192802836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/107986164-emilia,4,"Very interesting little book; it made me think quite a bit and also just put a different perspective on science in a way that was useful. The tone of the book was generally concise and easy to understand but there were a few moments where I switched off a little, especially when the text was oversaturated with accumulating subject-specific terms and concepts. Also, some of the examples had a hint of offensiveness (weird gendering, archaic stereotypes, insensitive language about mental illness) in them that unfortunately most likely wouldn't have been questioned when this was published in 2002, but now does feel a bit icky. Nonetheless, I did find quite a bit of value in this and I would recommend learning about the philosophy of science in general (not this book specifically, though it was adequate for my purposes) if you're interested in science."
45,0192802836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51346577-pablo-soto-mota,4,"This is a short book covering the main philosophical concepts and problems in science. It is, as the title says, an introduction, so no previous knowledge is required to read it. This is not to say that is not useful to philosophers with some training in Philosophy of Science; it could work as a quick review (it worked for me). The style is direct and not centered in natural sciences (social scientists may appreciate this). A negative point to say about the book is that it gives a disproportionate space and attention to Khun and not so much to Popper. I have nothing against Khun, but I believe the presentation could be better balanced."
46,0192802836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38988302-olatomiwa-bifarin,5,"What does an explanation means? How do we know that that which we opt for is the 'right' one. This is an important question that the author surveys throughout the book (directly and indirectly). Explanation in science gives less than most people think it gives; which is why many scientists (and non-scientists alike) confuse 'agency' for 'law'; why they confuse God with, say, law of motion. Explanation in science is extremely pragmatic but remarkably shallow, only if you look through a philosopher's lens. "
47,0192802836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76397340-alessandro,3,"It is, indeed, a very short introduction about the most common debates in philosophy of science. Okasha tries to answer questions like ""to what extent does a scientific explanation have to be to actually count as scientific?"" or ""do micro entities like electrons or protons really exists, or are they just a useful simplification of facts that cannot be seen/understood?"".For whom has not got any background knowledge about philosophy of (or) science it is indeed a good book to start off. Due to his being just a (short) introduction, however, it lacks deeper understanding of the subject."
48,0192802836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55846682-chalk,3,"The book is well written, and focuses strongly on the history of science. I did learn some new concepts, but I did not have too many 'wow' moments. Most of the concepts are decently explained, but I found it a bit superficial, and a lot less fun than the ""short history of almost everything"", which is a great book on the history of science. I am still looking for a good philosophy of science book to take a deeper dive."
49,0192802836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98858055-david-diaz,4,"This is an excellent primer on the philosophy of science. The author offers brief, clear explanations on the history of science and the interface between philosophy and science. I especially appreciated the discussion in chapter two on induction and deduction, Inference to the best explanation, causal inference, and probability. All in all, this brief work is a valuable read and a great introduction to some of the controversies in science."
50,0192802836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14851361-rachael,3,"Very neat little book covering many basics of the Philosophy of Science, presented and written in a way that makes it very easy to read and understand. A nice handy introduction to the subject.(This was my first experience of one of the 'A Very Short Introduction' books and it has made me want to look into delving into subjects outside my comfort zone!)"
51,0192802836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42250135-alexandre-coates,5,"A lucid explanation of the basics required to understand the main areas in the Philosophy Science. Very understandable and a great place to start, I am very happy to have started my reading in this area at such a clearly explained point. The list of further reading at the end will be very useful for me and anyone else who wants to get started, reading in this area."
52,0192802836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51726518-md-mohsin-ali,5,"It is meant for an introduction to the subject. It served its purpose. It has pointed me to ideas which I had no idea about, and has done it with clarity in only 130 pages. In some cases (few) I could not comprehend some arguments from the proponent and/or opponent of an idea. I hold myself responsible for that, maybe I did not think it deep enough. After all, I like the book."
53,0192802836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7777379-sabhrina-gita-aninta,5,"As the title said, it is a VERY short introduction. Thus, it might not cover all the issues discussed in the philosophy of science but it cover pretty much the many key issues to introduce most of it.A good reading to spark discussion with people who has been working on science. Lots of its mentioned paradigm gonna shake many things about what people mainly think science is about."
54,0192802836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7422017-carlos,5,"As the title says, a great summary of all the basic and not so basic approaches to the Philosophy of Science. I had previously read ""The Scientific Revolutions"" by Thomas Khun, and even so this book has opened my head much more to ideas about this field of Philosophy, both general and from some specific fields such as Biology and Physics."
55,0192802836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8146637-frederick,4,This is very interesting but raises more questions than it answers. Is there really such a thing as absolute scientific truth? Do even scientists believe that? This book is leading me on to further explorations.
56,0192802836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68604935-gilianb,4,"I liked this small book a lot. It introduced me to the philosophy of science in a clear, exciting way. I enjoyed reading the various arguments and counter-arguments on issues that philosophers deal with. The book ends by showing some examples of philosophical thought in scientific disciplines."
57,0192802836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42023850-jazlyn,4,"Some ideas are oversimplified (watered-down), I suspect to keep the book short, sweet and understandable (as much as it can be) to the ordinary person. Otherwise, it was a decent overview of the subject. "
58,0192802836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28777221-sharad-pandian,5,"A solid very short introduction to issues in philosophy of science. I thought it stumbled regarding Kuhn and critics of sociobiology, but given its compactness, it's probably the best possible book that could have been written."
59,0192802836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18655945-krish,5,This book sparked a lot of insightful thoughts which I hoped could've been introduced in high school Math and Physics classes. It is definitely a great starting point; now I have a lot of references and further reading topics I want to delve into.
