0,0674026594,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3038974-steve-van-slyke,3,"First, I think the subtitle ""Ten Billion Years in the life of our Planet"" is a bit misleading. From the main title I assumed it was about plate tectonics, which it is, but I then assumed from the subtitle that the story would take us from the formation of the earth almost 5 billion years ago, and then project what would happen in the next 5 billion years. That latter part never really happens although there is a brief section about what the likely scenarios are for the next collison of continents within the next 500 million years or so.A better title-subtitle might have been: SupercontinentS, And the Scientists Who Built Them. A lot of the story is not so much about the theory of plate tectonics, which at times is a bit thin, but more so about the various scientists and personalities that came up with the ideas that continents could move, and eventually how they moved.There were many interesting parts of the book, but if I had to choose another book on more less the same topic I would pick Richard Fortey's Earth: An Intimate History. Still, for plate tectonics geeks like myself I would recommend giving this one a look as well."
1,0674026594,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53458752-scot-parker,4,"I'm giving this book 5 stars, though I was tempted to only give 4 for a couple reasons. First, as other reviewers have said, this book doesn't really cover 10 billion years in the life of our planet. Nield doesn't really talk much about Earth's origins and the (brief) period up to the formation of the oceans, and he doesn't really talk much about the future beyond about 250 million years when the next supercontinent is projected to form. At best this book covers 4.5 billion years in the life of our planet, not 10. Nield also makes, in my opinion, a pretty egregious mistake towards the end of the book by stating that Earth's present atmosphere contains 16% oxygen. I tend to believe that this is a typo and not a true mistake because earlier in the book while discussing prehistoric trends in oxygen concentration in our atmosphere, he does imply the correct figure.Those negatives aside, I found the book engrossing, though as a geoscientist myself I may be a bit biased. Nield gives a pretty solid overview of the history of modern geology, covering the (to me) riveting controversy that the theory of continental drift faced in the geologic community and fascinating microbiographies of notable geologists throughout history. He gives the lay reader a solid overview of our current knowledge of plate tectonics and of the supercontinent cycle. He discusses in a fair amount of detail the formation and breakup of Pangaea and Rodinia but discusses the older supercontinents in much less detail (in large part because not much is known about them.) He presents a lot of interesting information about the Earth's past climates and delves into some interesting modern theories of past climates, such as the snowball earth. He shows throughout the book how the geosphere is connected with the other components of the Earth system - the hydrosphere, biosphere, and atmosphere.The bottom line - if you're looking for a book that covers 10 billion years of Earth's past and future, this is not the book for you. If you are looking for a great book that provides an overview of Earth's geologic history and of the history of geology as a field of study that's written in an engaging and accessible style, then absolutely give this one a go."
2,0674026594,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8490329-janta,4,"I feel like the subtitle of this book is a hair misleading; it's not precisely about the life of our planet, but more about how scientists developed the theory of continental drift and how they were able to gather the evidence to prove it. The author has a very readable style, and there is quite a bit of...not levity, exactly, but a way of making the scientists he discusses seem like actual people: we often get mentions of these scientists' personal lives and their abilities beyond analyzing data. I liked that about this book. There's a strong sense of the importance of science not just for its own sake or the sake of answering some esoteric question, but because it can, and does, provide real, tangible benefit to humanity. "
3,0674026594,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4534780-alina,4,"Though I love science, geology does not usually draw my interest. Who wants to read about rocks? Not me. On the other hand, who can resist a Lost Continent? This book manages to imbue the subject of geology with Lost Continent levels of glamor. Only in a few instances does the author delve too far into rock talk for my taste. Each chapter is a well-written, entertaining essay on a topic related to continental drift. The author tackles the history of the theory's development, the geological mechanisms involved, and reconstructions of past incarnations of the Earth. He explores all the lore of lost continents -- both the real ones, like Pangea, and the imaginary ones like Mu, Lemuria, and Atlantis. One of the things I learned is why so many lost continents loom out of the mystical mists. Except for Atlantis, their origins lie in the nineteenth century. Before continental drift became an established theory, the notion of sunken continents was a scientifically respectable way to explain the geological and biological links between areas of the world now sundered by ocean. More planetology than geology, this book offers a lively and informative treatment of Earth's story and the scientists who dug it up."
4,0674026594,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80750585-claudia,4,"It has become common knowledge that the solid ground beneath our feet is actually moving. Moving at the speed that our human fingernails grow (average 36 millimeters a year or about 1.5 inches), our human attention span can't visualize it. It took scientists until the 20th century, to even admit that plate tectonics was even a legitimate science. Supercontinents are what happens when all the surface land aggregates into one large continent. It's happened several times in the long life of planet Earth - land masses fusing together and fragmenting again and again. Only one - the most recent Pangea formed from the two former supercontinents of Laurasia and Gondwana - do scientists have a firm idea of how it broke apart. The older ones - Pannotia; Rodinia, Columbia/Nuna; Ur and others - have only fragmental evidence of their existence.Dr. Nield explains various varieties of the Earth (snowball Earth; rust Earth; 'lasagna world') and how the 'supercontinents' could have affected developing life as well as causing mass extinctions and climatic changes. He also introduces us to the many scientists/geologists whose work eventually developed into the science of plate tectonics. How an idea and need for an explanation - working even against the status quo - can eventually lead to answers. No matter how outlandish.In the end, Dr. Nield does seem to have dug out the proverbial soapbox to say that the Earth does not belong to us humans but we are merely a part of the Earth's story. 2019-038"
5,0674026594,http://goodreads.com/user/show/109086293-adam-nowicki,3,"The first half of Supercontinent is an engaging read, that looks at the theories surrounding supercontinents before the idea that continents could move became common place. The misconceptions by early scientists (and some clearly crazy people) are fascinating. The second half of the book, however, is a bit too overwritten for my taste, resulting in interesting subject matter that is interspersed by quite a bit of droning.Overwritten is probably the biggest criticism I have for this book, as unnecessary detail is put into describing geologists, or extended analogies. For me, I do not need to know how a certain geologist turned heads and commanded a room with his mere presence. Additionally, the ponderous beginning to the book with an extended spaceship story, with what amounts to an extraordinarily weak twist left me wondering why it was included at all.I learned a lot about the Supercontinent cycle, as well as Pangea, Rodina, and Ur, plus the fake continents of Mu, Lemuria, and other lost worlds was fascinating. Describing the history of earth and the various ages and world-states and how they affected the continents was also interesting. Unfortunately, I found myself skimming more than once, and had to go back to reread just to make sure I was reading everything.Overall, the content was great, and I feel more informed about the topic. I also feel that a solid 50-70 pages could have been scrapped and I would not have missed anything. "
6,0674026594,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20954866-travis,3,"The best parts of this book are the vividly described scenes of potential past and future Earths and the fascinating and perhaps unrepeatable conditions they exhibit, from geology to climate. Unfortunately the greater part of the book is taken up with a description of the historical development of the idea of continental drift, and especially the key players in imagining and researching this idea. This is interesting in its own way, but it doesn't speak to me the same as an evocative description of something like southern Gondwanaland, dark for half the year, then lashed by mega-monsoons powered by wind and ocean currents spanning most of the globe, dumping rain onto forests of fern trees that are no longer to be seen; or of low, hot desert being flooded in a matter of months by an inrushing sea as distant land forms slowly and catastrophically rift apart. Just a map, or even just a vivid description, of these imagined geologies is somehow evocative to the imagination, and I wish there had been more of it in the book. Probably some bias in that I read this book on the recommendation of some blogs that sited exactly that description of mega-monsoons, and the idea of climate patterns and ecosystems that no longer exist, nor even can exist in the world as it is now. Still worth reading for those images though."
7,0674026594,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1826775-a-reader,3,"What happens to usIs irrelevant to the world’s geologyBut what happens to the world’s geologyIs not irrelevant to us Hugh MacDiamidScience has been trying to humble the hubris of humans from the start, in a series of what Sigmund Freud refereed as ‘dethronements’. The first dethronement was of the Earth as the centre of the universe. Second was our dethronement as a unique creation in the image of God. Third (in Freud’s op;inion was his demystification of the human mind’s deepest motivations.Science is not often thanked for delivered such slights to our collective ego; though in fact these blows have been nothing like crushing enough. For when, we find ourselves standing on the brick of destruction it will be our arrogance, as much as the ignorance on which it feeds, that will prove our undoing. Science cannot tell us everything that matters about being human, but it provides us with the only practical knowledge of the natural world in which we have any reason to believe. But science teaches us another important lesson – that there is no absolute knowledge of any kind - either about Earth, or anything else.----------Earth scientists often complain, with reason, that politicians underuse the full potential of their subject, especially for the benefit of the vulnerable (for which read ‘poor’) people living in unsafe housing in unstable places. But in dramatic situations, like the 2004 tsunami’s aftermath this feeling to a pitch higher than mere frustration. That feeling is despair: that the world is still so ruled by the short-term, by superstition, inertia and irrationality, and their humane, possibilist long-term view of the world in not only ignored but even denied. "
8,0674026594,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3797146-joshua,3,"After doing a fairly interesting and enjoyable substitute lesson on the age of the Earth, I was left wondering why we bother to teach things like plate tectonics to middle school kids; what's the usefulness of it?This book peripherally addresses that issue in the introduction and conclusion with the specific example of tsunami preparedness and the more general argument that unguided science often comes to useful application in time.The geologic history of the Earth in it's many supercontinent configurations, most of which were new to me, and the complimentary history of science of geology itself was very interesting and engaging. I did get just a little over my head in scientific terminology towards the end of the book, around the discussion of fractionation.Separate from the merits of writing style and clear presentation of the science, I was a bit put off by the author's antagonism of religion. I'm not sure if it was solely New Earth Creationist Christians, or Christians in general, or all religion that the author had an issue with, but I think he overstepped his legitimate expression of dislike by characterizing his generally defined religious opposition as designed solely to enslave.On the whole a nice book about the deep time history of Earth and geology, with a little bit of vitriol thrown in."
9,0674026594,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1441633-glenn,4,"If this were merely a book about the history of the always evolving Supercontinent theory, it would have been a competent history but little more. What Hield has done is cleverly used the history of Supercontinent theory as a framework within which to dive in to other fascinating Earth History/Geology discoveries and theories throughout the years. The Supercontinent idea is interesting on its face, but probably doesn't require ~250 pages to explain to an intelligent reader interested in Earth Science. Nield apparently possess an ability to sense when the reader's attention will fade from one topic and desire another. Each time I was getting tired or bored with one sub-plot within the Supercontinent story the story quickly changed direction to another new yet relevant sub-plot. As a 1st semester Geology graduate student I found this book very readable. I still believe that non-geologists would enjoy this book if they are at all interested in Earth History. "
10,0674026594,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47610285-andrew-cheng,4,"This non-fiction book addresses how our planet has evolved over the history of its lifetime. The author explains the geological cycle and in light of this vastness of earth’s history, it is difficult to feel significant as humans are most likely going to be extinct by the time the current one ends. I believe he does an excellent job educating his readers about supercontinents and plate tectonics. Alongside this, he explains everything needed to understand the ideas being shown. However, sometimes the explanations do get long and one can find him/herself a bit lost on what the main idea is. I would recommend this book to somebody who is willing and interested in learning about many different concepts that support one large concept."
11,0674026594,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2419499-liz,3,"This isn't a topic that I can say truly, honestly interests me. I'm not big on geology. It just doesn't grab me. So because of this, I tuned out while reading some of this book, particularly when Nield was talking about various chemicals and chemical bonds. So for those of you looking for an analysis on the correctness of this book... uh, I'm sorry. It was good, though, I'll give Nield that. For the most part I could understand what he was talking about. Would I read another one of Nield's works? Maybe, if there wasn't so much chemical analysis in it. But it was good to read, and I learnt a bit."
12,0674026594,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1859006-john,3,"An excellent summary of how and why the continents have shifted and continue shifting, and how theories about supaercontinents emerged. Especially in the early parts of the book, however, the author's slightly flippant tone and penchant for telling stories about the lives of the scientists involved can be rather irritating, and I must admit to flicking through some of these sections. Verdict: far less learned than Richard Fortey's 'Earth: An intimate history', but also more accessible."
13,0674026594,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5974776-graham-tapper,0,"Neild delivers an engrossing history of the Earth and just how the bits on which we float happened to get to where they are today. He also discusses what might happen next and how long it will take for all the bits to join up once again, and in what order. His explanation of Continental Drift and Tectonic Plate activity is amusing, educating but very readable. He even manages to get a dig in at the Creationists and their wacky dogma."
14,0674026594,http://goodreads.com/user/show/749664-pastallreason,4,"Nield's book is directed towards the layperson interested in geology, the history and future of the planet. Not only does he cover his subject with easy expertise, he relates it to current happenings, i.e. the significance of the Boxing Day tsunami. As icing on the cake, the book is written with great humor. Douglas Adams' work makes a frequent appearance in the book. This is a great read for inquiring minds."
15,0674026594,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3265556-converse,3,"Book is mainly about supercontinents, which arise when plate tectonics brings all of the continents together to form one landmass. The author starts with the relatively recent Pangea, the earlier Rodinia, and the first, Ur. The author also discusses how the location of Rodinia led to snowball earth (it appears that at one point the earth's surface froze, either all the way or leaving a band of unfrozen water around the equator) which begat complex life. "
16,0674026594,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15843630-stephen-dawson,4,"Really fascinating - and a story which is a great monument to humans' ingenuity in piecing bits of information together to reveal an ever-more-detailed history of the Earth.A few more pictures would have been worthwhile, and the 10 billion of the title isn't really what it is about (5 billion would have been more accurate). But those are minor quibbles - a grand story, well told."
17,0674026594,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4131417-kirsten,3,"I thought this book was very interesting, but at times scattered and ADD. The author would start to talk about a topic, then change to another with little to no warning. On top of that, he would weave random stories and suppositions into the mix. I would have rated this book much higher if it were organized better and a little less like what I imagine a geologic acid trip would be like."
18,0674026594,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8169566-rachael,4,Fascinating read for science lover and lay person alike dealing with the science and history of plate tectonics from the dawn of the Earths beginning to it's possible future. Accessible and thoroughly enjoyable.
19,0674026594,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13065012-mark-edon,4,"I really enjoyed the mix of history of science and science. There are also flashes of a soaring, poetic and moving sense of perspective. I already know that I find geology fascinating, perhaps if you don't you won't enjoy this as much as I did."
20,0674026594,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11889175-christopher,4,"I have recently become fascinated with plate tectonics and this fits the bill nicely. Largely traveling back in time in reverse order the book explores the discoveries of our planets mobile past both scientifically, and often, how it was interpreted creatively."
21,0674026594,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1466725-marrije,4,Wow. Deep time is mind-blowing. 
22,0674026594,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4471243-shane-o-reilly,4,"Thought-provoking, entertaining and informal book about the evolution of Earth and the scientists and discoveries that pieced/are piecing it all together. Recommended."
