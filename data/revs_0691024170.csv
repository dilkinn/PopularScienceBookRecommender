Well, it is, but that that's not what it really is. Really, it's a love letter to a dead woman. Feynman says in his introduction that his friend Alix Mautner had always wanted him to explain quantum electrodynamics to her so that she could understand it, and he'd never gotten around to doing that. Now it was too late. But, somehow, you can see that that only made him want to do it, not just well (he did everything well), but perfectly. If the book was perfect, that would make up for its appearing after Alix was no longer around to read it. It may seem like an odd formula, but it worked for Dante, and it also worked for Feynman.The rest of this review is available elsewhere (the location cannot be given for Goodreads policy reasons) "
1,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70459127-tara,5,"My reaction upon finishing this book:(Any excuse for a Breaking Bad reference.)Seriously, though, this is one of the best pop science books I’ve yet encountered. I read Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!: Adventures of a Curious Character last year, and was thoroughly impressed by Feynman’s animated personality and his passion for physics. Now I find myself even more impressed by his exceptional teaching ability. QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter is a collection of 4 lectures he gave to the general public on the subject of quantum electrodynamics. The book is intended for laypeople, is written in very accessible language, and provides “Feynman diagrams” instead of advanced mathematical formulae. A rather lengthy summary of these fascinating lectures follows. If you don’t want any spoilers, or whatever you want to call them, then skip ahead to the final paragraph.The first lecture deals with photons, and how light behaves like particles. This is discussed in detail w.r.t. the partial reflection of monochrome light by glass. There’s already some fascinating shit right here, let me tell you! See, physicists can’t predict which photons will get reflected and which will pass through the glass. All they can tell you is the overall probability that it will happen. In other words, “identical photons are always coming down in the same direction to the same piece of glass,” and this somehow winds up “producing different results” each time. Who knew that “partial reflection by a single surface” was a “deep mystery and a difficult problem”?! Bizarre.Feynman then teaches us how to calculate the probability of photons bouncing off either the front or the back surface of sheets of glass of varying thickness. The lecture concludes with a discussion of iridescence (the colors produced by the reflection of white light by two surfaces). Neat-o.In the second lecture, Feynman uses QED to explain why, when light reflects off a mirror, the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. This is weirder than you might assume. (Actually, “weirder than you’d assume” sums up the entire book remarkably well!) The phenomenon discussed here is also the basis for diffraction gratings. Then he covers how light travels from air into water, and what causes mirages. Feynman goes on to explain why light appears to travel in straight lines. Incredibly, it behaves as such only when you give it enough wiggle room, so to speak. For “when you try to squeeze light [or restrict its path] too much to make sure it’s going in only a straight line, it refuses to cooperate and begins to spread out.” This is not altogether dissimilar to the behavior of surly teenagers. Perhaps we can reasonably refer to them as “little rays of sunshine” in an unironic fashion from now on! :D Bad joke, sorry. Anyway, the manner in which focusing lenses work is next revealed, and the lecture concludes with how quantum theory calculates the probability of compound events.The third lecture introduces electrons, which behave similarly to photons: somewhat like waves, somewhat like particles. (Feynman jokes about “wavicles,” a term I actually love to death, and will enthusiastically champion from now on!) We learn of the three basic actions from which all the phenomena of light and electrons arise: 1) photons rollicking about, 2) electrons rollicking about, and 3) electrons emitting or absorbing photons. As per the first item, we learn that “light doesn’t go only at the speed of light.” So yeah, that happens. It’s anarchy, I tell you! Madness! And the third action is even stranger. Hint: time travel may or may not be involved. Oh, you beautiful, depraved little positrons, you.Next, Feynman covers how electrons behave in atoms. He re-examines the partial reflection of light from glass in far greater detail than he did earlier, and we can now see why the former simplification was in fact warranted. (We previously treated light as reflecting from the “front” and ”back” surfaces of a sheet of glass, as opposed to what light actually does, which is to be scattered by the electrons inside the glass.) This scattering is also the reason light appears to move more slowly in glass or water than it does in a vacuum or in air. Also of interest is how lasers work: photons tend to go to the same point in space-time. (These lunatics are predisposed to travel in packs!) It turns out the reverse is true for electrons. Their aversion to one another is known as the “Exclusion Principle,” and helps explain chemical properties of atoms. Before finishing the lecture by discussing polarization, Feynman examines the complexity of the magnetic moments of electrons. This is fairly bananas, even considering the fact that the entire book is pretty much out to lunch. Here is what can happen: an “electron goes along for a while and suddenly emits a photon; then (horrors!) it absorbs its own photon. Perhaps there’s something ‘immoral’ about that, but the electron does it!” (You really have to love his sense of humor.) I’ve included some Feynman diagrams which depict this wanton immorality:The fourth and final lecture deals with some problems associated with quantum theory. It also looks at the relation of QED to the rest of physics, and includes a discussion of fundamental particles such as quarks and gluons, to name but a couple.Overall, this short book is packed full of mind-blowing information. I really appreciated all of the helpful diagrams that illustrate the very peculiar concepts under discussion. Also, Feynman is an excellent teacher. I just loved his occasional bursts of exuberance and humor. His enthusiasm for his subject is irresistible, his subject itself truly extraordinary."

I love this area of physics and I think it’s wonderful: it is called quantum electrodynamics, or QED for short.
I love this book and I think it’s wonderful: it is called QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter, or QED for short.  I feel as though I’ve been searching for this book for a long time, and now I’ve finally found it. In scarcely 150 pages, Feynman takes you inside the logic of this famously obscure subject. What was before unintelligible is breezy in Feynman’s hands. What had before seemed impossible and bizarre of the physical world—particles behaving like waves, going back in time, eluding measurement—is, in Feynman’s presentation, just Nature being goofy. So here’s the mystery. Newton proposed, in his Opticks, that light is corpuscular, or comes in little packets like raindrops. But it was later observed that light can interfere with itself, so it must be a wave. (For a while, English physicists were loath to admit that Newton could be wrong.) Then experimenters ran into trouble again when they discovered that if you take an extremely dim light and aim it at a detector, you don’t get one continuous signal, but a series of beeps and pauses like Morse code. So it appears that light comes in packets after all. But wait! In certain circumstances, if you shoot these particles one-by-one, you get an interference pattern like a wave. So light was both a particle and a wave? How was that possible? Feynman begins by saying that this question—How is this possible?—isn’t the right one to ask. Physics is an experimental science, so its task is to come up with a theory that will make predictions that agree with experiments, not to resolve philosophical paradoxes. In this book, that’s just what he does: he explains what physicists are doing when they are making these predictions. To do this, he must delve into the math. But he does not wish to explain how his graduate students do it (which wouldn’t be feasible in a book of this size, anyway), but to explain what is going on behind the scenes when they do these calculations. It’s like teaching children to add with pebbles rather than on paper. Feynman begins by telling us that, in quantum physics, we calculate probabilities, not certainties. That’s a bit disappointing, but that’s the way nature is. So when a physicist is calculating the probability that a photon will pass through or reflect off a pane of glass, they use “probability amplitudes,” which can sometimes reinforce and sometimes cancel one another. With this method, we can predict how many photons out of 100 will reflect, and how many will pass through. Not only that, but we can also deduce the wavelike properties of photons interacting with electrons to astounding levels of accuracy—so accurate that if you were measuring the distance from New York to Los Angeles, the uncertainty would be equivalent to the width of a hair. So as far as scientific theories go, QED is pretty dang good.  But what are “probability amplitudes” in reality? It seems a bit cheap at first, like Feynman merely found a clever way to talk about particles as waves without having to use the word “wave.” Feynman describes how to calculate the answer by picturing the particle as having a little clock hand that spins extremely fast, giving you an angle. In the end, two arrows (the amplitudes) are added up, the result is squared, and there’s your answer—a percentage. But what is really going on down there when the photon is traveling from the light source to the detector? What is happening before our measurements? Surely, there are no clock-hands attached to the particles. What's the mechanism behind all this?Of course, this is the kind of questioning that Feynman discourages. In his words:So this framework of amplitudes has no experimental doubt about it: you can have all the philosophical worries you want as to what the amplitudes mean (if, indeed, they mean anything at all), but because physics is an experimental science and the framework agrees with experiment, it’s good enough for us so far.So, really, there’s no way of knowing what’s going on before the particle is detected, since it is, in principle, undetectable. And in science, only things that can be measured are real. All of the stuff used to obtain the answer is just an intellectual apparatus, a tool for calculation. Yet it’s hard to be as content with this as Feynman. If you wanted to learn how a car works, you’d want to know what’s going on in the engine, the transmission, the steering and braking. If somebody told you, “It works by turning the key and stepping on the gas,” you’d feel like you were cheated. But this is what we must do in QED. Nature doesn’t allow us to look under the hood. We can step on the gas and the thing moves; we can come up with an equation that helps us predict how fast the car will go depending on how much we press on the pedal. But what makes it go? Who knows? As Feynman said:It is my task to convince you not to turn away because you don’t understand it. You see, my physics students don’t understand it either. That is because I don’t understand it. Nobody does."

I took this photo when I was about half way through the book. It shows a picture of a CD [click to enlarge]. It's been illuminated by an ordinary office lamp and the flashlight from my camera. I knew about this ""rainbow"" effect for a long time, but I didn't know exactly how it is created. This book gives some answers.To write a successful book like QED (short for Quantum Electro-Dynamics) two prerequisites are required: 1) The author must know a great deal about the subject matter, and 2) He must love his work. Only then it is possible to explain the theory of QED to laypersons like me. Richard Feynman obviously fulfilled both of these conditions. For one he virtually ""invented"" Quantum Electro-Dynamics (and received the Nobel Prize for physics for it in 1940) and secondly you can clearly sense his deep affection for the nature of objects and processes in the realm of the very very very small things, that is the quantum world.Instead of bothering the reader with mathematical formulas like this......Feynman developed a rather ingenious way of explaining the interaction of light particles (photons) and electrons (and later other particles too) using diagrams like this:All those little arrows are of the utmost importance because they represent what is called ""probability amplitudes"" for an event. The longer the arrow the more likely the event. In fact all we have to do–in theory–is to draw all possible little arrows on a piece of paper to explain almost any phenomenon concerning light that we can observe in nature. Don't ask me why that is. In fact even Richard Feynman couldn't answer the ""why"", only the ""how"". That's the charming thing about quantum theory. It has to be pointed out that this way of dealing with quantum effects is not a deviation from the truth (as far as anyone knows the truth). Other popular science books make things too easy and thereby achieve simplicity only for the price of a somewhat distorted truth. Not so here!But don't think that this drawing of arrows (and then later in the book what is called the ""Feynman diagrams"") is very simple. There are quite some things to consider, and the text is pretty dense. Anthony Zee, a Chinese American physicist, wrote in his introduction to QED:[...] you must mull over each sentence carefully and try hard to understand what Feynman is saying before moving on. Otherwise, I guarantee that you will be hopelessly lost. It is the physics that is bizarre, not the presentation.I have to agree to that. Whenever I came to a point where Feynman lost me I skipped back a few pages and read it again....and again, until I made sense of it (as much sense as was possible for me). I think I understood the majority of this book, I just haven't internalized it. Not yet anyway. Maybe I have to read the whole book again after a couple of weeks. Until then I keep a quantum of solace that we (the humankind) are by now advanced enough to understand what make these cool ""rainbow things"" on CDs.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the very foundation of what makes the world work the way it does.

I put on Cosmos while I clean the house, snatch up Michio Kaku's books like they won't be there tomorrow, know all the words to every Symphony of Science song ever, and follow Neil deGrasse Tyson on Twitter--but that doesn't mean I know the first thing about real science. I couldn't solve a linear algebraic equation even if the world depended on it (sorry, world). Instead, I revere famous physicists from afar while most women my age drool over movie stars like What's-His-Face. You know the one. That really hott one.Anyway. Richard Feynman is definitely in the top five on my list of favorite physicists. (Yep, I have a list. Expect nothing less from a girl who named her cat Sagan.) I love Feynman's sense of humor and his whimsical world-view. He may be gone, but he's not forgotten. So when I had a stupid question about light, I figured it was high time I read his book on the subject. My stupid question goes like this: Why is it that, when you turn off a light, the room immediately goes dark? Where does the light go? Why doesn't it bounce around the room for a bit before dispersing? If light is everywhere, why is the universe so dark?Well, this book didn't really help me answer those questions. If Feynman taught me anything here, it's that light is the honey badger of particles: it does what it wants, and leaves tiny arrows in its wake. Or something. I'm not sure. "
5,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44824883-paul-e-morph,5,"Richard Feynman's friend Alix had asked him to explain Quantum Electrodynamics (the titular QED) to her in a way a layman could understand many times. Heartbreakingly, it wasn't until her death that he actually found the time to write a series of four lectures that would do just that. This book is a (slightly edited) transcript of those four lectures.Feynman writes for the layman without ever being condescending and his famous sense of humour shines through. He makes this subject both approachable and fascinating. I've studied much of the content before in physics classes and other books but Feynman has made me look at it in a different way. In fact, I can safely say that this book has significantly changed the way I think about reality.If that's not worth five stars, nothing is. If you've not read this book before, do yourself a favour and give it a bash."
6,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12933866-edward,5,"QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter is an outstanding book on a subject that is often overlooked or glossed-over in many popular physics books. Feynman does a deep dive on Quantum Electrodynamics: a theory that deals not only with the various interactions between light and matter, but which can be applied to every area of physics with the exception of gravitation and nuclear physics.The theory of QED is fascinating, both in its explanatory power and its elegance. Using only a handful of conceptual tools, and working with just two fundamental particles - the photon and electron - it can describe phenomena as varied as reflection and refraction of light, changes in the speed of light through different mediums, quantum interference, lenses (I found the application of QED to this seemingly mundane property of glass to be particularly mind-blowing), and even suggests how all the diverse properties of the elements arise from only three basic actions performed by these two fundamental particles. To say that this book changed the way I see the world is only a slight overstatement - it has certainly opened my eyes. QED is an absolute must-read for anyone with an interest in physics. Feynman takes great pains to present the theory in a clear and logical way, and while the subject is challenging, it is utterly comprehensible from cover to cover. This is by far the best popular science book I've read in a long time - I cannot recommend it highly enough. "
7,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47021487-jose-moa,5,"Wonderful,Feynman is a genius of popularization,without a mathematical expression has achieved the goal of give the rigurous quantum electrodinamics fundaments of geometric and physical optics,is to say,refraction,refraction index,reflexion, difraction ,converging lenses,classic Fermats principle of minimun time in path light and so on.He uses arrows to represent complex numbers in complex plane,with its modules and phases and uses sums and products of histories in the propagation of the photon as sums and products of this arrows to obtain the final amplitude.Also he explains the bizarre and incomprehensible behavior of the photon as it explores all ways each one with it own phase and in the sum the major contribution is of similar to classical path of mínimum time.Also the strange property of a photon or electron that in the doublé slit experiment is able of have interference with itself.In the next chapter,explains his diagrams,how to calculate each piece,the propagation piece and the vertex piece,also the radiative serie of corrections,succesful in explanation of the magnetic moment of the electron and also with a diagram explains very well as a positrón can be viewed as a electron going backwards in time.In the last chapter explains the only ugly aspect of the theory,the problem of the infinities and the renormalization solution,ends with a brief account of the standard model.He also makes a deep reflection in the sense that the complex amplitudes has no physical meaning and that the deep work of the theory is incomprehensible,the idea is that we dont know the true working of reality,only knows the model we make,the reality has a behavior as the model predicts but no more,our model is a simulation of reality and we only can know that simulation.A masterpiece of science popularization,strongly recomended to those that want to have a taste of the deep conceps and strangeness of the quantum world reality"
8,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7552897-sebastian,5,"Throughout the years of reading both popular and less-popular science, I’ve kind of steered clear of Richard Feynman. The main reason is that what others describe as a “larger than life persona” I tend to describe as really bloody annoying, what with his bongos and womanizing and oh-so-clever quips where he always gets the upper hand with the old and rusty physics establishment. Having now fought my way through QED, I can see that this may have been a mistake. My annoyance with his autobiographical works has kept me away from some truly gorgeous scientific writing.The thing is, I’m not sure if it is even possible to explain quantum mechanics properly without all the higher math, but if it is possible, this is likely the only proper way – with a lot of “this is how it is, and don’t ask why, because even we, physicists, do not know”, and a lot of weird and unexpected analogies, such as his substitution of “little clock hands” for the harmonic oscillator that pops up every which way in QM. The only problem I had was that knowing the “proper” theory it took me a while to fully intuitively accept and adopt his “tiny clocks running” description and match it with the complex numbers/oscillators he is describing in this roundabout fashion. However, once that clicked into place, his descriptions of simple everyday phenomena, such as reflection and diffraction, the two-slit experiment, and later on the interaction of electrons and photons, really popped off of the page and sort of “broadened the groove” wherein all the counter-intuitiveness of QM is trying to get a foothold in my brain."
9,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,5,I remember reading this book as a physics undergrad and not quite getting it. I get more of it and have a better understanding of why parts of it are hard to get. Feynman does a great job with his deceptively simple book on something that defies our common sense. Having learned more and read more since then I understand more but there are still some deeply weird things about Quantum Electrodynamics. Recommended because Feynman is a great expositor as well as a hugely important physicist of the 20th century.
10,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9310150-quiver,5,"That's my position: I'm going to explain to you what the physicists are doing when they are predicting how Nature will behave, but I'm not going to teach you any tricks so you can do it efficiently.Starting from the idea of photons as particles of light, Feynman develops a nontechnical, easily understandable theory of basic quantum electrodynamics, or QED. He uses it to give modern explanations of everyday phenomena such as reflection and refraction, before delving into the basic of electron-photon interactions (the so-called Feynman diagrams) which underly all phenomena except gravity and nuclear physics. No maths is involved, though he uses pictures creatively. In the final lecture, he talks about the experimental aspects and the cutting-edge developments of his time (gluons, quarks, chromodynamics etc).If all sciences were so well explained in so few words with so much good will and humour, the ideas and intuition behind humanity's greatest achievements would be accessible to a much wider audience."

Physics is not a subject I have a terribly good grasp on mainly because my eyes glaze over at the sight of advanced mathematical equations, however Feynman is a pretty great at making the complex subjects of particle physics and quantum mechanics intelligible to the layest of laypersons. Fortunately I also read this with able-minded people who translated the math into clearer ideas which of course opened things up to broader philosophical speculation--something I am pretty good with. The introduction to the book is also worth reading by itself at the very least.""I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics.""-Richard FeynmanHe was also a very funny and clever man who left behind a whole host of aphoristic gems, for instance: ""A poet once said, 'The whole universe is in a glass of wine.' We will probably never know in what sense he meant it, for poets do not write to be understood. But it is true that if we look at a glass of wine closely enough we see the entire universe. There are the things of physics: the twisting liquid which evaporates depending on the wind and weather, the reflection in the glass; and our imagination adds atoms. The glass is a distillation of the earth's rocks, and in its composition we see the secrets of the universe's age, and the evolution of stars. What strange array of chemicals are in the wine? How did they come to be? There are the ferments, the enzymes, the substrates, and the products. There in wine is found the great generalization; all life is fermentation. Nobody can discover the chemistry of wine without discovering, as did Louis Pasteur, the cause of much disease. How vivid is the claret, pressing its existence into the consciousness that watches it! If our small minds, for some convenience, divide this glass of wine, this universe, into parts -- physics, biology, geology, astronomy, psychology, and so on -- remember that nature does not know it! So let us put it all back together, not forgetting ultimately what it is for. Let it give us one more final pleasure; drink it and forget it all!"""
12,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22614612-caroline,4,"I've never seen something like this before! It explains the way quantum electrodynamics actually works (not just analogies), but without assuming any physics or math background. I would have been skeptical if the author were anyone other than Richard Feynman, but it's super well done. With my limited physics background, I found the explanations super clear, at least in the beginning.Some of my favorite parts: I learned that light doesn't always travel in a straight line or at the speed of light, but I also learned why paths where it doesn't won't be observed at macroscopic scales. I learned why puddles of oil make rainbows and what a diffraction grating is. And I learned why when light reflects off or travels through a piece of glass, we can treat it as only interacting with the two surfaces of the glass, even though actually it interacts with all the electrons inside.Towards the end, the explanations became less complete and didn't make as much sense to me. For example, Feynman says that in a hydrogen atom, ""by exchanging photons, the proton keeps the electron nearby"", but he didn't explain how exchanging photons would make it more likely that the electron stays near. Overall, though, this was well worth reading."

Feynman targets this book to, well, everyone. He holds your hand and shows how things work. Its a slow step by step process and if you invest some time, its highly rewarding and quite refreshing to be taught physics by a man who is long dead but doesn't really feel so when you read his words. You get transposed to his classroom as he explains basic concepts and the paradox surrounding the most natural thing in this world: light.Its a re-read which I enjoyed and will get on to re-reading some of his other famous lectures.

15,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,3,"In this series of short lectures, Feynman reduces (except for gravity and radioactivity) the whole of the universe to quantum electrodynamics or QED.* QED involves the relationship between photons (light) and electrons (matter), or quantum phenomena, the interaction of which (electrons emit/give up and absorb/get photons/particles of light) creates all of the atoms and elements in the universe. Feynman uses light’s refraction to illustrate the relationship between electrons and photons. To understand light, one has to lose “common sense,” he says. Light does strange things. We understand light not as specifically identified photon movement but in terms of probability. “I am not going to explain how the photons actually ‘decide’ whether to bounce back or go through [an opening]; that is not known,” he writes, and then adds, “(Probably the question has no meaning.)” Light seeks the fastest (shortest) route in its movement from A to B, but it borrows or uses paths that are adjacent. When light moves through a small opening, it also spreads out. In this regard, he writes that “light doesn’t really travel only in a straight line; it ‘smells’ the neighboring paths around it and uses a small core of nearby space.”Electron movement is strange as well. Electrons jump from one path to another and positive electrons (positrons) go backward in time. The book quickly gets technical. It is filled with Feynman diagrams and I can’t say I grasped much. Feynman is describing quantum phenomena but describing is different than understanding. “While I am describing to you how Nature works,” he writes, “you won’t understand why Nature works that way.” “My physics students don’t understand it….That is because I don’t understand it. Nobody does.” This makes his quote above, “Probably the question has no meaning,” particularly interesting as Feynman seems to be saying that, in the end, we can only describe how nature works, but not why it works the way it does. By extension, is Feynman saying that there are no ultimate explanations (e.g., God, Deist design) for the cosmos and how it operates, and that Nature just Is?*“The theory describes all the phenomena of the physical world except the gravitational effect, the thing that holds you in your seats,..and radioactive phenomena.” QED is “a horrible name,” Feynman concedes. The theory also describes what goes on inside the nucleus itself, which are the quarks and gluons, and involve some 400 (and counting) subparticles."
16,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4369018-lee,4,"This weekend just passed my flatmate's boyfriend was visiting. Being the inquisitive sort, at one point he asked me if I could explain the main results of my PhD thesis to him in terms he would understand. To my eternal shame my knee-jerk response was ""No."" But a few moments later I was to be found scrawling on a napkin, explaining rational points on curves, density arguments, counting functions, and concluding by using the word ""generalise"" far more times in one sentence than I was comfortable with.He seemed to follow my haphazard ramblings which is always enough to leave one chuffed. It's no secret to the science community that its biggest failing is an inability to communicate with and engage the public. The more esoteric the science, the trickier it is to convey it in terms that are both accurate and interesting. And, outside of pure mathematics, it doesn't get a great deal more esoteric than quantum mecahnics. So Richard Feynman's QED is laudable for, if nothing else, being about as understandable as is possible with this subject. There were times that the text lost me, but after giving it some thought I realised in each case that it was because I was expecting the quantum world to make sense, and to paraphrase my old Physics teacher: if quantum mechanics starts making sense, then you've stopped understanding it.Feynman's abilities as a scientific orator are pretty well known—one of my favourite videos on Youtube is a two-and-a-half minute video of Feynman sitting in a chair explaining how a train stays on the tracks. Seriously. Feynman's writing skills are apparently just as good, but I've not read any of his other books and this one is actually the edited transcriptions of four of his lectures, so his speaking prowess proves more useful here. And as if being fascinating, self-deprecating, and witty wasn't enough, he also manages to be quite touching. The lectures were the inaugural set in a series dedicated to Alix Mautner, an English major and long time friend of Feynman to whom the physicist had promised to explain quantum electrodynamics in terms she could understand. Sadly she died before he managed to do so, but the lectures here are, as he says, the ones he prepared for Alex, but that he could no longer give just to her."
17,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3030419-fraser-kinnear,5,"I think this is my favorite science book. This was in large part due to having Feynman's real voice in my head, as I've heard him often in recorded lectures and documentaries.The book is transcription of a few lectures Feynman gave on Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), a branch of quantum theory he and Dirac developed. Feynman introduces a few simple rules on how electrons and photons behave (which appear to be easy-to-digest analogs for vector calculus) and then off he goes, explaining the theory and how it describes an enormous amount of phenomena, such as the uncertainty principle, the how lenses and mirages physically work, how light scattering creates particles that travel backwards in time (via an antiparticle), why electrons stay in their orbits, lasers (exclusion principle). The only concept which I felt didn't come across quite so clearly was his discussion of spin. Once he is satisfied with the level of detail he gave to explaining QED, Feynman quickly runs through the rest of the menagerie of sub atomic particles, doing little more than listing them and noting that the toolkit from QED is useful in describing the interaction of quarks and gluons."
18,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30541335-jimmy-ele,5,"The particle view of physics and how Richard Feynman was able to explain all of the weird ways that light behaves was a thoroughly engrossing read. The intellectual feat that was performed by this man in creating a workable mathematics for the physics behind the way that light travels, and reflects is truly amazing. Using the simple concepts of rotation, spin, frequency, and depicting it all with some simple calculations involving arrows and simple algebra gave me a sense of awe at the simplicity of such a seemingly complicated subject. Even though I currently side with the field theory of Julian Schwinger, I must say that I can not blame anyone for using Q.E.D. as the model for their calculations. Overall, I had to place this on my foundation list, seeing as it gives me inspiration for explaining the seemingly complicated in very simple terms that can be easily understood by many. "
19,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8044071-dean-hamp,5,"I visited my brother a long time ago, when he was working on his Ph.D. in Physics. He tossed a small, innocuous-looking book to me and said, ""Read this - its a complete brain-f**k. I've been hooked ever since. QED is, by far, the best piece of non-fiction I have ever read. It takes a long time for me to work though the concepts, and, as Feynman points out, nobody (including me) (especially me) truly understands Quantum Electrodynamics. But to begin with adding 'damned little arrows' and take that to an all-encompassing description of atomic theory, accurate to ten decimal places, in about 120 pages, so the likes of me can follow along, is the purest of genius. Bravo!"

Alas, that's the nature of science popularization. If you omit math, the heart is gone, and you have to make do with the leftover shell. Feynman does the best job of leaving behind some substance that I've ever seen in such a book.Excellent pedagogy, and some great quotes."
21,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43451865-bishnu-bhatta-buttowski,5,"Seriously, I don't know how to write this review. I'd promise myself and you that I'll be updating this review as I begin to evolve my thought regarding this book and 'Theory of Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)'.Physics has become full of Mess, these recent days, since the discovery of quantum mechanics and perhaps you'd claim that Physics is Ugly.Well I couldn't agree with you more, but on the other hand, Physicist and the whole of the physics community have done the great job of correlating these mess into a beautiful picture like 'Theory of Quantum electrodynamics'. Since, this is my first encounter with quantum electrodynamics or typo of these advanced topic, so this review is purely based upon my reading this book.If this is your first time reading a book by Richard Feynman, assuming that you do have some good school or high school physics, I wouldn't recommend you to read 'Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! ', the reason being that I don't want you to have a picture of Feynman being animated personality and top class physicist. Rather, I want you to have this picture by understanding his way of explaining things and his excellent teaching style by reading this book. You'd be amazed how Feynman explains the interference and other several phenomena by simply the work of geometry-some arrows, their length and a stopwatch, whose revolving hand's speed can be changed :DLectures are really insightful. The main purpose of reading this book wouldn't be only to show off to someone that you've read 'QED' and know one or two things about this field, but to gain insightful way of carving wit out of complex topics like QED. I never would have thought about why we take a principle-reflecting of light on mirror-'the angle of reflection is equal to angle of incidence.'-the way it is. And like other cases that electron or photon doesn't travel only in straight lines to some destination but travel through every possible path, there is more to this principle that happens in real life. You'd ask why?And this is the reason why I want you to read this book.Feynman starts off the these lectures as these were intended for laymen, with simple ideas and tools, only to evolve these tools as the lectures progress so he could explain difficult topics like in the chapter 3 of this book: 'Electrons and their interactions'.Only thing that was difficult to grasp was chapter 4: 'Loose ends' that discusses the theory of strong interactions that discusses about the quarks (particles that make up electrons protons, etc), gluons (particles that are exchanged between quarks). I believe chapter 4 needs re-reading and referring to other books if one is interested in it.And last but not the least, I can't and shouldn't end this review not including at least a Feynman diagram, so here it goes."
22,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30276417-nancy-mills,5,"How can you not love Richard Feynman? This is as easy a lesson in quantum electrodynamics as you'll find, I think. Which is not to say ""easy,"" but painless to read and absorbable with enough concentration and/or re-reading of the harder parts. No more math than you are already familiar with, just kind of hard to wrap your mind around. I have often complained that I didn't ""believe in"" quantum theory because it doesn't make sense. It turns out that nobody understands WHY it works, but Dr. Feynman does explain HOW it works and the experimental evidence that PROVES it works. At the time of the writing, they were still working on it and as far as I know, they are still. It is vexing and puzzling but like it or not, it's life.There are 4 lectures on QED on Youtube with the infamous Dr. Feynman. If you don't even like math or science you will still love the good humored, enthusiastic and irresistibly adorable Nobel prize winner. Here's the link to the first: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLQ2a...Watch the lectures and read the book and you'll understand QED .... somewhat. Very fun, believe it or not."

The explanation is good, you can understand, you are able to imagine things and if you are really interested I believe you can make suppositions. But I am not. I read the book because it sounded interesting and I thought that after reading it I would be more able to understand things. I am not. What I knew, I know. Lots of formules - actually, I know something new: the way to calculate and that the result of an action is done by an arrow (which is the sum of tiny arrows, all the possible ways of an action). I think that this book would be very interesting for people really into the subject. "
24,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22476125-maanasa,5,"When I first heard of the two recent quantum physics mega-events--the discovery of the Higgs-Boson particle and the confirmation of the Inflation theory--I knew that these were events of massive import but I was woefully ill-equipped to understand the ""why"" of it. What began as a wikipedia binge of particle physics terms and definitions, became an attempt to understand the four fundamental forces, which then led me to Richard Feynman's QED. This book attempts to explain to the layperson one of the fundamental forces of nature--electromagnetism--and to give us a glimpse into the ways that light and matter interact to give rise to a host of derivative (in the non-science/math sense of the term) phenomena like optics, heat transfer, electricity, magnetism, etc.While the book doesn't have the ability to make theoretical physicists out of us all, it does help the reader see the outline of the bigger picture (or should I say the infinitesimally tiny picture). I think one of Feynman's biggest successes as a translator come through his ability to 1) find the right metaphors, and 2) state clearly which ideas he is simplifying and which ones he is ignoring in order to make the material digestible. Feynman's tone is humorous and his language pithy. The diagrams used to illustrate concepts are extremely helpful. I, for one, am very glad to have gotten a glimpse into this fundamental concept that governs the world that we live in through this well-presented and fun book.For those of you only interested in my view on the book, you can stop reading here. From this point on, I digress a little.I have often heard people brandish the line ""a little knowledge is a dangerous thing."" The origin of this line can be traced back to Alexander Pope's poem, ""Essay on Criticism,"" and is often spouted to support the proposition that one must abstain from learning unless they mean to go all the way. However, I have always found this to be an incredibly superficial (totally ironic, I know) reading of the line given the context in which it appears. The poem states: ""A little learning is a dang'rous thing; Drink deep, or taste not the Pierian spring (spring of inspiration and knowledge - from Greek mythology): There shallow draughts intoxicate the brain, And drinking largely sobers us again.""Within this context, it's clear that Pope isn't trying to tell us that spotting the tip of an iceberg itself is dangerous, but that spotting the tip without realizing that there is more to the iceberg than its tip is what is dangerous. I strongly believe that as long as a person is aware of how incomplete or superficial his/her learning is, s/he can steer clear of said ""danger"". It is not only OK, but recommended that we try to broaden the scope of our intellectual pursuits even if we do not have the necessary resources to deepen them. And this book perfectly furthers that goal."
25,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5526063-mary-jean-harris,5,"This book hits all the marks for a great novel. Yes, it's a science book, but it's probably one of the best ones I've read so far. Feynman has a fun style of writing and makes these topics very easy to understand. He really captures the wonder and excitement that new things in physics can offer. Even though I knew many of the things in the book already, I had never seen them presented in this way before, as in, explaining common phenomena like reflection and diffraction with the little ""arrows"" (which are actually imaginary numbers represented in the complex plane. I wouldn't have figured that out if the person who wrote the intro hadn't pointed it out though). I often thought ""oh! so that's what's going on!"" and ""why on Earth didn't they teach it this way in school?"" Though it does seem deceptively simple when you read it, and I know that there is much more going on ""behind the curtain"" that only the physicists know about.The first 2 chapters are on QED (quantum electrodynamics): the first on photons, the second on electrons, and the third chapter is on quantum chromodynamics (ie. the strong force with quarks and co.). The theory of QED is one of the few (the only?) theory that's pretty much completely known in physics with regards to experiment aligning with theory. We see in the last chapter just how much of a ""mess"" particle physics is in general, though I found this last part really interesting. I think we have figured out more things to sort out the mess since this book has been written, but there are certainly still challenges to overcome.The diagrams in the book were simple and illustrative, and made me glad that I got the print copy as opposed to the audiobook (they were lectures, but I assume there must have been slides too, because you really need to see the diagrams).I'd recommend this book to anyone interested in science and especially physics. I wouldn't say it is a book for the ""general public"", since some parts might be a bit too complicated, but anyone with at least high school physics should have no problem (though I'm biased, since I'm doing physics at university, so I might be wrong about that). Although this was written (or rather, the lectures were given) many decades ago, it still forms the basis of our understanding of QED, and Feynman diagrams and the little arrows are still used in physics all the time.The only downside of the book is that since these were 3 lectures, they are split into 3 humungous chapters, and it would have been better to have smaller chapters. Nevertheless, I really enjoyed this book and at the same time I could laugh out loud as well as learn lots as I read it."
26,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7031841-martin,4,"The guy that wrote the forward for the book seems to dislike Feynman from his personal experience and reputation. For example, he labels Feynman as a philanderer - which was a surprise to me as I was expecting a book more about physics than the physicist.Feynman is confident and flamboyant in his style, which is easy and enjoyable to read. He also seems exceptionally able to put himself into the mind of a non-expert and explain things appropriately.The book is based on 4 lectures explaining some 'strange' things about how photons and electrons interact. To compare its difficulty, I found it a lot easier than A Brief History of Time. I also found the first 3 lectures most enjoyable because Feynman slowly works through what he is explaining. The explanations for his figures are really helpful because they reiterate the main text explanations, which gives more opportunity to understand some of the crucial points.It was only in lecture 4 where he starts to try and cover the remaining 1% of physics that requires 20 times as many particles (I think that is how he expresses his aim for lecture 4), that the book becomes more like reading a physics exam guide with a little humour.Overall, Feynman has a very readable style and an amazing ability to explain complicated physics."
27,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1926890-shawn,3,"My biggest mistake here was reading this in small bursts. It was helpful to have things framed in layman's terms, but I still found myself not ""getting it"" at times, and I think that was probably because I was only reading it in short bursts and then not taking time to make sure I went back and really understood before forging onward. I did gain new insights and understanding into many details that were unknown to me about quantum electrodynamics, including some exposure to things like gluons, mesons, quarks, and such which I've heard of, but never really had much understanding of before. I think the reviews are high for this because the people likely to read this are physics majors and technical types--I think a broader sampling of non-technical readers would likely result in lower reviews because many people would still find it incomprehensible, despite Feynman's talent for making complex stuff understandable. If you are on the fence about reading this, consider browsing the Wikipedia entry on quantum electrodynamics which has a short section on ""Feynman's view of quantum electrodynamics."" It gives a short idea of what one will find in the book."
28,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8755528-siina,5,"I first read Ottaviani's biographical comic of Richard P. Feynman and that is how I got interested in quantum electrodynamics. I'm not really good when it comes to physics (I do love math), but light and lenses I have understood and enjoyed always. Thus getting my hands on this book was wonderful!Feynman explains quantum electrodynamics very clearly with a humorous twist. The book is logical and very well written altogether. The last chapter is the only somewhat hard part, since in that one Feynman tries to explain other fields of physics and how they interact with quantum electrodynamics. What makes it hard is that the chapter is short and just a peek. Feynman makes me believe that quantum electrodynamics is easy, but it tells more about Feynman's marvelousness than me. As a whole the book was amazing and I'm happy to have understood almost all - and let's face it, it's physics! "

And, of course, it's always a delight to spend time in the company of Richard Feynman, even if only as a reader. Judged against the many exceptional popular science books that have been published since, however, this one suffers in comparison. The subject matter is fascinating, the explication only so successful. The book is well worth reading, though, a) because its author was such a talented scientist and such a cool dude, b) because the author was himself a major contributor to the branch of physics it describes, and c) because the tack he takes is an unusual one for popular science treatments (and quite interesting).

I know that because I read the book very slowly and later on I even skipped some parts of the book. Nature is simple and very perplexing at the same time; And as Feynman said ""You see my physics students don't understand it... That is because I don't understand it"". LOL"

Instead, I read it primarily as a study in style and the clear expression of ideas, and on this front I wasn't disappointed. Widely praised for the clarity of his style, it felt effortless and welcoming, even to those — like me — who only have a vague knowledge of the outline of the theory. I came away thinking: ""why isn't writing in the humanities like this?""I confess that I began to get a bit hazy on the theory half-way through the second of the four lectures, and I found the specifics of the third lecture challenging. What I enjoyed about the book, though, was the sense that if I wanted to, I could re-read those sections, think about it, and I would be able to get a good handle of the complexities. I didn't feel that those sections were out of my reach, only that I needed to invest more time in grasping them. "

40,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18029970-bram-van-der-heijde,5,Actually this book should be ranked six stars or more. I have never read anything as inspiring and interesting as QED before. 
41,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40481325-bernardo,5,"In the beginning of QED, Richard Feynman says that people are always asking physicists about the new findings of a grand unified theory. He feels they should also be asked about known and confirmed theories instead of undercooked and partially analyzed ones. So he decides to speak about the “well dissected and marvelous” theory of QED. The theory describes the interactions between photos and electrons, space-time and probabilities, among others.The book is based on four conferences given by Richard Feynman in the 1980s. These were done in memory of a friend of his who had passed away, Alix Mautner. She had a career in english literature but was curious about physics and often asked him about quantum mechanics. He never had the chance to explain her the theory of quantum electrodynamics (QED), for which he was awarded a Nobel prize (alongside Schwinger and Tomonoga), and which he described as “the jewel of physics”.It’s remarkable how much content there is in this book, having only 150 pages or so. The explanations are easy, illustrated with a great amount of examples and figures, and may seem too simple at times, until Feynman shows the grand picture and demonstrates how brilliant physics is. He had the ability to make topics which could be seen as too complex become accessible.I was delighted to read this book, as there aren’t many books for non-physicists that mention QED. Feynman’s mix of humour and humility just improves the experience.This is a wonderful book and one couldn’t ask for a better teacher than Feynman. He reminds us that physics can be fun and inspiring."
42,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18521921-r-strange,5,"When I look at the political landscape in my country today, it just seems as though complexity is simply too much for human beings to even deal. But somehow, we have been able to survive, a few more generations anyway, with this wedge of complexity inserted into the good old pie of life as usual. That increase in complexity comes down to getting to know nature Herself. Nature is a She when the extraordinary science explainer Richard Feynman writes. He gives you the sense that She cannot be easily not fully understood by the likes of any mortal, even if you are one of us who has spent many years studying some part of her. He makes it clear, that it's perfectly alright to get lost in the details. But he is also convincing, and rightly, that if we could grasp even a small part of it through our efforts, it would blow our minds. QED is a slim book, limited to four lectures, designed for those of us who did not study a subject that can really only be understood if you study it. He chose the topics carefully, late in his life, to just open a single manageable can of worms and try to show the wonder, and how far from intuition the truth really can be. I am one of those readers that is ready to dive in a little more. Like someone that knows a few words of Spanish and can understand it ok, but has never seriously sat down to study exactly how these people are saying the same exact things we are but in a way that doesn't make sense. And an appropriate analogy, many of us make huge assumptions about how different someone who speaks another language is, simply because our intuition is not able to pierce the format of the information we are presented with. I have watched all the science shows on TV, and as I get older, I am trying to set aside some time to actually sit down with some scratch paper, and maybe just pick up a few of these wonders I've heard about, and really try to grasp the evidence, that they say is there for anyone that looks, but is so far from easy! I know the rules of nature are there, and the outcomes of them are detected by my senses everyday, but the rules just never make the front page of... well, our shared reality as human beings. These things they are finding make our reality, but about which we are more or less clueless, have really changed what it means to understand. There's understand, as in repeating what someone else is saying, which is more like being a parrot in terms of understanding. And there's understand, as grasping the proofs that convince all serious scientists completely no matter their country or language, because they are... proof! The most harmful politicians today argue about whether or not proven science is real, maybe just to protect some fossil fuel lawyers from liability they fudge the most basic statistics regarding global tempurature, or maybe just to get an angry mob going. So someone with that thick a head is not going to be interested in how we as humanity have taken certain mysteries about how Nature actually works, from three decimal places in accuracy, to six or seven, in one lifetime. But it is a big deal, and Feynman manages to lightly let on about that as perhaps more wondrous, than why glass only reflects one to four percent of light back, and never more no matter how much you change the thickness! This is actually a more astounding discovery by newton, in my opinion, than gravity, it's so weird! And so not clarifying, or reassuring... it just is. It is simply truth. Starting as a fresh graduate in Los Alamos serving during wartime, he's one of the good ones that turned beatnik, and generously devoted some of himself to the daunting task of trying to relate to the public that the real basics about our universe... are so complicated and not tidy, that it takes years just to be ready to talk about light.So, knowing all this, all I wanted was to have a few big Aha! moments, a few things to remind me that the nature of reality is itself mysterious, and big, and not at all as simple as my senses and my brain make it out to be. Maybe I needed this service, because I felt like I was losing some of my grip in terms of being up to speed with where we really are - no matter how many people want to yell and shout and send us back in time when the class quiz was easier... we really are uncovering astounding things and that sense of mystery makes life more tolerable somehow. He did not disappoint. Have you ever heard that nothing can go faster than the speed of light? It's not true - light can go faster or slower than the speed of light. And when it does... it turns in a particular direction! Indeed, particles and electrons and all that tiny stuff that makes up everything liquid, solid and airy, most of it has a habit of turning this way or that whenever it interacts, and swelling and shrinking a bit is also not uncommon, like a super tiny infinitely complex pinball machine that makes up... everything! So when a 'beam' of light moves through the atoms that make up the invisible air... it is really hitting electrons which will just absorb it, and then possibly, spit out a new photon heading in the same direction! And so something as simple as a little beam of light travelling a tiny distance, could be doing it in a million different possible ways with no way to predict it, because it is so beyond complicated! We really do occupy this priveleged perspective, where things seem mechanical, and clunky and solid, water pours, stone is heavy, air is transparent... but the truth, the Truth as in Natural truth... is simply beyond even the smartest brain's ability to estimate, and a computer can only estimate probability. One rock, seemingly dead and lifeless, is actually jam packed with spinning, turning, absorbing, light emitting electrons! It is heavy, because it is so packed with moving energy!And I really need this right now, when people are so committed to making us confused, and stuck, making us miss this miraculous realities we are translating into our limited languages, just so we will obey their lust for concentrating our attention into short term power, turning us all into rocks they can throw. I got four... four WOWs from this book. I can't promise I understood even a quarter of it perfectly, clearly, the way a student of physics can. But it's not a gloss, it's not cheap or just a tourist brochure, he really did try to be plain, and clear, about how complicated just one little piece of the rules of the universe - that of light - really is. It's wonderful, it grounds my sense of reality - that there is such a thing as Truth, and pretty much anything we think or feel or sense, especially anything that can be said in only one sentence... is more like whistling a little tune (or passing wind) than making even a flake of the reality of Nature better known, as it has come down to us today, clearer than it has ever been in history, but with so far still to go.Science is the main reason why going back is just ridiculous and willfully ignorant. It's like saying you'd like to go back to when you didn't know that touching a hot burner on the stove would hurt. Who would want to know the world less, to have our experts be less knowledgeable less skilled, to be more in the dark, when we have so many things to get right still, and so many problems yet to resolve?"
43,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6079835-juno,5,"Renowned physicist Richard Feynman had promised for years to explain quantum electrodynamics to Alix Mautner, whose degree was in English literature. When she died, he finally sat down and put together this sequence of four lectures — and he did it, somewhat miraculously — without any of the mind-bogglingly complex equations that are so intimidating even to the most math-hardened of graduate students. Indeed, Feynman explains quantum electrodynamics purely conceptually, making me wonder why we don't teach it to children in junior high.My one wish is that someone had made me read this book before I took quantum back in college, because for the first time I truly felt like I understood the calculations my professor tried to teach me.Do not be deceived: this is not a book ""merely for an English major to understand science."" Feynman is explicit about when he is leaving out information, and he doesn't misrepresent anything. I read this book because I thought it would help me with my own research, and it has. The miracle of QED is that it would serve practically anyone else just as well, scientist or not.The first three chapters are mainly about light and quantum theory — and explicitly neglect discussions of polarization. The fourth chapter ties quantum electrodynamics into particle physics, introducing quarks and discussing polarization somewhat briefly.Three complaints come to mind with this book. Firstly, I wish Feynman had included information about polarization — perhaps in footnotes. Secondly, the figure captions are sometimes redundant, and one has to flip back and forth between text and appropriate figures (this objection may concern only the specific edition I read). Thirdly, I want more.I rarely dispense five-star ratings, but QED has earned it. All hail Feynman."
44,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8537537-scott-weeks,5,"Richard Feynman famously had an artist friend who took him, and all scientists, to task, for removing the beauty from nature by reducing things to mere physical processes and thereby making them dull. Feynmann thinks this is kind of nutty, viewing the complicated actions inside as having an intrinsic beauty all their own, arguing that scientific knowledge only adds to the excitement, mystery, and awe of nature. In QED, Feynman ably supports his thesis in a series of four lectures on quantum electrodynamics, or the interaction of light and electrons. Written for and delivered to a non-scientific audience, Feynman leads the thoughtful reader on a tour of how light works. Starting with the introduction, we learn about reflection and refraction, then in the next lecture we move on to why light reflects and refracts. Chapter three is about electrons and their interactions (electrons and photons behave identically, so by studying electrons we can understand photons, which are particles of light) including the famous two-hole experiment, which counterintuitively shows that light can be either a particle or a wave, depending on what observation you make with it. The book ends with an exploration of subatomic particles and their interactions with each other-quarks, gluons, particle spin, etc- for me personally, the most interesting chapter in a very interesting book.Read this book, think about the concepts explained, and see if you don't start to find excitement, mystery, and awe in something as simple as turning on a light switch. The beauty is in the details."
45,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47610637-sean-yuan,4,"QED, by Richard Feynman, a distinguished theoretical physicist, introduces the quantum world to the layman gently but effectively and accurately. Within his first lecture, he briefly introduces key concepts of QED, such as taking the square of an amplitude to find a probability, or the way that photons behave in the presence of electrons. This acts as a fairly succinct chapter introducing a mindset necessary for the comprehension of more advanced materials, which follow, in the later lectures. In his second and third lectures, he applies the previously demonstrated concepts to an example, the reflection of light from a pane of glass, as well as introducing new concepts, such as Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle, as well as constructive and destructive interference. In his final lecture, titled “Loose Ends”, he connects quantum electrodynamics to the rest of physics, tying in concepts such as the strong and weak forces, as well as discussing the meaning of quantum electrodynamics, and some of its problems, I enjoyed this book thoroughly, as it was written in a simple manner, while still being able to explain complex concepts. I would recommend it to anyone curious about the subject matter, as it serves as an excellent introduction to the quantum world, giving the reader a good idea of what to expect if they should further pursue the subject, while still being appropriate for an introduction to quantum physics."
46,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10803326-aonghas-van-sant,4,"""This is the third of four lectures on a rather difficult subject—the theory of quantum electrodynamics—and since there are obviously more people here tonight than there were before, some of you haven't heard the other two lectures and will find this lecture incomprehensible. Those of you who have heard the other two lectures will also find this lecture incomprehensible, but you know that that's alright: as I explained in the first lecture, the way we have to describe Nature is generally incomprehensible to us."""
47,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49167160-joseph-mirabelli,5,"I haven't written my rating for a book in a time, but my experience in QED this week was interesting enough to discuss publicly. As the young graduate physicist, the most fun challenge of the book ended up moving metaphoric language onto things that (to a young graduate physicist) are conceptually simple while describing mathematics that (still to a young graduate physicist - gonna get down on that renormalization this fall) are mostly foreign. I knew enough to get paused by the actual mechanics of ""clockworks"" in the ""arrows"" defining amplitudes, but in general haven't treated sums of probability amplitudes in a way that makes them as intuitive as they so clearly were for Feynman - I was definitely not the intended audience for QED, which initially obscured what some of the metaphors were doing. Regardless, this was a beautifully and concisely presented set of lectures on an incredible topic, and after a bit of mediation, still holds as a great way to introduce any quantum field theory or solidify it for _any learner._ The final chapter was as brilliant an explanation as it was a solid history. Non-fiction rarely makes one smile and laugh, especially on something so esoteric. Friends, sorry to fill my feed with only physics books this summer; I've got the qualifying exam and triple research duty this summer, so I'm only reading physics, the pretty and the gritty. "
48,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8701392-jo-o-melo,5,"This is hands down the most simple (and accurate!) explanation I've ever seen of Quantum Electrodynamics. This is a very complicated topic (usually at a level of a master's degree in physics) but Feynman finds a very clever way to simplify it down so that anyone can understand. It's not a very light reading since the arguments can be somewhat involved (but it is quite short) but the consequence is that someone who has none or very little mathematical background can completely follow the discussion, and even more importantly that discussion is precise. I am myself a physicist and can tell you that the concepts he introduced are exactly how we think about this stuff, we just use a more efficient language.The only downside of this book is the final lecture. It is quite outdated since it was written in the 80's. We now have a full understanding of the ""hocus pocus"" of renormalisation. And also we have completed the picture of the Standard Model with the finding of the Higgs boson. However, it is in no sense misleading. What he says is absolutely correct, he even mentions that physicist at that time were confused about it. It's just that now have a better understanding of most of what he talked about in the last lecture (although there's is still plenty of stuff that confuses modern physicists)."
49,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23893690-duncan,5,"QED is a book about quantum electrodynamics, which may sound complex, but with Richard Feynman teaching, its much easier to learn. This book covers basically what quantum electrodynamics is--the interaction of light with charged particles. However instead of advanced mathematics and complex words, Feynman uses the famous Feynman diagrams and other visualizations to explain things. This is a great read for anyone interested in physics, and if you fall into that category, you should read other Feynman books and lectures.If Feynman taught every physics class in the world it would be considered as easy as addition and subtraction. He manages to explain things that sometimes can take a whole semester of a college class in one short 175 page book. Anything from quantum electrodynamics and photons to basic physics equations is simple to learn with him teaching. Not to say its all easy, it does require some serious foreknowledge of the subject matter to read this book. The most amazing thing of all is this book doesn't even contain one equation, because Feynman explains everything so well it is unnecessary for the reader."
50,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12899386-jasper,3,"If you're willing and interested, it's really not all that difficult to understand, I was promised.Except that it is.I anticipated the promised ""illusion of understanding"", but ended up being told a story you know is overly simplified and fails to justify the most fundamental meaning of some key concepts in the theory. All nice, those arrows and amplitudes, but I'm left unknowing of how to exactly interpret that amplitude. What is its meaning? All that follows is interesting and mind-blowing even: Light does not *per se* move in a straight line! Light is reflected of a mirror in *all* directions!Light can go slower or faster than, well, the speed of light (Einstein's still right tho)And consequently, stuff is moving backwards in time all the time.But a full understanding thereof? No.Maybe the fact that this is a lecture transcript rather than a book has something to do with it. I'd undoubtedly go to a Feynman Seminar if I had the chance - once I figure out how to do that antimatter trick of moving backwards in time."
51,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1954955-brandon-meredith,5,"This book is wonderful! Feynman really is an amazing teacher. For me, this book is really the first two chapters. This is where Feynman is the clearest about the mysterious nature of the how 98% of the universe works: through the interaction of photons and electrons. Feynman walks us through the experiments and calculations that show how to use quantum mechanics. It was so exciting and led to many hushed and hurried conversations with coworkers. If encourage anyone to read the first two chapters to have their minds blown and the last couple chapters to know what it's like to sit in an advanced physics course you don't understand! Lol. Enjoy!"
52,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42902277-eric-s,5,"QED is the collection of four lectures by Feynman on quantum electrodynamics. This is an easy to read and understand book on a very difficult subject. Feynman is excellent at describing how light and matter interact without talking down to the reader. The humor is great. The concepts are clearly explained and one can easily look them up to get a better understanding. I loved his explanation of ""renormalization"" and description of ""magic numbers"" like 137.03597. Feynman does a good job explaining the Standard Model's success with providing experimental predictions and still explains some of the limitations. This was a joy to read and rediscover some physics along the way. "
53,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26623148-casey,4,An excellent book that describes the interactions of photons and electrons using insightful analogies and clear exposition. Even if you're not terribly interested in physics I might suggest it just to get a better understanding of how to explain difficult ideas without the jargon and get to the heart of the matter. The way the book is ended with the absurdity of the outrageous number of new particles being discovered (and the shameful naming scheme for some of them) is almost an inspiring call to arms for aspiring physicists.
54,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5264446-taylor-cline,5,Holy crap. Feynman attempts to write this book for a lay audience but I nearly have a PhD in physical chemistry and I struggled through it. But wow it was incredible when I got it. I don't think I'll ever tire of learning more about light because it is so fascinating and unlike anything in our universe. I don't think I would recommend this book for anyone that doesn't have a basic understanding of both classical mechanics and quantum mechanics.
55,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37051585-geoffrey,5,"I think this is my third re-reading of this wonderful little book that explains the ""magic"" at the heart of quantum physics to non-physicists. As a physicist myself, this book never ceases to fascinate,nit is such a cogent presentation of some of the deepest parts of modern physics, and yet never hides the ""hoopy"" parts of the theory from the public, and always with Feynman's wonderful sense of humour."
56,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77653-sporkurai,0,"Feynman is absolutely brilliant and shows it, probably intentionally, by making one of the most confusing and unintuitive subjects of human knowledge easily accessible. He has a very modest and unpretentious style and seems to revel in the simplicity to which he can reduce the most complex ideas. I would recommend him as quite possibly the most ideal writer on quantum physics for the layman."
57,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37043333-dan-slimmon,5,"I wish I'd read this book before taking quantum mechanics and optics in college! Feynman had an incredible talent for getting at the kernel of a theory and explaining it without formalisms. This book gave me a much greater appreciation for not only how weird nature truly is, but also in what ways it's weird and how it still manages to be self-consistent anyway."
58,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/765496-katharine,4,"A great read for those who are curious about how quantum electrodynamics works. It is a very accurate description and although it is explained as simply as possible, it still requires a basic understanding of math, in particular graphs of distance(space) and time."
59,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4983981-ben-pace,3,"A lovely and intelligent man explaining. The book is not a textbook, but is a good overview of the main ideas relating to the field, explained very clearly. A good place to start if you aim to understand quantum mechanics, although a textbook would be required for a technical understanding."
