That´s a difficult and very detailed one, but it´s worth each gram of brain sweat, because it not only describes many topics around heredity, genes, epigenetic, and the fascinating development of those fields, but it also gives interesting implications for the future and under those some pretty realistic scenarios.What can be done will be done and already now many expensive therapies are a thing for the rich and so will it be with the first options to pimp your baby, egg, and sperm. Of course, this will make all possible dystopian gene enhancing nightmares come true, because everyone wants the best for her/his kids and if the cash is there, it would be very bad parenting to not make the little bundles of joy smarter, healthier, longer living, happier, and more successful. The rich, beautiful, intelligent, friendly, strong,... kid vs the normal one. It´s already now pretty unfair with just wealthy vs. normal or even poor.The most amazing is how smooth and logical the dry facts are combined with deep insights and the descriptions that will come true, depending on the laws of a country and its mentality towards new technologies, what could lead to an emancipated utopia or a stronger alienation between different social groups.We are just at the very beginning and the epic fail of the human genome project and the arrogance around the underestimation of the RNA both showed that scientists tended to a bit too techno-optimistic mentality, quite kind of, ""we just have to write down, not even crack, the code and bingo."" So fine, yes, we have all those genomes and now we have barely any idea of how DNA and RNA interact in real, observable experiments and believe we could modify, tune and overclock the reproduction machinery with better tuning parts. Come on, that can´t end well, it´s like changing some parts of a huge industrial complex or a longly evolved computer with seemingly better parts without even knowing all of the functions of the removed parts and how the whole system works. It amazed me that gene expression is so heavily depending on outer influences one wouldn´t think can have something to do with it and that even our bodies aren´t constructed quite kind of genetically symmetrical and exactly, but instead in a way that different body parts like two hands can have different genetic codes. So all the not understood mechanisms, the influence of any substance around and consumed by us, if and how the mind influences the body, if epigenetic or genetic will win the race, and how all that changes when genetic engineering modifies tiny aspects of extremely complex molecular machinery might make the day of the Überbabies come far later than expected. But they will come crawling, driveling and already speaking whole, perfect sentences while they are parallel forming theories about quantum foam that bubbles like the drool on their sweet cheeks. Cultural conditioning epigenetics at its best, as they will still wear pink and play with Amazon warrior barbies before growing up and crashing their enemies perfectly styled, if they are Übergirls.A wiki walk can be as refreshing to the mind as a walk through nature in this completely overrated real life outside books: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigene...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredityhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_..."
1,1101984597,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-x,5,"I learned a lot about the history of genetics, starting from single-celled creatures emerging from the primordial ooze, through the entire science of it beyond present day knowledge, into a conjectured future. Together with genetics the author writes about cultural heredity without which we all be reinventing the wheel, just as certain apes have to learn in every generation how to use a stone to crack a nut and never develop further. Zimmer also discusses race, which is a social construct he says originated in Spain in the time of Isabella and Ferdinand who believed that the corruption in the Catholic church was caused by Jews! And therefore Jews had either to convert to Catholicism or be put to death (shades of ISIS among other fundamentalists). People were at pains to prove that they had no Jews in their ancestral lines and so the concept of race was born. ""Up until the Middle Ages, writers never used the word race in the sense that it would later take on—referring to a sharply defined biological group of people whose members were bound together by heredity.""The author who is European, together with colleagues from Asia and Africa had his genes tested. All three of us have 1.4 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms in common. There were another 530,000 that I shared only with the Chinese person but not with the Nigerian. And there were 440,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms that I shared with the Nigerian alone. All told, 83 percent of my variants were present in at least one of their genomes.We were three people of African, Asian, and European descent, from three corners of the world. Three races, some might say. And yet we shared far more than what set us apart.The science is heavy. I was constantly rereading and using the glossary. I learned about epigenetics which is when the dna code is not changed, but events change the genes for the next generation. The best known example of this is children born with foetal alcohol syndrome.The author discusses the possible modification of babies by the wealthy who even now can have eggs fertilized in vitro and only the embryos free from inherited disorders, or of the 'right' gender, implanted and allowed to develop into babies. It is known what genes contribute to height, eye colour and even intelligence. But will governments decide to allow people to design their babies? Is it ethical?Zimmer thinks that modification will creep in by the back door. Gene therapy to stop, say, osteoporosis in the elderly would be welcomed by all. So who could object if parents who could afford it gave it to their babies so they would never have to worry about it? Would this mean some adults who didn't get the therapy as babies and did develop osteoporosis could sue their parents for not having given it to them? What about increasing intelligence by 10 points? Achievement is more strongly linked to parents income level - what they can afford to spend on education and enriching their children's lives, not to mention who they know to get into colleges and jobs. But there is obviously a component of intelligence there (not that you would always think it given some of the people who run things). What if these wealthy people with all the advantages of cultural heredity also increased their children's intelligence? Where would that leave the poor and already disadvantaged in our capitalist societies?This is a wonderful book. If you like heavy books that require concentration, rereading, looking things up, it is for you. It expanded my world view, both back in time and forwards to a future I can't imagine any more than the children of the 60s could envisage life in the computer age, but like them at the dawning of electronics, so do I at the dawning of gene manipulation, see that the possibilies are endless. I love the book and author so much my next book was Parasite Rex: Inside the Bizarre World of Nature's Most Dangerous Creatures and since that was so good (5 star though, not 10 like this one), I'm going on to A Planet of Viruses"

Carl Zimmer has produced a masterpiece of science writing, distilling incredibly complex concepts into understandable and relatable language by using narrative journalism and personal anecdotes to perfect effect. Any questions you've had about DNA, genes, inheritance, and the moral and ethical questions surrounding them will be answered – as will numerous other questions you didn't realize you had. Zimmer leaves no topic unexplored, from history to the future, from eugenics to in vitro fertilization, from cancer to evolution. It's all there, and it's all tremendous. I found exactly zero weaknesses in this book, and highly recommend it to anyone wanting to expand their knowledge about how they got here and where we all are going."
3,1101984597,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4159922-diane-s,4,"As I was reading this I couldn't help but wish that science books would have been as interesting as this one, back in my school days. Or maybe I've gotten smarter? Either way this is a very good and thorough look at what makes us who we are. An exploration of genetics from Burbank who was famous for his gardens, and crossmatched his veggies. His potatoes, are the only potatoes McDonalds will use their french fries, to now. Mendels peas, and the horrifying use of eugenics. We have come a long way, understanding now how traits, diseases, and appearance are all passed on in our DNA. This book traces the steps that were taken, as well as the missteps, to the point where now we are looking at the genome for a possible cure for various diseases. I watched a show on CRISPR, which is in this books closing chapters. Well written, nicely divided by chapter, this is an intriguing look at our past, our present and our possible future."
4,1101984597,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,4,"I started this with a healthy dose of trepidation. I said to someone the other day that I didn’t really believe in genes and I think she did one of those double-takes – you know, oh no, he’s one of ‘those’ men, one who decides not to believe in something everyone otherwise knows is true, like climate change or vaccines or irony, and has some mind-numbing boring reason why what obviously does exist, doesn’t. But really my problem with genes goes back to my reading Not In Our Genes years ago – and then more recently books like Fatal Invention or Biology as Ideology. It’s not that I don’t believe in genes – it is more that I don’t believe in what genes are often said to be able to do. I’ve also read far too many books about Eugenics, particularly the impact of the Eugenics movement on education – and so part of me thought, as I started this book, that it was likely to be a kind of call to arms about all the benefits of genes. A kind of updated version of The Blank Slate, say. However, this is much better than I was expecting.You get a bit of a history of inheritance in this book which then merges into a history of genetics. He provides a nice and easy to understand explanation for why we can’t really clean out our gene pool (even if after Hitler we actually still wanted to do such a thing) and shows that diversity is perhaps the most beautiful thing about the world, even if it is something humans seems to not only distrust, but to even go out of our way to limit, and not just in our own species. Any book that deals with genes needs to deal with the horrors of eugenics – not merely the Nazis or Henry Ford and so on – but also the sterilisation programs that went on and on and on even after WW2 and the other horrors stacked upon horrors that much of the 20th century was built upon. It would be nice to think that such horrors might present us with something of a warning, but we humans don’t really respond all that well to warnings – as George Herbert would say, ‘call in thy death’s-head there, tie up thy fears’.Much of this is covered in the first part of the book – but I actually felt that the book improved after this part. I thought part 3 was a particular highlight – we like to think that we have ‘a’ genetic code, that you write out that particular alphabet and you get you. But it seems infinitely more complicated than this. For instance, there are even errors in copying our genetic code across our own bodies, where our hands, given they are so far apart from each other, might provide slightly different genetic markers from one another due to mis-copyings along the way. The differences are slight, obviously, and the genetic code on one hand would be more similar to that on the other than either would be to, say, my brothers’ DNA, but the fact that there might be differences at all had never occurred to me. The dance of environment and genes was also something I’d never really thought about as much as I ought to have. The fact some genes only basically turn on in certain environments complicates the story much more than I think most of us assume.Part of me has always thought that making people must be a bit easier than it looks – you know, since it so rarely goes wrong. I mean, if I was given the instructions to make a human from two cells, I could pretty well guarantee I would stuff it up nine-times-out-of-ten – maybe even more often than that. But nature (for want of a better metaphor) rarely stuffs up. Even so, the more he explained, the more I had to resist the temptation to think the whole thing is impossible – you know, despite all evidence to the contrary – and complex life forms, such as us, simply shouldn’t exist. There is one part in this book where he talks about Irish giants, people from Ireland whose ‘just keep growing’ gene never quite turned off and so they ended growing to 9 foot tall. A lot of this book feels like someone is pulling your leg, you know. I think we need to be more terrified of genetics than we are too, particularly genetic manipulation. His chapter at the start of part five on Phoebus and Phaethon – and how easy it is to think you know the consequences of what you are about to do when you really don’t – pretty much sums up my fears about just about everything in that part of the book. There is so much potential for things to go horribly wrong. This book gives a nice introduction to what genetics is good for, and what it isn’t. As someone quoted in this says at one point, before you start killing people to make the world a better place, perhaps we should tackle inequality and see how much that addresses the differences we observe. It would be nice if more people thought like that."
5,1101984597,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47188780-kathleen,5,"Zimmer provides an accessible compilation of the history and current scientific research regarding heredity. Fortunately, he uses individual examples to help illustrate and explain the basic theories. Yea! There are a lot of fascinating facts to absorb!First of all, paleogenetics has used the DNA extracted from ancient skeletons to reveal that we are all ‘mutts’, and that racial purity is a myth. Further, our genome is comprised of DNA in our chromosomes, PLUS the genes in our cells’ mitochondria (inherited solely from the mother). Our DNA is an amalgamation of DNA from ancient humanoids—including Neanderthals which provided larger brain size. In addition, roughly 8% of our genome originated in viruses.Mothers and their unborn babies trade DNA back and forth through the placenta, and EACH retains that DNA for years. AND, if the mother has additional babies, some of the firstborn’s DNA can get passed onto the next child, and so on. This makes one wonder about the impact of DNA transfer in surrogate mothers, doesn’t it?Speaking of siblings—the manner in which DNA replicates is through meiosis which results in siblings getting vastly different assortments of DNA from each parent. Researchers have found that a pair of siblings might share as much as 62% of their DNA or as little as 37%. Then there is this whole concept of chimeras. Opposite sex twins can exchange stem cells, or even fuse as embryos. The result is confusion—some cells in the resulting child may be XX and some may be XY. There is even a case where a chimera mother was accused of not being her children’s biological mother because of DNA discrepancies.Now we have the gene-editing technique known as CRISPER that has challenged the ethics of gene engineering. This may have some place in gene therapy for those with rare diseases, but probably not with something like height. There are so many DNA bits that are associated with determining height, that the resulting combinations number over 2 million.And lastly, there is the bizarre way in which some genes can be turned on/off by environmental factors. This adaptation can then be passed on to their progeny while that factor exists. Environmental stresses such as heat, salt, toxins, or infection can trigger these epigenetic responses.Highly recommend."
6,1101984597,http://goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie,4,"I see this book, She Has Her Mother's Laugh: The Powers, Perversions, and Potential of Heredity by Carl Zimmer, as a continuation of Siddhartha Mukherjee’s The Gene: An Intimate History. I wrote in my review of Mukherjee’s book:""My ability to follow the book, from start to finish without any serious problems, is amazing! The author is clear, and he captivates a reader’s interest all the way through.""The very same is true of Zimmer’s book! I highly recommend it. I think everyone attempting to keep afloat in the new discoveries of genealogy should read it.The book recaps both the history and the newest of the science. It starts with the ideas of Aristotle, covers of course Mendel and eugenics, then continues up to contemporary times with discussion of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance, mitochondrial replacement therapy, CRISPR, mosaicism and genetic chimeras and much more.Concerning the nature versus nurture debate the author makes clear the complexity of separating the two.To understand where we are today, one must study the steps taken to where we stand now. The book looks at diverse topics through individual in-depth stories. The reader is given details about both the scientific experiments done and about the people who did them.Please look at the list of related books I have mentioned at the bottom of my review. This indicates the width of the book’s coverage. All of these topics are interrelated and it is through the in-depth stories that readers interest remains glued.I do think the book could have been been tightened a bit. Topics are discussed and then returned to later. The titles of chapters and parts give little indication of what they will contain; the titles are too diffuse. You understand what the title signifies only after it is read. Often chapters end with a question rather than a summary. This leads one forward to the what follows next, but for those seeking to learn, a summary of each chapter would have been more helpful. Joe Ochman narrates the audiobook. He reads quickly. For those attempting to learn, his rapid speed makes this more difficult. When the topic concerns scientific terms, I had trouble. It is less difficult when the topic is biographical or on a general theme. I could follow it for the most part, but I prefer a slower narration. It was OK, so I have given the narration two stars. I could always hear Ochman’s words. It was my head that needed more time to think. In these sections I had to rewind.I want everyone to read this book. There is tons here that is fascinating! The telling via stories keeps you interested. Scientific terms are clearly but succinctly explained. The book gives a great summary of where we stand today in the field of genealogy and heredity.***************Related reading:*The Gene: An Intimate History 4 stars by Siddhartha Mukherjee*Before the Dawn: Recovering the Lost History of Our Ancestors 4 stars by Nicholas J.

7,1101984597,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,4,"Zimmer gives us an accessible and engaging presentation on genetics and heredity with the implications for health, intelligence, personality and our future. He explores the science around DNA, RNA, and the epigenome. The discussions are substantive, but not dense. For those with limited exposure to the material, this is an excellent introduction. For those who are well read in these topics, there may be little new, except perhaps from some of the many side stories that are interspersed with the science.Zimmer starts off with history. He highlights the Habsburgs who married first cousins for generations resulting in the Habsburg jaw and recurring ailments from inbreeding. Zimmer illustrates science with many personal stories. Another is that of the author Pearl Buck and her daughter, Carrie, who suffered from the serious genetic disease phenylketonuria (PKU) before its cause was understood. I enjoyed the story of Luther Burbank, a prolific plant breeder. He was a legend in his own time, who was inspired by Darwin’s book The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication. Zimmer focuses on eugenics, a tragic misuse of science. The story of Henry Goddard and Emma Wolverton is particularly interesting.In 1897 Emma Wolverton was committed to The Vineland Training School, a home for the “feebleminded” in New Jersey. Henry Goddard learned about the Simon-Binet test visiting Europe. He decided to develop it to test the feebleminded at Vineland School. He invented the word “moron” to describe people like Emma who performed on the tests a few years below their chronological age. The next lower classification was imbecile then idiot. An underlying purpose to Goddard’s research was to identify people he felt should not be allowed to have children. The era of eugenics was just beginning. Eugenicists wanted to prevent the birth of “defectives”, regardless of race, by sterilization or other means. They were sure North European whites would have far fewer “defectives.” Eugenics was used to justify white Anglo-Saxon superiority. Goddard hired people to investigate Emma’s family tree. In 1912 he published a book The Kallikak Family that documented generations of mentally ill, alcoholic and immoral people that his investigators found comprised Emma’s ancestors. The book was very influential and taken as proof by the eugenicists that “feeblemindedness” was inherited. Goddard’s influence extended to the testing of immigrants for admission to the U.S. and soldiers in the Army. Not surprisingly the vast majority of Jews, Italians and Russians trying to enter the country were found to be feebleminded on Goddard’s test. The test questions heavily favored educated U.S. residents. In the tests of those entering the Army nearly half of whites and ninety per cent of blacks scored as morons or below. The Kallikak Family was used as evidence in the famous 1927 Supreme Court decision to uphold Virginia’s plan to sterilize Carrie Buck, a young black woman. Goddard’s book was translated into German. Hitler read about it and reiterated its message soon after in Mein Kampf. The Nazis would sterilize and euthanize hundreds of thousands of people considered mentally defective. By the 1930s opposition in the U.S. by scientists to eugenics was strong and the public became disenchanted by the eugenicists' closeness to the Nazis. In 1939 the Kallikak book was no longer in print but its use in college texts persisted. In the 1980s genealogists examined the Kallikak (Emma Wolverton) family tree in the book and found it filled with erroneous relationships and omitted relationships that contradicted Goddard’s premise.Zimmer moves on to current science, enlightening us about mosaicism and chimerism. Mosaicism refers to a single individual with cells containing different DNA due to mutation. Cancer is an obvious example. Zimmer outlines other examples such as David Merrick the elephant man whose bony growths were due to mosaicism. He also describes a person who had cells with both X and Y chromosomes while other cells had only a single X. Apparently in the early development of the embryo a dividing cell failed to pass along a Y chromosome. This mosaicism produced an individual with both male and female genitalia. Zimmer outlines many more cases of conditions and diseases due to mosaicism. Zimmer presents examples of chimerism, which describes individuals who have cells with the genome of other individuals in addition to their own. A mother’s placenta is leaky. It allows cells from one individual to enter another. This can be an exchange between mother and child or between twins. Bizarre events also occur such as the baby born with some cells containing XX chromosomes and other cells having XY chromosomes. This child had both an ovary and a testicle. The apparent cause was the fertilization of two eggs by two different sperm from the father. The zygotes then merged to form one embryo. One sperm carried an X chromosome, the other a Y. Zimmer describes many more unique cases such as one where a mother was told her children couldn’t be hers based on a DNA test. Eventually, tests on other cells in her body showed her to be the mother.Zimmer discusses the microbiome and broadens the concept of heredity. Most plants and animals are dependent on microbes. Zimmer gives many examples of the different ways microbes are inherited. In humans microbes come directly from the mother’s vaginal canal at birth and from the breasts when nursing. As children grow they build their microbiome from contact with family and friends. Each species has its own unique microbiome. Our closest relative, the chimpanzee, has a microbiome quite different from ours. These microbes perform important functions that keep us healthy or if impaired make us sick. Having “good” genes means those of your microbiome need to be good too.Zimmer weighs in on transgenerational epigenetic inheritance, a controversial subject. Gene expression is regulated by an epigenetic process known as methylation, which can turn genes on or off, ramp them up or down. It goes on throughout are lives often in response to environmental factors. The question is whether epigenetic factors such as methylation in somatic cells can affect the germ cells and thus be inherited. When fertilization occurs the stripping of the epigenome begins and continues in the early embryo. The methyl groups are replaced by those necessary for the embryo’s development. At about three weeks, some of the embryo’s cells become germ cells. Their epigenome is again stripped and a new one consistent with their new identity applied. Could any of the parents’ epigenetic factors survive all this stripping and resetting of methyl groups? Experiments with mice seem to show that the stress incurred by a parent can alter the behavior of future progeny. Zimmer describes several other experiments that seem to show that some epigenetic factors must be getting through. Naysayers say these experiments are too few and too small to be trusted. It’s an open question. Plants, however, don’t form their germ cells in early development. Plant germ cells come from adult somatic cells when the plant is ready to reproduce. These cells will have incurred many epigenetic factors from their environment and all these factors are not stripped from the new germ cells as they are in animals. Thus epigenetic inheritance is widespread in plants.Another form of inheritance Zimmer explores is culture. Richard Dawkins coined the term for this inheritable factor, the meme, purposely named to rhyme with gene. The widespread passing on of learned skills is uniquely human. Humans, unlike other animals, are proficient teachers and their offspring are proficient learners who cooperate with each other to help each other learn. Zimmer describes experiments that show the stark differences between the way humans learn vs chimpanzees and monkeys. Thus humans are endowed with this cumulative knowledge that can also be considered something heritable.Zimmer looks at CRISPR technology and pre-implementation genetic screening as ways to control heredity. CRISPR allows the precise replacement of genes. In somatic cells this is not controversial, but in germ cells this permanent alteration affecting all progeny raises concern. Certainly everyone wants to see genes that cause Huntington’s disease, cystic fibrosis and other diseases eliminated from the gene pool. But there is the danger of unforeseen consequences. And once the technology starts being used we will undoubtedly see parents opting for genetic changes to improve their children’s appearance, intelligence and athletic ability. The technology will be limited to those that can afford it and could lead to the creation of an elite class of humans. Perhaps more immediate is pre-implementation screening of germ cells for in vitro fertilization to select out germ cells that carry problematic genes or to select in those that carry an extra benefit. While this process doesn’t carry all the ethical concerns of CRISPR, these procedures are also too expensive for most people. Zimmer notes that 1.6% of children in the U.S. were conceived via in vitro fertilization in 2014 so screening for good genes seems a logical next step. Another possibility for those who can’t produce viable sperm or eggs is turning skin or other somatic cells into germ cells. This has been done with mice producing healthy offspring. Use of CRISPR technology on plants and animals also opens up many new possibilities. Mosquitoes can be given genes that prevent them from spreading malaria or even genes to eliminate mosquitoes altogether. Who would miss them? We would only find out after the fact. Are we ready to begin grand experiments to reshape our environment? Our track record of tinkering with the environment isn’t very good. The ability of organisms to reshape their environment is well documented. Zimmer considers these new environments another form of heredity. Difficult choices face us. The world our children and theirs inherit will be poised on a precipice between existential dangers and powerful technologies to reshape that world and its inhabitants. "
8,1101984597,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"This is a wonderful book about heredity. It is such a comprehensive treatment of the subject. The hardcover version of the book is 672 pages long, about 575 pages of text followed by references and an index. So, this is not a book to be read in a couple of days. But don't let the length keep you from reading the book. It is terrific--filled with stories and anecdotes that are all quite engaging. This is a very engaging book!It wasn't until the last couple of hundred years that it was generally understood that many human traits are heritable. This came to me as a surprise. Didn't people notice how families seem to have similar traits? Yes, but the mechanism of heredity was not really understood.The story of Luther Burbank was very interesting. During the 1870's he developed a series of plant hybrids that were marvelous. He developed the Russet Burbank potato. He developed a grafting technique to deliver 20,000 plum trees in a single summer. He was not a scientist, but he had developed an instinct for understanding what might work in solving problems with plants. Burbank claimed to be religious, and that God will be gradually revealed by our savior, science.(!) The Mexican artist Frida Kahlo painted a portrait of Luther Burbank, shown here.Charles Darwin came up with a hypothesis called ""pangenesis"", in his book The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication. It was very similar to the Lamarckian concept of acquired characteristics; body parts can be altered by the environment, and this alteration could pass down to descendants. Francis Galton tried to prove Darwin's hypothesis and failed, by transfusing blood among rabbits. Recent experiments, however, show some ability to transfer traits through blood transfusions. Darwin publicly chided Galton for not conducting successful experiments. But neither Darwin nor Galton really had a clue about the mechanism for inheritance.Carl Zimmer goes into some detail about how the idea of eugenics came about. The Vineland School for the Feebleminded sent out researchers in the early 1900's, to families of the children who lived there. They found that feeblemindedness was inherited, just like Mendel's peas. The research director, Henry Goddard, became a eugenicist. He didn't want to kill the feebleminded, but he did want to prevent them from having children. He brought a team of fieldworkers to Ellis Island, to give intelligence tests to new immigrants. While trying to make the tests independent of culture, they nevertheless found that about 40% of the immigrants were feebleminded. He had tried to account for cultural differences and language barriers in his tests.The book contains lots of discussion about race and skin color. But the book shows that race is not a meaningful biological concept. Even at the DNA level, there is no clear-cut way to distinguish races.All sorts of interesting hereditary correlations are discussed in the book. Race and skin color, slave children and height, height among different countries, low intelligence and accidents, high intelligence and fast inspection times, high intelligence and life expectancy. Environmental influences are also described; iodine in the diet can increase intelligence to a point, and good diets can increase height.In fact, one cannot treat genes and the environment independently. Each one influences the other. In one study of heritability of intelligence, it was bound that heritability is about 60% among affluent families, but close to 0% among poorer families--at least in the United States. This seems not to hold in Europe. Also, heritability increases as we age, perhaps a sort of feedback loop. It was found in the 1970's that intelligence can be changed. This was the reason that the Head Start program was started. It raised the graduation rate of children, by as much as 10% in the case of children whose mothers didn't finish high school.There are some fascinating chapters about chimeras; fraternal twins who can share each others' blood types, or other genes from each other. Also, it is interesting how fetal cells can remain in a woman's body for years or even decades. They can sense what type of organ they reside in, and transform themselves into that type of cell. This can be helpful or harmful, depending on the situation.The book tells an incredible story about how researchers trained bees to pull on a string to obtain food. Without training, none of the bees figured out the puzzle, but by incremental-step training, many of them learned to trick. They returned the trained bees to their hive, and after a while, untrained bees were brought to the experiment. Many of them now knew how to procure the food; 2nd, 3rd, and even 4th-hand communications.There is so much more in the book, all told with marvelous stories. There are fascinating discussions of memes as a form of cultural heredity, and the revolution that has started with CRISPR technology. Don't be put off by the length of the book. The author's ability to tell a story makes this a very enjoyable read."

The interesting tidbits and stories were immersed in unnecessary prose and benign chapters that served no purpose except to increase the word count.

Have you ever, while in a mad rush to procure a book recommended to you by an unhinged country bumpkin, kicked a man so violently in the bollox that he saw, in a magnificent flash of pyrotechnic pain, life in all its ribald generative glory, and gurgled out what follows?“Young lady, you and I, and everyone - the world over, are bound by a common inheritance, stretching back in an unbroken chain of procreative successes. In these most improbable unions, a twisted ladder of phosphates and sugars, zipped and unzipped in just such a way, interacting with the environment epigenetically, expressing and suppressing according to transcription factors and.. “Christ! There’s enough hot air in you to blow an onion sack full.” You interrupt. Flattening his gonads with the instep of your foot like warm pizza dough.“METHYLATION PATTERNS!” He whistles through clenched teeth like a balloon unpinched. Falling to his knees and guarding his germ line from further deformation with shaking hands. “Winnowing the genetic population through predation, disease, starvation... Preserving only what...”Cuffing him about the ears you protest once more: “I must proceed hence, undeterred by man or beast, to mine destination, verbose vagabond. Stand aside or lose forever the option of fruitful sexual congress.”Capitulating to this senseless barbarism he rolls into a gutter and finishes with a quote: “Thus, from the war of nature, from famine and death, the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving, namely, the production of the higher animals, directly follows. There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.”Well, I’ll be frank, you were way out of line here, and that enthusiastic ornithologist was just out searching for information on the mating habits of Blue Footed Boobies. So you should feel properly terrible. But, you don’t have time for that, so continue on your merry way and obtain the grail.This book is a history of heredity and a tool to help you better understand the current science of genetics. Charting the exciting breakthroughs which have deepened our understanding, without shying away from its numerous, tragic misuses at the hands of racial demagogs attempting to elevate their hateful gospels beyond superficial difference, and the various eugenic crackpots who used a facile understanding of the burgeoning science to inflict untold misery. It’s all here. And, as this book will show you, the answer to bad science, is always good science. A proper understanding of genetics lays bare the fallacies of racial purity, dispels the notion of any simple answer to the question of human intelligence, and makes clear our common humanity.If our species is to move forward, it must solve what has been called The Twin Nuclei Problem of Cell and Atom. We must navigate a landscape fundamentally changed by our mastery over atomic energy and our increasing fluency in the language of biological manipulation. Those genies are out of the bottle, and better knowledge, not descent into ignorance or superstition, is the only viable path.Do NOT physically assault a stranger on your way to buy this book!"

12,1101984597,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1045774-mehrsa,3,"If you haven't been following or reading any news on genetics research, then this is an excellent primer, but if you do follow the science pages, there isn't much that is new in here. It's all interesting, but it's written by a reporter on science so none of it is firsthand research and the book isn't coherent enough to be memorable"
13,1101984597,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6243880-gary-beauregard-bottomley,2,"Heredity is the sum of all the previous environments and the current environment we were thrown into. Who we are as a species and as individuals is far more complicated than just our genes. Mendel’s law is a suggestion more than a law. This book lays the ground work for each of those assertions and steps the listener through some of the history of our understanding of the subject and reviews some of the current new research that has been transpiring over the last five years or so. Humans are special: we culturally pass on racism, bigotry, misogyny and superstition mimetically. The racist premises in the ‘Bell Curve’ or Nicholas Wade’s last book are best ignored rather than refuted since they are groundless. The author doesn’t mention either book or author but he does spend a lot of time refuting their absurdities inherent in their deterministic genetic fallacies. Racist and their ilk are going to hate. They will always have their reasons for hating the other just for the sake of making themselves appear superior to themselves and their select cohorts. Science has moved past that trash type thinking and this book lays out the case with fairly familiar concepts and stories. Most of what was in this book seemed to have been in other books that I’ve read recently, and the parts that weren’t in the other books I’ve already read about in Science News or Scientific American. For those who are still in a ‘nature v. nurture’ deterministic paradigm and think biology through genes alone determines destiny this book will give them the background they need to move ahead. For all others, who realize that heredity is dependent on all of our previous environments (both as a species and as individuals and within the genome, the cells, the womb and the polis) and our current environment and experiences this book will be mostly superfluous since that is the main theme for this book. "
14,1101984597,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31276231-pam-mooney,5,An amazing and well researched book. Takes us through the history and research of heredity from first works to today. It was so interesting to know where we started and how little we knew about heredity not that long ago. Some scientific researchers got it right and others drew wrong conclusions which may be forgivable for the time period but caused so much harm. There were certainly many ethical dilemmas that came in strong. Although it includes studies and scientific outcomes it is easy to read and understand the works and conclusions presented. This is an all inclusive study in who we are where we come from and how our genes and environment come together to make us who we are. Engaging - as it made me look at my own family and especially siblings to observe what traits we share with each other and our parents. This is the rare book for me that would get 100 out of 10 stars as where else would you get so much information in an easily read storytelling format in one book? I could open this book in any place randomly and follow the topic at hand immediately. A good read.

Zimmer weaves historical and contemporary scientific research to create a work which you want to engage with. Who’d have thought that Mendel’s messing around with peas would lead eventually to the horrors of Hitler’s eugenics programs? Who knew that the sloppy research which lead to the published book about the so-called Kallikak family could have such devastating world stage consequences? Even our own Reginald Mungomery gets a mention, the bloke who came up with the idea to bring cane toads to Australia to eat the beetles destroying cane fields, scientists and biologists have been trying to find a solution to that mistake ever since. This is a fascinating book and I recommend it to anyone who has an interest in who we are and where our world is going: Zimmer’s explanation of global warming and the consequences the planet inevitably faces if we don’t stop releasing carbon into the atmosphere is clear and indisputable. A terrific read."

He discussed the ethical issues involved, including eugenics, the treatment of people with genetic disorders, and the implications of genetic research. I also appreciated the discussion of cultural heredity. I feel like I learned a great deal of information!However, the writing was overly detailed and very long. It was a bear to get through.

Engaging and highly educational.It’s time for all of us to get up to speed on heredity, bioethics and the gene editing revolution or risk waking up in a near future that is much stranger than science fiction.The last 20 years have been a golden era in neuroscience. We are light years ahead of ware we were in 2000 in terms of what we now understand about the brain. I know that people have been making this (hitherto empty) claim for a while now.But...The next 20 years are going to be all about genome wide association studies, polygenic scores, and CRISPR. One can’t help but think about Pandora’s box, the flight of Icarus, the fate of prometheus and castigation from the garden.The ancients were highly circumspect of playing god and fucking with nature. But the gene genie is definitely out of the bottle. We’re obviously WAY past the point of no return. Let’s all hope this goes well. At the minimum. It’s going to be FUH KING interesting. Great Book!"

20,1101984597,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3749410-aaron-arnold,5,"The most important decision you can make in your life is who to have children with. This is understood more or less unconsciously by practically everyone, but the true nature of heredity - precisely what traits we inherit from our parents, and how we bequeath them in turn to our own children - is far more complex and subtle than we give it credit for. Zimmer traces our conception of heredity from one kind of ignorance to another, from our historical innocence of its genetic basis to our current incomprehension of what the ultimate consequences of our newfound power over it will be now that we have powerful tools like CRISPR. He does a great job balancing the pop sci elements of genetics 101 with the more complex cultural consequences at each stage of our understanding, so as concepts like X-inactivation, mosaicism, or epigenetics get discovered, you get crucial context as to how people used that new knowledge for both good and ill. The word ""eugenics"" casts a long shadow over our current attempts to consciously affect how our own heredity works, as it should, but the incandescence of real scientific knowledge is enough, or should be, to give us confidence that as we begin to use genetic engineering to deliberately reshape our genes that we don't have to simply repeat the old bigoted mistakes of the past. Our DNA might blindly attempt to replicate itself, but we don't have to, and a clear-eyed assessment of the possibilities in front of us should give us a great deal of optimism for our descendants.The first genetics class I took was in 7th grade, and the Darwin vs Lamarck debate was one of the first things we covered. I often take a dim and impatient view of science classes that insist on walking students all the way back through the buried strata of ancient debates like that - much like ""ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny"", in Ernst Haeckel's famous line, most intro classes force students to recapitulate the history of the development of the subject matter by dredging up lots of discarded hypotheses - but genetics is complicated enough to be worthy of a comprehensive review, since some aspects of Lamarck's hypothesis are still being debated. I'm always amazed how ancient peoples could simultaneously spend hundreds or thousands of years patiently turning teosinte into corn or wolves into sheepdogs, yet be foggy on what exactly children share with their parents or why specifically it might be unwise to follow in your ancestor's footsteps and marry your first cousin, or think it was plausible that giraffes have long necks due to stretching. Pioneers of fruit and vegetable breeding like Luther Burbank, or even Gregor Mendel himself, had to spend an ungodly number of hours untangling phenotypes, proposing, rejecting, and concocting ever more elaborate hypotheses to explain why successive batches of peas and raspberries exhibited maddening almost-regularities, so retracing their thought patterns is still valuable and relevant. I particularly sympathized with Mendel, since in class when we learned about Punnett squares, the simple example of a dominant/recessive trait we were given was eye color. This confused me since both of my parents have green eyes yet I and my two siblings all have brown eyes. Theory destroyed? No; this is perfectly explicable given that eye color is in reality controlled by multiple genes, but if I were a 19th century monk trying to figure it out I'd have thought it was quite improbable given my naive monogenetic heterozygotic model.So in that light it's not so surprising that the ideology behind inbred dynasties like the Ptolemies, Hapsburgs, or Romanovs lasted so long: if you want your children to inherit ""royalty"", then the more royals in their lineage the better! And of course the notion of heredity has been used to justify not only the continued rule of the strong, but also the subjugation of the weak, such as in the awful cases of the so-called ""feeble-minded"" individuals Zimmer profiles who were sterilized or otherwise dissuaded from having children due to stupid ideas about inherited cretinism. Intelligence remains the most hotly-debated form of heredity, since both nature and nurture seem important. Most people, including geneticists, freely acknowledge that there is at least some environmental influence, but it doesn't seem like anyone really believes that the choice of person who provides the other half of your child's genes is completely irrelevant to their welfare. If who you had kids with truly didn't matter at all, the world would look a lot different! This knowledge that your partner matters is also true for inherited diseases, as seen by the many techniques to reduce the chances of passing on congenital conditions via genetic testing and deliberate matching. A more innocuous trait like height, which is no longer as adaptive as it used to be (instead of a reliable marker of superior health, now that basically everyone has enough to eat it usually just signifies a difficulty fitting into tiny sports cars or airplane seats), falls somewhere in between, and so it took polymath Francis Galton, Charles Darwin's cousin, many hours of staring at height charts to come up with innovative statistical concepts like regression to the mean in order to explain why the children of the tall were not always the size of their parents, or how the odd pair of short people often produced average children. He was also the guy who first systematically fitted human attributes to Gaussian distributions, vastly improving our ability to analyze psychological and behavioral traits.But many of the more fascinating aspects of heredity had to wait for modern science to come around in order to be studied in more detail. The discovery that not all cells are the same (mitosis-using somatic cells which make up your body vs meiosis-using zygotic cells that make up sperm and eggs) was fairly recent, as was the distinction between totipotent cells (which can turn into anything), pluripotent cells (which can become any type of somatic cell), and multipotent cells (which are limited to specific cell genres). Also interesting to me were things like lyonization/X-inactivation, where clumps of cells decide at once whether or not to express certain traits and produce things like calico patterns in cats, or the distinction between mosaicism (different cell lineages inside the same organism, so your body is generating multiple lines of mutation within yourself) vs chimerism (where your body can include cells from other organisms, meaning a mother can actually back-inherit genes from her baby via reverse travel up through the placenta). The idea that your body depends on other organisms that you don't share any DNA with - things that are in you but not of you - is worth a ponder. Zimmer got the bacteria in his belly button analyzed, and found that he had 53 distinct species present, including 17 species that hadn't been seen before. Your specific intestinal ecosystem of gut bacteria is crucial for digestion. Less whimsically, mitochondria, which are crucial because they provide the body's energy via conversion of oxygen and sugar into ATP, are also separate organisms, yet are inherited almost but not quite entirely exclusively from our mothers (ancestry services like 23andMe use mitochondrial DNA to infer maternal lineage). He also relates the fascinating case of a form of infectious canine cancer which has been spreading from dog to dog for an almost unfathomably long time:""Contagious cancer is not all that different from an ordinary tumor that becomes metastatic and spreads from one organ to another. The new organ is, in effect, another animal. But unlike ordinary tumors, contagious cancers no longer face an inescapable death. Instead of gaining a few years' worth of mutations, they can gain centuries of them. After eleven thousand years circulating among dogs, for example, CTVT has acquired an impressive arsenal of mutations in genes linked to immune surveillance. And just like ordinary cancer cells, CTVT cells have stolen mitochondria to replace their own. The only difference is that they steal mitochondria from a series of dogs - at least five different dogs over the past two thousand years. From the days of the Roman Empire onward, CTVT has recharged itself like a vampire, with the youth of its canine victims.""More difficult for people to accept was the idea that the same DNA can be expressed differently based on environmental stimulus; epigenetics and gene expression seemed dangerously close to the ideas of Lamarck or Lysenko, the Soviet charlatan who thought that you could breed winter-resistant wheat by sowing the seeds in snow. Zimmer quotes geneticist Keven Mitchell expressing extreme skepticism that your life experiences as stored in your neurons could affect your sperm/eggs in order to thereby affect your children's neurons:""For transgeneration epigenetic transmission of behaviour to occur in mammals,"" he wrote, ""here's what would have to happen:Experience --> Brain state --> Altered gene expression in some specific neurons (so far so good, all systems working normally)-->Transmission of information to germline (how? what signal?) --> Instantiation of epigenetic states in gametes (how?) --> Propagation of state through genomic epigenetic ""rebooting,"" embryogenesis and subsequent brain development (hmm...) --> Translation of state into altered gene expression in specific neurons (ah now, c'mon) --> Altered sensitivity of specific neural circuits, as if the animal had had the same experience itself --> Altered behaviour now reflecting experience of parents, which somehow over-rides plasticity and epigenetic responsiveness of those same circuits to the behaviour of the animal itself (which supposedly kicked off the whole cascade in the first place)""Put that way, it does sound science fictional, like the genetic memory in the Dune series. Particularly that last part: if our minds are shaped by our parents' life experiences, how would we then pass down our own experiences to our children in turn without our experiences being overridden, unless all we're doing is transmitting Nth generation photocopies of particularly vivid days in the lives of our cavemen ancestors ceaselessly unto the future? But, fascinatingly, it seems that it is actually possible for plants to inherit certain gene expressions of their ancestors; whether due to patterns of DNA methylation (coatings around DNA that affect their transcription), different RNA interactions during DNA replication, or the distinct sequences of plant germ cells transforming into somatic cells, plants seem to have different tools of heredity than animals do.Zimmer uses those teases of cellular recollection to segue into a brief discussion of the distinctly human tools of mimesis, social learning, and culture that allow us to pass on far more than our genes to the next generation. Joe Henrich's book The Secret of Our Success is my current favorite book on cultural evolution, and some of Henrich's work on importance of our cultural heritage, which Zimmer estimates as extending back to about 7 million years (!), is cited here. But it's the possibilities of genetic engineering, particularly new tools like CRISPR, that are the most exciting, as the ability to selectively edit individual genes to precisely insert desired traits opens up all kinds of obvious avenues for genetic improvement. I don't think anyone but the most determined GMO conspiracy theorist would have issues with the kind of accelerated horticulture that plant scientist Zachary Lippmann wants to do to ground cherries, like Luther Burbank on fast forward:""He would edit genes that controlled when the fruits fell from the bushes, so that farmers wouldn't have to rummage on the ground for them. He would make a change to get the plants to ripen their fruits in batches rather than a few at a time. He would adjust the plants' response to sunlight so they would start producing fruit early in the growing season. They would grow to a fixed height so that farmers could use machines to gather them.""But people are rightly more worried about what this power could mean for human beings. We still have some time to ponder the ethical boundaries of deliberate gene editing, because it's unfortunately not quite as simple as cutting and pasting genes to make ourselves supermen, though we have already taken some steps into that world. In addition to the fact that CRISPR techniques themselves are still new and unperfected (Zimmer relates the example of some edited female mosquitoes that were somehow able to revert their CRISPR edits during their development from eggs; see also the saga of Chinese scientist He Jiankui from a month ago, well after this book was published), many of the traits we're most interested in depend on thousands of genes working together in ways that are still not well understood. Furthermore, even were we to develop a gene drive that would spread some new ability throughout humanity as fast as we're able to reproduce, there are still countless potential unintended consequences of a mutagenic chain reaction. Personally I'm all for getting rid of genetic diseases, and even conscious editing to encourage health and intelligence, but we have a while before we get there. The dream of a completely deterministic heredity has not yet been achieved, and so in the meantime we can still marvel at how the characteristics that we find most attractive or unique in each other get carried on to each new generation. ""Life finds a way"" indeed."
21,1101984597,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11820811-camelia-rose,4,"She has Her Mother's Laugh is the second book on similar topics I've read recently. The other book is The Gene: An Intimate History. There is some overlap, such as history of genetics from Aristotle to Darwin, Lamarck and Mendel, and Eugenics movement that had lead to The Holocaust, but enough difference makes it worth to read both books. I hope I have learned a lot about the history, single-gene diseases (Huntington's disease, PKU), the concept of race in genetic sense, polygenic disease (schizophrenia) and polygenic traits (height, intelligence), mitochondria, CRISPR, epigenetics, gene-therapy and gene-drive. In a way, the two books are complimentary to each other. A non-professional reader like me can get a better coverage from different aspects. Each book has different focus. For example, the discovery of DNA double Helix structure, Genentech and the first genetically engineered drug are detailed in The Gene, but briefly mentioned in She Has Her Mother's Laugh. Zimmer has better coverage on epigenetics and gene-drive, as well as ethical issues associated with altering human heredity. The titles say it all--Mukherjee's book is about genes, while Zimmer discusses heredity. She Has Her Mother's Laugh discusses not only human heredity, but also plants and animals. Luther Burbank has one chapter. Another chapter is about Tasmania Devil and their contagious cancer. Human heredity should include culture. The author's attempt is clear: to paint a bigger picture of heredity on the earth. To save earth from our own destruction, human race needs to think heredity out of our own present genes, but also genes which will populate the world in the future and what a future world we'll have to leave to our offsprings. Several stories told in the book deeply moved me: -- The story of Emma Wolverton-- Peal S. Buck and her daughter CarolThe overtone of the book is somewhat uplifting: our future is not as doomed as some (including me) might say. Even we are unsure about the consequences, we still do it anyway--to tamper heredity, the nature's sanctuary, with caution. How much caution one must exert? Will we be burnt to death like Phaethon?The author says we human are the only animal (except very few exceptions) capable of and very good at teaching and social learning. Are We Smart Enough to Know How Smart Animals Are? is a better source for such topic."
22,1101984597,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5995202-isil-arican,5,"One the best book I read this year, and definitely one of the best science books I read, ever.Carl Zimmer is an amazing science writer. Besides having a very fluid and engaging narrative style, he is also a great researcher and is able to simplify concepts without diluting them and present to the reader in a comprehensive, engaging way.The book tells many stories over the last two century about genetics: how various prominent historical science figure's work impacted the field of genetics and society, how the perceptions of the people over the history impacted what they wanted to see & believe regardless of their findings. He does a deep dive in the history of eugenics, the concept of race, history of evolution, discovery of genes and then DNAs as well as the recent developments around gene editing. He goes into the details of the history of some royal families and the genetics defects they ended up accumulating by marrying close relatives, the concept of feeblemindedness and how it ended up leading to most heinous crimes of the human history, the fascinating history of Luther Burbank ( The Wizard of Horticulture), who ended up creating more than 800 plant varieties in his lifetime, and the story of Pearl S. Buck's daughter and how she ended up being a prominent writer to support her.History of science and medicine is so fascinating, and it can give us so many clues about life, society, and our inherent biases. It demonstrates that sometimes the smartest people make the biggest blunders due to the inherent beliefs and values they have. Zimmer is great to find such stories that would help to understand those biases and allows us to reflect and be mindful about our assumptions.I enjoyed every minute of the book, and read/listened it with awe from time to time. It was a long read, but every minute of it was enjoyable."

And it is true, their genetic inheritance comes directly from me and my wife and the blend of our genes has made three very different and unique children. What gets passed on and how is the subject of this weighty tome.In this very researched book, Zimmer takes us back through our genetic history to show how these fragments make up our very being. Of the trillions of cells in our bodies, those that contain our DNA make us who we are, what we look like, how our health will be and countless other factors. But there is more to it than that, our genetic code is not the only thing passed from mother to child, echoes of past event from our father and his parents can be seen in the code, we get our first immune system via the placenta and the various microbes that ensure that we can live as passed on too.There is a fascinating chapter on Chimeras – these are people who carry more than one set of DNA. This was never thought to be possible, but after various anomalies including where a mother was witnessed giving birth to a child, the DNA test said that it wasn’t her child. The investigation into it discovered how DNA can transfer between non-identical twins after one dies in the womb. A mother can even absorb some of the DNA from the child she is carrying.There is a wealth of information and details in this substantial, but still a very readable book. Not only does he consider where we have got to in our understanding on DNA, but he contemplates the future of inheritance and what heredity will mean in years to come. Even though I never did biology while at school, Zimmer manages to make this fairly substantial tome a straightforward book for readers like me."

There's interesting stuff here, but it's lost amidst Zimmer's long, rambling detours into far less interesting subjects. Even when he's talking about interesting stuff, his writing is very wordy.

Our climate emergency illustrates the harm that the human race can inflict on the natural world, and God knows what is developing in the world of genetics...I am familiar with some of the history of thinking, writing and faux science in Germany leading up to the Third Reich’s ghastly eugenics programmes and practices, but until I read this book I wasn’t aware of the same in Britain and the USA, admired and emulated by Hitler et al. As my bent is more towards social anthropology than biological science (though very good to read more about the latter), I particularly liked the chapter The Teachable Ape. I wonder if the author has come across Iona and Peter Opie’s studies of the ways in which children teach children (see my review of their book The Lore and Language of Schoolchildren)?I was very interested too in Carl Zimmer’s thought on the social and cultural aspects of inheritance (p568 I believe, having returned the book to the library!) : as I understand it, that for most people, . your chances of success in all kinds of areas have a great deal to do, not only with genes, but also with your social background. Goodness, in Trump’s America, that almost amounts to Commie talk! 😄Thank you, Mr Zimmer, for the gargantuan task researching and writing this book must certainly have been. I feel higher educated!"

Some parts were difficult for me to follow and bogged my reading down...but that's not reflective of the author but of my understanding. Some chapters seemed like I was reading a history book while the author was explaining the history of specific scientific ideas and advancements made over the last 200 years. Other chapters seemed as if I was reading a medical journal with the information about our bodies and function. It seemed like a well researched and comprehensive book!
33,1101984597,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80247437-thomas,5,"This book has is an awesome journey through time and space. It covers much of the same ground as Siddhartha Mukherjee‘s book, The Gene, An Intimate History, but not too much. It would be more accurate to say they overlap a bit. Its a very accessible history of hereditary and our relationship with it. It covers all the major brake-throughs and the human stories connected with them, how we get to where we are and the perilous road ahead. Will we be wise enough to navigate the minefields connected with technologies like CRISPR and gene drives? Time will tell.One thing is for sure. You are much better off being informed on this subject then not. Ignorance about heredity has led to a lot of evil in this world, such as racism and eugenics. We need to be better informed if we want to face the future with wisdom rather than fear. Besides, it’s a ripping good read."
34,1101984597,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7712419-liz,5,"This book achieves what I would previously have described as impossible: it makes genetics, molecular biology, and other aspects of heredity interesting and (almost) accessible to the layperson. Zimmer masterfully guides us through the history of heredity research, its cultural context, and its ramifications for large groups of people. Despite having two degrees in biology, some of the information was new to me, and at one point I was so shocked by what I was learning from the audiobook version of this book that I actually had a mid-listening outburst of, ""WHAT?!"" That never happens. This would make a good companion read for anyone starting a degree in biology who struggles to maintain attention or comprehension in the face of having the entire accumulated knowledge of the biological world poured into their sleep-deprived brain through early morning lectures and textbook readings. Recommended, timely, and fascinating."
35,1101984597,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2118933-leo-walsh,4,"This is a brilliant pop-science book. It traces how our conceptions of ""heredity"" has evolved as our knowledge of the science of heritability, genetics and epigenetics have improved. Zimmer starts with European medieval heraldry, with its emphasis on ""pure royal blood"" -- which pop-culture still keeps live through fantasy series like Geroge R.R. Martins THE SONG OF ICE AND FIRE. Thing is, this selective breeding, where aristocrats bred only with aristocrats, did not lead to a superior race. Instead, it led to genetic defects, like hemophilia and the ""Hapsburg jaw"" — a deformity of the lower jaw and teeth — which weakened the aristocracy. Zimmer then traces how our collective scientific understanding of heredity changed. From ancient understanding to Darwin's heredity. To the Burbank potato to American eugincs, which influenced both American social atrocities, like involuntary sterilizations of poor people to stop ""further generations of inferior offspring,"" as well as Hitler's more chilling ""Final Solution."" Zimmer concludes by survey contemporary genetics and epigenetics, including gene therapy. All told, a well-written, thoughtful book. Four stars. "
36,1101984597,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10638965-robynne,5,"This book caught my eye when I saw it on a ""best of 2018"" book list. I was initially interested because I thought it would address some of (what I see as) the nonsense surrounding the market in DNA testing that has exploded over the past couple of years. Obviously North Americans have a lot of disposable income to invest in discovering the percentages of their ""ancestry,"" as if this has some meaningful impact on their own identity. Zimmer's book delivers far more than an assessment of the booming business in DNA testing. It is an excellent examination of genetics, psychology, ethics, sociology, pseudo-science, and all the other fields that come to bear on heredity. Well-researched, carefully argued, and clearly written for a lay audience, Zimmer's book is an example of the best kind of science writing."
37,1101984597,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29051308-ernst-hafen,5,"A fascinating journey through the multi-facetted biological basis, historical and societal impact of heredity; from Aristotle to plant and animal breeders in the 18th and 19th century to Darwin, Mendel, eugenics, pre-implantation diagnostics and CRISPR/Cas. Carl Zimmer tells the story not in a chronological way but in different vignettes of researchers that are careful, struggle with or are too confident about their discoveries. The book reads or is listened to easily. Zimmer reduces scientific jargon to a minimum. We will chose this book for the elective bookclub with our first semester biology students at ETH. It is an excellent alternative the equally fascinating book by Siddhartha Mukherjee The Gene - An Intimate History which we used in the previous years. "
38,1101984597,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4629416-betsy,4,"This is a long book -- 575 pages not including the glossary, notes, and other supplemental sections. I also found it to be oddly organized, not by time as might be assumed, but first by attitude to heredity, then by ""channel"" of heredity. It made sense to the author, and I could follow it, but I found it annoying and sometimes confusing that he jumped around in time, and with respect to people involved. Sometimes in a later chapter he would reference a scientist he had first introduced earlier, and he seems to assume I would recognize not only the name but also the contributions and attitudes of that person. Of course, that assumption was not always accurate. That being said, I still recommend this book for anyone interested in heredity because you will learn a lot. What is heredity? How has scientific thinking about it evolved since Aristotle? Mendel. Eugenics. Epigenetics. Mosaics. Chimeras. Cultural heredity. CRISPR. Three-parent heredity, or four, or more. It's not the subject that I studied in high school biology 60 years ago. It's a complex and very rapidly changing topic. This book probably covers most of it, as least as of the publication date, and for the most part makes it comprehensible and fascinating."
39,1101984597,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5586131-melora,5,Absolutely fascinating. Joe Ochman is a wonderful narrator and this is one of those popular science books that offers the perfect balance of story and science education. 
40,1101984597,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61117499-isaac-larkin,5,"Beautifully written, tackles important and fascinating areas of heredity. I was surprised to learn that if you go back just a few generations, your odds of sharing *any* DNA with any particular ancestor drops to almost 0 (and if you go back just a few thousand years, then every human being alive is either every living person's direct ancestor, or no one's). Zimmer also does a good job of tackling the ways in which the study of inheritance has been misused, from the eugenics movement to scientific racism to general questions of genetics and intelligence.I found the entire section on embryonic development, mosaicism and chimeras astounding. It's fascinating to think that somatic cells from children end up populating and contributing to their mother's body.And finally, the book closes with an excellent survey of the ways in which science and technology are beginning to control and alter inheritance, from genetic engineering and CRISPR to stem cells and preimplantation genetic diagnosis, and finally CRISPR gene drives."
41,1101984597,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38701123-kate-mcphail,4,Really long and really good (but I'm glad it's over)
42,1101984597,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8884040-emil-o-w-kirkegaard,4,"This book is pretty left-biased and too long, but not as bad as many popular news sources. Zimmer does not fall hard for the transgenerational epigenetics stuff, heeding the advice of Kevin Mitchell (e.g. http://www.wiringthebrain.com/2013/01...). Still, a lot of the beginning of the book is boring historical stuff trying to show how the motives of the oldschool people were all evil (motivated by greed from slavery profits for instance). Curiously, same motive second guessing is absent for the modern leftist researchers.Still, I recommend the book if you're curious about population genetics, genomics etc. It managed to teach me many things. Overall, I'd recommend David Reich's recent book instead though (https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3...), and for more medicine focused, I'd recommend Snyder's short book (https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2...)."
43,1101984597,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20735143-yaaresse,5,"4.5, rounding up. This is the most interesting book I've read this year. Zimmer provides a basic history of genetics, the theories and research, that sets the groundwork for discussing the biotech advances of recent years and all the accompanying ethical and legal challenges. He has a way of explaining complex scientific processes in plain English without being condescending and of adding interest with anecdotes without making it all about himself or succumbing to the melodramatic. While interested and excited about the science, he keeps a healthy skepticism and asks interesting questions. "
44,1101984597,http://goodreads.com/user/show/803323-nancy,5,"Carl Zimmer covers a lot of territory in this book. He starts with some history of the royal families of Europe and the genetic problems they developed over centuries of marrying their relatives. He ends with example of what is being done with CRISPR technology. In between he cover a lot of topics, often bringing home how it matters to each of us on a personal level by sharing information on his own genetic sequence. I had heard of CRISPR before starting this book but have a much better grasp of what it is now. Frankly, its potential is kind of frightening. That genie is not going to go back in the bottle. I wonder what the next ten years will bring. "
45,1101984597,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26855073-lada,4,"This book, while good, was rather disconcerting. First it was the way it would quote proponents of eugenics without much additional commentary. By the end it was the reality of CRISPR (plus gene drives) among other recent developments, that had me worried. In a way it was a rather slow build up to a pretty crazy present. Had lots of interesting info and ok writing. A bit too much about researchers' personalities & lives, and where this book overlapped with others, it seemed a bit hand-wavy (e.g. The Vital Question does mitochondria and the emergence of eucaryotes better while The Secret of Our Success does cultural evolution better)."
46,1101984597,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28604716-left-coast-justin,3,"I'm giving this three stars, but in fact I found it extremely tedious and gave up about halfway through. I recognize, however, that this is largely because my own interests are quite different from what the author was trying to accomplish; the writing and research were quite good, and if you're interested in what he chose to focus on -- some examples of actual family histories, and what he learned from his own 23andme analysis -- you'd probably enjoy this.If, on the other hand, you were hoping for a deep dive into the science of genes, I don't think you'll find it here."
47,1101984597,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3349962-candace,2,"Long and detailed, this book was tedious at times. Of course there are a few interesting concepts buried in there. For example, because humans teach each other (unlike other species), we can learn from each other and that sets us up for a cumulative culture. The concept of cultural heredity is interesting and gives us reason to hope that we can intentionally change as a species. We're not slaves to our pasts or our genes. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who wasn't really interested in the scientific minutiae, though."
48,1101984597,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81642824-laura,5,"A thing I love is reading a book and then seeing that book everywhere in my life. I keep seeing this book in my life, whether it's about the history of the human race (Denisovans and Neanderthals included), ill-conceived notions of eugenics, or the potential and pitfalls of scientific advancements to improve or endanger lives (of people, plants, animals)."
49,1101984597,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2177969-jaimie,4,"Good, but a bit uneven. Some sections were very enjoyable, but others dragged a bit for me."
50,1101984597,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1048108-sarah,5,A great popular science read for anyone interested in why we are the way we are.
51,1101984597,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7434712-sandeep-tammu,5,"In his new book 'She has her mother's laugh', Carl Zimmer dives deep into the science of DNA and dares to ask a few questions that will challenge long held views of our deterministic thinking about genetics and implications of it. I've read various books on this topic but no one was able to put all the questions as coherently as Zimmer did in this book. Carl Zimmer discusses various perplexing questions regarding heredity. What do you call a child born with three parents (using a mitochondrial transplant from a donor)? What if a child is born long after father's death (artificial insemination)? What if we can edit our DNA and eradicate most of the existing diseases that are caused by single mutations in the genome? What if we can edit the genome of an organism and disrupt the ecosystem of Earth itself? What if a man can develop both sperms and an egg and give birth to a child? Where do we stop or do we need to stop? Zimmer discusses epi-genetics, genetic chimeras, genetic foursomes, mosaics and the list goes on and on. It is very fascinating journey.Zimmer, at the end calls for a more inclusive view for genetics that takes into account all the other pathways where the DNA can influence a person's future. It may not be as simple as we think it is. He rightfully points out the socio-economic differences that could explain the lesser scores in IQ rather than the four digits in encoded in our DNA. Nature vs Nurture. We should be open towards all possibilities. We liked the DNA picture because it provided us with simple answers, but nature as we come to know is never really that simple. If you have time to read only one book in 2019 that discusses advances in genetics, this is one of those books. In the last few chapters, Zimmer puts all the ethical implications of editing our DNA, he nails it. What's in the DNA, after all?"
52,1101984597,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1989201-zoom,3,"I blame this book for me not meeting my reading target of 50 books in 2019. I got bogged down in this one, and it took me 6 months and a day to finish reading it. It's a pretty fat book (600+ pages including the index) and it's not light reading. It's about the history and biology of heredity, as well as the future of gene editing and the ethics of genetic modification. Interesting subject matter, but I hardly ever felt like reading it. I would climb into bed, look at this book, sigh, and pick up my iPad instead. So many hours of Homescapes, just to avoid the deep dive into epigenetic theory. I skimmed the last 100 pages today. It's cheating, I know, but there's no way I'm dragging this book into the 2020s with me."
53,1101984597,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90161042-ravi-singh,4,"The author describes heredity in a really broad way. From the genetics that we have uncovered to the cultural aspects and everything in between.There are parts where I really enjoyed the book, but there were also a lot of parts where I felt the author could get more to the point. I noticed that all chapter were around 30 pages long (in the ebook version that I had) and that really made me suspect that the author deliberately tried to make some chapters longer then they needed to be.All in all I still liked the book because I learned a lot about the history of genetics and the cultural aspects we relate to it. I would recommend this book to people who also want to read about genetics and are still fairly new to this subject. I give this book 3.5 out of 5 stars."
54,1101984597,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4354604-steve,5,"Sensitive, comprehensive, thoughtful review of the long and interesting history of heredity. How we used to think about it, how that knowledge has grown (and sometimes darkly twisted) through the ages, and the challenges and opportunities that face us now. Absolute must-read for anyone working in or near the life sciences in the 21st century."
55,1101984597,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6011718-ryan-morrow,4,"The chapters on CRISPR, chimeras, and gene drives alone make this a highly rewarding read. "
56,1101984597,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25269967-aniaszafa,5,Amazing. Insightful.
57,1101984597,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5979619-boudewijn,3,3.5 stars
58,1101984597,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1647517-victor-sonkin,4,"An interesting account of heredity and its history from the early researchers to today's headspinning novelties such as mosaic children or children born from three or more parents, or even the possibility of making a child out of the cells of a single person. The state of the science the book is about is amazing, and it seems that the whole nature of human existence might be radically shattered by scientific novelties (there are other social problems with science these days, but that's kind of beside the point)."
59,1101984597,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78086-jessica-howard,5,So fascinating!!
