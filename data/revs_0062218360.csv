1,0062218360,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1651956-riku-sayuj,2,"Not Very FreakyA very ordinary effort. Levitt & Dubner tells us the recipe to “Think Like a Freak”. Most of the ingredients are quite ordinary and almost all are trodden territory. A wholly unnecessary book.1. That all the Big Problems of the world are too tough to solve for ordinary people like us and that we should nibble at the edges. - A bit about game theory and about how most problems arise due to private vs public conflicts and how we need learn to realign incentives to solve small problems. Keep nudging the incentives and solving small incentive-problems. The very soul of Freakonomics.2. That we should learn - to say “I don’t know” more often, especially the experts. A few stories thrown in about how stupid people who try to predict the future are.- Also, don’t bring your moral compass into your predictions/decisions. And always look for feedback if you want to keep improving.3. That we have to learn - to ask the Right Question. Reframe the question to get ahead.- Endlessly experiment to get the right feedback on the reframed problem. The ‘abortion & crime’ story is repeated. AGAIN!4. That we should - Think like a Child: Have fun. Don’t ignore the obvious. Think small. 5. That we should obsess over - Incentives, Again: Understand contexts; Reframe contexts. Use appropriate incentives. NEVER mix your incentives!6. That we can win arguments: How to win an Argument: Don’t pretend your argument is perfect. Acknowledge their viewpoint and... meh.7. That we might want to think of - When to Quit: Avoid the sunk cost fallacy. BTW, this chapter is for us too — We (Levitt & Dubner) just might quit writing this stuff!In short, nothing really exciting, nothing novel. Nothing that fires the imagination. I am not at all freaked out by the ideas & stories presented here. They can still spin a good yarn, but that gets old fast without the essential ingredient - radical ideas.If indeed the freakish duo decides to call it quits, it would be a pity that this was added to their otherwise magnificent legacy."

And understanding them—or, often, deciphering them—is the key to understanding a problem, and how it might be solved.  Knowing what to measure, and how to measure it, can make a complicated world less so. There is nothing like the sheer power of numbers to scrub away layers of confusion and contradiction, especially with emotional, hot-button topics.  The conventional wisdom is often wrong. And a blithe acceptance of it can lead to sloppy, wasteful, or even dangerous outcomes.  Correlation does not equal causality. When two things travel together, it is tempting to assume that one causes the other. Married people, for instance, are demonstrably happier than single people; does this mean that marriage causes happiness? Not necessarily. The data suggest that happy people are more likely to get married in the first place. As one researcher memorably put it, “If you’re grumpy, who the hell wants to marry you?” (c)Q:this isn’t a self-help book in the traditional sense. We are probably not the kind of people you’d typically want to ask for help; and some of our advice tends to get people into trouble rather than out of it. (c)Q:Our thinking is inspired by what is known as the economic approach. That doesn’t mean focusing on “the economy”—far from it. The economic approach is both broader and simpler than that. It relies on data, rather than hunch or ideology, to understand how the world works, to learn how incentives succeed (or fail), how resources get allocated, and what sort of obstacles prevent people from getting those resources, whether they are concrete (like food and transportation) or more aspirational (like education and love). There is nothing magical about this way of thinking. It usually traffics in the obvious and places a huge premium on common sense. So here’s the bad news: if you come to this book hoping for the equivalent of a magician spilling his secrets, you may be disappointed. But there’s good news too: thinking like a Freak is simple enough that anyone can do it. What’s perplexing is that so few people do. Why is that?One reason is that it’s easy to let your biases—political, intellectual, or otherwise—color your view of the world. A growing body of research suggests that even the smartest people tend to seek out evidence that confirms what they already think, rather than new information that would give them a more robust view of reality. It’s also tempting to run with a herd. ...Another barrier to thinking like a Freak is that most people are too busy to rethink the way they think—or to even spend much time thinking at all. When was the last time you sat for an hour of pure, unadulterated thinking?... The absurdly talented George Bernard Shaw—a world-class writer and a founder of the London School of Economics—noted this thought deficit many years ago. “Few people think more than two or three times a year,” Shaw reportedly said. “I have made an international reputation for myself by thinking once or twice a week.” We too try to think once or twice a week (though surely not as cleverly as Shaw) and encourage you to do the same.(c)Q:This is not to say you should necessarily want to think like a Freak. It presents some potential downsides. You may find yourself way, way out of step with the prevailing winds. You might occasionally say things that make other people squirm...You’ll have to grow accustomed to people calling you a crank, or sputtering with indignation, or perhaps even getting up and walking out of the room. We have some firsthand experience with this. (c)Q:The next time you run into a question that you can only pretend to answer, go ahead and say “I don’t know”—and then follow up, certainly, with “but maybe I can find out.” And work as hard as you can to do that. You may be surprised by how receptive people are to your confession, especially when you come through with the real answer a day or a week later. But even if this goes poorly—if your boss sneers at your ignorance or you can’t figure out the answer no matter how hard you try—there is another, more strategic benefit to occasionally saying “I don’t know.” Let’s say you’ve already done that on a few occasions. The next time you’re in a real jam, facing an important question that you just can’t answer, go ahead and make up something—and everyone will believe you, because you’re the guy who all those other times was crazy enough to admit you didn’t know the answer. After all, just because you’re at the office is no reason to stop thinking. (c)Q:From what we’ve seen personally, the best predictor of success among young economists and journalists is whether they absolutely love what they do. If they approach their job like—well, a job—they aren’t likely to thrive. But if they’ve somehow convinced themselves that running regressions or interviewing strangers is the funnest thing in the world, you know they have a shot. (c)Q:The key is to learn to climb inside other people’s minds to figure out what really matters to them. (c) Q:Customer reps are encouraged to talk to a customer for as long as they want (all without a script, natch); they are authorized to settle problems without calling in a supervisor and can even “fire” a customer who makes trouble. (c) Q:Backfiring bounties are, sadly, not as rare as one might hope. This phenomenon is sometimes called “the cobra effect.”…As Mark Twain once wrote: “[T]he best way to increase wolves in America, rabbits in Australia, and snakes in India is to pay a bounty on their scalps. Then every patriot goes to raising them.” (c) Q:Which leads us to the most bizarre twist in this bizarre story: if medieval priests did manipulate the ordeals, that might make them the only parties who thought an all-knowing God didn’t exist—or if he did, that he had enough faith in his priestly deputies to see their tampering as part of a divine quest for justice. (c) Q:Quitting is hard in part because it is equated with failure, and nobody likes to fail, or at least be seen failing. But is failure necessarily so terrible? We don’t think so. For every ten Freakonomics research projects we take up, roughly nine are abandoned within a month. For whatever reason, it turns out we aren’t the right people to take them on. Resources are not infinite: you cannot solve tomorrow’s problem if you aren’t willing to abandon today’s dud. Nor should failure be considered a total loss. Once you start thinking like a Freak and running experiments, you’ll find that failure can provide valuable feedback. (c) Q:When failure is demonized, people will try to avoid it at all costs—even when it represents nothing more than a temporary setback. (c) Q:Have we definitively proven that people are on average more likely to be better off if they quit more jobs, relationships, and projects? (c) Waaait. No! Whoo."
3,0062218360,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48650982-always-pouting,3,I feel that a lot of self-help or businesses type books now all follow the same formula and in the end talk about the same few ideas again and again. Like there really isn't a need for a whole book on some of these ideas like thinking outside the box or being comfortable making mistakes. I really only get something out of reading them if I'm feeling lost unsure about what I'm doing because they kind of help me ground myself or become motivated again. Otherwise though it feels like a waste of time like how many anecdotes do I need to read about creative thinking honestly.
4,0062218360,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1444762-jill,3,"Levitt and Dubner’s earlier two books, Freakonomics and Superfreakonomics were smashing successes because they came up with innovative insights to make sense of phenomena that were rather mysterious, such as an explanation for the drop in the crime rate over the last decade.  Hoping to find similar out-of-the-box proposals, I was eager to try their third book, Think Like A Freak. This book contains a few surprises, but overall it seems like a slap-dash production intended to cash in on the success of their previous enterprises. As such, it is somewhat duller reading. There are a few interesting analyses, like about the rationale for the popular email extortion scam based in Nigeria, or how a love of ""fun"" might be harnessed to encourage people to save more money. For the most part, however, the chapters read like filler material. They include platitudinous management suggestions that make common sense but not compelling reading, such as in the chapter on “How to Persuade People Who Don’t Want to Be Persuaded,"" and “revelations” about phenomena ranging from the etiology of ulcers to the causes of obesity that made the rounds of popular magazines years ago. Using the examples of King Solomon and rock singer David Lee Roth to provide examples of game theory may have been cute, but it felt like the authors were reaching for the lowest common denominator. In fact, it seemed more like a chapter on the meta subject of How to Expand Your Potential Reading Audience.The last chapter of the book discusses when it is advisable to quit whatever is it you have been doing for too long. Maybe the authors should take their own advice and call it a day. Evaluation: This book is mildly entertaining, but not up the standards set in the first two. Gone are the ""economics"" of the earlier books; more challenging content has been replaced with bromidic bullet points and stories I read a long time ago in doctor's waiting room periodicals. Rating: 2.5/5"
5,0062218360,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5759543-sam-quixote,2,"If I changed the title to “Think Outside the Box” you’d probably have a good idea of what to expect from this book - and you’d be right! Granted I’ve not read Stephen J. Dubner and Steven D. Levitt’s other “Freak” books, Freakonomics and SuperFreakonomics, but I suspect they’re just more of what’s contained in Think Like a Freak. Hey, if it ain’t broke, right? Think Like a Freak essentially has one very broad thesis: to approach any difficult situation/problem from an unexpected angle to solve it/excel at it. It’s not a new idea. The writers relate stories to illustrate this, which I’m sure more than a few people have already heard. How David Lee Roth, the lead singer of Van Halen, ensured the venues they played at adhered to their lengthy stage setup by putting a clause in their rider for no brown M&M’s - if there were none when they got there it meant the promoter had read everything carefully; if there were it meant the crew needed to do a thorough check of the equipment to make sure nobody would be hurt at the show. Or the little Japanese fella who became a Coney Island hot dog eating champion by taking apart the hot dog - separating the bun, dunking it in a glass of water, breaking up the hot dog, and eating everything this way. Before that everyone used to eat them whole, limiting the amount they could competitively eat; now everyone does it the new way. It goes on like this with case after case being brought up of old thinking being usurped by those who came to a situation differently and changed everything. Not that I’m against this attitude in any way but it means Think Like a Freak is quite a shallow read. It has one unremarkable mantra repetitively underlined throughout. Trotting out case studies to prove the benefits of thinking like a freak or outside the box, or whatever, doesn’t make this any more valid or compelling. Sure, there are nuances throughout. They encourage people to think like a child, think about smaller portions of a problem rather than the problem as a whole in order to progress to a solution, saying “I don’t know” is often more useful an answer than saying either yes or no, know when to quit, humans enjoy stories and use them to understand problems so do that whenever trying to explain things (which they apply in this book). But it feels so unsubstantial and obvious - really nothing here stands out as unique or brilliant to recommend readers to pick it up. Maybe Dubner/Levitt were trying to parlay their Freakonomics brand into a kind of self-help methodology but it doesn’t work. Think Like a Freak has a few interesting stories but it’s all in service to a completely uninspired and smug thesis that felt like a lazy product than a book they cared about writing."
6,0062218360,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19915042-jen-lawrence,5,"I loved this book. No, scratch that. I LOVED this book. Authors Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner explore how the iconoclastic approach to data revealed in Freakonomics can improve the way we think. As they write, “This book steps out of the shadows and tries to offer some advice that may occasionally be useful, whether you are interested in minor lifehacks or major global reforms.” I have to admit that I became biased in favour of this book when I saw the early reference to Philip Tetlock, who I have loved ever since his piece, Why Foxes Are Better Forecasters Than Hedgehogs (with apologies to the Publisher of this fine newspaper, of course…) But I will try to write an open-minded review.Before researching this book, the authors naturally saw the world through the rational lenses of economics and statistics and were curious to find out why so many decisions seem illogical. The books starts by reviewing the thinking process of a soccer player who is about to make a critical penalty kick in the championship game of the World Cup. The authors turn to the data about penalty kicks to see where the player should direct the ball to maximize his chance of success. They then look at where he is most likely to aim the ball. “While a penalty kick aimed at the centre of the goal is significantly more likely to succeed, only 17% of kicks are aimed there. Why so few?”The authors realize that the decision cannot be made based on statistics alone as the rational side of the brain is forced to contend with the emotional side. This is not, of course, new information. Back in about 370 BC, Plato was writing about the tug between the intellect and the heart. More recently, Jonathan Haidt wrote about the struggle between the rider (the rational brain) and the elephant (the emotional brain) in The Happiness Hypothesis. What makes Think Like a Freak so good is that the authors breathe life into this oft-explored slice of neuroscience through the art of storytelling, like the example about the soccer game. True, kicking a ball dead centre towards the goalie is statistically more likely to result in a goal. But if the goalie does manage to stop the ball kicked right to him, the kicker looks like a bit of an idiot (“Why’d you kick it righ’ to ‘im?” the hooligans in the stands will shout.) As the authors write, “Aiming towards the centre has a better chance of success, but aiming towards the corner is less risky to his own reputation.” And, as they go on to describe, humans (and, in our experience, animals) are rather more interested in “protecting our own reputation rather than promoting the collective good” in spite of claiming otherwise. Therefore, most goalies take the riskier corner kick that is less likely to be successful but has the tried-my-very-best optics for the crowd.In order to think like a Freak, the authors say that we need to be aware of, and overcome, some of the general biases that mess with our ability to think well. None of these ideas are original (I discuss a number of these issues in my soon-to-be-released book, Engage the Fox) but the authors’ gift resides in their ability to tell a memorable story. Instead of boring the reader silly with talk of confirmation biases and herd mentality and the gap between revealed and declared preferences, they walk us through memorable examples such as how the Smile Train charity raises funds by not asking for money, why Zappos offers new employees $2000 to quit, and why rocker David Lee Roth insists on a candy bowl containing no brown M&Ms.This book will appeal to the business reader (our favourite line is “just because you are at the office is no reason to stop thinking”) and any reader interested in improving the way they think. Levitt and Dubner are not afraid to make bold suggestions such as why one should regularly say “I don’t know” and the benefits of being a quitter. They describe why it’s good to act like a kid as “there is no correlation between appearing to be serious and actually being good at what you do. In fact, an argument can be made that the opposite is true.” Phew! That observation alone is worth the price of the book. The authors find wisdom in the most interesting places, such as studying why kids are better at seeing through magic tricks than adults: “by seeing things from a literally new angle, you can sometimes gain an edge in solving a problem.”One of the most powerful sections in the book covers the art of persuading someone to change his or her mind. The authors are not optimistic: “As hard as it is to think creatively about problems and come up with solutions…it is even harder to persuade people who do not wish to be persuaded.” They dissect a $1 billion anti-drug campaign that not only did not turn people off drugs, but possibly made drug use appear more appealing. They then outline the most useful strategies for getting others to change their opinions (hint: don’t start campaigning with the so-called smartest guys in the room, but not for the reason you think.) In keeping with their Freak perspective, they show how pointing out the flaws in your own arguments is one of the most effective ways to convince people you are right.Not surprisingly, the authors find that the most effective way to change someone’s mind is to tell them a compelling story. And this is, of course, the heart of the book’s success. All three of the books in the Freakonomics series sing because memorable stories illustrate potent theories. At the end of this book, the authors, firmly embracing the idea that it’s OK to quit, threaten that this is their last book in this series. I hope that this is not, in fact, the case. The authors succeed in bringing thinking to life which, as a fox-like thinker, is something I take quite seriously. Hopefully the early success of this book will convince the authors to do more work in the field."
7,0062218360,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32532051-montzalee-wittmann,4,"Think Like a Freak by Steven D. Levitt, Stephen J. Dubner is a book I wish had been around (or I had thought like a freak) thirty years ago. We used to call it 'thinking outside the box ' but I like their phrase much better! Excellent book to try to retrain my brain, not that it is trained now. I think everyone should read this, especially young people."
8,0062218360,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,3,"I loved Freakonomics and its sequel, so was expecting more of the same here, but Think Like a Freak is a very different book and suffers by comparison. The thing that absolutely blew everyone away with the earlier books was the absolute string of superb eye-opening stories, taking a sideways look at a problem using statistics and psychology (it wasn’t really economics, but it worked as a title). Perhaps the definitive example was the idea that crime rates had fallen as a result of increased availability of abortions some years earlier. In this book, though, the Freakonomics authors set out to teach us their methodology and, by comparison it’s a bit dull.What we get is often ittle more than a collection of management consultancy platitudes like ‘thinking small is powerful’ and ‘it’s good to quit’, because in the end the special thing about the Freakonomics approach was not the basic tools, which are two a penny, but the way the authors employed them. Occasionally we do get a great little story – I particularly love the exploration of how to do better in football penalty shootouts – but there just aren’t enough of them, specifically not enough really surprising, ‘Wow!’ stories like the ones that fill the previous books. The authors really should have taken their own advice when they say the most powerful form of persuasion they know is to use stories. We need more great stories, guys!I would also pick up on another point they made. When talking about the benefits of quitting (where appropriate) they say ‘Should we take our own advice and think about quitting? After three Freakonomics books, can we possibly have more to say – and will anyone care?’ The answer is yes, and no. ‘Yes’, quit doing this kind of book – but ‘no’ don’t give up and write us another Freakonomics if you can, as we will be ready to lap up more of those mind-bending ideas."
9,0062218360,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25032773-zachary-schwartz,4,"Fun fun fun fun fun! This was my favorite of the franchise. Like its predecessors, it is filled with amusing stories which usually highlight some economic or behavioral principle (such as sunk cost, cobra effect, etc...). Unlike its predecessors, this book has an underlying structure of a ""how to"" book. I feel that this gives the book a more coherent flow. The writing is accessible to anyone, lighthearted in tone, entertaining, and it moves very fast. If you listen to the podcast, many of the stories will already be familiar to you. This didn't bother me at all as I enjoyed reading them now more than listening to them the first time. I try to reserve 5-star ratings for books that either make me see the world differently, provide a deep emotionally experience, or make me laugh really hard. Because this book did neither, I give it a 4+, but I highly recommend it to everyone. Did you ever wonder why Nigerian email scammers ALWAYS advertise that they are from Nigeria? Read the book to find out..."
10,0062218360,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23417467-rick-presley,5,"I got the audio version from the library and was delighted to find that Steven Dubner, famous for his Freakonomics Radio, was the narrator. In typical whimsical style, they extended their previous ideas into the realm of practical suggestions. While they aren't covering Friedman style weighty economic issues, this book is excellent for what it purports to be - a light-hearted treatment of thinking differently. While it isn't profound or weighty, it is just as useful for all that. In fact the accessibility and whimsy in the book are part of its charm and what makes it effective. I would recommend this to anyone open to thinking about the way they think. If creativity can be taught and if people are willing to take novel approaches to problem solving, then this book provides a way forward. Sure, it could be summarized into a single poster with some bullet points, but the narrative anecdotes give concrete reality to the tips. My fear is that that those who will be most helped by the book will be those who least need it and those who are hopelessly ossified into their own way of thinking will not change. But that's the risk with any ""self-help"" book. In any case, I applaud the Steves and encourage everyone to give this a look. Or better yet, a listen."

 for everyone. If, like myself, you enjoyed Steven and Stephen's earlier volumes, Freakonomics and 

Superfreakonomics

, then congratulations! — you've found a subject area that interests you (albeit a sometimes nebulous one that can show up under the guise of a variety of disciplines). If, for some reason, you only feel comfortable learning about the ways in which data and patterns can reveal the inner workings of our world with these two 
Freakonomists,
 then this book is for you. However, I'm an ever-curious being with little patience; and, thus, haven't been sitting around just waiting for the Steven/Stephens to give me the go ahead. I thought of giving a list of recommended reading here, but one of the cool things about Freakonomics is that its principles can be applied to almost anything — for me this has included books on the philosophical nature of humanity as well as ones that helped me figure out how to run a G-D factor analysis to draft my fantasy football team (spoiler alert: it wasn't that helpful for football purposes, but learning how to use

I liked this one, but after reading the authors' first book, Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything, I was expecting more of a wow factor. The audiobook was read by one of the authors and was well done. I do need to go back and read their second book, Super Freakonomics."
13,0062218360,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3789528-jane-stewart,5,"I prefer the audiobooks over the physical books. They’re great for listening while doing other things.This is the third book in the Freakonomics series. You don’t need to read them in order. I’ve enjoyed all three. They talk about a variety of subjects. One subject was intriguing and not answered. A multinational retail company bought tv ads 3 times a year. They had their highest sales at those three times. The authors asked the question did the ads cause the sales? Or did the sales cause the ads? The company took out ads on the three biggest sale days: Black Friday, Christmas, and Father’s Day. The same company paid for advertising inserts in newspapers year round. The authors suggested the company run an experiment to see if those ads paid off - by doing no ads in selected areas for a few months and then comparing sales data. The marketing guys refused to experiment. They said they’d get fired if they stopped advertising. But they admitted that one summer an intern forgot to place the ads in the Pittsburgh area and there was no decrease in sales during that time. And still, the marketing guys refused to experiment. I’m having trouble with that. I don’t think I’d want to invest money in that company.The authors looked at religious communities in Germany - or somewhere near there. They found Protestants made more money than Catholics - even though they all started with the same wages per hour. The reasons were: Protestants worked more hours per week, Protestants were more likely to be self employed, and more Protestant women worked than Catholic women.Want to keep restrooms cleaner?

It is still full of splendid stories."

It basically discusses how one should approach problems (big or small) and provides general steps that would help if we follow them through, like admitting when one doesn't know something, figuring out the real problem and its roots, thinking like a child, looking for and providing incentives to get certain things done, and so on. It also has some really interesting ideas that I would like to try myself some time. I recommend it to everyone. "
16,0062218360,http://goodreads.com/user/show/575806-kressel-housman,4,"I’m a big Freakonomics fan. I’ve read the two previous books, seen the movie, and I regularly listen to the podcasts. So for a fan like me, this book was slightly disappointing because I’d heard most of the material before on the podcasts. Still, since I love the lessons so much, I didn’t mind a review. I especially liked the lesson of embracing failure instead of fearing it. Temporarily putting away your moral compass before analyzing problems was a good one, too. As the authors say, you can’t solve a problem if you’ve already decided what to do about it. Thanks to Freakonomics, the subject of economics is more human to me, and I’ve gone on to read more books on the subject, most of them more academic in style. Because of that, the light-hearted style that appealed to me so much with the first books seems a little too light to me now. But ultimately, I love what these authors have to say, so I’ll read/listen to/watch anything they come out with, and I’m always looking forward to more."
17,0062218360,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11951948-paul,3,"Freakonomics and the follow up book, SuperFreakonomics were two of those books that changed the way people looked at the world and the things that happened in it. In this third volume, Levitt and Dubner are aiming to teach you the way of thinking outside the box as they do.With chapters as diverse as The Three Hardest Words in the English Language, How to Think Like a Child and Like Giving Candy to a Baby, they bring more stories and anecdotes that demonstrate just how lateral thinking can bring a fresh perspective on a problem, and that sometimes the uncomplicated answer is the correct one.Whilst this is a great read, Dubner writes some very readable text, it feels like a thin veneer rather than having the depth that the earlier books had. Interesting though, and may be the place to start if you have never read anything by these authors before."

Nothing stupendously ground-breaking to be honest but it's stuff that one doesn't really think about being too caught up in the rat race and what might be construed as conventional thinking. What I really like are the real world examples, while it might not be exactly relevant for my field of work in the financial sector, are more accessible and easy to connect to.

20,0062218360,http://goodreads.com/user/show/931082-arminius,4,Think like a Freak is a book that teaches people to think like kids. That means to not be afraid to not know an answer and investigate your interests without regard to what others may think. It also states to break large problems down and solve the small ones associated with them. The authors use various experiments to prove their points. They made a website that asks people to flip a coin on whether or not to make a major decision then report how happy they were at a future date. Their conclusions came to the fact that there is an upside to quitting something.They advise getting into other people’s minds and figure out what really matters to them to get them to do what you want. Watch what they do rather than what they say is how they offer to accomplish this.Also included in the book were other people’s stories where they thought like freaks and became very successful.

I've enjoyed the Freakonomics podcast, and some of the material in this book is similar, but it's still great to see it spelled in black and white.I just can't believe that I am reading this two years too late!Stephen and Steven emphasize that it is important to look beyond the obvious, when using data to make decisions. They don't really say that you should ignore data points and focus only on your gut. The premise of the book is that we spend too little time in analyzing issues from different angles, and end up making wrong decisions too often.""The conventional wisdom is often wrong. And a blithe acceptance of it can lead to sloppy, wasteful, or even dangerous outcomes. Correlation does not equal causality. When two things travel together, it is tempting to assume that one causes the other. ""I LOVE folks who can understand the difference between correlation and causality. I think it is absolutely fundamental to decision-making, but is ignored frequently enough. The authors talk about incentives, causality, ultracrepidarianism (quite a mouthful, eh?) and storytelling, among other things.While the content of this book doesn't differ too much from earlier ones, I still found it deeply insightful and useful. Some portions of the book sound decidedly self-help-ish. But well, if you are a terrorist, you might want to buy that life insurance policy. It's not advice that will save your life though... :)"
25,0062218360,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793094-lisa,4,"Thinking like a freak has paid off for Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner in their first two wildly popular nonfiction Freakonomics books. In this book, the authors continue in the same vein by presenting counter-intuitive ideas illustrated by interesting stories that help the reader to understand why those ideas actually do make sense.The authors go a little further this time by trying to help the reader make better decisions by thinking like a freak.My husband and I listened to parts of this together on a car trip; we shared laughs and our ideas on what we heard. Later I finished listening on my MP3 player while working in the garden. Either way was very enjoyable and entertaining!I am not sure my brain is fully freaked out yet--I am looking forward to the next Freakonomics book!"
26,0062218360,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29931726-joel,5,"It's a quick read, thanks to Stephen Dubner's brisk writing style.This is the third book by Levitt. I found his second one, SuperFreakonomics superior his first, Freakonomics. He seems to have gotten a hang of making fundamental points without being too grandiose. That was my problem with the first book - he seems to be grasping at some deep, overarching lesson, but it works better simply as a collection of interesting tidbits. Toning down the ambition in the sequel actually made it more effective in making the lessons sink in. In this third volume, Levitt turns slightly more ""prescriptive"", giving advice such as ""learn to say 'I don't know'"", and ""always ask what the root cause is"", and it actually works pretty well. His examples continue to be engaging, and the book holds together into a coherent whole."

31,0062218360,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5765949-mark-jr,3,"My company offers incentives to employees every year to read business books. By this means I have gotten through some self-helpy stuff I admit I would have disdained otherwise. To be honest, I feel icky when I read books that purport to lead you to a successful life and yet omit to mention the God of eternal power and divine nature that, Romans 1 says, the books’ authors can’t not know is there—and is not silent. Maybe I’m the weaker brother here; but I just have a hard time stomaching the secularism and implicit Pelagianism. And yet I’m a firm believer in common grace, so I’m eager to acknowledge that 1) nearly anyone who writes a business book knows more about the topic than I do and 2) I’ve gotten some bits of genuine wisdom worth having from these books. Recently I read two such books which, no surprise, led me back to a specifically Christian truth about love. I'll review them both together and post the review on both books.AlchemyRory Sutherland in Alchemy tells story after story showing that humans don’t have complete access to their own motivations, their “psychologic.” But, he argues, if product designers and marketers can work to discover that psychologic, they can come up with clever solutions to all kinds of problems, many of which we don’t yet even see. (For whatever reason, the suggestions that most fascinated me had to do with restructuring the seating on the metro [British English: “tube”] so as to reward riders who choose to take up less space. He suggested little bumps/stools built into the wall.)Why we should bother to do all this creative work is left to the reader’s worldview. I presume that “making more money” will be the motivation for many or most readers. This book appeals to no explicit system of values. But the reader comes away convinced that Rory Sutherland is clever and not too conceited about it. (Well, this reader did. Other readers, says Goodreads, thought he was bragging the whole time about his cleverness. Unfortunately, that is also a possible read of the book.)Think Like a FreakThink Like a Freak is the third in a series of books that—the authors are right to say in their conclusion—has probably run its course. I’ve read all three. The schtick is probably played out sufficiently, and it’s fundamentally similar to that of Sutherland in Alchemy: pay attention to human incentives and how people operate, and you can get stuff done better with and for other people. We shall not say “pay attention to human incentives and how people operate, and you can manipulate people,” because the authors’ motives seem to me to be more altruistic than that. They are helping tackle some important questions, such as diminishing societal obesity and catching terrorists, in which the ends of public health and safety justify a few means that bear resemblance to experiments performed on rats.But here’s what stuck out to me as I listened again to the entertaining but now-a-bit-cliched stories in the third of the three Freakonomics books: Dubner and Levitt actually do get into worldview, into evaluating motivations. And they say, toward the end of their book, that love has to drive you if you hope to live up to the ideals they promote.""If you love your work (or your activism or your family time), then you’ll want to do more of it. You’ll think about it before you go to sleep and as soon as you wake up; your mind is always in gear. When you’re that engaged, you’ll run circles around other people even if they are more naturally talented. From what we’ve seen personally, the best predictor of success among young economists and journalists is whether they absolutely love what they do.""Right after this quote, the authors let their insight lapse a bit into platitude (that is no less true for being a cliché): love your work, and you’ll never work a day in your life. But I’d like to explore their insight in the above paragraph.Because it is all fine, and it is all good, to watch other people be clever. But how are you ever going to come up with that key idea that will work Alchemy on your product sales, your public health project, your book manuscript? What can you do to increase your creativity, enabling you to Think Like a Freak? Or is it just a gift, and you have it or you don’t?Dubner and Levitt’s answer in that paragraph is love. And I think as a Christian that they have to be right. What little success I’ve seen in my field of writing for the church has come when love for people who are not currently seeing particular divinely revealed truths has so consumed me that I have endlessly mulled over how to open their eyes. My wife knows when this is happening, because as the old King James says, “Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.” I talk about it with her. I’d like to think some of my recent work has stumbled into a niche no one really saw before; I didn’t even know I’d discovered it until love drove me into it and I looked up to see where I was. (Permission to change metaphors, sir? Granted.) I have been astonished how many insights grow in a field watered by love. The creative ideas just keep coming. I have many thousands more words written that I haven’t published because I assume others are probably tired of hearing from me. I’m actually going to need to stop loving because I need to be done with this topic…Reading anecdotes in self-helpy business books can surely help prime the pump of good ideas. It’s funny and inspiring to see people gifted by common grace using their God-given brains cleverly. But love is like the water pressure in the pump. If there’s no love driving you, creative ideas will not flow."

If you have read any of Freakonomics books, listened to the podcast, or watched the documentary; you know you're here for a treat. I would say though the only drawback of the book its length! it is very short, and will leave you wanting more! BUT at least you can read it more than once in a weekend, I know i will :)Here are some of the main themes and notes i took while reading:* Sometimes shooting to the middle is the boldest move to do* When Political Leaders based their decisions on personal moral compass factuality is out of the window* Don't be embarrassed about things you don't know! * for most people it's very hard to say ""I don't know""* Until you recognize what you don't know you can't acquire the knowledge for it* Facts vs Beliefs (Does the devil exist?)* Prediction is very difficult especially if it is about the future!* What we know vs what we think by political / religious beliefs* Multi Dimensional cause-effect (Very hard to relate cause and effect)* Read: Why most economist are wrong?! (over estimate the impact of the technology in the future)* It costs almost nothing to pretend you know what will happen in the future* Cost of saying ""I don't know"" is higher than the cost of ""Bluffing"" !* When predication is not correct what incentive should be made to stop making them?* Valuable Feedback* Redefine the problem* The limits we accept or refuse * Barriers and expectations (may be ignoring it help solving hard problems)* Think like a child* sometimes thinking like 8 years old can generate the best creative ideas* preconception make us role out a wide range of idea* As long as you know the difference between good and bad idea, generating a bool of idea is a good thing* Cool off: Never act on a new idea for at least 24 hours! New ideas sounds cool when it is just hatched :)* channeling your inner child* To think like a freak: is to think small not big* Little with certainty* Ask small question is better than asking big ones* change is hard, change on small scale is easier* uncertainty is less on a small scale* Start from complete ignorance* raw talent is overrated* endless practice* it is important to have fun so you can have endless practice* ""Do not listen to what people say; instead watch what they do""* Moral, financial, social incentives and herd mentality * Persuasion: The power of telling a story* Most people are blind to their blind spot* Don't insult people if u want to persuade them with your idea* Smart and more educated people are harder to change mind; because they are used to be right it is hard to see themselves wrong* See the positives in other people argument* Story: ""Multidimensional"" vs Anecdote: ""One-Dimensional""* A quitter never wins, and a winner never quits* Sunk Costs: the time, money, equity, or resources you've already spent on a project* The Sunk Cost Fallacy: throwing good money after bad	* tendency to focus on concrete costs and pay too little attention to opportunity cost.* Civilization is an aggressive, almost maniacal chronicler of success.* When failure is demonized, people will try to avoid it at all costs* http://www.freakonomicsexperiments.com/"

Nor is it a self help book or a I've figured it out now book. What it is though is an extension to freakonomics and superfreakonomics with some great stories to read based on data of course. I think these the best kind of stories even love stories perhaps, backed by numbers and facts (most of the time) . All the books written by Steven Levitt are like a long New York times article which you find insightful and enjoy without it feeling like a typical book. Something on the lines of Malcolm Gladwell.

Put away your moral compass - because it’s hard to see a problem clearly if you’ve already decided what to do about it.2.

Think like a child - because you’ll come up with better ideas and ask better questions.4. Find the root cause of a problem - because attacking the symptoms, as often happens, rarely fixes the underlying issue.5. Take a master class in incentives - because for better or worse, incentives rule our world.6. Learn to persuade people who don’t want to be persuaded - because being right is rarely enough to carry the day.7. Learn to appreciate the upside of quitting - because you can’t solve tomorrow’s problem if you aren’t willing to abandon today’s dud.Levitt and Dubner plainly see the world like no one else.

Nhưng vì mình đọc nó đầu tiên, nên cảm thấy không quá tệ và còn muốn bổ xung vô danh sách Want-to-read 2 cuốn kia.Với lối viết hài hước (dĩ nhiên) và thông minh, 2 tác giả cho người đọc một cái nhìn tổng thể về lợi ích của việc nghĩ dị và tư duy ""nhỏ"". Đọc cuốn này về cấu trúc thì thấy thân thuộc với cuốn Phi Lý Trí, tức là kiểu 1 chủ đề sẽ được nói trong 2 chương liền kề và link sang một chủ đề tiếp theo. Trong mỗi chủ đề sẽ là đặt vấn đề, kỳ vọng, thực chứng và cuối cùng là kết luận. Làm cho các ý được rõ ràng và dễ đọc hơn. Nhược điểm duy nhất của lối viết này sẽ là hơi chán... vì nếu tư duy một chút thì ngay phần đặt vấn đề và kỳ vọng, người đọc đã có thể đoán được phần tiếp theo nói về cái gì.Mình có thói quen đọc trên mạng về những bài chính luận ngắn và kiểu self-development nên những ví dụ trong cuốn sách này rất quen, cũng như những gì đề cập trong cuốn sách này không quá xa lạ. Tuy nhiên phần mình thích là phần giải thích trên góc độ khoa học về bản tính/tính chất, cách hành xử của con người, vì trước đây có suy nghĩ đến nhưng không diễn tả được. Đọc khá tâm đắc vì nói hộ tâm tư =)).Tóm lại là sách đáng để đọc. Sẽ tìm 2 cuốn kia để đọc tiếp vì thích kiểu tư duy và hài của tác giả._________________________"

I had already read what I thought was half of it—and then suddenly the book was done. I had been fooled by the page count, not realizing that the end notes would take up a quarter of the pages. A bit of an anti-climax.Which is sort of what this book is overall: anticlimactic. Not that it’s bad. But after the “cool” factor of Freakonomics and Superfreakonomics, Think Like a Freak was a bit thin. Like a good broth—a good broth can be very delicious, but not after a buttery baked potato and a thick steak.The writers do offer a few examples to illustrate their lessons on “thinking like an economist i.e. consider people’s motivations” which are fun an interesting, and would make the book a decent bathroom read or something to pick up for a few bucks off the remainder shelves. But not nearly worth the full price I paid.I don’t know if “publish or perish” is a compelling motivator for non-fiction writers like these, but that’s what this book felt like: something they needed to put out there so their names stay relevant and they get more folks listening to their podcasts. I know writing isn’t their full-time job— and Think Like a Freak feels like it.This is a gimme, a side-bar, perhaps a fat appendix at the end of the of the SuperDuper Freakonomics Compendium. Read it if you’ve got disposable income and nothing better to do. Or you want to kill an evening. But don’t, like the other books, think of this as an investment at all."

As such, there was not much new material in ""Think Like a Freak."" Instead, Dubner and Levitt have distilled about 100 hours of material down to 5, with three clear messages. 1. Test assumptions, because accepted knowledge is often myth.2. Tell a story, putting narrative above criticism.3. Be willing to quit and move on, regardless of investment.""Think Like A Freak"" is the kind of book you want to read in high school. It encourages readers to think more deeply about the world. About the presumptions everyone makes. And the authority of experts. It is not a self-help book, but those able to engrain it's central values may find life to be a little more fulfilling.I listened to the audio version. Steven Dubnar does a good job reading it. I was thrown off by it's length. It's less than 6 hours. The end has been padded out with 3 episodes of the Freakonomics podcasts. A good introduction to them, for sure, but still offsetting when a book ends with 90 minutes remaining in Audible.If you enjoy Freakonomics or you just want to affirm the limits of human intuition, pick up a copy."

It is not very long at 211 pages, but they get lots of information in there. Not all of it is new information, they have re-hashed some older stories from previous books. Also, if you listen to the podcasts their way of thinking will have already worked its way in to your brain. They discuss vast range of topics; from how to eat many hot dogs in record time, why Dave Lee Roth requests no brown M&Ms in his rider, the effect religion has on the German economy, how to determine someone's true incentives, why we should try to think like a child more often, and quit things more often, and say I don't know more often. All very helpful advice.The podcasts broadcast at the time of this book's release take some of the chapters and go in to more detail, so it may enrich the experience of reading the book to also listen to those podcasts.

Moreover, these arguments are presented disorderly, which make it hard for readers to follow.Not recommend purchasing this book.

I love the Freakonomics books. So much so that I regularly listen to their podcast, and I would estimate that over half of the content in this book is from the podcast, if not more. I understand why they do it; there's a lot of good content on the show, and it would be a pity to use it. But it meant that I didn't have those same moments of surprise and excitement when I read the book. The book also provides a really good, accessible overview on how to think about problem solving. Unfortunately, I've read so many books on this topic - and the examples they use often come from what I have researched professionally as well - there wasn't much new in here for me. The two messages I really liked, however, were about the importance of failure and that it's okay to quit. I think they did a brilliant job of endorsing the value of two things we are generally told we should avoid. Overall, the book is a highly entertaining, enjoyable read, and it will be greatly informative for many people. "

Meaning that schools and education have suffered as a result. Also had my beliefs tested when they challenge the efficiency of free healthcare; if people don't appreciate the value do they use it wisely? Since I work in the NHS and believe in free healthcare it was hard to reflect on what something I believe in might not be the best solution.

The modern world demands that we all think a bit more productively, more creatively, more rationally; that we think from a different angle, with a different set of muscles, with a different set of expectations; that we think with neither fear nor favor, with neither blind optimism nor sour skepticism.  That we think like--ahem--a Freak.


-Steven D. Levitt & Steven J. Dubner, Think Like A Freak pg 8



Here's a simplified list of what the first two Freakonomics books were about. This book is different because they discuss in more depth HOW they did those things.
 	 Incentives are the cornerstone of modern life 	 Knowing what to measure, and how to measure it, can make a complicated world less so 	 The conventional wisdom is often wrong 	 Correlation does not equal causality  If you want a single word to describe all advice on Facebook, here it is:Just because you're great at something doesn't mean you're good at everything.  Unfortunately, this fact is routinely ignored by those who engage in--take a deep breath--ultracrepidarianism, or ""the habit of giving opinions and advice on matters outside of one's knowledge or competence.""-Steven D. Levitt & Stephen J. Dubner, Think Like A Freak pg 28I had never realized how much value there is in admitting you don't know something.  People fake it because looking like you don't know something, especially if everyone thinks you should know something, has more consequences than just making up something.  We all do it.  At the very least, it gave me permission to say ""I don't know"" to my kids more often.This small quote changed my perspective on learning.The key to learning is feedback.  It is nearly impossible to learn anything without it.- Steven D. Levitt & Stephen J. Dubner, Think Like A Freak pg 34I get stuck in the trap the feedback = criticism which leads to hurt feelings.  They give an example in the book of learning to bake bread.  If you have never baked bread in your life and you are not allowed to try it and make mistakes the chances of you succeeding are almost none.  The two ways you can learn something are: 	 Trying it out and using the feedback from your experiments to do better next time 	 Have a teacher, who will also give you feedback on what you are doing to guide you in the right direction  It's so simple and yet I had never thought about it that way before.  You can't learn anything without feedback! It changed the way I viewed teaching my piano students.  I now see that me making little adjustments to what they are doing is essential to learning instead of being hurtful.In most situations, it's easy to get feedback but reading this made me realize how many things I'm doing that have no feedback.  Raising my kids, running my book club, doing the laundry, cleaning my bathroom, running my blog, writing these reviews - I don't get much feedback on how I do those things. Most of the time I just stick with the first thing I did and hope it doesn't turn to crap.  It made me more aware of the decisions I make that are not based on feedback because I don't have it or I didn't bother to gather it.  I want to do more experiments in my life so I can have actual feedback and make better decisions.The best experiment I ever did was figuring out how to get my dishwasher to actually clean my dishes.  A couple years ago, we lived in a rented townhouse and it had a basic dishwasher.  We would pre-rinse the dishes as much as we could, but every time they came out they would be covered in tiny bits of food.  Glasses that had been used for drinking water were now dirtier than when they went in.  Obviously that must mean we weren't using enough detergent, so we used more dishwasher detergent.  Didn't help.  Convinced that our dishwasher was broken, we called the maintenance guy.  Unlike me, he had experience with using and fixing lots of dishwashers.  Or in other words, he had lots of feedback.  He told me my dishwasher was most likely clogged with detergent so it wasn't draining properly and instead of my dishes being rinsed with clean water, they were being rinsed with the dirty washing water that hadn't drained all the way.  Ew. Gag.  I also didn't believe him.  I thought he was trying to get out of fixing our stupid, broken dishwasher.  When I told him that, he decided to prove it to me.  He ran my dishwasher empty - no detergent or dishes.  After it had been running for about 10 minutes, he opened the door.  The entire bottom of the dishwasher was covered in suds.  The only place the suds could have come from was inside the dishwasher, clogging the pipes like he said.  He told me to get some dishwasher cleaner and run it empty until there were no more suds.  It took 3 times to get it all the way clean.  After that, I experimented with doing my dishes.  I've always believed that it's dumb to wash your dishes before you put them in a dishwasher.  What happens if you just stick gross, disgusting dishes with 2-day-old caked on food straight in the dishwasher?  I was going to find out.  Turns out, they come out much cleaner than you'd think (once your dishwasher isn't clogged with detergent anymore).  My experimenting revealed that caked on spaghetti sauce and cheese wouldn't come off very well in that particular dishwasher (my new dishwasher will get spaghetti sauce off like a dream).  Other than that, everything came out clean.  Plates with huge blobs of ketchup - straight in the dishwasher.  No pre-rinsing.  Pans that most sane people would soak - straight in there.  Food that was so caked on that I couldn't even scrape it off - dishwasher!  The caked-on kind came out 80% clean and then I would hand wash them after the dishwasher had done most of the work because I figured, why prewash ALL of the dishes when only some of them actually need it?  Putting them all in no matter what and then washing the ones that came out dirty afterwards saved time because then I only had to wash the ones that needed it.  Since it was draining properly, the gross dishes weren't getting the other ones dirty.  I would like to add that of course I scrape food off into the garbage can but anything that is so stuck on that scrapping won't get it off is the dishwasher's job.I then experimented with different brands and types of detergent.  The one that got my dishes the cleanest was the plastic tabs with powder inside them.  Powder dissolves better and doesn't clog up the drain like liquid detergent does.  I tried turing the heat-dry cycle on and off.  Turning the heat-dry off makes it easier to clean the dishes that didn't get all the way clean, but it leaves the tupperware wet and you have to shake it off before putting it away.TL;DR - don't do the dishes in the dishwasher the way your mom taught you.  Clean it out and experiment to see what your dishwasher can really do.  Hint - it can do more than you think, even the old, basic models.My next favorite chapter was about thinking like a child.  Try to make things fun.  I try to turn chores into games because I think I hate cleaning as much as my kids do.  One of my favorite games I made up was Laundry Basketball.  I turn on the washing machine and tell the kids to see how many shots they can make with their dirty clothes.  My mom is convinced that in college they are going to round up their roommates and play Laundry Basketball with them.Incentives easily backfire.  Say hello to my kid's sticker covered potty training toilet that achieved nothing. Incentives work for people who think just like you, but most people don't think like you do.  Can I just say that I love this list on how to use incentives the right way?  It's come in really handy so far.How to Bribe Your Kids the Right Way - Incentives 101 (pg 135) 	 Figure out what people really care about, not what they say they care about. 	 Incentivize them on the dimensions that are valuable to them but cheap for you to provide. 	 Pay attention to how people respond; if their response surprises or frustrates you, learn from it and try something different. 	 Whenever possible, create incentives that switch the frame from adversarial to cooperative. 	 Never, ever think that people will do something just because it is the ""right"" thing to do. 	 Know that some people will do everything they can to game the system, finding ways to win that you never could have imagined.  If only to keep yourself sane, try to applaud their ingenuity rather than curse their greed.  After reading that list I realized that the perfect incentive for my kids is video games.  My kids LOVE video games.  They would be completely addicted zombies by now if I let them.  But it makes the perfect incentive because they really care about it, it's cheap for me to provide, and they will do almost anything to get it.  They have done dishes, laundry, picked up toys, and even cleaned toilets to get to play for 30 minutes."

Levitt Book Ideas.Think Like a Freak is a non-fiction book that helps you think differently when approaching tasks and problems. I learned a lot of ideas that I can use in my life from this book. Problem SolvingI learned that when you are put up against a big task or a big problem, it is best to start small and to gradually build your way up. You should start off dealing with a portion of the problem, and then after you gain experience and knowledge, your journey of solving the whole problem will be easier. I also learned that sometimes, you need to think about what you are truly aiming for. Takeru Kobayashi, a competitive eater who nearly doubled the hot dog record in 12 minutes. Before Kobayashi, the previous record was 25 and 1/8. He ate 50 hot dogs in 12 minutes. The author noted that Kobayashi made a mental change by redefining the problem he was trying to solve. The traditional competitive eater's problem was, How can I fit more hot dogs in my stomach? Kobayashi redefined the question, How can I make the hot dogs easier to eat? He ate the bun and sausage separately as it was easier than stuffing a whole hot dog in your mouth. He also dipped the bun into the water and then squeezed the water out so he could break down its starch, making it easier to eat, while also not adding more excess water into his body. After Kobayashi, some competitive eaters utilized his genius method and they strived to reach 40 or 50 hot dogs, something that was impossible before Kobayashi. This shows that redefining the problem can lead to success, and you should not be held back just because someone told you that you couldn't go any higher.IncentivesI liked how the author went pretty in-depth on this topic. I noticed how he gave examples where they worked and examples where they didn't work.Incentives can have loopholes so you have to carefully construct them. Incentives might cause people to work or to support you, but for the utterly wrong motives. With incentives, you can find where the problem truly lies, and you can solve them more appropriately. The three hardest words in the worldWhat do you think it is? You would probably guess I love you is, but actually, it is ""I don't know"", according to the author. People tend to believe that they know a lot of things when in reality, they don't. There was a research study where people gave British children a test, where 2 were answerable and 2 were not given enough information to answer. Yet, 76% of the children blindly guessed either yes or no on the unanswerable questions. This is because humans do not want to admit that they don't know, as they think they know a lot when sometimes, they are just blindly guessing. I learned that sometimes, answers can be biased because of political or religious views. In another study, a person asked over 300 experts in any expertise and asked them thousands of predictions that he collected over 20 years. The result was that most experts thought that they knew more than they did. The ""expert"" predictions weren't much better than ""dart-throwing chimps"". A true expert is a person who is capable of saying they don't know. They will research and analyze the question, but sometimes, they just can't answer it with evidence, something that is perfectly all right.Quitting is bad, right?I learned that there are times when quitting is an option. Sometimes, you must persevere and take risks, but sometimes you might need to stop or slow down. It depends on the situation you are in. If you are happy and you are willing to dedicate your time and effort in it, you should greatly consider following through. Sometimes, if you are not enjoying what you are doing and you feel stressed and anxious, you should think about stopping or quitting. That's sometimes how I feel like when I am reading a book I don't enjoy. There is the saying that quitters never win, and winners never quit. While I do agree with that statement for most of the time, sometimes stubbornness and unwillingness to let go can harm you substantially.Overall, this was a good non-fiction book. I recommend it to people who want to improve academically and mentally. I have been reading non-fiction a lot these past days and I have learned some valuable things."
57,0062218360,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10328833-melissa-embry,5,"Who knew economics could be so much fun? Economist Steven D. Levitt and journalist Stephen J. Dubner, that’s who. The guys who brought us mashups of economics and popular culture, Freakonomics and its sequel, SuperFreakonomics, are going for serial book status with their third book, Think Like a Freak. Yes, having explored such unlikely topics as why terrorists should buy life insurance, and the positive relationship between a drop in crime and the availability of legal abortion, Levitt and Dubner regale readers with the reasoning behind their madness. And how we can open our minds to make other amazing – and profitable linkages.Given that the book’s title includes “retrain,” the authors provide plenty of suggestions on how to generate ideas that sound goofy only until they work.Some of their retraining suggestions sound counterintuitive – the power of the three hardest words in the English language (no, they aren’t I love you) as well as the power of ditching the moral compass when considering possibilities. Some sound rational but difficult, such as devising scientific experiments to test such hypotheses as the relationship (or not) between advertising and sales volume.There are also outright bonkers-sounding possibilities like running a successful charity by offering donors a chance to opt out of future fundraisers. (Yes, it’s been done.) Or how banks might beef up their customers’ savings by running lotteries -- an intriguing suggestion but not currently legal in most areas. Or why paying students for good grades could really pay off – if enough funding is available. As well as the surprising suggestion that medieval trials by ordeal might have been surprisingly effective at determining the guilt or innocence of accused persons..And then there are the fun and (serious) games, those Levitt and Dubner dub “making your garden weed itself.” Therein lies the real reason a famous rock band’s contract specified the colors of the M&M snack candies it demanded from concert promoters. (And the surprising connections between a certain rock star and the most famous judgement by biblical wise man King Solomon.)As well as the response to readers outraged by such previous Levitt and Dubner ploys as why terrorists should buy life insurance, or what the real reason is for decreased crime rates following the legalization of abortion.Failure to purchase life insurance, even when there were wives and young children, was among the surprising – at least to the authors – correlations between terrorism suspects. With tongues firmly in cheek, Levitt and Dubner suggested in a previous book that possible terrorists could make themselves less visible by purchasing life insurance – from their bank. After being (dare I say it?) martyred in the press for supposedly telling terrorists how to avoid law enforcement, the two Steves reveal in Think Like a Freak that it was the oddity of purchasing life insurance from a bank, rather than an insurance company, which they expected would actually make such purchasers more visible to law enforcement profilers. Whether either would-be terrorists or profilers use this information is problematic, however, since law enforcement agencies are famously stingy about revealing their actual criteria.Finally, no Levitt and Dubner don’t believe access to abortion is the real reason behind drops in crime rates. The sad but true connection, they say, is that fewer children were raised by parents who didn’t want them. The best cure for crime may be loving, responsible families, but that’s too big a chore even for these veteran freaks to undertake."
58,0062218360,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71056405-mia,2,"I was gifted this by an Uncle for Christmas which is an exciting premise but I’ll waste no time in saying it fell flat. I have dipped in and out of this for a while mainly because I’ve been busy but also because it never really got anywhere fast.  The book is divided into nine chapters exploring different ways of “thinking like a freak”, each with stories of real life examples to illustrate the benefits or drawbacks of the discussed ideas. I have walked away with some fun and utterly random pieces of trivia like Nigeria is the epicentre for email frauds, there exists an American shoe company called Zappos that offers employees $2000 dollars to quit and Malta is the country in the world in which most people believe in the devil! Obviously they are all taken out of context, but it gives an insight into what I did not like about this book - it’s smugness and self-conscious desire to “open eyes”. I will not deny that I have learnt things from this book but I have not bought into the overarching lessons and tips which frame the facts.  The chapters attempted to offer unique pearls of wisdom such as thinking like a child, realising the value of quitting and other stuff of that ilk. I don’t want to seem facetious but I have heard such “gems” trotted out before. It is written by a pair of Americans and I’m not going to hold nationality against them, but you can just feel the American-ness... in a bad way. I found this book too overly familiar, the people used as examples seemed to be friends, everything was the first person plural “we” and many of the chapters had an annoying habit of ending with brazen little summaries with a “and you would have never believed it!” vibe and a staged eureka moment which ultimately served to indulge the writers and failed to wow me. The one which grinds my gears the most was about an initiative of prize linked savings, which is a way of gambling with a savings scheme where no one loses because all money is donated to a charity if not one. The writers seemed electrified by this and branded it as a potential solution to poor financial habits amongst Americans but it’s not a million miles away from the National Lottery that has been around for quite a long time in the UK. Aspects of this book felt deliberately abstract which is annoying in itself but made worse when a fair degree of obliviousness exists along side it.  I’m giving this 2 stars which is rather savage but it just did not really float my boat. It is very closely linked to economics as it’s what the pair of writers specialise in, so I would say it’s more about how to think like a freaky economist rather than a freak of all disciplines. I realise that sounds narrow minded and it does aim to give life advice too, but if everyone ends up thinking like a freak then is anyone really thinking like a freak at all? I’m not good at taking advice, I hold grudges with styling and above all, I hate when things that are supposed to be unique to an individual are reduced to packs of instructions - maybe this book was just not for me.

59,0062218360,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105242433-lichao,5,"If you're a fan of Freakonomics and Super Freakonomics, you'll love this book. Here's why:Like many other people, after reading both of the Freakonomics books, I felt like I learned a ton, but I wasn't sure how it would apply directly to my life.And that's okay. They weren't writing a self help book, and I read their work because I was genuinely curious in understanding how the world works.But this book departs from their usual method of explaining how the world works and instead shows you how you can better live in the world.And that's why I believe this is their best book yet.Here's a little summary of what I learned:1. In one chapter, the three hardest words in the english language, they talk about one of the main problems that plagues people today - the inability to say ""I don't know."" And they show you how it's a deadly combination because ""cocky plus wrong"" is a recipe for disaster. They then show you how to avoid making this mistake. They even give a word for word script you can use.2. In another chapter, ""WHat's your problem,"" they share the story of Kobayashi and how he became a professional hot dog - and food eater. They walked through his entire process and how he went on to eat 50 hot dogs when people thought eating 30 was impossible. And even though they're talking about hot dogs, you'll see how this can apply to everyone.As an example, back when I started creating videos for Social Triggers TV, a friend of mine told me they were filming about 6 videos a day. And I thought, ""Well, I'm new at this ther's no way ill get there."" And I would film 3 videos a day. Eventually, as I got good, I got to the magic number - 6 videos in a day and I felt like I was on top of the world. Until I spoke to another friend who told me they do 15 or 20 videos in a day. I was SHOCKED. But I went back to the drawing board, refined my process, and eventually got up to 17 videos in a day.I'm being vague here, mainly because I want you to read the book. But it's funny seeing how the same process I used to increase my video production was used by the hot dog champ as well.3. And my favorite part of the book is when they talk about what they call ""the once and done"" technique. If you're a non-profit, you'll LOVE reading about this because you'll see how you can potentially increase donations a drastic amount by using this simple marketing tactic.And that's it.Great book and I suggest you buy it and read it."
