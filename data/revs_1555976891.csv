I've often wondered why people--privileged, educated people, no less--choose not to vaccinate their children, disregarding scientific evidence and social responsibility. I've especially wondered why this position seems so unassailable, why even people I consider friends are so closed to discussion on this one topic although they are open-minded about so much else.Eula Biss bridges the gap, exposes the power of irrational fears, shows compassion for this strange choice even as she avoids making the same mistake for her own child. Her investigation of the history of vaccination is thorough and wonderfully written. Everything is political, we are reminded. People are highly resistant to coercion, especially from those whose motives they suspect. And there's a long history of associating vaccination with the very contamination it is intended to prevent.An amazing read whether you're a parent struggling with this decision yourself, a parent who has already got a firm opinion, a non-parent wondering why on earth this has become such an issue, or just an interested reader curious about this cultural moment where we find ourselves."
1,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32804270-michael,5,"A meditation on American culture's conception of illness, On Immunity takes on the misinformation and paranoia surrounding vaccination. In precise and moving prose, Eula Biss tracks the global history of immunization, critiques the act of describing public and private health through militaristic metaphors, reflects on her experience of motherhood, considers the ways in which cultural cornerstones such as Dracula represent disease, and deconstructs common arguments against vaccination. The short book unfolds in a series of impressionistic chapters that, in spite of the author's eclectic interests, rarely feel disconnected from each other. It's astounding how many topics Biss brings under the central concept of immunity, from the racial wealth gap in America to the philosophical writings of Voltaire, and On Immunity easily has been one of my favorite reads of the fall."
2,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2988548-rebecca,3,"This book isn't what I thought. I expected a historical record of the development of vaccines as well as a debate about whether or not parents should vaccinate their children and I got that -- for the first few chapters. Then Biss launched into a serious of personal essays about the birth of her son, taking him for shots and obsessing about the transfusion she had to get following labor. Honestly, the book should have been called ""Transfusion"" because she never shut up about it. You'd think no one had ever needed to get blood from a stranger before. Instead of focusing on being thankful for a modern day medical marvel, she worried herself to death about the process.This was followed by a bunch of chapters about ""Dracula"", the legend and the novel by Bram Stoker. While this might have been mildly interesting in a college essay, I'm not sure how it tied into the topic of vaccines despite all of Biss's mental calisthenics.If you're looking for a serious book about the vaccine debate, I'd look elsewhere."
3,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93990-ashley,4,"Those of us who identify as what is called ""pro-vax""--parents who not only vaccinate their children, but who feel passionately about it--are not exactly shrinking violets. Frankly, we can't afford to be--although the vast majority of parents vaccinate their children, we do it as a matter of course for the most part, and do not feel a driving need to speak up about having done so, any more than we brag about taking our kids to the dentist. However, this silence has allowed a vocal and dangerous minority of no-vax, slow-vax, and anti-vax parents to dominate the conversation about immunization, to disastrous effects. We're faced now with measles outbreaks, pertussis clusters which have killed infants, even mumps outbreaks in college kids this year. Because we're so passionate, and because the other side is equally passionate, debates can devolve into shouting matches. One side braying about ""science and research"" while the other side spouts nonsense about a worldwide conspiracy of silence and ""vaccine injuries."" It's rarely productive.Although she vaccinates her children, no one would mistake author Eula Biss as a ""pro-vax"" parent. And in some ways, that's exactly what this conversation needs. I consider Eula Biss the closest thing we have to our generation's Joan Didion. She shares many of the same stylistic tics, has the same careful, analytic mind, the same elegant literary sensibility, and, most markedly, the same ability to take current anxieties, identify with them, even experience them herself, and them step back and examine them like an archaeologist might examine a shard of Minoan pottery. From bloodletting and bloodsucking (pre-twentieth century medicine and Bram Stoker's Dracula, respectively) to the politics of wealth and education when it comes to the decision to vaccinate, Biss carefully weaves the fears of vaccines, and more broadly, parenthood itself with timeless themes of chaos and lack of control.There were times I felt Eula Biss was too careful. She refers to the country's most vocal and, in my opinion, dangerous fearmongerer, Barbara Loe Fisher, as a ""consumer advocate."" There is an endnote that describes in more detail Fisher's role in the anti-vaccine movement, but I was disappointed to see her described in this positive manner in the body of the book. BIss's father, a doctor, at one point dismisses anti-vaxxers as idiots, and Eula Biss states unequivocally that they're not. No doubt there are those who are intelligent but misguided. But there is a deep vein of paranoid, conspiracy-mindedness that goes along with anti-vaccine ideas, and she doesn't touch this. In fact, she doesn't address the fact that the most common arguments anti-vaxxers use to sway parents from vaccinating are not based in science. In fact, they are mostly proved incorrect by science. There was a conversation about the catastrophic effect the fraudulent Wakefield study had on the vaccination rates in the U.S and the U.K., and she mentions that the IOM did an exhaustive review of the literature and found absolutely no connection between vaccines and autism. But I was concerned with the lack of acknowledgment about the scientific illiteracy question, particularly because it ties in so naturally with other dangerous belief systems that can or will cause real and lasting damage to humanity (i.e. climate change denialism). That being said, I was enraptured as I read this book, which felt--and perhaps intentionally so--addressed to me specifically. In fact, Biss says in one of her endnotes (and be sure to read the endnotes straight through--they're an integral part of the book) that she chose to write the book to mothers, not because fathers are any less important as caregivers, but because she feels many of the anxieties about which she writes are specific to mothers. An interesting approach. A brilliant writer."

5,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2641948-iris-p,4,"On Immunity: An Inoculation

Eula Biss, the author of ""On Immunization: An Inoculation"" is the daughter of a poet and a doctor. She is herself a poet and a renowned essayist, this creates a seemingly absurd but interesting background that I think allows her to bring a unique perspective to an issue that could be otherwise tedious and dull. 	Before reading this book, I never considered that the subject of immunizations was as complex and vast as it is. But as I learned our seemingly never ending argument about vaccines is not only a health issue, it is also a political/economic/philosophical/ theological and bio-ethical debate.""On Immunization: An Inoculation"", provides a very comprehensive, rational and thorough research of vaccines and their history, how they are developed, why they are so controversial and why we feared them so much. Bliss's takes a nuanced approach on the issue and although she comes strongly on the side that favors the widespread use of vaccines, she seems to make a a point of being respectful of people that are on both sides of the so called ""vaccination debate"".The rise of the anti-vaccine movement in the United States, has created an unusual alliance across some extreme ideological political lines. On the left side of the spectrum, we have liberals skeptic of pharmaceuticals companies that developed, patent, manufacture and aggressively market vaccines, on the right there are conservatives and libertarians that held a cynical view of government and its involvement in monitoring, distributing and regulating them.I should also mentioned that the issue of vaccines and the discussion of their potential side effects touches me on a personal level.As the mother of a boy who was diagnosed with Autism at 2 1/2 years-old, I experienced a fair amount of apprehension when deciding whether or not my child should continue receiving all his immunization shots and if so, if he was to get them on the schedule recommended by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and his pediatrician.In 2007 when a neurologist screened my son for Autism we were just starting to notice a significant increase in the amount of kids in the United States and other parts of the world, that were being diagnosed with Autism. This trend was and still is, particularly noticeable among boys in that 2 to 6 age-range.Right in the middle of this turmoil, a friend gave me Jenny McCarthy's book, ""Louder Than Words"", I didn't even know who Ms. McCarthy was until I read her book. As a general rule, I try not to take medical advice from celebrities and people that don't have a scientific background, but I confess that McCarthy's candid tell about her experiences in dealing with an Autistic son hit a nerve with me at the time.It was a difficult and unnerving experience because back then, there was so much to learn about the whole Autism spectrum, its causes, best treatments and whether or not we had reliable studies confirming or denying a link between the MMR (Measles, Mumps & Rubella) vaccine and the outbreak of Autism we were facing.So I did my best to research the issue, discussed the matter with my child doctors and ultimately decided to err on the side of caution: when outweighing the risks of not being immunized vs. the non-proven risks that linked Autism to the MMR vaccine, the former was scarier than the latter. Of course, Autism is not the only sickness that many have linked to immunizations, vaccines have been blamed for everything from allergies to cancer. They also carry inherent and real risks that although statistically small, should be part of this discussion.It was also a personal experience, the birth of her son and the question of whether to vaccinate him, that propelled Ms.Bliss to research the issue of vaccines so thoroughly.The book reads as a collection of essays and at it starts with Bliss's interesting connection of Greek mythology (Achilles was ""made immune to injure but not to heal"") and Gothic horror (Dracula demonstrates our deep fears of contagion) with the overall theme of our fears over the practice of immunization. The idea of contaminating our children with the very hazard we hope to avoid sounds indeed almost mythological.""The Life of Achilles"" by Rubens shows the infant Achilles immersed by his mother in the River Styx trying to make him immortal.Bliss looks at our unease with immunization as a metaphor that reflects on the larger fears and anxieties we have regarding government intervention, unethical medical and pharmaceutical companies and our overall predisposition to distrusts the injection of anything that doesn't feel ""natural"" into our bodies. These fears seemed to be particularly enhanced when it comes to making decisions that affect our children.""Our fears,"" Bliss warns, ""are informed by history and economics, by social power and stigma, by myths and nightmares.... When we encounter information that contradicts our beliefs, … we tend to doubt the information, not ourselves.""There's a good reason why metaphors are widely used by politicians, think tanks and legislators in an effort to (re))define the framework in which health issues are discussed. ""If thoughts corrupts language"", George Orwell famously said ""language can also corrupt thought"".Bliss recounts the results of a research that found that ""whenever two issues are metaphorically linked, manipulating a person's attitude towards one can affect how one thinks about the other"". Think of the infamous ""death panels"" during the The Affordable Health Care(ACA) debate for example.The author also takes some time to explore the history of vaccines, debunks some falsehoods about them and explores the links between class, race and gender as they relate to this issue.""On Immunization"", delves into the origins of vaccinations, we learn for example that in 18th century England, milkmaids were known not to be affected by the small pox epidemic. It was almost common knowledge among farmers that the milkmaids that endured blisters in their hands were immune to the virus even when nursing victims of the disease. In 1774 and to the dismay of his neighbors, a farmer decided to inject pus from an infected cow into the arms of his wife and sons. Although the wife got ill, she recovered eventually and the sons experienced only mild symptoms. After this experience they were exposed to the disease on multiple occasions but never got infected. The term vaccine actually comes from the Latin ""vacca"", which means cow.	Bliss also makes an important moral and social argument in favor of immunizations: vaccines protect not only those that have been immunized, but also those that for different reasons, are unable to do so. This includes people with impaired immune systems, pregnant women and people that are too young or too old.We all have probably heard the term ""herd immunization""(a term that unfortunately has a very negative connotation), it refers to ""a means of protecting a whole community from disease by immunizing a critical mass of its populace."" In order for herd immunity to work a certain percentage of the population needs to be vaccinated. Unfortunately in the case of many diseases we don't know for sure where that minimum threshold is until we reached the tipping point. Consider this, according to the Center for Disease Control's web site, as of the year 2000 the United States declared that the Measles was eliminated from this country, now is back thanks to the growing rate of non-vaccination.Bliss expands this concept by pointing out that ""from birth onward our bodies are a shared space"" and seriously challenges our illusion of our independent bodies, ""we resist vaccinations in pat because we want to rule ourselves"". In a way, this debate reflects our never-ending search for a perfect balance between the interest of the collective vs. the rights of the individual. This is indeed a very American dilemma...  ""Narcissus at the pool"" was on the cover of Science in a 2002 edition that was dedicated to ""Reflections on Self: Immunity and Beyond"". The concept of Self is fundamental to the science of immunity.Ultimately when addressing our fears and deep skepticism regarding vaccines, the author calls for us to consider this debate from a more reasonable perspective: Does it makes sense to be more afraid of the inoculation than the disease? By 2004, the 1998 British study that originally linked the MMR vaccine to Autism has been thoroughly debunked and retracted. As Bliss states, ""Science is ""self-correcting"", meaning that errors in preliminary studies are ideally revealed by subsequent ones"", unfortunately in the case of the this paper, it lives forever in the viral world of hoaxes and misinformation that are part of the internet.Bliss cites scientist Richard Feynman as saying ""Knowledge is, by its nature, incomplete"" and she indicates that this also applies to poetry, the poet John Keats frames this as """"negative capability"". She mentions that her mother, also a poet, ""has instilled this ability in me since I was a child"". As a mother and as a poet she says ""You have to erase yourself"", meaning abandon what I think I know, or ""live the questions our children raise for us"".Finally I have to say that I wish ""On Immunization"", would had been available to me in those difficult days when I was agonizing about my son and considering the best choices concerning his health. But I am glad to say that he's a happy, highly functioning, well adjusted 12-year old. He still have some issues to overcome but he does attends a regular public school and enjoys a dynamic and healthy social life. I hesitate to use the word ""normal"" when referring to him, but I have come to learn that ""normal"" is highly overrated.***********************************************************************On 03/24/15 Frontline aired a one-hour special on vaccinations called ""The Vaccine Wars""Here's a link to watch online:http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontli..."
6,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17449001-robert-felton,2,"There was a lot of very informative and insightful material in On Immunity. I liked the section focused on perceptions of risk, where the belief of the validity of a particular risk by many people in society is often at odds with quantifiable facts. I also enjoyed the metaphorical comparisons that Eula Biss makes in our language and our exaggerated scientific studies, both of which contribute to our general fear of vaccinations. But, I felt the book didn't quite work for me. My biggest problem is with the transitions to literary references like Dracula and Candide. Sure, I get the metaphorical implications, but some of them seem awfully far-fetched and those that appear to support her point don't always fit the book structurally. Consequently, the book is disjointed and messy more often that not. A stronger editorial hand was required here to elevate her strong points and eliminate her redundant literary diatribes. "
7,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28854579-glenn-sumi,4,"Eula Biss isn’t a scientist; she’s an award-winning non-fiction writer and a mother. But based on On Immunity: An Inoculation, she’s clearly done copious amounts of research. The book is a personal, impressionistic, fascinating look at the history of immunity, from those 18th century English milkmaids with cowpox who miraculously found themselves immune to smallpox to the crazy (and dangerous) theories of celebrities like Jenny McCarthy.Biss has a poet’s ear, and recognizes all the connotations of a scientific term like “herd immunity” (“it suggests that we are cattle, waiting, perhaps, to be sent to slaughter”) and takes apart the contradictions of the much-used word “natural” (“What natural has come to mean to us in the context of medicine is pure and safe and benign.”) This book is in the spirit of Susan Sontag’s Illness And Metaphor and AIDS And Its Metaphors, both of which Biss mentions. She’s very sensitive to how disease has been linked with fear of “the other.” There’s a fascinating section on the legend of Dracula. And during the smallpox epidemic of 1898, the disease was called, variously, “the Nigger itch,” “the Italian itch,” and “the Mexican bump.” Seriously.Biss also suggests that the frontier mentality of Americans might account for the anti-vaccers: “we imagine our bodies as isolated homesteads that we tend either well or badly. The health of the homestead next to ours does not affect us, this thinking suggests, so long as ours is well tended.”Biss grounds the book with stories about her own fears of being a new mom, but also looks abroad. Most horrifying is the story of vaccine providers in Pakistan and Nigeria being murdered by extremist groups because it was thought they were giving them AIDS or sterilizing Muslim girls.Closer to home, there’s the Nashville woman who handed out chickenpox lollipops. And there’s the disturbing demonization campaign against Dr. Paul A. Offit, a pediatrician who co-invented the rotavirus vaccine. To discredit him, he was being called ""Dr. Proffit"" to create the illusion that the vaccine was simply a way for him to make money. (In fact, vaccines are costly to develop and generate only modest profits.)The book isn't a page-turner, by any means, but rather a thoughtful, meditative book about a timeless topic that affects everyone on the planet."
8,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4112781-erin,2,"Wow, not what I expected. I agree with Rebecca's review below. I was wanting a more factual/historical read, but instead this book was ALL OVER THE PLACE. The chapters weren't arranged chronologically, or in any logical way whatsoever. You start a new chapter where she talks about when her son was born, but in the previous chapter he was 4 years old. She talks way too much about vaccinating her son, her father being a doctor, and a blood transfusion she once received. The title should be more like, ""My Personal Opinions on Vaccinating My Son"" "
9,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16375752-anusha-narasimhan,4,"This book is a collection of essays from the author's perspective as a doctor's daughter and a mother. It informs the reader about immunity, viruses, history of some diseases, clinical trials and vaccination. It also explains the concept of herd immunity and the process involved in finding a vaccine for a disease. I found this book very relevant to the current crisis of coronavirus.This book does not focus only on hard science. It talks about the metaphors we use to describe disease and immunity and how this influences our thought process. It sheds light on how healthcare impacts, as well as gets impacted by politics, economics, morality and prejudice.I like how the author references books by professionals to back up her claims and occasionally quotes fiction or recounts her own experience when she focusses on philosophical grey areas."
10,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca,4,"When she first became a mother, professor and essayist Eula Biss took the opportunity to reconsider inoculation. She’d never given it much thought before, but in an American culture of paranoia about everything from bird flu to food additives, it was impossible not to ask what risks she was exposing her son to, and whether they were worth it. In a wide-ranging cultural history reminiscent of Susan Sontag’s AIDS and Its Metaphors, she delves into the facts, myths and metaphors surrounding immunization. This book powerfully captures the modern phenomenon of feeling simultaneously responsible and powerless. Biss reminds us that “what heals may harm and the sum of science is not always progress.” A short, well-constructed argument, well worth reading.(See my full review at Nudge.)"
11,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1811124-jeremiah,1,"Thank you to Eula Biss for pushing me to return to goodreads. I felt as though this was the only place I could properly voice my disappointment in this book. As focused as a broken telescope I have to wonder with what scandalous info she blackmailed her editor. Her use of metaphors are like a clean-up hitter shooting a three point shot during the superbowl and coming up short only to get an icing call on the final lap. ...or should I say it is like a vampire quoting Sontag but only to support Kierkegaards theories about Dr. Bob and Frankenstein. Wait...weren't we supposed to be talking about vaccinations? I thought so too. Much like the cover of the book only shows 20% of P.P. Ruben's ""Thetis dipping the infant Achilles into the river Styx"", this book only scratches the surface of any real research done into the world of vaccines. Muddled among misguided literary references and the airing of her own personal demons are the oases of pure quotes from existent research. For anyone truly interested in vaccines and the pros and (imagined) cons of them I would recommend reading the ""Selected Sources"" portion of this book and finding out the complete information on your own."
12,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935491-tanja-berg,5,"Rating 6* out of 5. I have never read anything like this in my life. I am not talking about the subject in itself, because actually none of the facts presented here were new to me. I have read about them before. What is different is how Eula Biss pieces together fact and mythology (Greek and vampirical) together with her own experiences as a first time mother to make a case for vaccination. She does this so gently, so expertly, that surely not even the anti-vaccination faction could take offense. Biss is sympathetic where I would have been arrogant.I got this book in the post on Thursday. I had already started something else, but I thought I would read a couple of pages while warming up dinner. I was immediately hooked. I had been afraid that this would be a technical and complicated book that would require some additional effort on my part, but it is not. This is a very easy book, compelling, fascinating, deeply personal and written for the lay man. All you need is basic reading comprehension. This should be mandatory reading.""After leaving the cemetery I remarked to my father that I had noticed the graves of five-year-olds and ten-year-olds and a number of teenagers, but that I was surprised not to have seen, in one of the oldest cemeteries in Chicago, the graves of any babies. This, my father reminded me, was probably because infants died in such large numbers during the nineteenth century that they were not routinely buried in marked graves. Later, I would learn that one out of every ten children born in 1900 died before their first birthdays. I would read this ina report on vaccine side effects, which concluded its brief historical overview of child mortality with the observation that now 'children are expected to survive to adulthood.'""Think about it. Up until recent history, even in the Western world, child mortality was a fact everyone had to live with. Even when children did not die, they could suffer consequences for the rest of their lives, as with polio. Antibiotics are also a recent invention, and a respite from infections that will quickly come to an end because of over-use.""For several nights while my son had croup I sat with him for most of the night, holding him upright while he slept so that he could breathe more easily. There was nothing else I could do for him. I traveled back in time then, or so I felt, passing through a space-time rift into what I imagined might have been the experience of a mother a hundred years ago, when faux-croup could just as easily have been killing croup. I thought of the mothers in Daniel Defoe's 'A Journal of the Plague Year' who were said to have died after losing their children - not of the plague, but of grief.""""However we choose to think of the social body, we are each other's environment. Immunity is a shared space - a garden we tend together.""I cannot do this book justice. It is a call for greater good. It is deeply intellectual and philosphical work, written so that anyone can grasp its concepts. READ IT! "
13,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27189535-greg,2,"This is a thoughtful discussion of illness and immunity that pays particular attention to the controversies surrounding vaccines. And there is no doubt the author invested a great deal of research and thinking in this. Be warned, however, that it is less straightforward narrative than a bricolage of her own memories, readings and musings, which can be, at times, difficult. For example, early in the book, Biss moves from Kierkegaard, to the Doppler effect, to O negative blood and then to the idea we owe each other our bodies. This elliptical strategy allows her to include a range of reflections, but as a reader I did find myself feeling lost, from time to time. I also found the system of ‘Notes’ exasperating. They include important material but they’re buried at the back of the book, and there is no indication in the text that you’ve just read something on which there is further comment. One must keep a thumb at the back and continually check to see when the next note should be read. Alas, this is not the book I was expecting, or hoping for, especially considering the effusive blurbs on the back cover. "

By combining historical information and personal essays, Biss takes on the hot button topic of vaccinations and brings it to a level that can appeal to anyone. Plus she is able to take the idea of vampires and our cultural history with those creatures and integrate them into our current cultural fear of vaccinations. Without shaming people who may be wary of vaccines and providing her own personal stories of motherhood, Biss does a really fantastic job explaining how we have vaccines, what they can do compared to what we think they can do, and why they are so important. — Rincey AbrahamFrom The Best Books We Read In February: http://bookriot.com/2015/03/02/riot-r..."

But I will echo what others are saying -- Biss has inherited the critical inquiry skills of Susan Sontag and Joan Didion and merged them with the research focus of Rebecca Solnit. The whole short book (164 pages, followed by 40 pages of endnotes and bibliography) pierces like a needle (haha, see what I did there?) to the core of her own fears, doubts, and confidences as she sees the world of threats differently through her own eyes as a new mother.

17,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3898791-udit-nair,4,The author tries to weave a story through hard hitting research and personal experiences. The intergenerational approach added with current political environment over vaccination makes it an interesting read. The areas where the book stands out is the precise combination of science of vaccination added with other aspects related to vaccination. The author is able to give out the historical data along with some of the personal anxieties which surround the individuals. Another exciting aspect is the use of literary metaphors throughout the essays. It might not be liked by all but surely is a novel approach. If one is not very comfortable with reading dry non fiction book then this turns out as a saviour. The narration is beautifully weaved as a story and hence can be termed as fiction and non fiction at the same time. Only problem with the book is that the view point of the author is not clearly articulated. Often the message is hidden behind the wide usage of metaphors. Though largely she addresses the science behind the vaccination but also tries to cater towards the fears of anti vaccine brigade. I think the balancing act here might not be liked by all. Being said that this book is actually a nice read overall.
18,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3020662-douglas,4,"“Immunity is a shared space – a garden we tend together.”Eula Biss has written a fine argument and defense for the importance of vaccination in our society. When I was in high school, we had a contest between other school debate teams called The Lincoln-Douglas Debates, named for the famous candidates in the 1858 Senate race in Illinois, Abraham Lincoln and Stephen Douglas. Even though Lincoln didn’t win the debate in 1858, his opinions won the popular vote, and the debates helped launch his career and popularity. Just two years later, Lincoln would become President. Biss has made nearly every “best of” list this year for On Immunity. Like Lincoln, it seems her ideas and arguments resound with the public, or at the very least, with journalists and media. With public health being such a hot topic and a theme for 2014, I can see why. This book reads like a persuasive speech, a treatise meant to dispute the idea that vaccinations are harmful and should be avoided. The most popular theory is that vaccinations cause autism, a theory I admittedly once entertained. As Biss points out (I’ve come to the same conclusion through my own research), the idea that vaccinations cause autism is unfounded and has been proven false through several unbiased studies. There are several intriguing metaphors in the book that are quite near perfect, the idea of disease and inoculation, like vampires and Dracula, being interconnected with the collective and individual body, both reliant and harmful. Unfortunately, I also had a few problems with this book. First, I think her political ideology often gets in the way. To make a case for the benefit of immunization, something that you actually need everyone to agree on, it might not be best to quote Karl Marx and compare capitalism to Dracula, “The drive toward capital, as Dracula suggests, is inherently inhumane. We are justified in feeling threatened by the unlimited expansion of industry, and we are justified in fearing our interests are secondary to corporate interests.”While I understand her point, I think this could alienate a large population of people (people that are needed in order for her arguments to work) and supposes that everyone involved has evil vampire motives. This shaming of Wall Street, corporate America, and everyone that transcribes to it is also somewhat hypocritical. After all, guess who’s got shareholders and big players in this evil game? Amazon (AMZN), Barnes & Noble (BKS), New York Times Co (NYT), which are all the reasons and distribution channels that have made this very book successful, not to mention the countless pharmaceutical and medical supply companies that make even the idea of public immunization possible. This book was published by Graywolf Press, a non-profit, but even they accept stock gifts: https://www.graywolfpress.org/about-u.... What’s more capitalistic than the stock market? I’m not defending capitalism. I understand its problems of inequality and excess. I’m just pointing out that if you are going to demonize a system (comparing it to a blood-sucking Dracula), at least acknowledge that you’re also a part of it. I also wonder if her political bias shielded her from seeing the bi-partisan efforts that are happening right now to immunize entire areas of the world. She touched on the subject of global immunization a few times, but did not once acknowledge the current and massive efforts to vaccinate against HPV in Africa, a virus that causes cervical cancer and threatens to end the lives of millions. This is a project that extended from the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), which provided antiretroviral treatment to millions infected with HIV and is the largest health initiative ever initiated by one country to address a disease. It was started in 2002 by President Bush and has been extended by President Obama. Why did Biss not mention these efforts? I hope this slight was not political, but based on her obvious political orientation, it was hard not to think so. (By the way, my defense of any side doesn’t indicate I’m one or the other. I just don’t prefer political bias in my books. On either side.) Biss shines in her idea of lowering the self for the collective good. In my mind, this is exactly the way I want to live my own life, to put my needs second to the needs of others. To me, that is the most fulfilling life. Admittedly, I often fail in my attempts, but books like this really help me see the benefit and help motivate me to do better. “The unvaccinated person is protected by the bodies around her, bodies through which disease is not circulating. But a vaccinated person surrounded by bodies that host disease is left vulnerable to vaccine failure or fading immunity. We are protected not so much by our own skin, but by what is beyond it. The boundaries between our bodies begin to dissolve here. Donations of blood and organs move between us, exiting one body and entering another, and so too with immunity, which is a common trust as much as a private account. Those of us who draw on immunity owe our health to our neighbors.” This idea of common trust is beautiful. The absolutely most beautiful account in this book is when Biss describes a friend of hers from Vietnam who fears vaccinations for her own children. Her friend was exposed to agent orange during the Vietnam War (an exposure I also believe killed my mom, a nurse in Vietnam, a little over two years ago), and was suspicious of the “collective trust” and rightly so. “I could not ask her to risk her children for the benefit of the citizens of the country that had put her in danger. The best I could do, I determine, was hope that my own child’s body might help shield them from disease. If vaccination can be conscripted into acts of war, it can still be instrumental in works of love.”I love this idea. Biss was fearful as well, but instead of letting fear keep her from participating in the “collective trust”, she offers her own child on the altar of hope for what’s best for us all. If this were the Lincoln-Douglas debates, her courageous surrender of her own son is a two for the win. "

This is different--one structured narrative rather than an essay collection, but she does trace different topics related to the history of vaccinations and anti-vaccinations. Ugh she's just so SMART and so good at making connections between things. And I love that she writes openly from her perspective as a new mother, a privileged mother, who can understand the panic that anti-vaccinators feel while so, so perfectly destroying their arguments on both a medical and ethical level. Just. Great. And she's such an impressive writer. I already said that. I'm just very impressed by her. *_*"
20,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6342520-andreas,1,"No, thank you. I didn't realise that by reading this I would have to engage with someone who is sceptical of vaccinations and chooses to selectively vaccinate their own a child. As someone who works in public health, I can't deal with this kind of nonsense even if it's packaged as a Fitzcarraldo edition. Vaccinating is not a debate and I don't want science and public health policy explained to me by a lay person who has done a bit of research on the internet. This is not, in any way, like Sontag's 'Illness as Metaphor' or 'AIDS and its Metaphors'. Rather, it's like hearing your gullible neighbour go on about a topic they don't know very much about. This was an infuriating read."
21,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78792-cat,5,"When I was pregnant with my daughter, I was obsessed with what I consumed. I didn't just give up wine; I gave up chewing gum. I feared that my cups of early pregnancy green tea could cause spinal bifida; I meticulously removed the feta cheese from a dining hall sandwich, knowing that there was virtually no chance that institutional dairy was unpasteurized. In ""On Immunity,"" Eula Biss explores our desire to spare our children the toxicity and mortality that is their lot, and she is unsparing in her assessment of the privilege such anxieties reflect. Though it would be easy to imagine the ideal of immunity as a hermetic space, repelling the onslaught of infection through the shield of the immune system (and Biss discusses our martial metaphors for immunity as well), Biss emphasizes the collective condition of vulnerability and the ideal of herd immunity as a metaphor for the body politic, where the choice to vaccinate supposedly protected privileged children improves the health of everyone. She understands vaccination not as an incursion on our inviolate bodies but rather as a choice to opt in to a social good, to mind the commons for everyone. Biss's book weaves together feminist, posthuman, and queer theory with personal anecdote and medical research, and she makes her own learning process and maternal anxieties part of the narrative. Her family members play roles in the unfolding philosophical dialogue about vaccination and its implications: her father, a doctor, and her sister, an ethicist. Her syntactical grace and unfailing clarity effortlessly lift the intellectual weight of her explorations; I do not know how she slices through these waters with such momentum given how easily she could be bogged down by her multi-faceted approach (symbolic, epidemiological, and psychological) to the subject. The one thing that was very demoralizing was reading this book during the dawn of the Trump era. Biss prognosticates about the contemporary anxieties about what it means to be a citizen in a democracy and what it means to be awash in toxicity, and she convincingly links xenophobia and racism to metaphors about bodily invasion and infection (one of my favorite things about the book). She chronicles the debunking of Robert Kennedy Jr.'s unfounded article about immunization and autism. When she was writing this, she must have imagined her inoculation moving forward into a reasonable future, helping people to see not simply the pragmatic benefits of vaccination but also its important to a more capacious view of our physical enmeshment with one another. Unfortunately, it seems we're going  in the other direction ."
22,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2796628-erica,2,"This isn't a science book. It's not a book about health care. It's not even a book about vaccination. Instead, On Immunity is a confusing collection of essays with no cohesive theme. Biss cycles between motherhood and literary analysis and never brings it all together.With the measles outbreak splashed across every newspaper, I picked up a copy of On Immunity, aiming to educate myself on vaccination, and expecting a primer on vaccines and vaccine culture. I was disappointed to discover that this book is an unorganized collection of vague musing about Biss' decision to vaccinate her son, and her obsession with Stoker's Dracula.I'm not sure what this book is, and I don't think Biss is, either. It's definitely not a comprehensive history of vaccination. I'm not even convinced that Biss is pro-vaccine. She treats the anti-vaccine movement like a valid philosophy, and that's a dangerous approach. The truth is, anti-vaxxers are not parents with valid concerns. They spread misinformation, information known to be false, and their message results in low vaccination rates that put vulnerable members of the population at risk. It's not okay. From all her ""research,"" I expected more from Biss. And was this a book about vaccination, or a book about Dracula? I'm convinced that Biss had an idea for a thesis about medicine as the modern Dracula, and it never got approved, so she turned it into a book. She practically mentions Dracula on every page. It quickly became annoying, then infuriating. The constant discussion of Dracula wasn't relevant to Biss' larger goal to discuss the sociology of vaccines. Her editor should have taken most of that out. Parts of this book struck me as insightful, specifically where Biss highlighted the contrast between mothers and doctors, and how the disconnect can impact vaccination rates, which is why I'm giving it two stars instead of one. But I would never recommend this book to anyone."

Now, returning to it after the outbreak of COVID-19, it is prophetic and helpful.

Biss's essays cover a range of social, cultural, scientific, and historical effects and implications surrounding the decision to immunize. She begins with the struggle she faced as a new mother hearing widely varying ideas of whether or not immunization is healthy and, from there, delves into the history of inoculation, the reasons people have feared the idea of vaccines throughout history and culture, and the current controversies surrounding the topic. Each essay is concisely written and well-thought-out, and you can tell that Biss has conducted thorough research. Entertainment ValueAs ideas about vaccines become more and more polarized, the issue itself has been muddied through various pseudo-scientific claims and celebrity testimonials. Biss doesn't try to give a definitive answer to the question of whether or not to vaccinate, although she is clear about her own personal beliefs. Instead, she explores every facet of the conversation, from literary to scientific to historical to pop culture. It's fascinating and easy to read - I completed it in a day.OverallI highly recommend this to anyone, parent or not, who is interested in the ongoing debate about vaccination and it's implications for community health.

If I could have highlighted every single word I would have. I am very very pro-vaccination, but I also do not have children, and so have never been confronted with the rational and irrational fears that accompany motherhood. I have never had anyone dependent upon every decision I made, and so just cannot understand what it is like to be so completely overwhelmed with data, decisions, troubles, fears, and love. This book helped me there, and has definitely also helped me to understand internationally some of the debate over vaccinations (for instance, the middle east has wildly different problems with vaccinations- mainly that at times we have embedded spies in medical crews, etc.). Biss’s discussions on the civic implications of vaccinations, how herd immunity works within the socio-economic structure of America, how we may even possibly be risking the lives of the less fortunate in our country and others by not vaccinating, but also how vaccinations have always been a source of a personal power and freedom struggle in America is amazingly thoughtful and is dealt with beautifully.

And it is my first time pregnant and I have many questions about vaccinations. This was the book for me. I was skeptical because I had read about the author's conclusion in favor of vaccinations and did not want to be persuaded under false pretenses, but I feel like Biss was very thorough in her research and as honest about her questions as any concerned parent would be. As a fan of literature, I loved her inclusion of myth and discussion of vampires. I have put Dracula on my reading list and believe I will love it as much as I did Frankenstein for its observations of humanity. I also appreciated Biss's personal stories and shared conversations. It made for much easier reading. And yes, I did come away with a new perspective on vaccinations. Avoiding them is a privilege of the wealthy and a vampiric dependency on others. As a member of the community, I prefer to do my part to increase quality of life for all, and myself at the same time, by fighting fears with rationality and an overall survey of the available information."

I expected a historical look at vaccines, past, present, and future, and that is not what I got. It is a collection of essays chock-full of the bricolage the author found during her clearly extensive research on the subject. While some of the bricolage was indeed interesting, I wish an editor had taken out some of the tangents, and created more of a logical structure to this one. It could be that these tangents would be applicable to parents, but since I am not one I can only assume that is the case. The book starts out in the manner I expected, and then veered into what one might title "" A Mother's Search for Peace of Mind.""

It's easy to just leave it at 'well they're idiots' when thinking about why people don't vaccinate or provide other types of medical care for their children. But leaving it at that does the issue a disservice. Eula suggests that these actions are the consequence of mother-blaming, consumerism in healthcare, a particularly American desire to be completely free of dependence on others, and successful opportunists who have understood this and capitalized on addressing what nobody else will: We all want to live an ideal. Not vaccinating and bucking the medical system in general fulfills the ideals of individualism and purity."

She goes on and on about her son, his birth, his vaccines, his allergies, etc. Please! You should just go ahead and write a memoir about your tendencies as an overprotective helicopter mom.

Its central thesis, that immunity is ""a shared space,"" one that inextricably binds us together, is of course incredibly prescient, something that we're all coming to understand day after day right now. But this book also does so much more, expanding the boundaries of how I think of health and vaccination and its relationship to individualism, capitalism, and language—and also what I thought was possible for a book to do. “Candide and his friends—who have been imprisoned and prostituted, who have suffered syphilis and the plague—work together on a small plot of land where they enjoy the fruits of the garden.The conclusion of Candide is masterful, according to Flaubert, because it is “as stupid as life itself.” My sister and I both remember where we were when we read Candide for the first time, but neither of us is sure of what to make of the ending. Or at least my sister is not sure at midnight, which is when I ask her to interpret Candide. “You should just say you don’t know what it means,” she advises me sleepily. I do not know what it means. I want it to mean that the garden in which we work when we are no longer optimistic is not a retreat from the world, but a place where we cultivate the world.” "

How microorganisms are part of us and how our personal immune system is also part of a collective human immune system. To me, this was the key takeaway from the book; as someone who needed no convincing that vaccines are essential in our fight against disease.The book does not pull back punches in its criticisms of the medical community.

But I was already proven wrong few pages in. Coming from a viewpoint of a mother, Bliss weaved together important scientific facts, philosophy, history, and even sociology in discussing vaccination and the debate surrounding it. In her essays, Bliss writes about immunity in the context of our own communities, beyond one’s individual domain, and how it fits in the narrative of the history of the world. While it shows the importance of vaccination, Bliss was thoughtful yet incisive in analyzing the arguments of those who choose not to vaccinate their children. Their sides weren’t included for the sake of presenting both sides, but also for us to understand where they are coming from and why they are wrong. There is a certain kind of calm in the prose, the type that invites a reader to assess one’s understanding of the world. For example, there’s a part where she said that wealthier countries “have the luxury of entertaining fears the rest of the world cannot afford.” Wow.I believe this is an important book to read in these trying times."
44,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10762842-nicole-r,1,"The measles vaccine, MMR, is getting some major press time lately. It seems like many people are questioning the safety/wisdom of vaccines and many parents are choosing not to vaccinate their children. I openly admit that I am pro-vaccine. Do I recognize that there are some potentially serious side effects? Yes. Do I recognize that those side effects have been greatly reduced over recent decades as science has progressed? Yes. Do I think that the benefits of vaccinations outweigh the risks? Yes.While I think there are some very convincing arguments as to why certain parents chose not to vaccinate, I am often appalled at the downright lies and misinformation that permeate this argument and seem to take on a life of their own. I picked up this book hoping that it would provide some solid rebuttals to the common anti-vaccine arguments with an added connection of how this mother navigated the waters when making decisions for her own child.I was extremely disappointed.This book contains very few scientific facts about the safety and risks of vaccines. And by ""very few"", I mean like maybe two. Instead, it is a rambling account of what the author thinks vaccines mean to society and the history of how vaccines came to be so widespread. This could be interesting, I like social science and history, and she started strong with an interesting comparison to immunity in Greek mythology (Achilles, anyone?), but she quickly lost me as she bounced from topic to topic without any structure. It seemed like she didn't even know where she was going next but, instead, just wrote about whatever popped into her head. She also focused extensively (or, at least it felt extensively) on the comparison of immortality (which she poorly attempted to connect to vaccinations) to how vampires are portrayed in mainstream media. From Dracula to Bela Lugosi to True Blood and Twilight, the portrayal of vampires mirrors how society feels about vaccines. What?!? Does that mean that society really wishes we could sparkle in the sunlight?! (Okay, that may actually be a valid point). It was just weird. And based on poor logic. The author annoyed me as well. It becomes painfully clear that this is one of those parents who is scared of everything her child comes into contact with. She is the mother who reads crazy blogs, accepts them as gospel, and then knee-jerk reacts to them. She came across as flaky, an over-disinfecter to ensure her child's world is germ-free, and basically someone I would never be friends with but would roll my eyes at in public.I could go on and on about the ways this book annoyed me. It adds nothing to the vaccination debate outside of soundbite quotes and illogical analogies. I highly recommend not reading this book and instead finding something with even a modicum of fact or actual research."

But you can't respect the decision - it's an unnecessary risk."" - Paul Offit, pediatrician/author/vaccine inventor.Biss writes from the perspective of what we call at work, ""the vaccine hesitant parent."" They're not sure they want every vaccine, and they're not sure they want them for their child right here, right now. They've heard things, read things. They're not vaccine-preventable disease epidemiologists (like me), they might not have access to peer-reviewed journal articles, and they may not even be able to grok the vaccine schedule the CDC publishes or the simplified, colorful version put out by their state health department, or even the short list on their child's preschool's website. This is highly understandable because I spend part of every week explaining it to doctors and nurses - the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine catch-up schedule is a nightmare of minimum ages and intervals.At work, it's ground into us over and over that ""vaccine hesitant"" =/= ""anti-vaxxer."" Which makes perfect sense: asking a question about preservatives in vaccines does not mean you don't want to vaccinate your child, it means that you've heard or read some concerning things about thimerosal (probably from anti-vaxxers) and want to know what's up. They want reassurance, an explanation. They do not want a shout-y pediatrician or nurse snapping ""because I said so!"" (Which sounds like a ridiculous response until you've met a lot of health care professionals.)Biss interweaves her own journey through childbirth and motherhood with the anti-vaccine movements of the past and present, meditating on the whys and wherefores of public health. Who needs it? Who thinks they don't need it? A lot of her ponderings dovetail neatly with an article published this week, What the Measles Epidemic Really Says About America; both mention Susan Sontag's ""Illness as Metaphor"" and ""AIDS and Its Metaphors,"" both discuss the NIMBYism of anti-vaxxers, the rise of the individual as preeminent in health care, and distrust of the government.I found this incredibly engaging and readable, especially considering that it's languished on my to-read list long enough that I've forgotten where I heard of it or who recommended it to me. I suspect it was someone local or at work - the book was published by the press my best friend interned for in college, a local company, and Biss received a Minnesota State Arts Board Operating Support Grant."
46,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/962663-karen,5,"Biss writes a book about immunity that dwells in the intersection between objectivity and subjectivity, which makes sense, given she is the child of a physician and a poet. I love this book. I wanted to race through it because it was smart, beautiful and poignant. But I forced myself to slow down for the same reasons. Biss investigates the history of inoculation through three primary methods: she explores key historical detail about events, researchers and advocates (such as the development of small pox inoculation); she explores the metaphors in the language and the symbolism in the actions (war as a metaphor for illness and metaphorical views of germs, viruses, toxicity, disease and filth); and she shares her own journey as a mother trying to protect her own health and the health of her child (her son has severe allergies). Biss writes a book that's immensely complex; however, her prose illuminates as she parses these complexities. Other reviewers compare her to Sontag and Didion, but I see her doing work similar to Sachs, Wilson, and other public intellectuals. She's insightful and articulate. Some of the sections directly take on the anti-vax movement, but she doesn't scold. Biss tries to understand how people on various sides of the issue form their arguments. Many sections of the book investigate how emotion and perception contribute to opinion and policy. For example, I can see quite clearly how people in Africa rely on emotion, perception and bias to resist inoculation efforts by foreigners. This makes me wonder how I might be blind to my own ""reasonable"" conclusions about inoculations and more broadly how nonscientific elements influence US policies about inoculations. Biss also brings in works from the humanities. Readers will encounter passages from _Dracula_, _Alice and Wonderland_ and _Candide_ as well as quotes from Susan Sontag's parallel works about illness in general and AIDS specifically as cultural metaphors. Rachel Carson's _Silent Spring_ makes an argument that people and their environment are intertwined. I enjoyed this book so much, I'm tempted to reread it immediately.

Vaccination, in my line of work, is one of our front-line infectious disease prevention tools right behind handwashing and covering your cough/sneeze. It protects not only the individual but also those who cannot be immunized (infants, those with compromised immune systems, etc) from diseases that can take a huge toll in mortality and morbidity. A world where we lose that herd immunity due to ""anti-vaxxers"" which allows diseases like measles (a disease that killed tens of thousands of children in the pre-vaccine era of the 20th century) to run rampant is truly terrifying to me. Biss looks at a lot of her own fears and those of other mothers and then collates/arranges/dissects her research.

I was most interested in Biss's convincing speculations about the metaphors that distort our thinking when it comes to vaccination, disease, and health. Biss the author is a rationalist, but Biss the mother (of one young son) has experienced enough anxious fear that she is completely snark-free when it comes to the anti-vaccine crowd. She suggests an interesting history here: a few centuries ago, Westerners worried most about ""filth""; post-germ theory, they worried about germs; today, with germs under greater control than ever in human history, we worry about ""toxins""--by which we mean (though the usage is inaccurate) poisons we've produced via our own scientific ingenuity. Biss also has some striking things to say about our tendency to draw illogical boundaries between what we deem to be ""self"" and ""nonself."" ""Nonself,"" she shows, is very often a misnomer. This is a book just about everyone should read if they want to be smarter about certain urgent cultural conversations."

It answers a question I've had for some time without really realizing: why is it that so many (almost uniformly) white, upper- class women with college degrees and otherwise progressive politics believe they shouldn't vaccinate their children? In a series of penetrating essays, Biss pulls back the layers of the anti-vaccination movement throughout the last 100 years to expose its roots in class and race issues, the marginalization of women in medicine and our chronic inability to see ourselves as members of a larger community. Unfortunately the second half of the book tosses all of that out the window and becomes a series of personal essays about her birth and her son's infant medical care, where a whole host of the author's personal neuroses are put on display: from her year(!) of hand-wringing over her need to receive a blood transfusion while giving birth to her fervent paranoid belief that her doctors are attempting to ""punish"" her and her child for questioning orthodox medical science. Blehhh. And you were doing so well, too."

This, for me, is one of those books that inspires me to be a better reader and a better thinker. It's a short book but she crams a lot of thinking in there and it's clear she did a ton of research before writing this contemplation. I'm not really sure what to call this book...an essay? I do wonder if this is the sort of book she intended to write when she started her research and note-taking. In any case, with such disparate sources making up her body of research she did an impressive job of distilling her thoughts and reflections and somehow making this thing hang together and be readable. Yet, because there is so much here, I will probably be reading it again with a pencil in hand. One little thought: as a researcher myself, I thoroughly appreciated the tears that can result when one falls down the rabbit hole..."

It does no good to cite science or statistics in persuading for or against vaccination on the current schedule--it feels as though both ideological sides of the argument are armed with their own set of figures and reciting them only leads to all parties becoming further entrenched in their own perspective. Science alone is not enough to persuade. Instead, with gorgeous prose in brief chapters, Biss looks at the concept of vaccination through a variety of lenses: historical, scientific, personal, political, ethical, and philosophical. Through an accretion of evidence, while concluding that vaccination is our best bet, she finds and acknowledges the shared experience in our struggle to come to peace with the prickly question of whether or not to vaccinate our children."

But I found it to be a very smart and measured contemplation of the ways in which we view our bodies, health and illness, our immune systems—the term is recent, a 1970s construct—and particularly the subject of vaccinations. Within that, she brings in a lot of interesting cultural touchpoints: Bram Stoker’s Dracula, Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring, the history of inoculation, and the etymology of the metaphors we use for disease and the body—it’s a little surprising to note how many of the terms come from warfare. Or maybe it’s not. As someone who has a very uneasy relationship to doctors and medicine and illness, I found the book surprisingly reassuring."

On Immunity takes an academic, literary approach to that question and comes up with a variety of illuminating answers, or rather, the various pieces that constitute a nebulous, partial answer. So much about the current debate that seems novel actually has historical precedent, such as the tendency of the wealthy to rely on the less wealthy to bolster their health via herd immunity. But beyond that, On Immunity is a meditation on an individual's body in relationship to the community and what underscores our beliefs about health.

59,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2597121-laura-hoffman-brauman,4,"In On Immunity: An Inoculation, Eula Biss looks at the concepts of immunization/vaccination and immunity from both a scientific, social, and historical perspective. She often writes from the perspective of a mother, anxious about the potential dangers that could impact her young son - from the actual illness to the concerns that people have about vaccinations. Her book is extremely well researched, but also comes across as very relatable as she sorts out what she sees in the media and digs in to the data behind it. The book came out in 2014 and in sections references various flu outbreaks/pandemics - it is impossible not to draw parallels between the scenarios she describes and the COVID outbreak. Some of her discussion on vaccination/precautions taken not only to protect the individual but for the good of society are particularly relevant when considering the current situation. Biss is a very strong writer and makes the science of this accessible. She has a clear point of view, but doesn't come across as preachy - she looks at both sides of an issue and builds her case. I appreciated the literary references in here, but from reading other reviews, I know that some readers felt it distracted from the book. "

A LITTLE bit too even-handed with antivaxxers (some things should not be treated equally!), but honestly I can extend compassion to the fears these people hold, even if I think they lack empathy and good sense. At least she very much does not come down on their side."
62,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1288876-julie-g,5,"WritingAbsolutely superb. Biss's essays cover a range of social, cultural, scientific, and historical effects and implications surrounding the decision to immunize. She begins with the struggle she faced as a new mother hearing widely varying ideas of whether or not immunization is healthy and, from there, delves into the history of inoculation, the reasons people have feared the idea of vaccines throughout history and culture, and the current controversies surrounding the topic. Each essay is concisely written and well-thought-out, and you can tell that Biss has conducted thorough research. Entertainment ValueAs ideas about vaccines become more and more polarized, the issue itself has been muddied through various pseudo-scientific claims and celebrity testimonials. Biss doesn't try to give a definitive answer to the question of whether or not to vaccinate, although she is clear about her own personal beliefs. Instead, she explores every facet of the conversation, from literary to scientific to historical to pop culture. It's fascinating and easy to read - I completed it in a day.OverallI highly recommend this to anyone, parent or not, who is interested in the ongoing debate about vaccination and it's implications for community health. I feel like I learned a great deal and was excited by the number of discussions the essays in this book sparked among my friends. I highly recommend getting a copy and checking it out."

If I could have highlighted every single word I would have. I am very very pro-vaccination, but I also do not have children, and so have never been confronted with the rational and irrational fears that accompany motherhood. I have never had anyone dependent upon every decision I made, and so just cannot understand what it is like to be so completely overwhelmed with data, decisions, troubles, fears, and love. This book helped me there, and has definitely also helped me to understand internationally some of the debate over vaccinations (for instance, the middle east has wildly different problems with vaccinations- mainly that at times we have embedded spies in medical crews, etc.). Biss’s discussions on the civic implications of vaccinations, how herd immunity works within the socio-economic structure of America, how we may even possibly be risking the lives of the less fortunate in our country and others by not vaccinating, but also how vaccinations have always been a source of a personal power and freedom struggle in America is amazingly thoughtful and is dealt with beautifully. She put the whole conversation in terms that I have never before realized or been able to verbalize and she did so with wonderful prose. I whole-heartedly recommend."

And it is my first time pregnant and I have many questions about vaccinations. This was the book for me. I was skeptical because I had read about the author's conclusion in favor of vaccinations and did not want to be persuaded under false pretenses, but I feel like Biss was very thorough in her research and as honest about her questions as any concerned parent would be. As a fan of literature, I loved her inclusion of myth and discussion of vampires. I have put Dracula on my reading list and believe I will love it as much as I did Frankenstein for its observations of humanity. I also appreciated Biss's personal stories and shared conversations. It made for much easier reading. And yes, I did come away with a new perspective on vaccinations. Avoiding them is a privilege of the wealthy and a vampiric dependency on others. As a member of the community, I prefer to do my part to increase quality of life for all, and myself at the same time, by fighting fears with rationality and an overall survey of the available information."

I expected a historical look at vaccines, past, present, and future, and that is not what I got. It is a collection of essays chock-full of the bricolage the author found during her clearly extensive research on the subject. While some of the bricolage was indeed interesting, I wish an editor had taken out some of the tangents, and created more of a logical structure to this one. It could be that these tangents would be applicable to parents, but since I am not one I can only assume that is the case. The book starts out in the manner I expected, and then veered into what one might title "" A Mother's Search for Peace of Mind."" Still I learned things and connected several dots, so this was certainly worth a read as it is a good introduction to the topic. I'll be looking for other books that cover the history I was in search of, so if you know of a good one please do let me know."

It's easy to just leave it at 'well they're idiots' when thinking about why people don't vaccinate or provide other types of medical care for their children. But leaving it at that does the issue a disservice. Eula suggests that these actions are the consequence of mother-blaming, consumerism in healthcare, a particularly American desire to be completely free of dependence on others, and successful opportunists who have understood this and capitalized on addressing what nobody else will: We all want to live an ideal. Not vaccinating and bucking the medical system in general fulfills the ideals of individualism and purity."

I still do not know what all the ranting was about. It talks a great deal about vaccines and why people are afraid of them, about Dracula, and about her son, but I still don’t know what she was trying to get at. She goes on and on about her son, his birth, his vaccines, his allergies, etc. Please! You should just go ahead and write a memoir about your tendencies as an overprotective helicopter mom. I decided to read this book because it was considered one of the best 10 books of 2014 by the New York Times.

Its central thesis, that immunity is ""a shared space,"" one that inextricably binds us together, is of course incredibly prescient, something that we're all coming to understand day after day right now. But this book also does so much more, expanding the boundaries of how I think of health and vaccination and its relationship to individualism, capitalism, and language—and also what I thought was possible for a book to do. “Candide and his friends—who have been imprisoned and prostituted, who have suffered syphilis and the plague—work together on a small plot of land where they enjoy the fruits of the garden.The conclusion of Candide is masterful, according to Flaubert, because it is “as stupid as life itself.” My sister and I both remember where we were when we read Candide for the first time, but neither of us is sure of what to make of the ending. Or at least my sister is not sure at midnight, which is when I ask her to interpret Candide. “You should just say you don’t know what it means,” she advises me sleepily. I do not know what it means. I want it to mean that the garden in which we work when we are no longer optimistic is not a retreat from the world, but a place where we cultivate the world.” "

We are given a balanced layman's view of immunity in general, with a particular focus on vaccination. In short chapters she delves into the past and present of vaccination to illustrate the reasons for the way things are in the world of vaccination.One of the overarching themes of the book is how the individual human being exists in a sort of continuum, with other human beings but also as part of nature. How microorganisms are part of us and how our personal immune system is also part of a collective human immune system. To me, this was the key takeaway from the book; as someone who needed no convincing that vaccines are essential in our fight against disease.The book does not pull back punches in its criticisms of the medical community. She makes it clear that medicines suffers from issues brought about by a lack of empathy.Highly recommend. Accessible. Balanced. Nuanced."

But I was already proven wrong few pages in. Coming from a viewpoint of a mother, Bliss weaved together important scientific facts, philosophy, history, and even sociology in discussing vaccination and the debate surrounding it. In her essays, Bliss writes about immunity in the context of our own communities, beyond one’s individual domain, and how it fits in the narrative of the history of the world. While it shows the importance of vaccination, Bliss was thoughtful yet incisive in analyzing the arguments of those who choose not to vaccinate their children. Their sides weren’t included for the sake of presenting both sides, but also for us to understand where they are coming from and why they are wrong. There is a certain kind of calm in the prose, the type that invites a reader to assess one’s understanding of the world. For example, there’s a part where she said that wealthier countries “have the luxury of entertaining fears the rest of the world cannot afford.” Wow.I believe this is an important book to read in these trying times."
74,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10762842-nicole-r,1,"The measles vaccine, MMR, is getting some major press time lately. It seems like many people are questioning the safety/wisdom of vaccines and many parents are choosing not to vaccinate their children. I openly admit that I am pro-vaccine. Do I recognize that there are some potentially serious side effects? Yes. Do I recognize that those side effects have been greatly reduced over recent decades as science has progressed? Yes. Do I think that the benefits of vaccinations outweigh the risks? Yes.While I think there are some very convincing arguments as to why certain parents chose not to vaccinate, I am often appalled at the downright lies and misinformation that permeate this argument and seem to take on a life of their own. I picked up this book hoping that it would provide some solid rebuttals to the common anti-vaccine arguments with an added connection of how this mother navigated the waters when making decisions for her own child.I was extremely disappointed.This book contains very few scientific facts about the safety and risks of vaccines. And by ""very few"", I mean like maybe two. Instead, it is a rambling account of what the author thinks vaccines mean to society and the history of how vaccines came to be so widespread. This could be interesting, I like social science and history, and she started strong with an interesting comparison to immunity in Greek mythology (Achilles, anyone?), but she quickly lost me as she bounced from topic to topic without any structure. It seemed like she didn't even know where she was going next but, instead, just wrote about whatever popped into her head. She also focused extensively (or, at least it felt extensively) on the comparison of immortality (which she poorly attempted to connect to vaccinations) to how vampires are portrayed in mainstream media. From Dracula to Bela Lugosi to True Blood and Twilight, the portrayal of vampires mirrors how society feels about vaccines. What?!? Does that mean that society really wishes we could sparkle in the sunlight?! (Okay, that may actually be a valid point). It was just weird. And based on poor logic. The author annoyed me as well. It becomes painfully clear that this is one of those parents who is scared of everything her child comes into contact with. She is the mother who reads crazy blogs, accepts them as gospel, and then knee-jerk reacts to them. She came across as flaky, an over-disinfecter to ensure her child's world is germ-free, and basically someone I would never be friends with but would roll my eyes at in public.I could go on and on about the ways this book annoyed me. It adds nothing to the vaccination debate outside of soundbite quotes and illogical analogies. I highly recommend not reading this book and instead finding something with even a modicum of fact or actual research."
75,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/117566-mauri,5,"""You can respect the fear. The fear of vaccines is understandable. But you can't respect the decision - it's an unnecessary risk."" - Paul Offit, pediatrician/author/vaccine inventor.Biss writes from the perspective of what we call at work, ""the vaccine hesitant parent."" They're not sure they want every vaccine, and they're not sure they want them for their child right here, right now. They've heard things, read things. They're not vaccine-preventable disease epidemiologists (like me), they might not have access to peer-reviewed journal articles, and they may not even be able to grok the vaccine schedule the CDC publishes or the simplified, colorful version put out by their state health department, or even the short list on their child's preschool's website. This is highly understandable because I spend part of every week explaining it to doctors and nurses - the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine catch-up schedule is a nightmare of minimum ages and intervals.At work, it's ground into us over and over that ""vaccine hesitant"" =/= ""anti-vaxxer."" Which makes perfect sense: asking a question about preservatives in vaccines does not mean you don't want to vaccinate your child, it means that you've heard or read some concerning things about thimerosal (probably from anti-vaxxers) and want to know what's up. They want reassurance, an explanation. They do not want a shout-y pediatrician or nurse snapping ""because I said so!"" (Which sounds like a ridiculous response until you've met a lot of health care professionals.)Biss interweaves her own journey through childbirth and motherhood with the anti-vaccine movements of the past and present, meditating on the whys and wherefores of public health. Who needs it? Who thinks they don't need it? A lot of her ponderings dovetail neatly with an article published this week, What the Measles Epidemic Really Says About America; both mention Susan Sontag's ""Illness as Metaphor"" and ""AIDS and Its Metaphors,"" both discuss the NIMBYism of anti-vaxxers, the rise of the individual as preeminent in health care, and distrust of the government.I found this incredibly engaging and readable, especially considering that it's languished on my to-read list long enough that I've forgotten where I heard of it or who recommended it to me. I suspect it was someone local or at work - the book was published by the press my best friend interned for in college, a local company, and Biss received a Minnesota State Arts Board Operating Support Grant."
76,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/962663-karen,5,"Biss writes a book about immunity that dwells in the intersection between objectivity and subjectivity, which makes sense, given she is the child of a physician and a poet. I love this book. I wanted to race through it because it was smart, beautiful and poignant. But I forced myself to slow down for the same reasons. Biss investigates the history of inoculation through three primary methods: she explores key historical detail about events, researchers and advocates (such as the development of small pox inoculation); she explores the metaphors in the language and the symbolism in the actions (war as a metaphor for illness and metaphorical views of germs, viruses, toxicity, disease and filth); and she shares her own journey as a mother trying to protect her own health and the health of her child (her son has severe allergies). Biss writes a book that's immensely complex; however, her prose illuminates as she parses these complexities. Other reviewers compare her to Sontag and Didion, but I see her doing work similar to Sachs, Wilson, and other public intellectuals. She's insightful and articulate. Some of the sections directly take on the anti-vax movement, but she doesn't scold. Biss tries to understand how people on various sides of the issue form their arguments. Many sections of the book investigate how emotion and perception contribute to opinion and policy. For example, I can see quite clearly how people in Africa rely on emotion, perception and bias to resist inoculation efforts by foreigners. This makes me wonder how I might be blind to my own ""reasonable"" conclusions about inoculations and more broadly how nonscientific elements influence US policies about inoculations. Biss also brings in works from the humanities. Readers will encounter passages from _Dracula_, _Alice and Wonderland_ and _Candide_ as well as quotes from Susan Sontag's parallel works about illness in general and AIDS specifically as cultural metaphors. Rachel Carson's _Silent Spring_ makes an argument that people and their environment are intertwined. I enjoyed this book so much, I'm tempted to reread it immediately. It's already proved relevant to today's news. I was reading comments in response to a _Washington Post_ news story about immigration, and many were fearful that immigrants sans inoculations were going to bring disease into the US."

I was most interested in Biss's convincing speculations about the metaphors that distort our thinking when it comes to vaccination, disease, and health. Biss the author is a rationalist, but Biss the mother (of one young son) has experienced enough anxious fear that she is completely snark-free when it comes to the anti-vaccine crowd. She suggests an interesting history here: a few centuries ago, Westerners worried most about ""filth""; post-germ theory, they worried about germs; today, with germs under greater control than ever in human history, we worry about ""toxins""--by which we mean (though the usage is inaccurate) poisons we've produced via our own scientific ingenuity. Biss also has some striking things to say about our tendency to draw illogical boundaries between what we deem to be ""self"" and ""nonself."" ""Nonself,"" she shows, is very often a misnomer. This is a book just about everyone should read if they want to be smarter about certain urgent cultural conversations."

It answers a question I've had for some time without really realizing: why is it that so many (almost uniformly) white, upper- class women with college degrees and otherwise progressive politics believe they shouldn't vaccinate their children? In a series of penetrating essays, Biss pulls back the layers of the anti-vaccination movement throughout the last 100 years to expose its roots in class and race issues, the marginalization of women in medicine and our chronic inability to see ourselves as members of a larger community. Unfortunately the second half of the book tosses all of that out the window and becomes a series of personal essays about her birth and her son's infant medical care, where a whole host of the author's personal neuroses are put on display: from her year(!) of hand-wringing over her need to receive a blood transfusion while giving birth to her fervent paranoid belief that her doctors are attempting to ""punish"" her and her child for questioning orthodox medical science. Blehhh. And you were doing so well, too."

This, for me, is one of those books that inspires me to be a better reader and a better thinker. It's a short book but she crams a lot of thinking in there and it's clear she did a ton of research before writing this contemplation. I'm not really sure what to call this book...an essay? I do wonder if this is the sort of book she intended to write when she started her research and note-taking. In any case, with such disparate sources making up her body of research she did an impressive job of distilling her thoughts and reflections and somehow making this thing hang together and be readable. Yet, because there is so much here, I will probably be reading it again with a pencil in hand. One little thought: as a researcher myself, I thoroughly appreciated the tears that can result when one falls down the rabbit hole..."
81,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2375647-andrea-schwalm-stolz,5,"I think that Ms. Biss is onto something important with this book. It does no good to cite science or statistics in persuading for or against vaccination on the current schedule--it feels as though both ideological sides of the argument are armed with their own set of figures and reciting them only leads to all parties becoming further entrenched in their own perspective. Science alone is not enough to persuade. Instead, with gorgeous prose in brief chapters, Biss looks at the concept of vaccination through a variety of lenses: historical, scientific, personal, political, ethical, and philosophical. Through an accretion of evidence, while concluding that vaccination is our best bet, she finds and acknowledges the shared experience in our struggle to come to peace with the prickly question of whether or not to vaccinate our children."

But I found it to be a very smart and measured contemplation of the ways in which we view our bodies, health and illness, our immune systems—the term is recent, a 1970s construct—and particularly the subject of vaccinations. Within that, she brings in a lot of interesting cultural touchpoints: Bram Stoker’s Dracula, Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring, the history of inoculation, and the etymology of the metaphors we use for disease and the body—it’s a little surprising to note how many of the terms come from warfare. Or maybe it’s not. As someone who has a very uneasy relationship to doctors and medicine and illness, I found the book surprisingly reassuring."

On Immunity takes an academic, literary approach to that question and comes up with a variety of illuminating answers, or rather, the various pieces that constitute a nebulous, partial answer. So much about the current debate that seems novel actually has historical precedent, such as the tendency of the wealthy to rely on the less wealthy to bolster their health via herd immunity. But beyond that, On Immunity is a meditation on an individual's body in relationship to the community and what underscores our beliefs about health. It's an enriching and pleasurable read that I recommend heartily. "

89,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2597121-laura-hoffman-brauman,4,"In On Immunity: An Inoculation, Eula Biss looks at the concepts of immunization/vaccination and immunity from both a scientific, social, and historical perspective. She often writes from the perspective of a mother, anxious about the potential dangers that could impact her young son - from the actual illness to the concerns that people have about vaccinations. Her book is extremely well researched, but also comes across as very relatable as she sorts out what she sees in the media and digs in to the data behind it. The book came out in 2014 and in sections references various flu outbreaks/pandemics - it is impossible not to draw parallels between the scenarios she describes and the COVID outbreak. Some of her discussion on vaccination/precautions taken not only to protect the individual but for the good of society are particularly relevant when considering the current situation. Biss is a very strong writer and makes the science of this accessible. She has a clear point of view, but doesn't come across as preachy - she looks at both sides of an issue and builds her case. I appreciated the literary references in here, but from reading other reviews, I know that some readers felt it distracted from the book. "

I did want to contemplate what inoculation is and how immunity is symbolized and contemplated in culture and there were threads in here that hinted at deeper meaning, but it just never really hit the mark for me."
91,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5706847-kellie,5,"Wow, it's weird reading this during Quarantimes. But excellent. It's really good stuff. A LITTLE bit too even-handed with antivaxxers (some things should not be treated equally!), but honestly I can extend compassion to the fears these people hold, even if I think they lack empathy and good sense. At least she very much does not come down on their side."
92,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1288876-julie-g,5,"WritingAbsolutely superb. Biss's essays cover a range of social, cultural, scientific, and historical effects and implications surrounding the decision to immunize. She begins with the struggle she faced as a new mother hearing widely varying ideas of whether or not immunization is healthy and, from there, delves into the history of inoculation, the reasons people have feared the idea of vaccines throughout history and culture, and the current controversies surrounding the topic. Each essay is concisely written and well-thought-out, and you can tell that Biss has conducted thorough research. Entertainment ValueAs ideas about vaccines become more and more polarized, the issue itself has been muddied through various pseudo-scientific claims and celebrity testimonials. Biss doesn't try to give a definitive answer to the question of whether or not to vaccinate, although she is clear about her own personal beliefs. Instead, she explores every facet of the conversation, from literary to scientific to historical to pop culture. It's fascinating and easy to read - I completed it in a day.OverallI highly recommend this to anyone, parent or not, who is interested in the ongoing debate about vaccination and it's implications for community health. I feel like I learned a great deal and was excited by the number of discussions the essays in this book sparked among my friends. I highly recommend getting a copy and checking it out."
93,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6316460-becky,5,"An absolute must-read no matter what side of the vaccination fence you are sitting on. If I could have highlighted every single word I would have. I am very very pro-vaccination, but I also do not have children, and so have never been confronted with the rational and irrational fears that accompany motherhood. I have never had anyone dependent upon every decision I made, and so just cannot understand what it is like to be so completely overwhelmed with data, decisions, troubles, fears, and love. This book helped me there, and has definitely also helped me to understand internationally some of the debate over vaccinations (for instance, the middle east has wildly different problems with vaccinations- mainly that at times we have embedded spies in medical crews, etc.). Biss’s discussions on the civic implications of vaccinations, how herd immunity works within the socio-economic structure of America, how we may even possibly be risking the lives of the less fortunate in our country and others by not vaccinating, but also how vaccinations have always been a source of a personal power and freedom struggle in America is amazingly thoughtful and is dealt with beautifully. She put the whole conversation in terms that I have never before realized or been able to verbalize and she did so with wonderful prose. I whole-heartedly recommend."
94,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4764870-laura-dallas,5,"I kept being surprised to find this book on so many ""best of"" lists in a variety of media. And it is my first time pregnant and I have many questions about vaccinations. This was the book for me. I was skeptical because I had read about the author's conclusion in favor of vaccinations and did not want to be persuaded under false pretenses, but I feel like Biss was very thorough in her research and as honest about her questions as any concerned parent would be. As a fan of literature, I loved her inclusion of myth and discussion of vampires. I have put Dracula on my reading list and believe I will love it as much as I did Frankenstein for its observations of humanity. I also appreciated Biss's personal stories and shared conversations. It made for much easier reading. And yes, I did come away with a new perspective on vaccinations. Avoiding them is a privilege of the wealthy and a vampiric dependency on others. As a member of the community, I prefer to do my part to increase quality of life for all, and myself at the same time, by fighting fears with rationality and an overall survey of the available information."

I expected a historical look at vaccines, past, present, and future, and that is not what I got. It is a collection of essays chock-full of the bricolage the author found during her clearly extensive research on the subject. While some of the bricolage was indeed interesting, I wish an editor had taken out some of the tangents, and created more of a logical structure to this one. It could be that these tangents would be applicable to parents, but since I am not one I can only assume that is the case. The book starts out in the manner I expected, and then veered into what one might title "" A Mother's Search for Peace of Mind."" Still I learned things and connected several dots, so this was certainly worth a read as it is a good introduction to the topic. I'll be looking for other books that cover the history I was in search of, so if you know of a good one please do let me know."

It's easy to just leave it at 'well they're idiots' when thinking about why people don't vaccinate or provide other types of medical care for their children. But leaving it at that does the issue a disservice. Eula suggests that these actions are the consequence of mother-blaming, consumerism in healthcare, a particularly American desire to be completely free of dependence on others, and successful opportunists who have understood this and capitalized on addressing what nobody else will: We all want to live an ideal. Not vaccinating and bucking the medical system in general fulfills the ideals of individualism and purity."

I still do not know what all the ranting was about. It talks a great deal about vaccines and why people are afraid of them, about Dracula, and about her son, but I still don’t know what she was trying to get at. She goes on and on about her son, his birth, his vaccines, his allergies, etc. Please! You should just go ahead and write a memoir about your tendencies as an overprotective helicopter mom. I decided to read this book because it was considered one of the best 10 books of 2014 by the New York Times.

Its central thesis, that immunity is ""a shared space,"" one that inextricably binds us together, is of course incredibly prescient, something that we're all coming to understand day after day right now. But this book also does so much more, expanding the boundaries of how I think of health and vaccination and its relationship to individualism, capitalism, and language—and also what I thought was possible for a book to do. “Candide and his friends—who have been imprisoned and prostituted, who have suffered syphilis and the plague—work together on a small plot of land where they enjoy the fruits of the garden.The conclusion of Candide is masterful, according to Flaubert, because it is “as stupid as life itself.” My sister and I both remember where we were when we read Candide for the first time, but neither of us is sure of what to make of the ending. Or at least my sister is not sure at midnight, which is when I ask her to interpret Candide. “You should just say you don’t know what it means,” she advises me sleepily. I do not know what it means. I want it to mean that the garden in which we work when we are no longer optimistic is not a retreat from the world, but a place where we cultivate the world.” "

We are given a balanced layman's view of immunity in general, with a particular focus on vaccination. In short chapters she delves into the past and present of vaccination to illustrate the reasons for the way things are in the world of vaccination.One of the overarching themes of the book is how the individual human being exists in a sort of continuum, with other human beings but also as part of nature. How microorganisms are part of us and how our personal immune system is also part of a collective human immune system. To me, this was the key takeaway from the book; as someone who needed no convincing that vaccines are essential in our fight against disease.The book does not pull back punches in its criticisms of the medical community. She makes it clear that medicines suffers from issues brought about by a lack of empathy.Highly recommend. Accessible. Balanced. Nuanced."

To do so, she draws on her personal experiences (as a mother, and as daughter of a physician), on her readings about the science of vaccination, on history, theory, and literature in this slim, thoughtful volume.

But I was already proven wrong few pages in. Coming from a viewpoint of a mother, Bliss weaved together important scientific facts, philosophy, history, and even sociology in discussing vaccination and the debate surrounding it. In her essays, Bliss writes about immunity in the context of our own communities, beyond one’s individual domain, and how it fits in the narrative of the history of the world. While it shows the importance of vaccination, Bliss was thoughtful yet incisive in analyzing the arguments of those who choose not to vaccinate their children. Their sides weren’t included for the sake of presenting both sides, but also for us to understand where they are coming from and why they are wrong. There is a certain kind of calm in the prose, the type that invites a reader to assess one’s understanding of the world. For example, there’s a part where she said that wealthier countries “have the luxury of entertaining fears the rest of the world cannot afford.” Wow.I believe this is an important book to read in these trying times."
104,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10762842-nicole-r,1,"The measles vaccine, MMR, is getting some major press time lately. It seems like many people are questioning the safety/wisdom of vaccines and many parents are choosing not to vaccinate their children. I openly admit that I am pro-vaccine. Do I recognize that there are some potentially serious side effects? Yes. Do I recognize that those side effects have been greatly reduced over recent decades as science has progressed? Yes. Do I think that the benefits of vaccinations outweigh the risks? Yes.While I think there are some very convincing arguments as to why certain parents chose not to vaccinate, I am often appalled at the downright lies and misinformation that permeate this argument and seem to take on a life of their own. I picked up this book hoping that it would provide some solid rebuttals to the common anti-vaccine arguments with an added connection of how this mother navigated the waters when making decisions for her own child.I was extremely disappointed.This book contains very few scientific facts about the safety and risks of vaccines. And by ""very few"", I mean like maybe two. Instead, it is a rambling account of what the author thinks vaccines mean to society and the history of how vaccines came to be so widespread. This could be interesting, I like social science and history, and she started strong with an interesting comparison to immunity in Greek mythology (Achilles, anyone?), but she quickly lost me as she bounced from topic to topic without any structure. It seemed like she didn't even know where she was going next but, instead, just wrote about whatever popped into her head. She also focused extensively (or, at least it felt extensively) on the comparison of immortality (which she poorly attempted to connect to vaccinations) to how vampires are portrayed in mainstream media. From Dracula to Bela Lugosi to True Blood and Twilight, the portrayal of vampires mirrors how society feels about vaccines. What?!? Does that mean that society really wishes we could sparkle in the sunlight?! (Okay, that may actually be a valid point). It was just weird. And based on poor logic. The author annoyed me as well. It becomes painfully clear that this is one of those parents who is scared of everything her child comes into contact with. She is the mother who reads crazy blogs, accepts them as gospel, and then knee-jerk reacts to them. She came across as flaky, an over-disinfecter to ensure her child's world is germ-free, and basically someone I would never be friends with but would roll my eyes at in public.I could go on and on about the ways this book annoyed me. It adds nothing to the vaccination debate outside of soundbite quotes and illogical analogies. I highly recommend not reading this book and instead finding something with even a modicum of fact or actual research."
105,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/117566-mauri,5,"""You can respect the fear. The fear of vaccines is understandable. But you can't respect the decision - it's an unnecessary risk."" - Paul Offit, pediatrician/author/vaccine inventor.Biss writes from the perspective of what we call at work, ""the vaccine hesitant parent."" They're not sure they want every vaccine, and they're not sure they want them for their child right here, right now. They've heard things, read things. They're not vaccine-preventable disease epidemiologists (like me), they might not have access to peer-reviewed journal articles, and they may not even be able to grok the vaccine schedule the CDC publishes or the simplified, colorful version put out by their state health department, or even the short list on their child's preschool's website. This is highly understandable because I spend part of every week explaining it to doctors and nurses - the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine catch-up schedule is a nightmare of minimum ages and intervals.At work, it's ground into us over and over that ""vaccine hesitant"" =/= ""anti-vaxxer."" Which makes perfect sense: asking a question about preservatives in vaccines does not mean you don't want to vaccinate your child, it means that you've heard or read some concerning things about thimerosal (probably from anti-vaxxers) and want to know what's up. They want reassurance, an explanation. They do not want a shout-y pediatrician or nurse snapping ""because I said so!"" (Which sounds like a ridiculous response until you've met a lot of health care professionals.)Biss interweaves her own journey through childbirth and motherhood with the anti-vaccine movements of the past and present, meditating on the whys and wherefores of public health. Who needs it? Who thinks they don't need it? A lot of her ponderings dovetail neatly with an article published this week, What the Measles Epidemic Really Says About America; both mention Susan Sontag's ""Illness as Metaphor"" and ""AIDS and Its Metaphors,"" both discuss the NIMBYism of anti-vaxxers, the rise of the individual as preeminent in health care, and distrust of the government.I found this incredibly engaging and readable, especially considering that it's languished on my to-read list long enough that I've forgotten where I heard of it or who recommended it to me. I suspect it was someone local or at work - the book was published by the press my best friend interned for in college, a local company, and Biss received a Minnesota State Arts Board Operating Support Grant."
106,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/962663-karen,5,"Biss writes a book about immunity that dwells in the intersection between objectivity and subjectivity, which makes sense, given she is the child of a physician and a poet. I love this book. I wanted to race through it because it was smart, beautiful and poignant. But I forced myself to slow down for the same reasons. Biss investigates the history of inoculation through three primary methods: she explores key historical detail about events, researchers and advocates (such as the development of small pox inoculation); she explores the metaphors in the language and the symbolism in the actions (war as a metaphor for illness and metaphorical views of germs, viruses, toxicity, disease and filth); and she shares her own journey as a mother trying to protect her own health and the health of her child (her son has severe allergies). Biss writes a book that's immensely complex; however, her prose illuminates as she parses these complexities. Other reviewers compare her to Sontag and Didion, but I see her doing work similar to Sachs, Wilson, and other public intellectuals. She's insightful and articulate. Some of the sections directly take on the anti-vax movement, but she doesn't scold. Biss tries to understand how people on various sides of the issue form their arguments. Many sections of the book investigate how emotion and perception contribute to opinion and policy. For example, I can see quite clearly how people in Africa rely on emotion, perception and bias to resist inoculation efforts by foreigners. This makes me wonder how I might be blind to my own ""reasonable"" conclusions about inoculations and more broadly how nonscientific elements influence US policies about inoculations. Biss also brings in works from the humanities. Readers will encounter passages from _Dracula_, _Alice and Wonderland_ and _Candide_ as well as quotes from Susan Sontag's parallel works about illness in general and AIDS specifically as cultural metaphors. Rachel Carson's _Silent Spring_ makes an argument that people and their environment are intertwined. I enjoyed this book so much, I'm tempted to reread it immediately. It's already proved relevant to today's news. I was reading comments in response to a _Washington Post_ news story about immigration, and many were fearful that immigrants sans inoculations were going to bring disease into the US."

Vaccination, in my line of work, is one of our front-line infectious disease prevention tools right behind handwashing and covering your cough/sneeze. It protects not only the individual but also those who cannot be immunized (infants, those with compromised immune systems, etc) from diseases that can take a huge toll in mortality and morbidity. A world where we lose that herd immunity due to ""anti-vaxxers"" which allows diseases like measles (a disease that killed tens of thousands of children in the pre-vaccine era of the 20th century) to run rampant is truly terrifying to me. Biss looks at a lot of her own fears and those of other mothers and then collates/arranges/dissects her research. I don't really want to comment a lot on her conclusions - because that would ruin the work of the book - but suffice to say she posits a lot of good arguments and writes it all very well.

Unfortunately the second half of the book tosses all of that out the window and becomes a series of personal essays about her birth and her son's infant medical care, where a whole host of the author's personal neuroses are put on display: from her year(!) of hand-wringing over her need to receive a blood transfusion while giving birth to her fervent paranoid belief that her doctors are attempting to ""punish"" her and her child for questioning orthodox medical science. Blehhh. And you were doing so well, too."

It's a short book but she crams a lot of thinking in there and it's clear she did a ton of research before writing this contemplation. I'm not really sure what to call this book...an essay? I do wonder if this is the sort of book she intended to write when she started her research and note-taking. In any case, with such disparate sources making up her body of research she did an impressive job of distilling her thoughts and reflections and somehow making this thing hang together and be readable.

111,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2375647-andrea-schwalm-stolz,5,"I think that Ms. Biss is onto something important with this book. It does no good to cite science or statistics in persuading for or against vaccination on the current schedule--it feels as though both ideological sides of the argument are armed with their own set of figures and reciting them only leads to all parties becoming further entrenched in their own perspective. Science alone is not enough to persuade. Instead, with gorgeous prose in brief chapters, Biss looks at the concept of vaccination through a variety of lenses: historical, scientific, personal, political, ethical, and philosophical. Through an accretion of evidence, while concluding that vaccination is our best bet, she finds and acknowledges the shared experience in our struggle to come to peace with the prickly question of whether or not to vaccinate our children."

But I found it to be a very smart and measured contemplation of the ways in which we view our bodies, health and illness, our immune systems—the term is recent, a 1970s construct—and particularly the subject of vaccinations. Within that, she brings in a lot of interesting cultural touchpoints: Bram Stoker’s Dracula, Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring, the history of inoculation, and the etymology of the metaphors we use for disease and the body—it’s a little surprising to note how many of the terms come from warfare. Or maybe it’s not. As someone who has a very uneasy relationship to doctors and medicine and illness, I found the book surprisingly reassuring."

On Immunity takes an academic, literary approach to that question and comes up with a variety of illuminating answers, or rather, the various pieces that constitute a nebulous, partial answer. So much about the current debate that seems novel actually has historical precedent, such as the tendency of the wealthy to rely on the less wealthy to bolster their health via herd immunity. But beyond that, On Immunity is a meditation on an individual's body in relationship to the community and what underscores our beliefs about health. It's an enriching and pleasurable read that I recommend heartily. "

Never have I encountered work that made me literally reconsider what it is to have a body. Her examinations and interrogations of immunity, inoculation, the body social v the body politic, vampire as metaphor, community dependence, wealth and health—they are done with the most thoughtful and empathetic and genuine inquiry that Biss is known for.

119,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2597121-laura-hoffman-brauman,4,"In On Immunity: An Inoculation, Eula Biss looks at the concepts of immunization/vaccination and immunity from both a scientific, social, and historical perspective. She often writes from the perspective of a mother, anxious about the potential dangers that could impact her young son - from the actual illness to the concerns that people have about vaccinations. Her book is extremely well researched, but also comes across as very relatable as she sorts out what she sees in the media and digs in to the data behind it. The book came out in 2014 and in sections references various flu outbreaks/pandemics - it is impossible not to draw parallels between the scenarios she describes and the COVID outbreak. Some of her discussion on vaccination/precautions taken not only to protect the individual but for the good of society are particularly relevant when considering the current situation. Biss is a very strong writer and makes the science of this accessible. She has a clear point of view, but doesn't come across as preachy - she looks at both sides of an issue and builds her case. I appreciated the literary references in here, but from reading other reviews, I know that some readers felt it distracted from the book. "
120,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1045774-mehrsa,4,"I think this book was reaching for Sontag's illness metaphors and it was certainly relevant as we all await herd immunity, but it was not ultimately moving. I did want to contemplate what inoculation is and how immunity is symbolized and contemplated in culture and there were threads in here that hinted at deeper meaning, but it just never really hit the mark for me."
121,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5706847-kellie,5,"Wow, it's weird reading this during Quarantimes. But excellent. It's really good stuff. A LITTLE bit too even-handed with antivaxxers (some things should not be treated equally!), but honestly I can extend compassion to the fears these people hold, even if I think they lack empathy and good sense. At least she very much does not come down on their side."
122,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1288876-julie-g,5,"WritingAbsolutely superb. Biss's essays cover a range of social, cultural, scientific, and historical effects and implications surrounding the decision to immunize. She begins with the struggle she faced as a new mother hearing widely varying ideas of whether or not immunization is healthy and, from there, delves into the history of inoculation, the reasons people have feared the idea of vaccines throughout history and culture, and the current controversies surrounding the topic. Each essay is concisely written and well-thought-out, and you can tell that Biss has conducted thorough research. Entertainment ValueAs ideas about vaccines become more and more polarized, the issue itself has been muddied through various pseudo-scientific claims and celebrity testimonials. Biss doesn't try to give a definitive answer to the question of whether or not to vaccinate, although she is clear about her own personal beliefs. Instead, she explores every facet of the conversation, from literary to scientific to historical to pop culture. It's fascinating and easy to read - I completed it in a day.OverallI highly recommend this to anyone, parent or not, who is interested in the ongoing debate about vaccination and it's implications for community health. I feel like I learned a great deal and was excited by the number of discussions the essays in this book sparked among my friends. I highly recommend getting a copy and checking it out."
123,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6316460-becky,5,"An absolute must-read no matter what side of the vaccination fence you are sitting on. If I could have highlighted every single word I would have. I am very very pro-vaccination, but I also do not have children, and so have never been confronted with the rational and irrational fears that accompany motherhood. I have never had anyone dependent upon every decision I made, and so just cannot understand what it is like to be so completely overwhelmed with data, decisions, troubles, fears, and love. This book helped me there, and has definitely also helped me to understand internationally some of the debate over vaccinations (for instance, the middle east has wildly different problems with vaccinations- mainly that at times we have embedded spies in medical crews, etc.). Biss’s discussions on the civic implications of vaccinations, how herd immunity works within the socio-economic structure of America, how we may even possibly be risking the lives of the less fortunate in our country and others by not vaccinating, but also how vaccinations have always been a source of a personal power and freedom struggle in America is amazingly thoughtful and is dealt with beautifully. She put the whole conversation in terms that I have never before realized or been able to verbalize and she did so with wonderful prose. I whole-heartedly recommend."

And it is my first time pregnant and I have many questions about vaccinations. This was the book for me. I was skeptical because I had read about the author's conclusion in favor of vaccinations and did not want to be persuaded under false pretenses, but I feel like Biss was very thorough in her research and as honest about her questions as any concerned parent would be. As a fan of literature, I loved her inclusion of myth and discussion of vampires. I have put Dracula on my reading list and believe I will love it as much as I did Frankenstein for its observations of humanity. I also appreciated Biss's personal stories and shared conversations. It made for much easier reading. And yes, I did come away with a new perspective on vaccinations. Avoiding them is a privilege of the wealthy and a vampiric dependency on others. As a member of the community, I prefer to do my part to increase quality of life for all, and myself at the same time, by fighting fears with rationality and an overall survey of the available information."

I expected a historical look at vaccines, past, present, and future, and that is not what I got. It is a collection of essays chock-full of the bricolage the author found during her clearly extensive research on the subject. While some of the bricolage was indeed interesting, I wish an editor had taken out some of the tangents, and created more of a logical structure to this one. It could be that these tangents would be applicable to parents, but since I am not one I can only assume that is the case. The book starts out in the manner I expected, and then veered into what one might title "" A Mother's Search for Peace of Mind."" Still I learned things and connected several dots, so this was certainly worth a read as it is a good introduction to the topic. I'll be looking for other books that cover the history I was in search of, so if you know of a good one please do let me know."

It's easy to just leave it at 'well they're idiots' when thinking about why people don't vaccinate or provide other types of medical care for their children. But leaving it at that does the issue a disservice. Eula suggests that these actions are the consequence of mother-blaming, consumerism in healthcare, a particularly American desire to be completely free of dependence on others, and successful opportunists who have understood this and capitalized on addressing what nobody else will: We all want to live an ideal. Not vaccinating and bucking the medical system in general fulfills the ideals of individualism and purity."

I still do not know what all the ranting was about. It talks a great deal about vaccines and why people are afraid of them, about Dracula, and about her son, but I still don’t know what she was trying to get at. She goes on and on about her son, his birth, his vaccines, his allergies, etc. Please! You should just go ahead and write a memoir about your tendencies as an overprotective helicopter mom. I decided to read this book because it was considered one of the best 10 books of 2014 by the New York Times.

Its central thesis, that immunity is ""a shared space,"" one that inextricably binds us together, is of course incredibly prescient, something that we're all coming to understand day after day right now. But this book also does so much more, expanding the boundaries of how I think of health and vaccination and its relationship to individualism, capitalism, and language—and also what I thought was possible for a book to do. “Candide and his friends—who have been imprisoned and prostituted, who have suffered syphilis and the plague—work together on a small plot of land where they enjoy the fruits of the garden.The conclusion of Candide is masterful, according to Flaubert, because it is “as stupid as life itself.” My sister and I both remember where we were when we read Candide for the first time, but neither of us is sure of what to make of the ending. Or at least my sister is not sure at midnight, which is when I ask her to interpret Candide. “You should just say you don’t know what it means,” she advises me sleepily. I do not know what it means. I want it to mean that the garden in which we work when we are no longer optimistic is not a retreat from the world, but a place where we cultivate the world.” "

We are given a balanced layman's view of immunity in general, with a particular focus on vaccination. In short chapters she delves into the past and present of vaccination to illustrate the reasons for the way things are in the world of vaccination.One of the overarching themes of the book is how the individual human being exists in a sort of continuum, with other human beings but also as part of nature. How microorganisms are part of us and how our personal immune system is also part of a collective human immune system. To me, this was the key takeaway from the book; as someone who needed no convincing that vaccines are essential in our fight against disease.The book does not pull back punches in its criticisms of the medical community. She makes it clear that medicines suffers from issues brought about by a lack of empathy.Highly recommend. Accessible. Balanced. Nuanced."
132,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7135572-emmkay,3,"Essayist Biss muses on immunization and the fears it sparks. To do so, she draws on her personal experiences (as a mother, and as daughter of a physician), on her readings about the science of vaccination, on history, theory, and literature in this slim, thoughtful volume. I’ve read a fair amount in this area and so wished for a bit more meat, but nonetheless thought this was elegantly drawn together."

But I was already proven wrong few pages in. Coming from a viewpoint of a mother, Bliss weaved together important scientific facts, philosophy, history, and even sociology in discussing vaccination and the debate surrounding it. In her essays, Bliss writes about immunity in the context of our own communities, beyond one’s individual domain, and how it fits in the narrative of the history of the world. While it shows the importance of vaccination, Bliss was thoughtful yet incisive in analyzing the arguments of those who choose not to vaccinate their children. Their sides weren’t included for the sake of presenting both sides, but also for us to understand where they are coming from and why they are wrong. There is a certain kind of calm in the prose, the type that invites a reader to assess one’s understanding of the world. For example, there’s a part where she said that wealthier countries “have the luxury of entertaining fears the rest of the world cannot afford.” Wow.I believe this is an important book to read in these trying times."
134,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10762842-nicole-r,1,"The measles vaccine, MMR, is getting some major press time lately. It seems like many people are questioning the safety/wisdom of vaccines and many parents are choosing not to vaccinate their children. I openly admit that I am pro-vaccine. Do I recognize that there are some potentially serious side effects? Yes. Do I recognize that those side effects have been greatly reduced over recent decades as science has progressed? Yes. Do I think that the benefits of vaccinations outweigh the risks? Yes.While I think there are some very convincing arguments as to why certain parents chose not to vaccinate, I am often appalled at the downright lies and misinformation that permeate this argument and seem to take on a life of their own. I picked up this book hoping that it would provide some solid rebuttals to the common anti-vaccine arguments with an added connection of how this mother navigated the waters when making decisions for her own child.I was extremely disappointed.This book contains very few scientific facts about the safety and risks of vaccines. And by ""very few"", I mean like maybe two. Instead, it is a rambling account of what the author thinks vaccines mean to society and the history of how vaccines came to be so widespread. This could be interesting, I like social science and history, and she started strong with an interesting comparison to immunity in Greek mythology (Achilles, anyone?), but she quickly lost me as she bounced from topic to topic without any structure. It seemed like she didn't even know where she was going next but, instead, just wrote about whatever popped into her head. She also focused extensively (or, at least it felt extensively) on the comparison of immortality (which she poorly attempted to connect to vaccinations) to how vampires are portrayed in mainstream media. From Dracula to Bela Lugosi to True Blood and Twilight, the portrayal of vampires mirrors how society feels about vaccines. What?!? Does that mean that society really wishes we could sparkle in the sunlight?! (Okay, that may actually be a valid point). It was just weird. And based on poor logic. The author annoyed me as well. It becomes painfully clear that this is one of those parents who is scared of everything her child comes into contact with. She is the mother who reads crazy blogs, accepts them as gospel, and then knee-jerk reacts to them. She came across as flaky, an over-disinfecter to ensure her child's world is germ-free, and basically someone I would never be friends with but would roll my eyes at in public.I could go on and on about the ways this book annoyed me. It adds nothing to the vaccination debate outside of soundbite quotes and illogical analogies. I highly recommend not reading this book and instead finding something with even a modicum of fact or actual research."
135,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/117566-mauri,5,"""You can respect the fear. The fear of vaccines is understandable. But you can't respect the decision - it's an unnecessary risk."" - Paul Offit, pediatrician/author/vaccine inventor.Biss writes from the perspective of what we call at work, ""the vaccine hesitant parent."" They're not sure they want every vaccine, and they're not sure they want them for their child right here, right now. They've heard things, read things. They're not vaccine-preventable disease epidemiologists (like me), they might not have access to peer-reviewed journal articles, and they may not even be able to grok the vaccine schedule the CDC publishes or the simplified, colorful version put out by their state health department, or even the short list on their child's preschool's website. This is highly understandable because I spend part of every week explaining it to doctors and nurses - the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine catch-up schedule is a nightmare of minimum ages and intervals.At work, it's ground into us over and over that ""vaccine hesitant"" =/= ""anti-vaxxer."" Which makes perfect sense: asking a question about preservatives in vaccines does not mean you don't want to vaccinate your child, it means that you've heard or read some concerning things about thimerosal (probably from anti-vaxxers) and want to know what's up. They want reassurance, an explanation. They do not want a shout-y pediatrician or nurse snapping ""because I said so!"" (Which sounds like a ridiculous response until you've met a lot of health care professionals.)Biss interweaves her own journey through childbirth and motherhood with the anti-vaccine movements of the past and present, meditating on the whys and wherefores of public health. Who needs it? Who thinks they don't need it? A lot of her ponderings dovetail neatly with an article published this week, What the Measles Epidemic Really Says About America; both mention Susan Sontag's ""Illness as Metaphor"" and ""AIDS and Its Metaphors,"" both discuss the NIMBYism of anti-vaxxers, the rise of the individual as preeminent in health care, and distrust of the government.I found this incredibly engaging and readable, especially considering that it's languished on my to-read list long enough that I've forgotten where I heard of it or who recommended it to me. I suspect it was someone local or at work - the book was published by the press my best friend interned for in college, a local company, and Biss received a Minnesota State Arts Board Operating Support Grant."
136,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/962663-karen,5,"Biss writes a book about immunity that dwells in the intersection between objectivity and subjectivity, which makes sense, given she is the child of a physician and a poet. I love this book. I wanted to race through it because it was smart, beautiful and poignant. But I forced myself to slow down for the same reasons. Biss investigates the history of inoculation through three primary methods: she explores key historical detail about events, researchers and advocates (such as the development of small pox inoculation); she explores the metaphors in the language and the symbolism in the actions (war as a metaphor for illness and metaphorical views of germs, viruses, toxicity, disease and filth); and she shares her own journey as a mother trying to protect her own health and the health of her child (her son has severe allergies). Biss writes a book that's immensely complex; however, her prose illuminates as she parses these complexities. Other reviewers compare her to Sontag and Didion, but I see her doing work similar to Sachs, Wilson, and other public intellectuals. She's insightful and articulate. Some of the sections directly take on the anti-vax movement, but she doesn't scold. Biss tries to understand how people on various sides of the issue form their arguments. Many sections of the book investigate how emotion and perception contribute to opinion and policy. For example, I can see quite clearly how people in Africa rely on emotion, perception and bias to resist inoculation efforts by foreigners. This makes me wonder how I might be blind to my own ""reasonable"" conclusions about inoculations and more broadly how nonscientific elements influence US policies about inoculations. Biss also brings in works from the humanities. Readers will encounter passages from _Dracula_, _Alice and Wonderland_ and _Candide_ as well as quotes from Susan Sontag's parallel works about illness in general and AIDS specifically as cultural metaphors. Rachel Carson's _Silent Spring_ makes an argument that people and their environment are intertwined. I enjoyed this book so much, I'm tempted to reread it immediately. It's already proved relevant to today's news. I was reading comments in response to a _Washington Post_ news story about immigration, and many were fearful that immigrants sans inoculations were going to bring disease into the US."
137,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/312880-melissa,5,"Excellent short of book of essays and meditations on the nature of vaccination as both a concept and a practice, the logic behind anti-vaccination, the history of compulsory medicine, the nature of scientific research, language/semantics, skepticism, the undying nature of stuff that gets on the Internet, and the anxiety that comes with being a parent.As an epidemiologist, I requested (and was granted - thanks Graywolf Press!) an advance copy because I wanted to know what Biss - from the position of a parent and writer, not a scientist in any way - had to say about vaccination. Vaccination, in my line of work, is one of our front-line infectious disease prevention tools right behind handwashing and covering your cough/sneeze. It protects not only the individual but also those who cannot be immunized (infants, those with compromised immune systems, etc) from diseases that can take a huge toll in mortality and morbidity. A world where we lose that herd immunity due to ""anti-vaxxers"" which allows diseases like measles (a disease that killed tens of thousands of children in the pre-vaccine era of the 20th century) to run rampant is truly terrifying to me. Biss looks at a lot of her own fears and those of other mothers and then collates/arranges/dissects her research. I don't really want to comment a lot on her conclusions - because that would ruin the work of the book - but suffice to say she posits a lot of good arguments and writes it all very well. Everyone should read this."

I was most interested in Biss's convincing speculations about the metaphors that distort our thinking when it comes to vaccination, disease, and health. Biss the author is a rationalist, but Biss the mother (of one young son) has experienced enough anxious fear that she is completely snark-free when it comes to the anti-vaccine crowd. She suggests an interesting history here: a few centuries ago, Westerners worried most about ""filth""; post-germ theory, they worried about germs; today, with germs under greater control than ever in human history, we worry about ""toxins""--by which we mean (though the usage is inaccurate) poisons we've produced via our own scientific ingenuity. Biss also has some striking things to say about our tendency to draw illogical boundaries between what we deem to be ""self"" and ""nonself."" ""Nonself,"" she shows, is very often a misnomer. This is a book just about everyone should read if they want to be smarter about certain urgent cultural conversations."

It does no good to cite science or statistics in persuading for or against vaccination on the current schedule--it feels as though both ideological sides of the argument are armed with their own set of figures and reciting them only leads to all parties becoming further entrenched in their own perspective. Science alone is not enough to persuade. Instead, with gorgeous prose in brief chapters, Biss looks at the concept of vaccination through a variety of lenses: historical, scientific, personal, political, ethical, and philosophical. Through an accretion of evidence, while concluding that vaccination is our best bet, she finds and acknowledges the shared experience in our struggle to come to peace with the prickly question of whether or not to vaccinate our children."

But I found it to be a very smart and measured contemplation of the ways in which we view our bodies, health and illness, our immune systems—the term is recent, a 1970s construct—and particularly the subject of vaccinations. Within that, she brings in a lot of interesting cultural touchpoints: Bram Stoker’s Dracula, Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring, the history of inoculation, and the etymology of the metaphors we use for disease and the body—it’s a little surprising to note how many of the terms come from warfare. Or maybe it’s not. As someone who has a very uneasy relationship to doctors and medicine and illness, I found the book surprisingly reassuring."

On Immunity takes an academic, literary approach to that question and comes up with a variety of illuminating answers, or rather, the various pieces that constitute a nebulous, partial answer. So much about the current debate that seems novel actually has historical precedent, such as the tendency of the wealthy to rely on the less wealthy to bolster their health via herd immunity. But beyond that, On Immunity is a meditation on an individual's body in relationship to the community and what underscores our beliefs about health. It's an enriching and pleasurable read that I recommend heartily. "

Never have I encountered work that made me literally reconsider what it is to have a body. Her examinations and interrogations of immunity, inoculation, the body social v the body politic, vampire as metaphor, community dependence, wealth and health—they are done with the most thoughtful and empathetic and genuine inquiry that Biss is known for.

149,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2597121-laura-hoffman-brauman,4,"In On Immunity: An Inoculation, Eula Biss looks at the concepts of immunization/vaccination and immunity from both a scientific, social, and historical perspective. She often writes from the perspective of a mother, anxious about the potential dangers that could impact her young son - from the actual illness to the concerns that people have about vaccinations. Her book is extremely well researched, but also comes across as very relatable as she sorts out what she sees in the media and digs in to the data behind it. The book came out in 2014 and in sections references various flu outbreaks/pandemics - it is impossible not to draw parallels between the scenarios she describes and the COVID outbreak. Some of her discussion on vaccination/precautions taken not only to protect the individual but for the good of society are particularly relevant when considering the current situation. Biss is a very strong writer and makes the science of this accessible. She has a clear point of view, but doesn't come across as preachy - she looks at both sides of an issue and builds her case. I appreciated the literary references in here, but from reading other reviews, I know that some readers felt it distracted from the book. "

I did want to contemplate what inoculation is and how immunity is symbolized and contemplated in culture and there were threads in here that hinted at deeper meaning, but it just never really hit the mark for me."
151,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5706847-kellie,5,"Wow, it's weird reading this during Quarantimes. But excellent. It's really good stuff. A LITTLE bit too even-handed with antivaxxers (some things should not be treated equally!), but honestly I can extend compassion to the fears these people hold, even if I think they lack empathy and good sense. At least she very much does not come down on their side."
152,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1288876-julie-g,5,"WritingAbsolutely superb. Biss's essays cover a range of social, cultural, scientific, and historical effects and implications surrounding the decision to immunize. She begins with the struggle she faced as a new mother hearing widely varying ideas of whether or not immunization is healthy and, from there, delves into the history of inoculation, the reasons people have feared the idea of vaccines throughout history and culture, and the current controversies surrounding the topic. Each essay is concisely written and well-thought-out, and you can tell that Biss has conducted thorough research. Entertainment ValueAs ideas about vaccines become more and more polarized, the issue itself has been muddied through various pseudo-scientific claims and celebrity testimonials. Biss doesn't try to give a definitive answer to the question of whether or not to vaccinate, although she is clear about her own personal beliefs. Instead, she explores every facet of the conversation, from literary to scientific to historical to pop culture. It's fascinating and easy to read - I completed it in a day.OverallI highly recommend this to anyone, parent or not, who is interested in the ongoing debate about vaccination and it's implications for community health. I feel like I learned a great deal and was excited by the number of discussions the essays in this book sparked among my friends. I highly recommend getting a copy and checking it out."
153,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6316460-becky,5,"An absolute must-read no matter what side of the vaccination fence you are sitting on. If I could have highlighted every single word I would have. I am very very pro-vaccination, but I also do not have children, and so have never been confronted with the rational and irrational fears that accompany motherhood. I have never had anyone dependent upon every decision I made, and so just cannot understand what it is like to be so completely overwhelmed with data, decisions, troubles, fears, and love. This book helped me there, and has definitely also helped me to understand internationally some of the debate over vaccinations (for instance, the middle east has wildly different problems with vaccinations- mainly that at times we have embedded spies in medical crews, etc.). Biss’s discussions on the civic implications of vaccinations, how herd immunity works within the socio-economic structure of America, how we may even possibly be risking the lives of the less fortunate in our country and others by not vaccinating, but also how vaccinations have always been a source of a personal power and freedom struggle in America is amazingly thoughtful and is dealt with beautifully. She put the whole conversation in terms that I have never before realized or been able to verbalize and she did so with wonderful prose. I whole-heartedly recommend."

And it is my first time pregnant and I have many questions about vaccinations. This was the book for me. I was skeptical because I had read about the author's conclusion in favor of vaccinations and did not want to be persuaded under false pretenses, but I feel like Biss was very thorough in her research and as honest about her questions as any concerned parent would be. As a fan of literature, I loved her inclusion of myth and discussion of vampires. I have put Dracula on my reading list and believe I will love it as much as I did Frankenstein for its observations of humanity. I also appreciated Biss's personal stories and shared conversations. It made for much easier reading. And yes, I did come away with a new perspective on vaccinations. Avoiding them is a privilege of the wealthy and a vampiric dependency on others. As a member of the community, I prefer to do my part to increase quality of life for all, and myself at the same time, by fighting fears with rationality and an overall survey of the available information."

I expected a historical look at vaccines, past, present, and future, and that is not what I got. It is a collection of essays chock-full of the bricolage the author found during her clearly extensive research on the subject. While some of the bricolage was indeed interesting, I wish an editor had taken out some of the tangents, and created more of a logical structure to this one. It could be that these tangents would be applicable to parents, but since I am not one I can only assume that is the case. The book starts out in the manner I expected, and then veered into what one might title "" A Mother's Search for Peace of Mind."" Still I learned things and connected several dots, so this was certainly worth a read as it is a good introduction to the topic. I'll be looking for other books that cover the history I was in search of, so if you know of a good one please do let me know."

It's easy to just leave it at 'well they're idiots' when thinking about why people don't vaccinate or provide other types of medical care for their children. But leaving it at that does the issue a disservice. Eula suggests that these actions are the consequence of mother-blaming, consumerism in healthcare, a particularly American desire to be completely free of dependence on others, and successful opportunists who have understood this and capitalized on addressing what nobody else will: We all want to live an ideal. Not vaccinating and bucking the medical system in general fulfills the ideals of individualism and purity."

I still do not know what all the ranting was about. It talks a great deal about vaccines and why people are afraid of them, about Dracula, and about her son, but I still don’t know what she was trying to get at. She goes on and on about her son, his birth, his vaccines, his allergies, etc. Please! You should just go ahead and write a memoir about your tendencies as an overprotective helicopter mom. I decided to read this book because it was considered one of the best 10 books of 2014 by the New York Times.

Its central thesis, that immunity is ""a shared space,"" one that inextricably binds us together, is of course incredibly prescient, something that we're all coming to understand day after day right now. But this book also does so much more, expanding the boundaries of how I think of health and vaccination and its relationship to individualism, capitalism, and language—and also what I thought was possible for a book to do. “Candide and his friends—who have been imprisoned and prostituted, who have suffered syphilis and the plague—work together on a small plot of land where they enjoy the fruits of the garden.The conclusion of Candide is masterful, according to Flaubert, because it is “as stupid as life itself.” My sister and I both remember where we were when we read Candide for the first time, but neither of us is sure of what to make of the ending. Or at least my sister is not sure at midnight, which is when I ask her to interpret Candide. “You should just say you don’t know what it means,” she advises me sleepily. I do not know what it means. I want it to mean that the garden in which we work when we are no longer optimistic is not a retreat from the world, but a place where we cultivate the world.” "

We are given a balanced layman's view of immunity in general, with a particular focus on vaccination. In short chapters she delves into the past and present of vaccination to illustrate the reasons for the way things are in the world of vaccination.One of the overarching themes of the book is how the individual human being exists in a sort of continuum, with other human beings but also as part of nature. How microorganisms are part of us and how our personal immune system is also part of a collective human immune system. To me, this was the key takeaway from the book; as someone who needed no convincing that vaccines are essential in our fight against disease.The book does not pull back punches in its criticisms of the medical community. She makes it clear that medicines suffers from issues brought about by a lack of empathy.Highly recommend. Accessible. Balanced. Nuanced."
162,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7135572-emmkay,3,"Essayist Biss muses on immunization and the fears it sparks. To do so, she draws on her personal experiences (as a mother, and as daughter of a physician), on her readings about the science of vaccination, on history, theory, and literature in this slim, thoughtful volume. I’ve read a fair amount in this area and so wished for a bit more meat, but nonetheless thought this was elegantly drawn together."

But I was already proven wrong few pages in. Coming from a viewpoint of a mother, Bliss weaved together important scientific facts, philosophy, history, and even sociology in discussing vaccination and the debate surrounding it. In her essays, Bliss writes about immunity in the context of our own communities, beyond one’s individual domain, and how it fits in the narrative of the history of the world. While it shows the importance of vaccination, Bliss was thoughtful yet incisive in analyzing the arguments of those who choose not to vaccinate their children. Their sides weren’t included for the sake of presenting both sides, but also for us to understand where they are coming from and why they are wrong. There is a certain kind of calm in the prose, the type that invites a reader to assess one’s understanding of the world. For example, there’s a part where she said that wealthier countries “have the luxury of entertaining fears the rest of the world cannot afford.” Wow.I believe this is an important book to read in these trying times."
164,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10762842-nicole-r,1,"The measles vaccine, MMR, is getting some major press time lately. It seems like many people are questioning the safety/wisdom of vaccines and many parents are choosing not to vaccinate their children. I openly admit that I am pro-vaccine. Do I recognize that there are some potentially serious side effects? Yes. Do I recognize that those side effects have been greatly reduced over recent decades as science has progressed? Yes. Do I think that the benefits of vaccinations outweigh the risks? Yes.While I think there are some very convincing arguments as to why certain parents chose not to vaccinate, I am often appalled at the downright lies and misinformation that permeate this argument and seem to take on a life of their own. I picked up this book hoping that it would provide some solid rebuttals to the common anti-vaccine arguments with an added connection of how this mother navigated the waters when making decisions for her own child.I was extremely disappointed.This book contains very few scientific facts about the safety and risks of vaccines. And by ""very few"", I mean like maybe two. Instead, it is a rambling account of what the author thinks vaccines mean to society and the history of how vaccines came to be so widespread. This could be interesting, I like social science and history, and she started strong with an interesting comparison to immunity in Greek mythology (Achilles, anyone?), but she quickly lost me as she bounced from topic to topic without any structure. It seemed like she didn't even know where she was going next but, instead, just wrote about whatever popped into her head. She also focused extensively (or, at least it felt extensively) on the comparison of immortality (which she poorly attempted to connect to vaccinations) to how vampires are portrayed in mainstream media. From Dracula to Bela Lugosi to True Blood and Twilight, the portrayal of vampires mirrors how society feels about vaccines. What?!? Does that mean that society really wishes we could sparkle in the sunlight?! (Okay, that may actually be a valid point). It was just weird. And based on poor logic. The author annoyed me as well. It becomes painfully clear that this is one of those parents who is scared of everything her child comes into contact with. She is the mother who reads crazy blogs, accepts them as gospel, and then knee-jerk reacts to them. She came across as flaky, an over-disinfecter to ensure her child's world is germ-free, and basically someone I would never be friends with but would roll my eyes at in public.I could go on and on about the ways this book annoyed me. It adds nothing to the vaccination debate outside of soundbite quotes and illogical analogies. I highly recommend not reading this book and instead finding something with even a modicum of fact or actual research."
165,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/117566-mauri,5,"""You can respect the fear. The fear of vaccines is understandable. But you can't respect the decision - it's an unnecessary risk."" - Paul Offit, pediatrician/author/vaccine inventor.Biss writes from the perspective of what we call at work, ""the vaccine hesitant parent."" They're not sure they want every vaccine, and they're not sure they want them for their child right here, right now. They've heard things, read things. They're not vaccine-preventable disease epidemiologists (like me), they might not have access to peer-reviewed journal articles, and they may not even be able to grok the vaccine schedule the CDC publishes or the simplified, colorful version put out by their state health department, or even the short list on their child's preschool's website. This is highly understandable because I spend part of every week explaining it to doctors and nurses - the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine catch-up schedule is a nightmare of minimum ages and intervals.At work, it's ground into us over and over that ""vaccine hesitant"" =/= ""anti-vaxxer."" Which makes perfect sense: asking a question about preservatives in vaccines does not mean you don't want to vaccinate your child, it means that you've heard or read some concerning things about thimerosal (probably from anti-vaxxers) and want to know what's up. They want reassurance, an explanation. They do not want a shout-y pediatrician or nurse snapping ""because I said so!"" (Which sounds like a ridiculous response until you've met a lot of health care professionals.)Biss interweaves her own journey through childbirth and motherhood with the anti-vaccine movements of the past and present, meditating on the whys and wherefores of public health. Who needs it? Who thinks they don't need it? A lot of her ponderings dovetail neatly with an article published this week, What the Measles Epidemic Really Says About America; both mention Susan Sontag's ""Illness as Metaphor"" and ""AIDS and Its Metaphors,"" both discuss the NIMBYism of anti-vaxxers, the rise of the individual as preeminent in health care, and distrust of the government.I found this incredibly engaging and readable, especially considering that it's languished on my to-read list long enough that I've forgotten where I heard of it or who recommended it to me. I suspect it was someone local or at work - the book was published by the press my best friend interned for in college, a local company, and Biss received a Minnesota State Arts Board Operating Support Grant."
166,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/962663-karen,5,"Biss writes a book about immunity that dwells in the intersection between objectivity and subjectivity, which makes sense, given she is the child of a physician and a poet. I love this book. I wanted to race through it because it was smart, beautiful and poignant. But I forced myself to slow down for the same reasons. Biss investigates the history of inoculation through three primary methods: she explores key historical detail about events, researchers and advocates (such as the development of small pox inoculation); she explores the metaphors in the language and the symbolism in the actions (war as a metaphor for illness and metaphorical views of germs, viruses, toxicity, disease and filth); and she shares her own journey as a mother trying to protect her own health and the health of her child (her son has severe allergies). Biss writes a book that's immensely complex; however, her prose illuminates as she parses these complexities. Other reviewers compare her to Sontag and Didion, but I see her doing work similar to Sachs, Wilson, and other public intellectuals. She's insightful and articulate. Some of the sections directly take on the anti-vax movement, but she doesn't scold. Biss tries to understand how people on various sides of the issue form their arguments. Many sections of the book investigate how emotion and perception contribute to opinion and policy. For example, I can see quite clearly how people in Africa rely on emotion, perception and bias to resist inoculation efforts by foreigners. This makes me wonder how I might be blind to my own ""reasonable"" conclusions about inoculations and more broadly how nonscientific elements influence US policies about inoculations. Biss also brings in works from the humanities. Readers will encounter passages from _Dracula_, _Alice and Wonderland_ and _Candide_ as well as quotes from Susan Sontag's parallel works about illness in general and AIDS specifically as cultural metaphors. Rachel Carson's _Silent Spring_ makes an argument that people and their environment are intertwined. I enjoyed this book so much, I'm tempted to reread it immediately. It's already proved relevant to today's news. I was reading comments in response to a _Washington Post_ news story about immigration, and many were fearful that immigrants sans inoculations were going to bring disease into the US."
167,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/312880-melissa,5,"Excellent short of book of essays and meditations on the nature of vaccination as both a concept and a practice, the logic behind anti-vaccination, the history of compulsory medicine, the nature of scientific research, language/semantics, skepticism, the undying nature of stuff that gets on the Internet, and the anxiety that comes with being a parent.As an epidemiologist, I requested (and was granted - thanks Graywolf Press!) an advance copy because I wanted to know what Biss - from the position of a parent and writer, not a scientist in any way - had to say about vaccination. Vaccination, in my line of work, is one of our front-line infectious disease prevention tools right behind handwashing and covering your cough/sneeze. It protects not only the individual but also those who cannot be immunized (infants, those with compromised immune systems, etc) from diseases that can take a huge toll in mortality and morbidity. A world where we lose that herd immunity due to ""anti-vaxxers"" which allows diseases like measles (a disease that killed tens of thousands of children in the pre-vaccine era of the 20th century) to run rampant is truly terrifying to me. Biss looks at a lot of her own fears and those of other mothers and then collates/arranges/dissects her research. I don't really want to comment a lot on her conclusions - because that would ruin the work of the book - but suffice to say she posits a lot of good arguments and writes it all very well. Everyone should read this."

I was most interested in Biss's convincing speculations about the metaphors that distort our thinking when it comes to vaccination, disease, and health. Biss the author is a rationalist, but Biss the mother (of one young son) has experienced enough anxious fear that she is completely snark-free when it comes to the anti-vaccine crowd. She suggests an interesting history here: a few centuries ago, Westerners worried most about ""filth""; post-germ theory, they worried about germs; today, with germs under greater control than ever in human history, we worry about ""toxins""--by which we mean (though the usage is inaccurate) poisons we've produced via our own scientific ingenuity. Biss also has some striking things to say about our tendency to draw illogical boundaries between what we deem to be ""self"" and ""nonself."" ""Nonself,"" she shows, is very often a misnomer. This is a book just about everyone should read if they want to be smarter about certain urgent cultural conversations."

It answers a question I've had for some time without really realizing: why is it that so many (almost uniformly) white, upper- class women with college degrees and otherwise progressive politics believe they shouldn't vaccinate their children? In a series of penetrating essays, Biss pulls back the layers of the anti-vaccination movement throughout the last 100 years to expose its roots in class and race issues, the marginalization of women in medicine and our chronic inability to see ourselves as members of a larger community. Unfortunately the second half of the book tosses all of that out the window and becomes a series of personal essays about her birth and her son's infant medical care, where a whole host of the author's personal neuroses are put on display: from her year(!) of hand-wringing over her need to receive a blood transfusion while giving birth to her fervent paranoid belief that her doctors are attempting to ""punish"" her and her child for questioning orthodox medical science. Blehhh. And you were doing so well, too."

Or maybe it’s not. As someone who has a very uneasy relationship to doctors and medicine and illness, I found the book surprisingly reassuring."

Never have I encountered work that made me literally reconsider what it is to have a body.

179,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2597121-laura-hoffman-brauman,4,"In On Immunity: An Inoculation, Eula Biss looks at the concepts of immunization/vaccination and immunity from both a scientific, social, and historical perspective. She often writes from the perspective of a mother, anxious about the potential dangers that could impact her young son - from the actual illness to the concerns that people have about vaccinations. Her book is extremely well researched, but also comes across as very relatable as she sorts out what she sees in the media and digs in to the data behind it. The book came out in 2014 and in sections references various flu outbreaks/pandemics - it is impossible not to draw parallels between the scenarios she describes and the COVID outbreak. Some of her discussion on vaccination/precautions taken not only to protect the individual but for the good of society are particularly relevant when considering the current situation. Biss is a very strong writer and makes the science of this accessible. She has a clear point of view, but doesn't come across as preachy - she looks at both sides of an issue and builds her case. I appreciated the literary references in here, but from reading other reviews, I know that some readers felt it distracted from the book. "

I did want to contemplate what inoculation is and how immunity is symbolized and contemplated in culture and there were threads in here that hinted at deeper meaning, but it just never really hit the mark for me."
181,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5706847-kellie,5,"Wow, it's weird reading this during Quarantimes. But excellent. It's really good stuff. A LITTLE bit too even-handed with antivaxxers (some things should not be treated equally!), but honestly I can extend compassion to the fears these people hold, even if I think they lack empathy and good sense. At least she very much does not come down on their side."
182,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1288876-julie-g,5,"WritingAbsolutely superb. Biss's essays cover a range of social, cultural, scientific, and historical effects and implications surrounding the decision to immunize. She begins with the struggle she faced as a new mother hearing widely varying ideas of whether or not immunization is healthy and, from there, delves into the history of inoculation, the reasons people have feared the idea of vaccines throughout history and culture, and the current controversies surrounding the topic. Each essay is concisely written and well-thought-out, and you can tell that Biss has conducted thorough research. Entertainment ValueAs ideas about vaccines become more and more polarized, the issue itself has been muddied through various pseudo-scientific claims and celebrity testimonials. Biss doesn't try to give a definitive answer to the question of whether or not to vaccinate, although she is clear about her own personal beliefs. Instead, she explores every facet of the conversation, from literary to scientific to historical to pop culture. It's fascinating and easy to read - I completed it in a day.OverallI highly recommend this to anyone, parent or not, who is interested in the ongoing debate about vaccination and it's implications for community health. I feel like I learned a great deal and was excited by the number of discussions the essays in this book sparked among my friends. I highly recommend getting a copy and checking it out."

If I could have highlighted every single word I would have. I am very very pro-vaccination, but I also do not have children, and so have never been confronted with the rational and irrational fears that accompany motherhood. I have never had anyone dependent upon every decision I made, and so just cannot understand what it is like to be so completely overwhelmed with data, decisions, troubles, fears, and love. This book helped me there, and has definitely also helped me to understand internationally some of the debate over vaccinations (for instance, the middle east has wildly different problems with vaccinations- mainly that at times we have embedded spies in medical crews, etc.). Biss’s discussions on the civic implications of vaccinations, how herd immunity works within the socio-economic structure of America, how we may even possibly be risking the lives of the less fortunate in our country and others by not vaccinating, but also how vaccinations have always been a source of a personal power and freedom struggle in America is amazingly thoughtful and is dealt with beautifully. She put the whole conversation in terms that I have never before realized or been able to verbalize and she did so with wonderful prose. I whole-heartedly recommend."

And it is my first time pregnant and I have many questions about vaccinations. This was the book for me. I was skeptical because I had read about the author's conclusion in favor of vaccinations and did not want to be persuaded under false pretenses, but I feel like Biss was very thorough in her research and as honest about her questions as any concerned parent would be. As a fan of literature, I loved her inclusion of myth and discussion of vampires. I have put Dracula on my reading list and believe I will love it as much as I did Frankenstein for its observations of humanity. I also appreciated Biss's personal stories and shared conversations. It made for much easier reading. And yes, I did come away with a new perspective on vaccinations. Avoiding them is a privilege of the wealthy and a vampiric dependency on others. As a member of the community, I prefer to do my part to increase quality of life for all, and myself at the same time, by fighting fears with rationality and an overall survey of the available information."

I expected a historical look at vaccines, past, present, and future, and that is not what I got. It is a collection of essays chock-full of the bricolage the author found during her clearly extensive research on the subject. While some of the bricolage was indeed interesting, I wish an editor had taken out some of the tangents, and created more of a logical structure to this one. It could be that these tangents would be applicable to parents, but since I am not one I can only assume that is the case. The book starts out in the manner I expected, and then veered into what one might title "" A Mother's Search for Peace of Mind."" Still I learned things and connected several dots, so this was certainly worth a read as it is a good introduction to the topic. I'll be looking for other books that cover the history I was in search of, so if you know of a good one please do let me know."

It's easy to just leave it at 'well they're idiots' when thinking about why people don't vaccinate or provide other types of medical care for their children. But leaving it at that does the issue a disservice. Eula suggests that these actions are the consequence of mother-blaming, consumerism in healthcare, a particularly American desire to be completely free of dependence on others, and successful opportunists who have understood this and capitalized on addressing what nobody else will: We all want to live an ideal. Not vaccinating and bucking the medical system in general fulfills the ideals of individualism and purity."

I still do not know what all the ranting was about. It talks a great deal about vaccines and why people are afraid of them, about Dracula, and about her son, but I still don’t know what she was trying to get at. She goes on and on about her son, his birth, his vaccines, his allergies, etc. Please! You should just go ahead and write a memoir about your tendencies as an overprotective helicopter mom. I decided to read this book because it was considered one of the best 10 books of 2014 by the New York Times.

Its central thesis, that immunity is ""a shared space,"" one that inextricably binds us together, is of course incredibly prescient, something that we're all coming to understand day after day right now. But this book also does so much more, expanding the boundaries of how I think of health and vaccination and its relationship to individualism, capitalism, and language—and also what I thought was possible for a book to do. “Candide and his friends—who have been imprisoned and prostituted, who have suffered syphilis and the plague—work together on a small plot of land where they enjoy the fruits of the garden.The conclusion of Candide is masterful, according to Flaubert, because it is “as stupid as life itself.” My sister and I both remember where we were when we read Candide for the first time, but neither of us is sure of what to make of the ending. Or at least my sister is not sure at midnight, which is when I ask her to interpret Candide. “You should just say you don’t know what it means,” she advises me sleepily. I do not know what it means. I want it to mean that the garden in which we work when we are no longer optimistic is not a retreat from the world, but a place where we cultivate the world.” "

We are given a balanced layman's view of immunity in general, with a particular focus on vaccination. In short chapters she delves into the past and present of vaccination to illustrate the reasons for the way things are in the world of vaccination.One of the overarching themes of the book is how the individual human being exists in a sort of continuum, with other human beings but also as part of nature. How microorganisms are part of us and how our personal immune system is also part of a collective human immune system. To me, this was the key takeaway from the book; as someone who needed no convincing that vaccines are essential in our fight against disease.The book does not pull back punches in its criticisms of the medical community. She makes it clear that medicines suffers from issues brought about by a lack of empathy.Highly recommend. Accessible. Balanced. Nuanced."
192,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7135572-emmkay,3,"Essayist Biss muses on immunization and the fears it sparks. To do so, she draws on her personal experiences (as a mother, and as daughter of a physician), on her readings about the science of vaccination, on history, theory, and literature in this slim, thoughtful volume. I’ve read a fair amount in this area and so wished for a bit more meat, but nonetheless thought this was elegantly drawn together."

But I was already proven wrong few pages in. Coming from a viewpoint of a mother, Bliss weaved together important scientific facts, philosophy, history, and even sociology in discussing vaccination and the debate surrounding it. In her essays, Bliss writes about immunity in the context of our own communities, beyond one’s individual domain, and how it fits in the narrative of the history of the world. While it shows the importance of vaccination, Bliss was thoughtful yet incisive in analyzing the arguments of those who choose not to vaccinate their children. Their sides weren’t included for the sake of presenting both sides, but also for us to understand where they are coming from and why they are wrong. There is a certain kind of calm in the prose, the type that invites a reader to assess one’s understanding of the world. For example, there’s a part where she said that wealthier countries “have the luxury of entertaining fears the rest of the world cannot afford.” Wow.I believe this is an important book to read in these trying times."
194,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10762842-nicole-r,1,"The measles vaccine, MMR, is getting some major press time lately. It seems like many people are questioning the safety/wisdom of vaccines and many parents are choosing not to vaccinate their children. I openly admit that I am pro-vaccine. Do I recognize that there are some potentially serious side effects? Yes. Do I recognize that those side effects have been greatly reduced over recent decades as science has progressed? Yes. Do I think that the benefits of vaccinations outweigh the risks? Yes.While I think there are some very convincing arguments as to why certain parents chose not to vaccinate, I am often appalled at the downright lies and misinformation that permeate this argument and seem to take on a life of their own. I picked up this book hoping that it would provide some solid rebuttals to the common anti-vaccine arguments with an added connection of how this mother navigated the waters when making decisions for her own child.I was extremely disappointed.This book contains very few scientific facts about the safety and risks of vaccines. And by ""very few"", I mean like maybe two. Instead, it is a rambling account of what the author thinks vaccines mean to society and the history of how vaccines came to be so widespread. This could be interesting, I like social science and history, and she started strong with an interesting comparison to immunity in Greek mythology (Achilles, anyone?), but she quickly lost me as she bounced from topic to topic without any structure. It seemed like she didn't even know where she was going next but, instead, just wrote about whatever popped into her head. She also focused extensively (or, at least it felt extensively) on the comparison of immortality (which she poorly attempted to connect to vaccinations) to how vampires are portrayed in mainstream media. From Dracula to Bela Lugosi to True Blood and Twilight, the portrayal of vampires mirrors how society feels about vaccines. What?!? Does that mean that society really wishes we could sparkle in the sunlight?! (Okay, that may actually be a valid point). It was just weird. And based on poor logic. The author annoyed me as well. It becomes painfully clear that this is one of those parents who is scared of everything her child comes into contact with. She is the mother who reads crazy blogs, accepts them as gospel, and then knee-jerk reacts to them. She came across as flaky, an over-disinfecter to ensure her child's world is germ-free, and basically someone I would never be friends with but would roll my eyes at in public.I could go on and on about the ways this book annoyed me. It adds nothing to the vaccination debate outside of soundbite quotes and illogical analogies. I highly recommend not reading this book and instead finding something with even a modicum of fact or actual research."
195,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/117566-mauri,5,"""You can respect the fear. The fear of vaccines is understandable. But you can't respect the decision - it's an unnecessary risk."" - Paul Offit, pediatrician/author/vaccine inventor.Biss writes from the perspective of what we call at work, ""the vaccine hesitant parent."" They're not sure they want every vaccine, and they're not sure they want them for their child right here, right now. They've heard things, read things. They're not vaccine-preventable disease epidemiologists (like me), they might not have access to peer-reviewed journal articles, and they may not even be able to grok the vaccine schedule the CDC publishes or the simplified, colorful version put out by their state health department, or even the short list on their child's preschool's website. This is highly understandable because I spend part of every week explaining it to doctors and nurses - the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine catch-up schedule is a nightmare of minimum ages and intervals.At work, it's ground into us over and over that ""vaccine hesitant"" =/= ""anti-vaxxer."" Which makes perfect sense: asking a question about preservatives in vaccines does not mean you don't want to vaccinate your child, it means that you've heard or read some concerning things about thimerosal (probably from anti-vaxxers) and want to know what's up. They want reassurance, an explanation. They do not want a shout-y pediatrician or nurse snapping ""because I said so!"" (Which sounds like a ridiculous response until you've met a lot of health care professionals.)Biss interweaves her own journey through childbirth and motherhood with the anti-vaccine movements of the past and present, meditating on the whys and wherefores of public health. Who needs it? Who thinks they don't need it? A lot of her ponderings dovetail neatly with an article published this week, What the Measles Epidemic Really Says About America; both mention Susan Sontag's ""Illness as Metaphor"" and ""AIDS and Its Metaphors,"" both discuss the NIMBYism of anti-vaxxers, the rise of the individual as preeminent in health care, and distrust of the government.I found this incredibly engaging and readable, especially considering that it's languished on my to-read list long enough that I've forgotten where I heard of it or who recommended it to me. I suspect it was someone local or at work - the book was published by the press my best friend interned for in college, a local company, and Biss received a Minnesota State Arts Board Operating Support Grant."
196,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/962663-karen,5,"Biss writes a book about immunity that dwells in the intersection between objectivity and subjectivity, which makes sense, given she is the child of a physician and a poet. I love this book. I wanted to race through it because it was smart, beautiful and poignant. But I forced myself to slow down for the same reasons. Biss investigates the history of inoculation through three primary methods: she explores key historical detail about events, researchers and advocates (such as the development of small pox inoculation); she explores the metaphors in the language and the symbolism in the actions (war as a metaphor for illness and metaphorical views of germs, viruses, toxicity, disease and filth); and she shares her own journey as a mother trying to protect her own health and the health of her child (her son has severe allergies). Biss writes a book that's immensely complex; however, her prose illuminates as she parses these complexities. Other reviewers compare her to Sontag and Didion, but I see her doing work similar to Sachs, Wilson, and other public intellectuals. She's insightful and articulate. Some of the sections directly take on the anti-vax movement, but she doesn't scold. Biss tries to understand how people on various sides of the issue form their arguments. Many sections of the book investigate how emotion and perception contribute to opinion and policy. For example, I can see quite clearly how people in Africa rely on emotion, perception and bias to resist inoculation efforts by foreigners. This makes me wonder how I might be blind to my own ""reasonable"" conclusions about inoculations and more broadly how nonscientific elements influence US policies about inoculations. Biss also brings in works from the humanities. Readers will encounter passages from _Dracula_, _Alice and Wonderland_ and _Candide_ as well as quotes from Susan Sontag's parallel works about illness in general and AIDS specifically as cultural metaphors. Rachel Carson's _Silent Spring_ makes an argument that people and their environment are intertwined. I enjoyed this book so much, I'm tempted to reread it immediately. It's already proved relevant to today's news. I was reading comments in response to a _Washington Post_ news story about immigration, and many were fearful that immigrants sans inoculations were going to bring disease into the US."
197,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/312880-melissa,5,"Excellent short of book of essays and meditations on the nature of vaccination as both a concept and a practice, the logic behind anti-vaccination, the history of compulsory medicine, the nature of scientific research, language/semantics, skepticism, the undying nature of stuff that gets on the Internet, and the anxiety that comes with being a parent.As an epidemiologist, I requested (and was granted - thanks Graywolf Press!) an advance copy because I wanted to know what Biss - from the position of a parent and writer, not a scientist in any way - had to say about vaccination. Vaccination, in my line of work, is one of our front-line infectious disease prevention tools right behind handwashing and covering your cough/sneeze. It protects not only the individual but also those who cannot be immunized (infants, those with compromised immune systems, etc) from diseases that can take a huge toll in mortality and morbidity. A world where we lose that herd immunity due to ""anti-vaxxers"" which allows diseases like measles (a disease that killed tens of thousands of children in the pre-vaccine era of the 20th century) to run rampant is truly terrifying to me. Biss looks at a lot of her own fears and those of other mothers and then collates/arranges/dissects her research. I don't really want to comment a lot on her conclusions - because that would ruin the work of the book - but suffice to say she posits a lot of good arguments and writes it all very well. Everyone should read this."

I was most interested in Biss's convincing speculations about the metaphors that distort our thinking when it comes to vaccination, disease, and health. Biss the author is a rationalist, but Biss the mother (of one young son) has experienced enough anxious fear that she is completely snark-free when it comes to the anti-vaccine crowd. She suggests an interesting history here: a few centuries ago, Westerners worried most about ""filth""; post-germ theory, they worried about germs; today, with germs under greater control than ever in human history, we worry about ""toxins""--by which we mean (though the usage is inaccurate) poisons we've produced via our own scientific ingenuity. Biss also has some striking things to say about our tendency to draw illogical boundaries between what we deem to be ""self"" and ""nonself."" ""Nonself,"" she shows, is very often a misnomer. This is a book just about everyone should read if they want to be smarter about certain urgent cultural conversations."

It answers a question I've had for some time without really realizing: why is it that so many (almost uniformly) white, upper- class women with college degrees and otherwise progressive politics believe they shouldn't vaccinate their children? In a series of penetrating essays, Biss pulls back the layers of the anti-vaccination movement throughout the last 100 years to expose its roots in class and race issues, the marginalization of women in medicine and our chronic inability to see ourselves as members of a larger community. Unfortunately the second half of the book tosses all of that out the window and becomes a series of personal essays about her birth and her son's infant medical care, where a whole host of the author's personal neuroses are put on display: from her year(!) of hand-wringing over her need to receive a blood transfusion while giving birth to her fervent paranoid belief that her doctors are attempting to ""punish"" her and her child for questioning orthodox medical science. Blehhh. And you were doing so well, too."

This, for me, is one of those books that inspires me to be a better reader and a better thinker. It's a short book but she crams a lot of thinking in there and it's clear she did a ton of research before writing this contemplation. I'm not really sure what to call this book...an essay? I do wonder if this is the sort of book she intended to write when she started her research and note-taking. In any case, with such disparate sources making up her body of research she did an impressive job of distilling her thoughts and reflections and somehow making this thing hang together and be readable. Yet, because there is so much here, I will probably be reading it again with a pencil in hand.

It does no good to cite science or statistics in persuading for or against vaccination on the current schedule--it feels as though both ideological sides of the argument are armed with their own set of figures and reciting them only leads to all parties becoming further entrenched in their own perspective. Science alone is not enough to persuade. Instead, with gorgeous prose in brief chapters, Biss looks at the concept of vaccination through a variety of lenses: historical, scientific, personal, political, ethical, and philosophical. Through an accretion of evidence, while concluding that vaccination is our best bet, she finds and acknowledges the shared experience in our struggle to come to peace with the prickly question of whether or not to vaccinate our children."

Within that, she brings in a lot of interesting cultural touchpoints: Bram Stoker’s Dracula, Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring, the history of inoculation, and the etymology of the metaphors we use for disease and the body—it’s a little surprising to note how many of the terms come from warfare.

209,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2597121-laura-hoffman-brauman,4,"In On Immunity: An Inoculation, Eula Biss looks at the concepts of immunization/vaccination and immunity from both a scientific, social, and historical perspective. She often writes from the perspective of a mother, anxious about the potential dangers that could impact her young son - from the actual illness to the concerns that people have about vaccinations. Her book is extremely well researched, but also comes across as very relatable as she sorts out what she sees in the media and digs in to the data behind it. The book came out in 2014 and in sections references various flu outbreaks/pandemics - it is impossible not to draw parallels between the scenarios she describes and the COVID outbreak. Some of her discussion on vaccination/precautions taken not only to protect the individual but for the good of society are particularly relevant when considering the current situation. Biss is a very strong writer and makes the science of this accessible. She has a clear point of view, but doesn't come across as preachy - she looks at both sides of an issue and builds her case. I appreciated the literary references in here, but from reading other reviews, I know that some readers felt it distracted from the book. "
210,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1045774-mehrsa,4,"I think this book was reaching for Sontag's illness metaphors and it was certainly relevant as we all await herd immunity, but it was not ultimately moving. I did want to contemplate what inoculation is and how immunity is symbolized and contemplated in culture and there were threads in here that hinted at deeper meaning, but it just never really hit the mark for me."
211,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5706847-kellie,5,"Wow, it's weird reading this during Quarantimes. But excellent. It's really good stuff. A LITTLE bit too even-handed with antivaxxers (some things should not be treated equally!), but honestly I can extend compassion to the fears these people hold, even if I think they lack empathy and good sense. At least she very much does not come down on their side."
212,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1288876-julie-g,5,"WritingAbsolutely superb. Biss's essays cover a range of social, cultural, scientific, and historical effects and implications surrounding the decision to immunize. She begins with the struggle she faced as a new mother hearing widely varying ideas of whether or not immunization is healthy and, from there, delves into the history of inoculation, the reasons people have feared the idea of vaccines throughout history and culture, and the current controversies surrounding the topic. Each essay is concisely written and well-thought-out, and you can tell that Biss has conducted thorough research. Entertainment ValueAs ideas about vaccines become more and more polarized, the issue itself has been muddied through various pseudo-scientific claims and celebrity testimonials. Biss doesn't try to give a definitive answer to the question of whether or not to vaccinate, although she is clear about her own personal beliefs. Instead, she explores every facet of the conversation, from literary to scientific to historical to pop culture. It's fascinating and easy to read - I completed it in a day.OverallI highly recommend this to anyone, parent or not, who is interested in the ongoing debate about vaccination and it's implications for community health. I feel like I learned a great deal and was excited by the number of discussions the essays in this book sparked among my friends. I highly recommend getting a copy and checking it out."
213,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6316460-becky,5,"An absolute must-read no matter what side of the vaccination fence you are sitting on. If I could have highlighted every single word I would have. I am very very pro-vaccination, but I also do not have children, and so have never been confronted with the rational and irrational fears that accompany motherhood. I have never had anyone dependent upon every decision I made, and so just cannot understand what it is like to be so completely overwhelmed with data, decisions, troubles, fears, and love. This book helped me there, and has definitely also helped me to understand internationally some of the debate over vaccinations (for instance, the middle east has wildly different problems with vaccinations- mainly that at times we have embedded spies in medical crews, etc.). Biss’s discussions on the civic implications of vaccinations, how herd immunity works within the socio-economic structure of America, how we may even possibly be risking the lives of the less fortunate in our country and others by not vaccinating, but also how vaccinations have always been a source of a personal power and freedom struggle in America is amazingly thoughtful and is dealt with beautifully. She put the whole conversation in terms that I have never before realized or been able to verbalize and she did so with wonderful prose. I whole-heartedly recommend."

And it is my first time pregnant and I have many questions about vaccinations. This was the book for me. I was skeptical because I had read about the author's conclusion in favor of vaccinations and did not want to be persuaded under false pretenses, but I feel like Biss was very thorough in her research and as honest about her questions as any concerned parent would be. As a fan of literature, I loved her inclusion of myth and discussion of vampires. I have put Dracula on my reading list and believe I will love it as much as I did Frankenstein for its observations of humanity. I also appreciated Biss's personal stories and shared conversations. It made for much easier reading. And yes, I did come away with a new perspective on vaccinations. Avoiding them is a privilege of the wealthy and a vampiric dependency on others. As a member of the community, I prefer to do my part to increase quality of life for all, and myself at the same time, by fighting fears with rationality and an overall survey of the available information."

I expected a historical look at vaccines, past, present, and future, and that is not what I got. It is a collection of essays chock-full of the bricolage the author found during her clearly extensive research on the subject. While some of the bricolage was indeed interesting, I wish an editor had taken out some of the tangents, and created more of a logical structure to this one. It could be that these tangents would be applicable to parents, but since I am not one I can only assume that is the case. The book starts out in the manner I expected, and then veered into what one might title "" A Mother's Search for Peace of Mind."" Still I learned things and connected several dots, so this was certainly worth a read as it is a good introduction to the topic. I'll be looking for other books that cover the history I was in search of, so if you know of a good one please do let me know."

It's easy to just leave it at 'well they're idiots' when thinking about why people don't vaccinate or provide other types of medical care for their children. But leaving it at that does the issue a disservice. Eula suggests that these actions are the consequence of mother-blaming, consumerism in healthcare, a particularly American desire to be completely free of dependence on others, and successful opportunists who have understood this and capitalized on addressing what nobody else will: We all want to live an ideal. Not vaccinating and bucking the medical system in general fulfills the ideals of individualism and purity."

I still do not know what all the ranting was about. It talks a great deal about vaccines and why people are afraid of them, about Dracula, and about her son, but I still don’t know what she was trying to get at. She goes on and on about her son, his birth, his vaccines, his allergies, etc. Please! You should just go ahead and write a memoir about your tendencies as an overprotective helicopter mom. I decided to read this book because it was considered one of the best 10 books of 2014 by the New York Times.

Its central thesis, that immunity is ""a shared space,"" one that inextricably binds us together, is of course incredibly prescient, something that we're all coming to understand day after day right now. But this book also does so much more, expanding the boundaries of how I think of health and vaccination and its relationship to individualism, capitalism, and language—and also what I thought was possible for a book to do. “Candide and his friends—who have been imprisoned and prostituted, who have suffered syphilis and the plague—work together on a small plot of land where they enjoy the fruits of the garden.The conclusion of Candide is masterful, according to Flaubert, because it is “as stupid as life itself.” My sister and I both remember where we were when we read Candide for the first time, but neither of us is sure of what to make of the ending. Or at least my sister is not sure at midnight, which is when I ask her to interpret Candide. “You should just say you don’t know what it means,” she advises me sleepily. I do not know what it means. I want it to mean that the garden in which we work when we are no longer optimistic is not a retreat from the world, but a place where we cultivate the world.” "

We are given a balanced layman's view of immunity in general, with a particular focus on vaccination. In short chapters she delves into the past and present of vaccination to illustrate the reasons for the way things are in the world of vaccination.One of the overarching themes of the book is how the individual human being exists in a sort of continuum, with other human beings but also as part of nature. How microorganisms are part of us and how our personal immune system is also part of a collective human immune system. To me, this was the key takeaway from the book; as someone who needed no convincing that vaccines are essential in our fight against disease.The book does not pull back punches in its criticisms of the medical community. She makes it clear that medicines suffers from issues brought about by a lack of empathy.Highly recommend. Accessible. Balanced. Nuanced."
222,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7135572-emmkay,3,"Essayist Biss muses on immunization and the fears it sparks. To do so, she draws on her personal experiences (as a mother, and as daughter of a physician), on her readings about the science of vaccination, on history, theory, and literature in this slim, thoughtful volume. I’ve read a fair amount in this area and so wished for a bit more meat, but nonetheless thought this was elegantly drawn together."

But I was already proven wrong few pages in. Coming from a viewpoint of a mother, Bliss weaved together important scientific facts, philosophy, history, and even sociology in discussing vaccination and the debate surrounding it. In her essays, Bliss writes about immunity in the context of our own communities, beyond one’s individual domain, and how it fits in the narrative of the history of the world. While it shows the importance of vaccination, Bliss was thoughtful yet incisive in analyzing the arguments of those who choose not to vaccinate their children. Their sides weren’t included for the sake of presenting both sides, but also for us to understand where they are coming from and why they are wrong. There is a certain kind of calm in the prose, the type that invites a reader to assess one’s understanding of the world. For example, there’s a part where she said that wealthier countries “have the luxury of entertaining fears the rest of the world cannot afford.” Wow.I believe this is an important book to read in these trying times."
224,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10762842-nicole-r,1,"The measles vaccine, MMR, is getting some major press time lately. It seems like many people are questioning the safety/wisdom of vaccines and many parents are choosing not to vaccinate their children. I openly admit that I am pro-vaccine. Do I recognize that there are some potentially serious side effects? Yes. Do I recognize that those side effects have been greatly reduced over recent decades as science has progressed? Yes. Do I think that the benefits of vaccinations outweigh the risks? Yes.While I think there are some very convincing arguments as to why certain parents chose not to vaccinate, I am often appalled at the downright lies and misinformation that permeate this argument and seem to take on a life of their own. I picked up this book hoping that it would provide some solid rebuttals to the common anti-vaccine arguments with an added connection of how this mother navigated the waters when making decisions for her own child.I was extremely disappointed.This book contains very few scientific facts about the safety and risks of vaccines. And by ""very few"", I mean like maybe two. Instead, it is a rambling account of what the author thinks vaccines mean to society and the history of how vaccines came to be so widespread. This could be interesting, I like social science and history, and she started strong with an interesting comparison to immunity in Greek mythology (Achilles, anyone?), but she quickly lost me as she bounced from topic to topic without any structure. It seemed like she didn't even know where she was going next but, instead, just wrote about whatever popped into her head. She also focused extensively (or, at least it felt extensively) on the comparison of immortality (which she poorly attempted to connect to vaccinations) to how vampires are portrayed in mainstream media. From Dracula to Bela Lugosi to True Blood and Twilight, the portrayal of vampires mirrors how society feels about vaccines. What?!? Does that mean that society really wishes we could sparkle in the sunlight?! (Okay, that may actually be a valid point). It was just weird. And based on poor logic. The author annoyed me as well. It becomes painfully clear that this is one of those parents who is scared of everything her child comes into contact with. She is the mother who reads crazy blogs, accepts them as gospel, and then knee-jerk reacts to them. She came across as flaky, an over-disinfecter to ensure her child's world is germ-free, and basically someone I would never be friends with but would roll my eyes at in public.I could go on and on about the ways this book annoyed me. It adds nothing to the vaccination debate outside of soundbite quotes and illogical analogies. I highly recommend not reading this book and instead finding something with even a modicum of fact or actual research."
225,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/117566-mauri,5,"""You can respect the fear. The fear of vaccines is understandable. But you can't respect the decision - it's an unnecessary risk."" - Paul Offit, pediatrician/author/vaccine inventor.Biss writes from the perspective of what we call at work, ""the vaccine hesitant parent."" They're not sure they want every vaccine, and they're not sure they want them for their child right here, right now. They've heard things, read things. They're not vaccine-preventable disease epidemiologists (like me), they might not have access to peer-reviewed journal articles, and they may not even be able to grok the vaccine schedule the CDC publishes or the simplified, colorful version put out by their state health department, or even the short list on their child's preschool's website. This is highly understandable because I spend part of every week explaining it to doctors and nurses - the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine catch-up schedule is a nightmare of minimum ages and intervals.At work, it's ground into us over and over that ""vaccine hesitant"" =/= ""anti-vaxxer."" Which makes perfect sense: asking a question about preservatives in vaccines does not mean you don't want to vaccinate your child, it means that you've heard or read some concerning things about thimerosal (probably from anti-vaxxers) and want to know what's up. They want reassurance, an explanation. They do not want a shout-y pediatrician or nurse snapping ""because I said so!"" (Which sounds like a ridiculous response until you've met a lot of health care professionals.)Biss interweaves her own journey through childbirth and motherhood with the anti-vaccine movements of the past and present, meditating on the whys and wherefores of public health. Who needs it? Who thinks they don't need it? A lot of her ponderings dovetail neatly with an article published this week, What the Measles Epidemic Really Says About America; both mention Susan Sontag's ""Illness as Metaphor"" and ""AIDS and Its Metaphors,"" both discuss the NIMBYism of anti-vaxxers, the rise of the individual as preeminent in health care, and distrust of the government.I found this incredibly engaging and readable, especially considering that it's languished on my to-read list long enough that I've forgotten where I heard of it or who recommended it to me. I suspect it was someone local or at work - the book was published by the press my best friend interned for in college, a local company, and Biss received a Minnesota State Arts Board Operating Support Grant."
226,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/962663-karen,5,"Biss writes a book about immunity that dwells in the intersection between objectivity and subjectivity, which makes sense, given she is the child of a physician and a poet. I love this book. I wanted to race through it because it was smart, beautiful and poignant. But I forced myself to slow down for the same reasons. Biss investigates the history of inoculation through three primary methods: she explores key historical detail about events, researchers and advocates (such as the development of small pox inoculation); she explores the metaphors in the language and the symbolism in the actions (war as a metaphor for illness and metaphorical views of germs, viruses, toxicity, disease and filth); and she shares her own journey as a mother trying to protect her own health and the health of her child (her son has severe allergies). Biss writes a book that's immensely complex; however, her prose illuminates as she parses these complexities. Other reviewers compare her to Sontag and Didion, but I see her doing work similar to Sachs, Wilson, and other public intellectuals. She's insightful and articulate. Some of the sections directly take on the anti-vax movement, but she doesn't scold. Biss tries to understand how people on various sides of the issue form their arguments. Many sections of the book investigate how emotion and perception contribute to opinion and policy. For example, I can see quite clearly how people in Africa rely on emotion, perception and bias to resist inoculation efforts by foreigners. This makes me wonder how I might be blind to my own ""reasonable"" conclusions about inoculations and more broadly how nonscientific elements influence US policies about inoculations. Biss also brings in works from the humanities. Readers will encounter passages from _Dracula_, _Alice and Wonderland_ and _Candide_ as well as quotes from Susan Sontag's parallel works about illness in general and AIDS specifically as cultural metaphors. Rachel Carson's _Silent Spring_ makes an argument that people and their environment are intertwined. I enjoyed this book so much, I'm tempted to reread it immediately. It's already proved relevant to today's news. I was reading comments in response to a _Washington Post_ news story about immigration, and many were fearful that immigrants sans inoculations were going to bring disease into the US."
227,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/312880-melissa,5,"Excellent short of book of essays and meditations on the nature of vaccination as both a concept and a practice, the logic behind anti-vaccination, the history of compulsory medicine, the nature of scientific research, language/semantics, skepticism, the undying nature of stuff that gets on the Internet, and the anxiety that comes with being a parent.As an epidemiologist, I requested (and was granted - thanks Graywolf Press!) an advance copy because I wanted to know what Biss - from the position of a parent and writer, not a scientist in any way - had to say about vaccination. Vaccination, in my line of work, is one of our front-line infectious disease prevention tools right behind handwashing and covering your cough/sneeze. It protects not only the individual but also those who cannot be immunized (infants, those with compromised immune systems, etc) from diseases that can take a huge toll in mortality and morbidity. A world where we lose that herd immunity due to ""anti-vaxxers"" which allows diseases like measles (a disease that killed tens of thousands of children in the pre-vaccine era of the 20th century) to run rampant is truly terrifying to me. Biss looks at a lot of her own fears and those of other mothers and then collates/arranges/dissects her research. I don't really want to comment a lot on her conclusions - because that would ruin the work of the book - but suffice to say she posits a lot of good arguments and writes it all very well. Everyone should read this."
228,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/142271-pamela,0," A brief, intriguing, essayistic meditation on vaccination, with forays into the related contemporary fear of toxins in our food and environment. I was most interested in Biss's convincing speculations about the metaphors that distort our thinking when it comes to vaccination, disease, and health. Biss the author is a rationalist, but Biss the mother (of one young son) has experienced enough anxious fear that she is completely snark-free when it comes to the anti-vaccine crowd. She suggests an interesting history here: a few centuries ago, Westerners worried most about ""filth""; post-germ theory, they worried about germs; today, with germs under greater control than ever in human history, we worry about ""toxins""--by which we mean (though the usage is inaccurate) poisons we've produced via our own scientific ingenuity. Biss also has some striking things to say about our tendency to draw illogical boundaries between what we deem to be ""self"" and ""nonself."" ""Nonself,"" she shows, is very often a misnomer. This is a book just about everyone should read if they want to be smarter about certain urgent cultural conversations."

It answers a question I've had for some time without really realizing: why is it that so many (almost uniformly) white, upper- class women with college degrees and otherwise progressive politics believe they shouldn't vaccinate their children? In a series of penetrating essays, Biss pulls back the layers of the anti-vaccination movement throughout the last 100 years to expose its roots in class and race issues, the marginalization of women in medicine and our chronic inability to see ourselves as members of a larger community. Unfortunately the second half of the book tosses all of that out the window and becomes a series of personal essays about her birth and her son's infant medical care, where a whole host of the author's personal neuroses are put on display: from her year(!) of hand-wringing over her need to receive a blood transfusion while giving birth to her fervent paranoid belief that her doctors are attempting to ""punish"" her and her child for questioning orthodox medical science. Blehhh. And you were doing so well, too."

This, for me, is one of those books that inspires me to be a better reader and a better thinker. It's a short book but she crams a lot of thinking in there and it's clear she did a ton of research before writing this contemplation. I'm not really sure what to call this book...an essay? I do wonder if this is the sort of book she intended to write when she started her research and note-taking. In any case, with such disparate sources making up her body of research she did an impressive job of distilling her thoughts and reflections and somehow making this thing hang together and be readable. Yet, because there is so much here, I will probably be reading it again with a pencil in hand. One little thought: as a researcher myself, I thoroughly appreciated the tears that can result when one falls down the rabbit hole..."
231,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2375647-andrea-schwalm-stolz,5,"I think that Ms. Biss is onto something important with this book. It does no good to cite science or statistics in persuading for or against vaccination on the current schedule--it feels as though both ideological sides of the argument are armed with their own set of figures and reciting them only leads to all parties becoming further entrenched in their own perspective. Science alone is not enough to persuade. Instead, with gorgeous prose in brief chapters, Biss looks at the concept of vaccination through a variety of lenses: historical, scientific, personal, political, ethical, and philosophical. Through an accretion of evidence, while concluding that vaccination is our best bet, she finds and acknowledges the shared experience in our struggle to come to peace with the prickly question of whether or not to vaccinate our children."

But I found it to be a very smart and measured contemplation of the ways in which we view our bodies, health and illness, our immune systems—the term is recent, a 1970s construct—and particularly the subject of vaccinations. Within that, she brings in a lot of interesting cultural touchpoints: Bram Stoker’s Dracula, Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring, the history of inoculation, and the etymology of the metaphors we use for disease and the body—it’s a little surprising to note how many of the terms come from warfare. Or maybe it’s not. As someone who has a very uneasy relationship to doctors and medicine and illness, I found the book surprisingly reassuring."

On Immunity takes an academic, literary approach to that question and comes up with a variety of illuminating answers, or rather, the various pieces that constitute a nebulous, partial answer. So much about the current debate that seems novel actually has historical precedent, such as the tendency of the wealthy to rely on the less wealthy to bolster their health via herd immunity. But beyond that, On Immunity is a meditation on an individual's body in relationship to the community and what underscores our beliefs about health. It's an enriching and pleasurable read that I recommend heartily. "

239,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2597121-laura-hoffman-brauman,4,"In On Immunity: An Inoculation, Eula Biss looks at the concepts of immunization/vaccination and immunity from both a scientific, social, and historical perspective. She often writes from the perspective of a mother, anxious about the potential dangers that could impact her young son - from the actual illness to the concerns that people have about vaccinations. Her book is extremely well researched, but also comes across as very relatable as she sorts out what she sees in the media and digs in to the data behind it. The book came out in 2014 and in sections references various flu outbreaks/pandemics - it is impossible not to draw parallels between the scenarios she describes and the COVID outbreak. Some of her discussion on vaccination/precautions taken not only to protect the individual but for the good of society are particularly relevant when considering the current situation. Biss is a very strong writer and makes the science of this accessible. She has a clear point of view, but doesn't come across as preachy - she looks at both sides of an issue and builds her case. I appreciated the literary references in here, but from reading other reviews, I know that some readers felt it distracted from the book. "
240,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1045774-mehrsa,4,"I think this book was reaching for Sontag's illness metaphors and it was certainly relevant as we all await herd immunity, but it was not ultimately moving. I did want to contemplate what inoculation is and how immunity is symbolized and contemplated in culture and there were threads in here that hinted at deeper meaning, but it just never really hit the mark for me."
241,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5706847-kellie,5,"Wow, it's weird reading this during Quarantimes. But excellent. It's really good stuff. A LITTLE bit too even-handed with antivaxxers (some things should not be treated equally!), but honestly I can extend compassion to the fears these people hold, even if I think they lack empathy and good sense. At least she very much does not come down on their side."
242,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1288876-julie-g,5,"WritingAbsolutely superb. Biss's essays cover a range of social, cultural, scientific, and historical effects and implications surrounding the decision to immunize. She begins with the struggle she faced as a new mother hearing widely varying ideas of whether or not immunization is healthy and, from there, delves into the history of inoculation, the reasons people have feared the idea of vaccines throughout history and culture, and the current controversies surrounding the topic. Each essay is concisely written and well-thought-out, and you can tell that Biss has conducted thorough research. Entertainment ValueAs ideas about vaccines become more and more polarized, the issue itself has been muddied through various pseudo-scientific claims and celebrity testimonials. Biss doesn't try to give a definitive answer to the question of whether or not to vaccinate, although she is clear about her own personal beliefs. Instead, she explores every facet of the conversation, from literary to scientific to historical to pop culture. It's fascinating and easy to read - I completed it in a day.OverallI highly recommend this to anyone, parent or not, who is interested in the ongoing debate about vaccination and it's implications for community health. I feel like I learned a great deal and was excited by the number of discussions the essays in this book sparked among my friends. I highly recommend getting a copy and checking it out."
243,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6316460-becky,5,"An absolute must-read no matter what side of the vaccination fence you are sitting on. If I could have highlighted every single word I would have. I am very very pro-vaccination, but I also do not have children, and so have never been confronted with the rational and irrational fears that accompany motherhood. I have never had anyone dependent upon every decision I made, and so just cannot understand what it is like to be so completely overwhelmed with data, decisions, troubles, fears, and love. This book helped me there, and has definitely also helped me to understand internationally some of the debate over vaccinations (for instance, the middle east has wildly different problems with vaccinations- mainly that at times we have embedded spies in medical crews, etc.). Biss’s discussions on the civic implications of vaccinations, how herd immunity works within the socio-economic structure of America, how we may even possibly be risking the lives of the less fortunate in our country and others by not vaccinating, but also how vaccinations have always been a source of a personal power and freedom struggle in America is amazingly thoughtful and is dealt with beautifully. She put the whole conversation in terms that I have never before realized or been able to verbalize and she did so with wonderful prose. I whole-heartedly recommend."
244,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4764870-laura-dallas,5,"I kept being surprised to find this book on so many ""best of"" lists in a variety of media. And it is my first time pregnant and I have many questions about vaccinations. This was the book for me. I was skeptical because I had read about the author's conclusion in favor of vaccinations and did not want to be persuaded under false pretenses, but I feel like Biss was very thorough in her research and as honest about her questions as any concerned parent would be. As a fan of literature, I loved her inclusion of myth and discussion of vampires. I have put Dracula on my reading list and believe I will love it as much as I did Frankenstein for its observations of humanity. I also appreciated Biss's personal stories and shared conversations. It made for much easier reading. And yes, I did come away with a new perspective on vaccinations. Avoiding them is a privilege of the wealthy and a vampiric dependency on others. As a member of the community, I prefer to do my part to increase quality of life for all, and myself at the same time, by fighting fears with rationality and an overall survey of the available information."
245,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3123067-elizabeth-a,3,"I listened to the audiobook, which was well narrated by Tamara Marston.This is not the book I expected to read. I expected a historical look at vaccines, past, present, and future, and that is not what I got. It is a collection of essays chock-full of the bricolage the author found during her clearly extensive research on the subject. While some of the bricolage was indeed interesting, I wish an editor had taken out some of the tangents, and created more of a logical structure to this one. It could be that these tangents would be applicable to parents, but since I am not one I can only assume that is the case. The book starts out in the manner I expected, and then veered into what one might title "" A Mother's Search for Peace of Mind."" Still I learned things and connected several dots, so this was certainly worth a read as it is a good introduction to the topic. I'll be looking for other books that cover the history I was in search of, so if you know of a good one please do let me know."

It's easy to just leave it at 'well they're idiots' when thinking about why people don't vaccinate or provide other types of medical care for their children. But leaving it at that does the issue a disservice. Eula suggests that these actions are the consequence of mother-blaming, consumerism in healthcare, a particularly American desire to be completely free of dependence on others, and successful opportunists who have understood this and capitalized on addressing what nobody else will: We all want to live an ideal. Not vaccinating and bucking the medical system in general fulfills the ideals of individualism and purity."
247,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1924495-luis,1,"What a waste of time this book was. The only positive thing is that it is short. The problem? It has no thesis whatsoever. I still do not know what all the ranting was about. It talks a great deal about vaccines and why people are afraid of them, about Dracula, and about her son, but I still don’t know what she was trying to get at. She goes on and on about her son, his birth, his vaccines, his allergies, etc. Please! You should just go ahead and write a memoir about your tendencies as an overprotective helicopter mom. I decided to read this book because it was considered one of the best 10 books of 2014 by the New York Times. I don’t know what the Times base’s its decision on but this one has got to be the worst I have read in a long time! "

Its central thesis, that immunity is ""a shared space,"" one that inextricably binds us together, is of course incredibly prescient, something that we're all coming to understand day after day right now. But this book also does so much more, expanding the boundaries of how I think of health and vaccination and its relationship to individualism, capitalism, and language—and also what I thought was possible for a book to do. “Candide and his friends—who have been imprisoned and prostituted, who have suffered syphilis and the plague—work together on a small plot of land where they enjoy the fruits of the garden.The conclusion of Candide is masterful, according to Flaubert, because it is “as stupid as life itself.” My sister and I both remember where we were when we read Candide for the first time, but neither of us is sure of what to make of the ending. Or at least my sister is not sure at midnight, which is when I ask her to interpret Candide. “You should just say you don’t know what it means,” she advises me sleepily. I do not know what it means. I want it to mean that the garden in which we work when we are no longer optimistic is not a retreat from the world, but a place where we cultivate the world.” "

We are given a balanced layman's view of immunity in general, with a particular focus on vaccination. In short chapters she delves into the past and present of vaccination to illustrate the reasons for the way things are in the world of vaccination.One of the overarching themes of the book is how the individual human being exists in a sort of continuum, with other human beings but also as part of nature. How microorganisms are part of us and how our personal immune system is also part of a collective human immune system. To me, this was the key takeaway from the book; as someone who needed no convincing that vaccines are essential in our fight against disease.The book does not pull back punches in its criticisms of the medical community. She makes it clear that medicines suffers from issues brought about by a lack of empathy.Highly recommend. Accessible. Balanced. Nuanced."
252,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7135572-emmkay,3,"Essayist Biss muses on immunization and the fears it sparks. To do so, she draws on her personal experiences (as a mother, and as daughter of a physician), on her readings about the science of vaccination, on history, theory, and literature in this slim, thoughtful volume. I’ve read a fair amount in this area and so wished for a bit more meat, but nonetheless thought this was elegantly drawn together."

But I was already proven wrong few pages in. Coming from a viewpoint of a mother, Bliss weaved together important scientific facts, philosophy, history, and even sociology in discussing vaccination and the debate surrounding it. In her essays, Bliss writes about immunity in the context of our own communities, beyond one’s individual domain, and how it fits in the narrative of the history of the world. While it shows the importance of vaccination, Bliss was thoughtful yet incisive in analyzing the arguments of those who choose not to vaccinate their children. Their sides weren’t included for the sake of presenting both sides, but also for us to understand where they are coming from and why they are wrong. There is a certain kind of calm in the prose, the type that invites a reader to assess one’s understanding of the world. For example, there’s a part where she said that wealthier countries “have the luxury of entertaining fears the rest of the world cannot afford.” Wow.I believe this is an important book to read in these trying times."
254,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10762842-nicole-r,1,"The measles vaccine, MMR, is getting some major press time lately. It seems like many people are questioning the safety/wisdom of vaccines and many parents are choosing not to vaccinate their children. I openly admit that I am pro-vaccine. Do I recognize that there are some potentially serious side effects? Yes. Do I recognize that those side effects have been greatly reduced over recent decades as science has progressed? Yes. Do I think that the benefits of vaccinations outweigh the risks? Yes.While I think there are some very convincing arguments as to why certain parents chose not to vaccinate, I am often appalled at the downright lies and misinformation that permeate this argument and seem to take on a life of their own. I picked up this book hoping that it would provide some solid rebuttals to the common anti-vaccine arguments with an added connection of how this mother navigated the waters when making decisions for her own child.I was extremely disappointed.This book contains very few scientific facts about the safety and risks of vaccines. And by ""very few"", I mean like maybe two. Instead, it is a rambling account of what the author thinks vaccines mean to society and the history of how vaccines came to be so widespread. This could be interesting, I like social science and history, and she started strong with an interesting comparison to immunity in Greek mythology (Achilles, anyone?), but she quickly lost me as she bounced from topic to topic without any structure. It seemed like she didn't even know where she was going next but, instead, just wrote about whatever popped into her head. She also focused extensively (or, at least it felt extensively) on the comparison of immortality (which she poorly attempted to connect to vaccinations) to how vampires are portrayed in mainstream media. From Dracula to Bela Lugosi to True Blood and Twilight, the portrayal of vampires mirrors how society feels about vaccines. What?!? Does that mean that society really wishes we could sparkle in the sunlight?! (Okay, that may actually be a valid point). It was just weird. And based on poor logic. The author annoyed me as well. It becomes painfully clear that this is one of those parents who is scared of everything her child comes into contact with. She is the mother who reads crazy blogs, accepts them as gospel, and then knee-jerk reacts to them. She came across as flaky, an over-disinfecter to ensure her child's world is germ-free, and basically someone I would never be friends with but would roll my eyes at in public.I could go on and on about the ways this book annoyed me. It adds nothing to the vaccination debate outside of soundbite quotes and illogical analogies. I highly recommend not reading this book and instead finding something with even a modicum of fact or actual research."
255,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/117566-mauri,5,"""You can respect the fear. The fear of vaccines is understandable. But you can't respect the decision - it's an unnecessary risk."" - Paul Offit, pediatrician/author/vaccine inventor.Biss writes from the perspective of what we call at work, ""the vaccine hesitant parent."" They're not sure they want every vaccine, and they're not sure they want them for their child right here, right now. They've heard things, read things. They're not vaccine-preventable disease epidemiologists (like me), they might not have access to peer-reviewed journal articles, and they may not even be able to grok the vaccine schedule the CDC publishes or the simplified, colorful version put out by their state health department, or even the short list on their child's preschool's website. This is highly understandable because I spend part of every week explaining it to doctors and nurses - the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine catch-up schedule is a nightmare of minimum ages and intervals.At work, it's ground into us over and over that ""vaccine hesitant"" =/= ""anti-vaxxer."" Which makes perfect sense: asking a question about preservatives in vaccines does not mean you don't want to vaccinate your child, it means that you've heard or read some concerning things about thimerosal (probably from anti-vaxxers) and want to know what's up. They want reassurance, an explanation. They do not want a shout-y pediatrician or nurse snapping ""because I said so!"" (Which sounds like a ridiculous response until you've met a lot of health care professionals.)Biss interweaves her own journey through childbirth and motherhood with the anti-vaccine movements of the past and present, meditating on the whys and wherefores of public health. Who needs it? Who thinks they don't need it? A lot of her ponderings dovetail neatly with an article published this week, What the Measles Epidemic Really Says About America; both mention Susan Sontag's ""Illness as Metaphor"" and ""AIDS and Its Metaphors,"" both discuss the NIMBYism of anti-vaxxers, the rise of the individual as preeminent in health care, and distrust of the government.I found this incredibly engaging and readable, especially considering that it's languished on my to-read list long enough that I've forgotten where I heard of it or who recommended it to me. I suspect it was someone local or at work - the book was published by the press my best friend interned for in college, a local company, and Biss received a Minnesota State Arts Board Operating Support Grant."
256,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/962663-karen,5,"Biss writes a book about immunity that dwells in the intersection between objectivity and subjectivity, which makes sense, given she is the child of a physician and a poet. I love this book. I wanted to race through it because it was smart, beautiful and poignant. But I forced myself to slow down for the same reasons. Biss investigates the history of inoculation through three primary methods: she explores key historical detail about events, researchers and advocates (such as the development of small pox inoculation); she explores the metaphors in the language and the symbolism in the actions (war as a metaphor for illness and metaphorical views of germs, viruses, toxicity, disease and filth); and she shares her own journey as a mother trying to protect her own health and the health of her child (her son has severe allergies). Biss writes a book that's immensely complex; however, her prose illuminates as she parses these complexities. Other reviewers compare her to Sontag and Didion, but I see her doing work similar to Sachs, Wilson, and other public intellectuals. She's insightful and articulate. Some of the sections directly take on the anti-vax movement, but she doesn't scold. Biss tries to understand how people on various sides of the issue form their arguments. Many sections of the book investigate how emotion and perception contribute to opinion and policy. For example, I can see quite clearly how people in Africa rely on emotion, perception and bias to resist inoculation efforts by foreigners. This makes me wonder how I might be blind to my own ""reasonable"" conclusions about inoculations and more broadly how nonscientific elements influence US policies about inoculations. Biss also brings in works from the humanities. Readers will encounter passages from _Dracula_, _Alice and Wonderland_ and _Candide_ as well as quotes from Susan Sontag's parallel works about illness in general and AIDS specifically as cultural metaphors. Rachel Carson's _Silent Spring_ makes an argument that people and their environment are intertwined. I enjoyed this book so much, I'm tempted to reread it immediately. It's already proved relevant to today's news. I was reading comments in response to a _Washington Post_ news story about immigration, and many were fearful that immigrants sans inoculations were going to bring disease into the US."
257,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/312880-melissa,5,"Excellent short of book of essays and meditations on the nature of vaccination as both a concept and a practice, the logic behind anti-vaccination, the history of compulsory medicine, the nature of scientific research, language/semantics, skepticism, the undying nature of stuff that gets on the Internet, and the anxiety that comes with being a parent.As an epidemiologist, I requested (and was granted - thanks Graywolf Press!) an advance copy because I wanted to know what Biss - from the position of a parent and writer, not a scientist in any way - had to say about vaccination. Vaccination, in my line of work, is one of our front-line infectious disease prevention tools right behind handwashing and covering your cough/sneeze. It protects not only the individual but also those who cannot be immunized (infants, those with compromised immune systems, etc) from diseases that can take a huge toll in mortality and morbidity. A world where we lose that herd immunity due to ""anti-vaxxers"" which allows diseases like measles (a disease that killed tens of thousands of children in the pre-vaccine era of the 20th century) to run rampant is truly terrifying to me. Biss looks at a lot of her own fears and those of other mothers and then collates/arranges/dissects her research. I don't really want to comment a lot on her conclusions - because that would ruin the work of the book - but suffice to say she posits a lot of good arguments and writes it all very well. Everyone should read this."
258,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/142271-pamela,0," A brief, intriguing, essayistic meditation on vaccination, with forays into the related contemporary fear of toxins in our food and environment. I was most interested in Biss's convincing speculations about the metaphors that distort our thinking when it comes to vaccination, disease, and health. Biss the author is a rationalist, but Biss the mother (of one young son) has experienced enough anxious fear that she is completely snark-free when it comes to the anti-vaccine crowd. She suggests an interesting history here: a few centuries ago, Westerners worried most about ""filth""; post-germ theory, they worried about germs; today, with germs under greater control than ever in human history, we worry about ""toxins""--by which we mean (though the usage is inaccurate) poisons we've produced via our own scientific ingenuity. Biss also has some striking things to say about our tendency to draw illogical boundaries between what we deem to be ""self"" and ""nonself."" ""Nonself,"" she shows, is very often a misnomer. This is a book just about everyone should read if they want to be smarter about certain urgent cultural conversations."

It answers a question I've had for some time without really realizing: why is it that so many (almost uniformly) white, upper- class women with college degrees and otherwise progressive politics believe they shouldn't vaccinate their children? In a series of penetrating essays, Biss pulls back the layers of the anti-vaccination movement throughout the last 100 years to expose its roots in class and race issues, the marginalization of women in medicine and our chronic inability to see ourselves as members of a larger community. Unfortunately the second half of the book tosses all of that out the window and becomes a series of personal essays about her birth and her son's infant medical care, where a whole host of the author's personal neuroses are put on display: from her year(!) of hand-wringing over her need to receive a blood transfusion while giving birth to her fervent paranoid belief that her doctors are attempting to ""punish"" her and her child for questioning orthodox medical science. Blehhh. And you were doing so well, too."

This, for me, is one of those books that inspires me to be a better reader and a better thinker. It's a short book but she crams a lot of thinking in there and it's clear she did a ton of research before writing this contemplation. I'm not really sure what to call this book...an essay? I do wonder if this is the sort of book she intended to write when she started her research and note-taking. In any case, with such disparate sources making up her body of research she did an impressive job of distilling her thoughts and reflections and somehow making this thing hang together and be readable. Yet, because there is so much here, I will probably be reading it again with a pencil in hand. One little thought: as a researcher myself, I thoroughly appreciated the tears that can result when one falls down the rabbit hole..."

It does no good to cite science or statistics in persuading for or against vaccination on the current schedule--it feels as though both ideological sides of the argument are armed with their own set of figures and reciting them only leads to all parties becoming further entrenched in their own perspective. Science alone is not enough to persuade. Instead, with gorgeous prose in brief chapters, Biss looks at the concept of vaccination through a variety of lenses: historical, scientific, personal, political, ethical, and philosophical. Through an accretion of evidence, while concluding that vaccination is our best bet, she finds and acknowledges the shared experience in our struggle to come to peace with the prickly question of whether or not to vaccinate our children."

But I found it to be a very smart and measured contemplation of the ways in which we view our bodies, health and illness, our immune systems—the term is recent, a 1970s construct—and particularly the subject of vaccinations. Within that, she brings in a lot of interesting cultural touchpoints: Bram Stoker’s Dracula, Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring, the history of inoculation, and the etymology of the metaphors we use for disease and the body—it’s a little surprising to note how many of the terms come from warfare. Or maybe it’s not. As someone who has a very uneasy relationship to doctors and medicine and illness, I found the book surprisingly reassuring."

On Immunity takes an academic, literary approach to that question and comes up with a variety of illuminating answers, or rather, the various pieces that constitute a nebulous, partial answer. So much about the current debate that seems novel actually has historical precedent, such as the tendency of the wealthy to rely on the less wealthy to bolster their health via herd immunity. But beyond that, On Immunity is a meditation on an individual's body in relationship to the community and what underscores our beliefs about health. It's an enriching and pleasurable read that I recommend heartily. "

Her book is extremely well researched, but also comes across as very relatable as she sorts out what she sees in the media and digs in to the data behind it. The book came out in 2014 and in sections references various flu outbreaks/pandemics - it is impossible not to draw parallels between the scenarios she describes and the COVID outbreak.

Biss is a very strong writer and makes the science of this accessible. She has a clear point of view, but doesn't come across as preachy - she looks at both sides of an issue and builds her case. I appreciated the literary references in here, but from reading other reviews, I know that some readers felt it distracted from the book. "

I did want to contemplate what inoculation is and how immunity is symbolized and contemplated in culture and there were threads in here that hinted at deeper meaning, but it just never really hit the mark for me."
271,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5706847-kellie,5,"Wow, it's weird reading this during Quarantimes. But excellent. It's really good stuff. A LITTLE bit too even-handed with antivaxxers (some things should not be treated equally!), but honestly I can extend compassion to the fears these people hold, even if I think they lack empathy and good sense. At least she very much does not come down on their side."
272,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1288876-julie-g,5,"WritingAbsolutely superb. Biss's essays cover a range of social, cultural, scientific, and historical effects and implications surrounding the decision to immunize. She begins with the struggle she faced as a new mother hearing widely varying ideas of whether or not immunization is healthy and, from there, delves into the history of inoculation, the reasons people have feared the idea of vaccines throughout history and culture, and the current controversies surrounding the topic. Each essay is concisely written and well-thought-out, and you can tell that Biss has conducted thorough research. Entertainment ValueAs ideas about vaccines become more and more polarized, the issue itself has been muddied through various pseudo-scientific claims and celebrity testimonials. Biss doesn't try to give a definitive answer to the question of whether or not to vaccinate, although she is clear about her own personal beliefs. Instead, she explores every facet of the conversation, from literary to scientific to historical to pop culture. It's fascinating and easy to read - I completed it in a day.OverallI highly recommend this to anyone, parent or not, who is interested in the ongoing debate about vaccination and it's implications for community health. I feel like I learned a great deal and was excited by the number of discussions the essays in this book sparked among my friends. I highly recommend getting a copy and checking it out."

If I could have highlighted every single word I would have. I am very very pro-vaccination, but I also do not have children, and so have never been confronted with the rational and irrational fears that accompany motherhood. I have never had anyone dependent upon every decision I made, and so just cannot understand what it is like to be so completely overwhelmed with data, decisions, troubles, fears, and love. This book helped me there, and has definitely also helped me to understand internationally some of the debate over vaccinations (for instance, the middle east has wildly different problems with vaccinations- mainly that at times we have embedded spies in medical crews, etc.). Biss’s discussions on the civic implications of vaccinations, how herd immunity works within the socio-economic structure of America, how we may even possibly be risking the lives of the less fortunate in our country and others by not vaccinating, but also how vaccinations have always been a source of a personal power and freedom struggle in America is amazingly thoughtful and is dealt with beautifully. She put the whole conversation in terms that I have never before realized or been able to verbalize and she did so with wonderful prose. I whole-heartedly recommend."

And it is my first time pregnant and I have many questions about vaccinations. This was the book for me. I was skeptical because I had read about the author's conclusion in favor of vaccinations and did not want to be persuaded under false pretenses, but I feel like Biss was very thorough in her research and as honest about her questions as any concerned parent would be. As a fan of literature, I loved her inclusion of myth and discussion of vampires. I have put Dracula on my reading list and believe I will love it as much as I did Frankenstein for its observations of humanity. I also appreciated Biss's personal stories and shared conversations. It made for much easier reading. And yes, I did come away with a new perspective on vaccinations. Avoiding them is a privilege of the wealthy and a vampiric dependency on others. As a member of the community, I prefer to do my part to increase quality of life for all, and myself at the same time, by fighting fears with rationality and an overall survey of the available information."

I expected a historical look at vaccines, past, present, and future, and that is not what I got. It is a collection of essays chock-full of the bricolage the author found during her clearly extensive research on the subject. While some of the bricolage was indeed interesting, I wish an editor had taken out some of the tangents, and created more of a logical structure to this one. It could be that these tangents would be applicable to parents, but since I am not one I can only assume that is the case. The book starts out in the manner I expected, and then veered into what one might title "" A Mother's Search for Peace of Mind."" Still I learned things and connected several dots, so this was certainly worth a read as it is a good introduction to the topic. I'll be looking for other books that cover the history I was in search of, so if you know of a good one please do let me know."

It's easy to just leave it at 'well they're idiots' when thinking about why people don't vaccinate or provide other types of medical care for their children. But leaving it at that does the issue a disservice. Eula suggests that these actions are the consequence of mother-blaming, consumerism in healthcare, a particularly American desire to be completely free of dependence on others, and successful opportunists who have understood this and capitalized on addressing what nobody else will: We all want to live an ideal. Not vaccinating and bucking the medical system in general fulfills the ideals of individualism and purity."

I still do not know what all the ranting was about. It talks a great deal about vaccines and why people are afraid of them, about Dracula, and about her son, but I still don’t know what she was trying to get at. She goes on and on about her son, his birth, his vaccines, his allergies, etc. Please! You should just go ahead and write a memoir about your tendencies as an overprotective helicopter mom. I decided to read this book because it was considered one of the best 10 books of 2014 by the New York Times. I don’t know what the Times base’s its decision on but this one has got to be the worst I have read in a long time! "

Its central thesis, that immunity is ""a shared space,"" one that inextricably binds us together, is of course incredibly prescient, something that we're all coming to understand day after day right now. But this book also does so much more, expanding the boundaries of how I think of health and vaccination and its relationship to individualism, capitalism, and language—and also what I thought was possible for a book to do. “Candide and his friends—who have been imprisoned and prostituted, who have suffered syphilis and the plague—work together on a small plot of land where they enjoy the fruits of the garden.The conclusion of Candide is masterful, according to Flaubert, because it is “as stupid as life itself.” My sister and I both remember where we were when we read Candide for the first time, but neither of us is sure of what to make of the ending. Or at least my sister is not sure at midnight, which is when I ask her to interpret Candide. “You should just say you don’t know what it means,” she advises me sleepily. I do not know what it means. I want it to mean that the garden in which we work when we are no longer optimistic is not a retreat from the world, but a place where we cultivate the world.” "

We are given a balanced layman's view of immunity in general, with a particular focus on vaccination. In short chapters she delves into the past and present of vaccination to illustrate the reasons for the way things are in the world of vaccination.One of the overarching themes of the book is how the individual human being exists in a sort of continuum, with other human beings but also as part of nature. How microorganisms are part of us and how our personal immune system is also part of a collective human immune system. To me, this was the key takeaway from the book; as someone who needed no convincing that vaccines are essential in our fight against disease.The book does not pull back punches in its criticisms of the medical community. She makes it clear that medicines suffers from issues brought about by a lack of empathy.Highly recommend. Accessible. Balanced. Nuanced."
282,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7135572-emmkay,3,"Essayist Biss muses on immunization and the fears it sparks. To do so, she draws on her personal experiences (as a mother, and as daughter of a physician), on her readings about the science of vaccination, on history, theory, and literature in this slim, thoughtful volume. I’ve read a fair amount in this area and so wished for a bit more meat, but nonetheless thought this was elegantly drawn together."

But I was already proven wrong few pages in. Coming from a viewpoint of a mother, Bliss weaved together important scientific facts, philosophy, history, and even sociology in discussing vaccination and the debate surrounding it. In her essays, Bliss writes about immunity in the context of our own communities, beyond one’s individual domain, and how it fits in the narrative of the history of the world. While it shows the importance of vaccination, Bliss was thoughtful yet incisive in analyzing the arguments of those who choose not to vaccinate their children. Their sides weren’t included for the sake of presenting both sides, but also for us to understand where they are coming from and why they are wrong. There is a certain kind of calm in the prose, the type that invites a reader to assess one’s understanding of the world. For example, there’s a part where she said that wealthier countries “have the luxury of entertaining fears the rest of the world cannot afford.” Wow.I believe this is an important book to read in these trying times."
284,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10762842-nicole-r,1,"The measles vaccine, MMR, is getting some major press time lately. It seems like many people are questioning the safety/wisdom of vaccines and many parents are choosing not to vaccinate their children. I openly admit that I am pro-vaccine. Do I recognize that there are some potentially serious side effects? Yes. Do I recognize that those side effects have been greatly reduced over recent decades as science has progressed? Yes. Do I think that the benefits of vaccinations outweigh the risks? Yes.While I think there are some very convincing arguments as to why certain parents chose not to vaccinate, I am often appalled at the downright lies and misinformation that permeate this argument and seem to take on a life of their own. I picked up this book hoping that it would provide some solid rebuttals to the common anti-vaccine arguments with an added connection of how this mother navigated the waters when making decisions for her own child.I was extremely disappointed.This book contains very few scientific facts about the safety and risks of vaccines. And by ""very few"", I mean like maybe two. Instead, it is a rambling account of what the author thinks vaccines mean to society and the history of how vaccines came to be so widespread. This could be interesting, I like social science and history, and she started strong with an interesting comparison to immunity in Greek mythology (Achilles, anyone?), but she quickly lost me as she bounced from topic to topic without any structure. It seemed like she didn't even know where she was going next but, instead, just wrote about whatever popped into her head. She also focused extensively (or, at least it felt extensively) on the comparison of immortality (which she poorly attempted to connect to vaccinations) to how vampires are portrayed in mainstream media. From Dracula to Bela Lugosi to True Blood and Twilight, the portrayal of vampires mirrors how society feels about vaccines. What?!? Does that mean that society really wishes we could sparkle in the sunlight?! (Okay, that may actually be a valid point). It was just weird. And based on poor logic. The author annoyed me as well. It becomes painfully clear that this is one of those parents who is scared of everything her child comes into contact with. She is the mother who reads crazy blogs, accepts them as gospel, and then knee-jerk reacts to them. She came across as flaky, an over-disinfecter to ensure her child's world is germ-free, and basically someone I would never be friends with but would roll my eyes at in public.I could go on and on about the ways this book annoyed me. It adds nothing to the vaccination debate outside of soundbite quotes and illogical analogies. I highly recommend not reading this book and instead finding something with even a modicum of fact or actual research."
285,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/117566-mauri,5,"""You can respect the fear. The fear of vaccines is understandable. But you can't respect the decision - it's an unnecessary risk."" - Paul Offit, pediatrician/author/vaccine inventor.Biss writes from the perspective of what we call at work, ""the vaccine hesitant parent."" They're not sure they want every vaccine, and they're not sure they want them for their child right here, right now. They've heard things, read things. They're not vaccine-preventable disease epidemiologists (like me), they might not have access to peer-reviewed journal articles, and they may not even be able to grok the vaccine schedule the CDC publishes or the simplified, colorful version put out by their state health department, or even the short list on their child's preschool's website. This is highly understandable because I spend part of every week explaining it to doctors and nurses - the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine catch-up schedule is a nightmare of minimum ages and intervals.At work, it's ground into us over and over that ""vaccine hesitant"" =/= ""anti-vaxxer."" Which makes perfect sense: asking a question about preservatives in vaccines does not mean you don't want to vaccinate your child, it means that you've heard or read some concerning things about thimerosal (probably from anti-vaxxers) and want to know what's up. They want reassurance, an explanation. They do not want a shout-y pediatrician or nurse snapping ""because I said so!"" (Which sounds like a ridiculous response until you've met a lot of health care professionals.)Biss interweaves her own journey through childbirth and motherhood with the anti-vaccine movements of the past and present, meditating on the whys and wherefores of public health. Who needs it? Who thinks they don't need it? A lot of her ponderings dovetail neatly with an article published this week, What the Measles Epidemic Really Says About America; both mention Susan Sontag's ""Illness as Metaphor"" and ""AIDS and Its Metaphors,"" both discuss the NIMBYism of anti-vaxxers, the rise of the individual as preeminent in health care, and distrust of the government.I found this incredibly engaging and readable, especially considering that it's languished on my to-read list long enough that I've forgotten where I heard of it or who recommended it to me. I suspect it was someone local or at work - the book was published by the press my best friend interned for in college, a local company, and Biss received a Minnesota State Arts Board Operating Support Grant."
286,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/962663-karen,5,"Biss writes a book about immunity that dwells in the intersection between objectivity and subjectivity, which makes sense, given she is the child of a physician and a poet. I love this book. I wanted to race through it because it was smart, beautiful and poignant. But I forced myself to slow down for the same reasons. Biss investigates the history of inoculation through three primary methods: she explores key historical detail about events, researchers and advocates (such as the development of small pox inoculation); she explores the metaphors in the language and the symbolism in the actions (war as a metaphor for illness and metaphorical views of germs, viruses, toxicity, disease and filth); and she shares her own journey as a mother trying to protect her own health and the health of her child (her son has severe allergies). Biss writes a book that's immensely complex; however, her prose illuminates as she parses these complexities. Other reviewers compare her to Sontag and Didion, but I see her doing work similar to Sachs, Wilson, and other public intellectuals. She's insightful and articulate. Some of the sections directly take on the anti-vax movement, but she doesn't scold. Biss tries to understand how people on various sides of the issue form their arguments. Many sections of the book investigate how emotion and perception contribute to opinion and policy. For example, I can see quite clearly how people in Africa rely on emotion, perception and bias to resist inoculation efforts by foreigners. This makes me wonder how I might be blind to my own ""reasonable"" conclusions about inoculations and more broadly how nonscientific elements influence US policies about inoculations. Biss also brings in works from the humanities. Readers will encounter passages from _Dracula_, _Alice and Wonderland_ and _Candide_ as well as quotes from Susan Sontag's parallel works about illness in general and AIDS specifically as cultural metaphors. Rachel Carson's _Silent Spring_ makes an argument that people and their environment are intertwined. I enjoyed this book so much, I'm tempted to reread it immediately. It's already proved relevant to today's news. I was reading comments in response to a _Washington Post_ news story about immigration, and many were fearful that immigrants sans inoculations were going to bring disease into the US."
287,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/312880-melissa,5,"Excellent short of book of essays and meditations on the nature of vaccination as both a concept and a practice, the logic behind anti-vaccination, the history of compulsory medicine, the nature of scientific research, language/semantics, skepticism, the undying nature of stuff that gets on the Internet, and the anxiety that comes with being a parent.As an epidemiologist, I requested (and was granted - thanks Graywolf Press!) an advance copy because I wanted to know what Biss - from the position of a parent and writer, not a scientist in any way - had to say about vaccination. Vaccination, in my line of work, is one of our front-line infectious disease prevention tools right behind handwashing and covering your cough/sneeze. It protects not only the individual but also those who cannot be immunized (infants, those with compromised immune systems, etc) from diseases that can take a huge toll in mortality and morbidity. A world where we lose that herd immunity due to ""anti-vaxxers"" which allows diseases like measles (a disease that killed tens of thousands of children in the pre-vaccine era of the 20th century) to run rampant is truly terrifying to me. Biss looks at a lot of her own fears and those of other mothers and then collates/arranges/dissects her research. I don't really want to comment a lot on her conclusions - because that would ruin the work of the book - but suffice to say she posits a lot of good arguments and writes it all very well. Everyone should read this."

I was most interested in Biss's convincing speculations about the metaphors that distort our thinking when it comes to vaccination, disease, and health. Biss the author is a rationalist, but Biss the mother (of one young son) has experienced enough anxious fear that she is completely snark-free when it comes to the anti-vaccine crowd. She suggests an interesting history here: a few centuries ago, Westerners worried most about ""filth""; post-germ theory, they worried about germs; today, with germs under greater control than ever in human history, we worry about ""toxins""--by which we mean (though the usage is inaccurate) poisons we've produced via our own scientific ingenuity. Biss also has some striking things to say about our tendency to draw illogical boundaries between what we deem to be ""self"" and ""nonself."" ""Nonself,"" she shows, is very often a misnomer. This is a book just about everyone should read if they want to be smarter about certain urgent cultural conversations."

It answers a question I've had for some time without really realizing: why is it that so many (almost uniformly) white, upper- class women with college degrees and otherwise progressive politics believe they shouldn't vaccinate their children? In a series of penetrating essays, Biss pulls back the layers of the anti-vaccination movement throughout the last 100 years to expose its roots in class and race issues, the marginalization of women in medicine and our chronic inability to see ourselves as members of a larger community. Unfortunately the second half of the book tosses all of that out the window and becomes a series of personal essays about her birth and her son's infant medical care, where a whole host of the author's personal neuroses are put on display: from her year(!) of hand-wringing over her need to receive a blood transfusion while giving birth to her fervent paranoid belief that her doctors are attempting to ""punish"" her and her child for questioning orthodox medical science. Blehhh. And you were doing so well, too."

This, for me, is one of those books that inspires me to be a better reader and a better thinker. It's a short book but she crams a lot of thinking in there and it's clear she did a ton of research before writing this contemplation. I'm not really sure what to call this book...an essay? I do wonder if this is the sort of book she intended to write when she started her research and note-taking. In any case, with such disparate sources making up her body of research she did an impressive job of distilling her thoughts and reflections and somehow making this thing hang together and be readable. Yet, because there is so much here, I will probably be reading it again with a pencil in hand. One little thought: as a researcher myself, I thoroughly appreciated the tears that can result when one falls down the rabbit hole..."

It does no good to cite science or statistics in persuading for or against vaccination on the current schedule--it feels as though both ideological sides of the argument are armed with their own set of figures and reciting them only leads to all parties becoming further entrenched in their own perspective. Science alone is not enough to persuade. Instead, with gorgeous prose in brief chapters, Biss looks at the concept of vaccination through a variety of lenses: historical, scientific, personal, political, ethical, and philosophical. Through an accretion of evidence, while concluding that vaccination is our best bet, she finds and acknowledges the shared experience in our struggle to come to peace with the prickly question of whether or not to vaccinate our children."

But I found it to be a very smart and measured contemplation of the ways in which we view our bodies, health and illness, our immune systems—the term is recent, a 1970s construct—and particularly the subject of vaccinations. Within that, she brings in a lot of interesting cultural touchpoints: Bram Stoker’s Dracula, Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring, the history of inoculation, and the etymology of the metaphors we use for disease and the body—it’s a little surprising to note how many of the terms come from warfare. Or maybe it’s not. As someone who has a very uneasy relationship to doctors and medicine and illness, I found the book surprisingly reassuring."

On Immunity takes an academic, literary approach to that question and comes up with a variety of illuminating answers, or rather, the various pieces that constitute a nebulous, partial answer. So much about the current debate that seems novel actually has historical precedent, such as the tendency of the wealthy to rely on the less wealthy to bolster their health via herd immunity. But beyond that, On Immunity is a meditation on an individual's body in relationship to the community and what underscores our beliefs about health. It's an enriching and pleasurable read that I recommend heartily. "

299,1555976891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2597121-laura-hoffman-brauman,4,"In On Immunity: An Inoculation, Eula Biss looks at the concepts of immunization/vaccination and immunity from both a scientific, social, and historical perspective. She often writes from the perspective of a mother, anxious about the potential dangers that could impact her young son - from the actual illness to the concerns that people have about vaccinations. Her book is extremely well researched, but also comes across as very relatable as she sorts out what she sees in the media and digs in to the data behind it. The book came out in 2014 and in sections references various flu outbreaks/pandemics - it is impossible not to draw parallels between the scenarios she describes and the COVID outbreak. Some of her discussion on vaccination/precautions taken not only to protect the individual but for the good of society are particularly relevant when considering the current situation. Biss is a very strong writer and makes the science of this accessible. She has a clear point of view, but doesn't come across as preachy - she looks at both sides of an issue and builds her case. I appreciated the literary references in here, but from reading other reviews, I know that some readers felt it distracted from the book. "
