To me the implication is that no matter how much we learn, we will still be wrong. Not because we don’t know everything, but because what we do know is fundamentally uncertain. We are not unsure only about mathematics. Physics for example will always exhibit paradoxes like those of quantum theory. People unaccountably will always do things which are bad for them. And my socks will continue to disappear in the dryer. There is, in other words, a fundamental continuity, a necessary humility, in life that will never be interrupted by the latest technology from Apple or Trump’s most recent tweet. Goldstein appreciates the cultural import of Gödel’s Proof. In an age rocked by the counter-intuitive implications of things like Relativity Theory and Quantum Mechanics, which present paradoxes that seem resolvable by further thought, the Incompleteness Theorem is even more of a scandal. It exists in logic not in observation. It will remain in force no matter what else we learn about the world. As Goldstein says, “Gödel’s theorems, then, appear to be that rarest of rare creatures: mathematical truths that also address themselves—however ambiguously and controversially—to the central question of the humanities: what is involved in our being human?”Incompleteness is a leveller. It applies to the deepest thinker, the wealthiest entrepreneur, the most powerful politician, as well as to any random cog in the modern economic machine and to those who have been rejected by it. It is the modern form of the ancient Christian doctrine of Original Sin, formulated so forcefully by the great saint, Augustine of Hippo.Just as Original Sin, Incompleteness affects us all. We inherit it, not through our genes, but through our memes. Incompleteness comes packaged in language itself. To engage the world through language is to enter the domain of Incompleteness, and therefore of profound doubt. And just as Augustine said in his religious idiom, Godel has restated the situation in his: There is no escape. The user of language is trapped and is incapable of extricating himself from an existence of rational error - about himself as well as the world around him.But unlike Augustine, Gödel doesn’t presume he has a solution. Augustine withholds his assent to radical doubt, which he neutralises through ‘faith.’ Clearly Augustine cannot stomach the intellectual humiliation of not having a way forward, of not mitigating the debilitating effects of the human condition. Like many before him and since, Augustine fills the intellectual vacuum with the magic of a divine saviour, the guarantor of the ultimate rationality of human and other life on Earth. For Augustine Christ is the deus ex machina who is capable of correcting, literally remaking, flawed human nature into something reliable. And if other people don’t ‘get it,’ he feels entirely justified in literally throwing them to the lions. Augustine, of course, merely demonstrates the extent to which the basic human flaw can make us crazy. That his need for and presumption of a beneficent saviour is part of his Original Sin is something which doesn’t occur to him. His solution is actually the greatest delusion produced by his fundamental insight. He neurotically invents in order to avoid his own logic, and then projects his neurosis onto the world as a defect which must be eliminated. He is the first Christian terrorist.Gödel has no such delusion and therefore accepts the bleakness of our prospects. What Godel allows us to see, however, is that mathematics is a genre of poetry with its own arbitrary, but still rather satisfying, conventions. It is something to be done for its own sake, not because it leads anywhere else (the Princeton Institute for Advanced Studies of which Godel, along with Albert Einstein, was a founding member was created on the principle of “the usefulness of useless knowledge”). Prospects, bleak or not, - whether spiritual or material - have nothing to do with the matter, therefore. Mathematics, like the rest of poetry, is important in the continuous present. It doesn’t save us but it passes the time rather pleasantly. Gödel was no materialist or relativist, however. For my money he was more spiritual than Augustine, as well as more committed to the idea of truth. He knew there was something permanently beyond human reach. As a committed Platonist, he considered this to be the abstract realm of numbers, which exist quite independently of human thought about them. Numbers for Gödel are eternal and impassive, that is, there is nothing we can do to affect their existence. They call to us from elsewhere, much like Augustine’s God. The principle difference however is that numbers make no absolute demands and pass no judgments. They exist for our comfort and edification not for remaking us as something we’re not. And very few have felt compelled to use violence to defend number theory.Goldstein makes an apposite observation: “Paranoia isn’t the abandonment of rationality. Rather, it is rationality run amuck, the inventive search for explanations turned relentless.” Augustine is an example of rationality run amok. This certainly is the heart of Gödel’s riposte to Augustine’s and all other religious arrogance."
1,0393327604,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16077597-matt,4,"I’ve always been fascinated by Kurt Gödel and his incompleteness theorems. While Douglas Hofstadter did a fine job in explaining the latter in his book 
Gödel, Escher, Bach
, and also in a video lecture, there’s hardly any biographical/personal information about the human behind the mathematician here to be found. That’s where Rebecca Goldstein jumps in. Her book focuses on the life of the “greatest logician since Aristotle”. About his time at the Vienna Circle (a.k.a. the Schlick-Group) in the late 1920s, the emigration to Princeton (the Institute for Advanced Study), where Gödel became friends with Albert Einstein, and finally his personal incompleteness and his tragic death, apparently brought on by self starvation in 1978.There is, of course, a chapter devoted to Gödel’s proof of the incompleteness of formal systems, which is not entirely without mathematics and formulas. The proof itself is rather simplified and no great mathematical knowledge is required. Logical understanding is very helpful, however!As opposed to most of the participants in the Viennese circle, Gödel was not a positivist, but rather held it with Plato: He had an axiom by which he looked at the world: nothing that happens in it is due to accident or stupidity. Gödel believed in an abstract reality, and “that the truths of mathematics are independent of any human activities, such as the construction of formal systems — with their axioms, definitions, rules of inference, and proofs.” The positivists, on the other hand, believed in the creation of the (meta-) mathematical reality by man alone. Everything outside this reality, all meta-mathematics, was meaningless and of no importance to them. Since Gödel also acted in this circle of positivists, there was reason for many to believe that his proof of incompleteness was a success story of positivism, but, according to Goldstein, ""could not be further from the truth.""For me the most exciting topic was the confrontation of Gödel and Ludwig Wittgenstein, who was venerated by the Viennese circle in an almost mystical way.Wittgenstein’s 
 Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus
 was apparently read and read again in the circle for months, as if it were a holy book. Gödel never acknowledged Wittgenstein’s work, and Wittgenstein was “adamant in denying the possibility of a proof such as Gödel’s.” The characters of the two could not be more different. Ironically, however, one can conceive the final statement of the Tractatus as a kind of incompleteness theorem: “Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.” Unfortunately, Gödel was anything but ironically inclined, and perhaps he did not see this, so that one can almost speak of a meta-irony here.Gödel’s other important relationship was the warm and close friendship with Albert Einstein. The two of them were very dissimilar (Einstein was 27 years older than Gödel), but they understood each other well and appreciated each other extremely. Einstein confessed that “he only went to his office to have the privilege of walking home each day with the logician, the two great minds of the twentieth century able to share, at least for a while, their intellectual exile with one another.” After Einstein’s death in 1955 Gödel became very lonely indeed. The final chapter shows the incessant descent of this brilliant thinker quite impressively, as I find.Apart from the formal parts of the third chapter, this is a very easy to grasp and recommendable reading for all those who want to make themselves more familiar epistemology, history of science, meta-mathematics and logic.

2,0393327604,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1843184-szplug,4,"The more I think about language, the more it amazes me that people ever understand each other at all.Fucking Gödel.The above (pictured with a rueful smile and head shake) succinctly summarizes my feelings for the incomparable Kurt Gödel—the greatest logician since Aristotle, as Rebecca Goldstein makes sure to iterate several times—the quiet and unassuming genius whose steel-trap mind could capture those ethereal abstract truths and convert them into human language constructs; who single-handedly elevated mathematical logic to a respectable berth at the table; who produced several earth-shaking proofs that performed the almost unheard-of double duty of having mathematical and metamathematical implications; the dear friend of Einstein who presented the latter, on his 70th birthday, with mind-bending solutions to his field equations; the paranoid recluse who, seeing conspiracies everywhere, eventually died from starvation when his wife, being in the hospital, was no longer available to prepare his food and thus left him wide open to his pervasive fear of being poisoned by ill-wishers and positivist conspirators.Goldstein quite clearly harbors a fondness and admiration for the eccentric logician, whom she once saw in person at a Princeton house party, and she does an excellent job of situating him within his time period, his academic milieu, his long tenure at the Princeton-adjunct Institute for Advanced Studies and, especially, in describing both his two Incompleteness Theorems—having first outlined his graduate student dissertation on Completeness—and explaining the immense impact they had upon the mathematical, scientific, and philosophic world once they had interpenetrated these disciplines of the mind.I've read other reviews that complain about the amount of time she devotes to Wittgenstein, who is said to be peripheral to the wonders that Gödel created, but I think she made a smart choice. Not only does the fiery and charismatic Wittgenstein add some missing color to the proceedings, but Goldstein makes an IMO apt analogy between the thought of the philosopher during his Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus period and Gödel's Theorems. That the latter proclaims first that in a formal mathematical system of assumed consistency there will exist a statement that is both true and unprovable; and second that said formal system's consistency cannot be proved from within itself, is, as Goldstein argues, from the same mental territory that Wittgenstein drew from in his early thought. The TLP end statement Whereof one cannot speak, one must pass over in silence hints that the silence contains all of the important things; abstractions that inhabit the same Platonic ideality that Gödel believed existed. Two brilliant Viennese, one a Platonist amidst a sea of Positivists, the other—well, a sui generis explorer on the roiling seas of language.If, in the end, the reader finds he hasn't actually discovered much that Gödel actually said, it is perhaps because Goldstein found it difficult to shoehorn what was available—and relevant—into a brief biography, and one more concerned with his ideas than the actual man himself; and, with this end in mind, I enjoyed her presentation from start to finish. I do plan to read Nagel's 
Gödel's Proof
, because the idea has always been stimulating for me, even when I only understood it in a very general sense. At a time when Hilbert and Russell, at the apex of the Positivist surge, were attempting to chain mathematics within the bounds of a formal human rationalism, Gödel proved how futile it was for man to think he could tame infinity. This illusion has recurrently manifested itself as a product to be manufactured in the mental workshops, the principal theme of Leszek Kołakowski in his slim masterpiece 
Metaphysical Horror
—though to the genial Pole, the shops themselves must perforce endeavor to continue operating. To finite man the infinite is an awesome, disturbing, and chaotic beast, forever mocking human aspirations and advances with its eternities and paradoxes and circularities. We have always been able to intuit it, yet without restraining it and fixing it into place, and the quiet genius showed that this cannot be effected. What implications does this bring to the existence of God, of a Platonic world of abstract ideals, of all that the mind can conjure but never empirically locate? It's a source of endless fascination for me—and, apparently, for Gödel as well; so at least I've got that in common with the great man."
3,0393327604,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4384303-brad-lyerla,5,"INCOMPLETENESS is an excellent book about an intellectually elusive subject. Kurt Godel's fame was established by his proof of something called ""the Incompleteness Theorem."" His proof employed formal logic to establish a basic truth about mathematics. Namely, that in closed systems, there will be true statements that cannot be proved. Until Godel's proof, many leading mathematicians assumed the opposite was true. This is a challenging subject to write about, but Goldstein makes it easily accessible to a casual reader of science and philosophy like me.Godel's personal story is interesting. He was not a Jew, but had many colleagues who were. Yet, he failed to take a stance against the Nazis, instead choosing to continue his work even as Hitler's policies forced the Universities of Germany and Austria to purge Jewish faculty members. It is unclear how much he knew about the worst atrocities perpetrated by the Nazis. Later, Godel immigrated to the US and became a close friend and frequent companion of Albert Einstein in Princeton, NJ. Godel struggled with mental illness and, ultimately, it contributed to his death.I may bestir myself to write a full review of INCOMPLETENESS eventually. In the meantime, I recommend the book highly and I am deeply impressed with Goldstein. I look forward to reading more of her stuff."
4,0393327604,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61033954-m-r,5,"""…the precocious Gödel grasped the limits of parental omniscience at about the age of five. It would be comforting, in the presence of such a shattering conclusion, especially when it’s reinforced by serious illness a few years later, to derive the following additional conclusion…the grownups around me may be a sorry lot, but luckily I don’t need to depend on them. I can figure out everything for myself. The world is thoroughly logical and so is my mind—a perfect fit.Quite possibly the young Gödel had some such thoughts to quell the terror of discovering at too young an age that he was far more intelligent than his parents. It would explain much about the man he would become.""Popular books on mathematics play an important role in the lay public’s education. But as is known to anyone who has given a popular mathematics lecture or written about a famous theorem for an audience of nonmathematicians, doing justice to the mathematics in question is almost impossible in those circumstances. Rebecca Goldstein, the MacArthur Foundation fellow and author of The Mind-Body Problem (a novel which seems to be quite popular among mathematicians) attempts an even more difficult task in her short new book Incompleteness: The Proof and Paradox of Kurt Gödel, namely, to place a significant piece of mathematics—Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorems—inthe context of the wider intellectual currents of the twentieth century, both within the mathematical logic and the philosophy of mathematics communities, as well as within the intellectual culture at large.The theorems are presented in the context of a somewhat detailed personal and intellectual biography of Gödel as well as in that of the various schools in foundations of mathematics in existence at the time. A vast amount of material is covered: everything from the history of the Vienna Circle, to Gödel’s philosophical differences with Wittgenstein, to the Hilbert Program, to Gödel’s views on appointments at the Institute for Advanced Study, to many aspects of his personal biography."
5,0393327604,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9437763-k-york,5,"What a wonderful book. Goldstein not only lays out Godel's famous theorems in relatively understandable terms for the layman (an accomplishment in itself,) but provides an original, funny, and lucid account of the intellectual atmosphere in which these theorems arose. She discussed Godel's relation to the Logical Positivists and Formalists, which sheds great light upon the meaning of his discoveries. She also dispels the postmodernists mythologies about what Godel's theorems mean. In addition, she outlines Godel's relationship with Einstein, both intellectual and personal, which turns out to be rather significant.Objective topics covered in this book range from the nature of mathematical reality, to the nature of time, to the nature of the mind. In addition to all this, she gives an account of Godel's personal life and a picture of who he was as a person. The picture that she paints is tragic, warm, and very eccentric. By the end of the book, I found myself as touched by these accounts of Godel's life as by any novel.Goldstein was the perfect person to write this book-- because of her lucidity in regards to mathematical logic, science, and analytic philosophy, and because of her experience as a novelist and capacity for wit, humor, and sympathy for the human experience. If you are like me and unfamiliar with but interested in Godel, you will never look at the world exactly the same way after reading this book. I highly recommend it. (On a side note, I found it interesting that this book was listed under Science/Mathematics and not Philosophy. Telling of the current cultural atmosphere, no?)"

7,0393327604,http://goodreads.com/user/show/501971-jeff,3,"I'm going to reread the sections specifically about Gödel's incompleteness theorems because i'd really like to be able to speak about them without misrepresenting them one of these days. You could call it a New Year resolution if you wanted to.I don't know how to rate this book because i'm so incapable of rating Goldstein's ability to convey the mathematical ideas. I can say that i thought i read many sentences more than once ... but in completely different sections of the book, as if the editor & author hadn't noticed something was copied from one section to another rather than moved. Another quibble of mine: intending a positive connotation for prolix as a modifier of these theorems, specifically meant to imply that despite the few words needed to write them, they affect an astounding variety of intellectual disciplines.On the positive side, i actually enjoyed much of the ""history"" and ""biography"" bits as they fleshed out the time and places covered by Logicomix.I'm following Goldstein's implied advice and reading Nagel and Newman's Gödel's Proof as soon as it's delivered to my doorstep."
8,0393327604,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28825839-stephie-williams,3,"I may have read this book previously, but I could not remember doing so. This review replaces the very short review I had previously made.In this book Rebecca Goldstein sets out to explain Kurt Godel’s life, including his incompleteness theorems. She first sets the stage in an environmental context, both personal and mathematical. Then comes her explanation of Godel’s theorems. And finally, the later stages of his life.The book starts our interestingly enough with the relationship between Einstein and Godel, or what can be gleamed by the little information that relates to this relationship. It moves on to Godel’s early life, his life at university and within the Vienna Circle (a philosophical club of the logical positive school of thought). After this the problems with the foundations of mathematics and its formalism is presented, starting with Frege, moving on to Russell and Whitehead, and finishing up with Hilbert and his formalist program. Then comes Godel’s incompleteness theorems. Finally, it covers the responses to his theorems, both his and others’, and the latter stages of his life.The following are some of the comments I made while reading the book. Page numbers are in brackets [] from the W. W. Norton & Company paperback edition from 2005.[24] “Though one might not guess it from this terse statement [from an The Encylopedia of Philosophys article] of them, the [Godel theorems] . . . are extraordinary for (among other reasons) how much they have to say . . . they range far beyond their narrow formal domain [mathematical logic], addressing such vast and messy issues as the nature of truth and knowledge and certainty . . . Godel’s theorems have also seemed to have important things to say about what our minds could—and could not—be.” (italics hers) I do not think that Godel’s theorems have that much to say outside of their domain; although, others certainly seem to think so. And, they say preciously little on the human mind, if anything. Even its effects on mathematics proper is limited. Most mathematicians happily go about their business without a thought about the two theorems.[26] Goldstein makes a similar claim here: “Godel’s theorems, then, appear to be that rarest of rare creatures: mathematical truths that also address themselves—however ambiguously and controversially—to the central questions of the humanities: what is involved in our being human . . . Though there is disagreement about precisely how much, and precisely what, they say, there is no doubt that they say an awful lot and that what they say extends beyond mathematics, certainly into metamathematics and perhaps beyond.” At least she hedges her claim here, but what they say about being human is beyond me, except that they were produced by a human mind. [32] Footnote 6 mentions “Godel’s hostility to the theory of evolution” with its “chance and randomness.” I think it is somewhat of misnomer that changes in the bases of DNA are random. The changes themselves are not random in a physical sense. This is because these changes have exact causes, such as chemical, ultraviolet radiation, or cosmic rays. The randomness comes in from appearances only, or if like, possibly which base gets mutated.[39] At the end of a quote from William Barrett’s book Irrational Man it reads “. . . since mathematics has no self-subsistent reality independent of human activity that mathematician carry on.” This goes against everything Godel believed in about mathematics. This is that mathematics has an existence outside the human mind in some sort of Platonic realm.[139] She characterizes Cantor’s continuum hypothesis thusly: “Cantor hypothesized that there is no infinite set that intervenes between the set of natural numbers and the set of real numbers; that is, there no set that has a higher ordinality than the natural numbers and a lower ordinality than the real numbers.” This is wrong. It is cardinality, not ordinality that Cantor was talking about. It makes me wonder if she can commit one (big) blunder, could she be committing further blunders when it comes to her description of the incompleteness theorems, like her previously statement that Godel did not use numbers in his proofs [23]. I am not certain here, but is not Godel numbering using numbers? She could have been saying that it can be stated without using numbers rather than the actual proof used no numbers. When I came across the mistake on page 139 I immediately check her acknowledgments. I could not find it was reviewed and commented on by anyone known to be competent in mathematics, while she did consult others for their comments. If she had consulted some one of this caliber she might have avoided this mistake as well as others that may lurk within the book.[200] It is claimed by John Lucas [and others] that Godel’s theorem shows that minds are not machines because no machine could devise Godel’s proof. Since Godel himself proved his theorem within a formal system would that not indicate that a computer could be programmed to produce his proof. This may not apply to Turing’s uncomputability theorem. While no computer could decide if a particular algorithm would stop, no human could decide this either.[217] Godel claims mathematical realism on the basis, not only from his own theorem, but from the undecidability of Cantor’s continuum hypothesis under the current axioms of set theory and the as yet unproved Goldbach conjecture. But, I ask: If mathematical truth lies in some Platonic realm, what about mathematical falsities? Would not they have to reside there too? If they did would that not be contradiction.*[232] In footnote 8 talking about Godel’s argument that a dictatorship could arise from the United States Constitution, she states: “Unfortunately, Morgenstern’s account, and so all others that derive from it, omits mention of the precise constitutional flaw.” I guess I will have to give up the hope that I will ever discovered what Godel thought he saw there.As far as Goldstein’s mathematical explanation of Godel’s theorems are concerned, I think she did a fairly good job, but the mistake when explaining Cantor’s continuum hypothesis makes me wonder. I thought a far better description was done by Douglas Hofstadter in his Godel, Escher, Bach. This being said, her biographical information was informative for me and intriguing. Godel was certainly an interesting character, as well as a very smart man; his proof is quite ingenious. So my overall rating would be mixed. On the proof itself I would call it fair. Depicting the man, Godel, it was real good, and the importance of the theorem outside of mathematics and philosophy of mathematics I could not agree with her coverage, but to be fair she did not take sides as to whose interpretations, if any, might be correct.If you are interested in Godel’s life or are unfamiliar with his theorems this book should be of interest to you. In addition when it comes to how people both in mathematics and without view the theorems you would probably also be interested as well. I would just caution to be a little wary of some of her information.* I just posted a blog on Mathematics called ""Can Mathematics Be Constructed?"" which partially includes a more fuller discussion of mathematical realism @ https://aquestionersjourney.wordpress..."
9,0393327604,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1394552-keith-akers,4,"This is a great book to learn more about ""Goedel's Proof"" (actually two proofs, or actually three proofs if you count his Ph. D. thesis on predicate calculus). The incompleteness of mathematics is an astounding concept -- it's so astounding, that you are left breathless, not even sure what the whole thing means. Does this mean that God exists? Actually, Goedel himself toyed with variations of the ontological proof. The incompleteness of mathematics is just really hard to wrap your brain around; it's not just understanding the proof that is hard, but just figuring out What It All Means. Goedel didn't know (or didn't tell us), and we're still trying to figure it out today. There is so much more to reality than science and logic can explain, and we don't need metaphysics to see this -- all we need, actually, is mathematics. Go Plato! This is what the author conveys so well.I read this book and ""A World Without Time"" by Palle Yourgrau at the same time. They are both quite good books and, as written by academic philosophers, generally mitigate my general negative opinion of academic philosophy. If you are interested in Goedel's ideas about ""time travel"" then read the book by Palle Yourgrau. If you are more interested in the proof itself, read this book, which goes into more detail. But really you should read both, because unlike some philosophers from Austria that I could name (ahem! cough, cough!), they actually take the time to try to explain things to you.What I liked most about this book was the anecdotes about Goedel and those around him. She gives a fairly complete account of a really interesting anecdote, which I will have to blog about at some point, concerning Goedel's becoming an American citizen. Goedel indignantly protested that the constitution had a contradiction in it that would allow a dictator to take over! Also, the accounts of the personal relationships between the people in the Vienna Circle really helped me to understand the very different ideas which they and Goedel were respectively trying to articulate. The main negative of the book, which is also paradoxically a strong positive, is its treatment of Wittgenstein. This book is fair towards both Wittgenstein and Goedel, but makes a lot more sense out of Wittgenstein than I think he deserves. I will spare you the comparisons with livestock agriculture and the waste products thereof. What bothers me about Wittgenstein is his condescension and failure to explain things -- being deliberately enigmatic. Yeah, sure, he might be a genius, but why should I read someone who clearly doesn't want to talk to me, or apparently anyone else? This seems like the philosophical equivalent of the medieval practice of self-flagellation. On the other hand, the author actually makes more sense out of Wittgenstein than anyone else I've heard, and the anecdotes about Wittgenstein are helpful in describing the intellectual scene around the Vienna Circle. So paradoxically, I now feel more sympathy with Wittgenstein than I did before. But not agreement with W. -- I'm with Goedel on this one. Wittgenstein rejected Goedel's proof, and this book makes it fairly clear that Wittgenstein never really understood it and somehow wanted to dodge the conclusions with condescending statements about having, somehow, transcended it all. But what is more amazing than that Wittgenstein rejected Goedel, was that Goedel, a master logician, who should be the hero of all the ""analytic"" philosophers in the U. S. A. -- since he proved something really significant about logic and mathematics that rivals or exceeds Aristotle -- is hardly even regarded as a philosopher at all, a fact which reveals the shallowness of modern academic philosophy.I found the explanation of ""Goedel's proof"" of the incompleteness of mathematics (actually two proofs, as it turns out) to be quite accessible. However, I should warn you, I went to graduate school in philosophy, and took one logic class in which Goedel's proof was discussed. Unfortunately, it was not the proof that I wanted to learn about, the incompleteness of mathematics, but the completeness and consistency of what the author calls ""limpid logic,"" a nice turn of phrase. I think that this is going to be over a lot of people's heads. But even if it is, it will at least convey what Goedel's proof means, which is actually in some ways harder than following the formal proof itself, although that's hard enough."
10,0393327604,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13941368-bakunin,4,"Rebeccca Goldstein is an American philosopher and writer. This book managed to dive into who Gödel was and what his views on mathematics really meant. I was intrigued by this myth of a man; a man who seemed only to get more quiet as he grew older. He never seemed to argue against the popular trends of the day yet was quite certain of his own opinion. In fact the last great philosopher he admired was Leibniz. I was interested in how Gödel was formed as a person and given his infamous secrecy this was quite hard for mrs. Goldstein to show. She did a good job despite this difficulties and hints at an early life crisis at the age of 5 when Gödel realized he was smarter than his parents. What does one do in such a situation? How does a child handle that type of uncertainty? One of Goldsteins theories is that Gödels whole life was a reaction to this insight and an attempt to find stable mathematical ground given the uncertainty of the world. Much has been written about Kurt Gödel and his incompleteness theorem. It is a mathematical theorem which has managed to enthrall even those persons (myself included) who are not mathematicians and has therefore begun to live a life of its own. Wikipedia defines the axiom (or rather axioms as there are two) in the following way: The first incompleteness theorem states that no consistent system of axioms whose theorems can be listed by an effective procedure (i.e., an algorithm) is capable of proving all truths about the arithmetic of the natural numbers. For any such consistent formal system, there will always be statements about the natural numbers that are true, but that are unprovable within the system. The second incompleteness theorem, an extension of the first, shows that the system cannot demonstrate its own consistency.I am to this day not quite sure what this means but I interpret it as saying there is something magical to human intuition which cannot be boiled down to the pure rules of a system. You cannot prove a system is true within the system and like the Austrian economists say, you cannot find an objective value to things which can only be evaluated subjectively by an individual. It was also interesting to learn that Gödel was a mathematical platonist, i.e. one who believes in that mathematics exists in reality and are not a system created by humans. Why else would you be able to use math in physics (which explore how the real universe works)? A delightful read and I recommend it to anyone interested in the history!"
11,0393327604,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29791454-domhnall,5,"This book is succinct, accessible and well constructed. Godel's Incompleteness Theorems are so significant in the history of ideas that it is essential to have a decent grasp of just what they are and why they mattered and this book supplies that need for general readers. It gives a good enough explanation of Godel's findings and deals with the reactions of other major names to his theories, which sheds interesting light on their work too. We need to grasp Godel's theories accurately because we need to be aware of the way others not only use but also misrepresent them. For example, William Barrett, in a famous book which I greatly enjoyed: Irrational Man: A Study in Existentialist Philosophy, 1962, concluded from his account of Godel that ""mathematics has no self-subsistent reality independent of the human activity that mathematicians carry on."" Godel believed pretty much the direct opposite of this fashionable assertion. This is a very widespread problem. Goldstein gives another example in the way many serious minded people assume from Einstein's Theory of Relativity that there is no absolute reality, since everything depends on the subjective point of view of an observor. On the contrary, Einstein was quite satisfied that the purpose of science is to obtain an accurate account of a reality that is authentic and independent of any observor. How is the general reader to avoid being sucked into false and sometimes dishonest positions based on misrepresentation? Paradox plays a major role in the story of this book. For a general reader like myself, one paradox might arise if we are asked to rely on Goldstein as an authority and to reject the opinions of other authorities, not least Wittgenstein. The solution cannot possibly be to elevate her in that way - instead, she invites us to join the debate about Godel and stop observing passively from the sidelines. Godel will start to be important to us when we start using his ideas in our own thinking and when we can do that in a credible way: based on understanding and not preconceptions. "

Put another way, this is a book less about Gödel and more about Gödel and Wittgenstein, or perhaps more accurately, about Wittgenstein and Gödel.This is a book that prefers to tell rather than show: Goldstein spends 160 pages telling the reader how amazing and important and revolutionary Gödel's proofs were before she ever unpacks the proofs themselves. Once she does set to explaining them, she makes the same mistake many authors attempting to popularize math and science make by simplifying too much and skipping steps in the name of not overwhelming the reader. What's left is paradoxically difficult to follow, as it is riven with caveats like ""we won't be rigorous"" and ""this isn't really what Gödel did"".I would not recommend this book to anyone seeking to learn more about Gödel's work on incompleteness. However, if you're looking for a book about Wittgenstein, Gödel, and philosophical circles in 1920s and 30s Vienna, this may be the book for you."
13,0393327604,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18736-davin,3,"Well written and a good picture of Godel, his work, philosophy and the times he lived in. There would be more starts up there but for 2 reasons:1 The book goes through thumbnail sketches of Godel's famous proofs and then a more involved version, but even after the more detailed explanation I still felt like I had only scratched the surface of it. Some of the things asserted about the process of Godel numbering seemed almost magical as a result. This is a tough balancing act for any popular take on technical subjects. (See David Foster Wallace's book on Cantor and Infinity for the same ""Great Discoveries"" Series if you want read more about the difficulties of writing a book like this.) Still, I wanted a little more. Since these proofs are crux of the book, this was disappointing.2. The book spends surprising amount of time on Wittgenstein but he seems tangential at best to the story. It's interesting to read about him, but it felt tacked on."
14,0393327604,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,3,"David Foster Wallace (RIP) once referred to Kurt Goedel, the subject of this book, as mathematics' Prince of Darkness. Douglas Hofstadter gave his Incompleteness Theorems (1 and 2) a central role in his book “Goedel, Escher, Bach”. Goedel's ideas are so central to 20th century thinking that it is likely that Einstein (for many years until his death Goedel's closest friend) was the only person he ever met who he was not, eventually, to become more famous and influential than (for example Wittgenstein, a much more famous thinker than Goedel in his time and a major player in this book's story, is not nearly so influential now).For all that, we know relatively little about Goedel's life. Rebecca Goldstein attempts here to fill in the gaps as best we can. Her basic thesis, which she does a fair job of demonstrating, is that Goedel's famous theorems, in his opinion, mean roughly the opposite of what most people took them to mean.To summarize greatly, Goedel's Theorems state that every sufficiently powerful system of arithmetic thought contains well-formed statements that are true, but unprovable. In addition, no sufficiently powerful system of arithmetic thought can prove its own consistency. To put it another way, systems of arithmetic thought can be either:1) so crippled that they cannot be used for much because they can't say much2) able to say a lot, but some of it is unable to be proved (or disproved), and anyway cannot prove that they are consistentI am, of course, grotesquely abbreviating, and therefore leaving out much which is necessary. But then, the summary of Goedel's theorems may perhaps have been more influential than the full content.Goedel was a young man in Vienna between the world wars, a time of enormous intellectual ferment. The dominant thinking of the time was Logical Positivism, and more generally the rejection of Platonic ideals.Goldstein asserts that Goedel was himself a devoted (even devout) Platonist, who saw his own work as demonstrating that there is a realm of absolute truth, which exists independent of any (necessarily flawed) system of thought we use to get at it. This ran counter to much of 20th century thought, which saw all truths as relative.One wonders if this wasn't all simply a rejection of ""absolute"", because the term ""absolutism"" had become associated with a political system in which all power is held by the central executive. Einstein's theory of Relativity actually takes as its starting point the tenet that the speed of light in a vacuum is absolute. What would its reception have been if it had been called the Theory of Absolutism? More to the point, there was never any chance of it being interpreted that way. It was similar with Goedel's Theorems. Goedel saw them as proving that Platonic ideals are more fundamental and important than human-created systems of thought. Almost all of the brightest minds of Goedel's time took his work to mean much the opposite, that all systems are incomplete and therefore absolute truth cannot exist.The first half of the book is a fascinating look at a very private man, whose behavior almost caricatures the stereotypical absent-minded professor. Einstein may have been the only person who was able to relate to Goedel at all levels (both were German speakers who were driven from Europe by fascism, became famous for theoretical work cited far beyond its intended field, and ended their years at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton). After Einstein's death, Goedel became increasingly isolated, and eventually paranoid, ending his life in a state of near-starvation brought on by a paranoid fear of poisoning.In the end, what does Goldstein's book tell us about Goedel that we didn't know before? I think it tells us that the way in which even the most brilliant discoveries and original thinking are interpreted is controlled as much by the zeitgeist into which it emerges, as by the intentions of the creator or even the nature of the discovery itself. It reminds us that being a genius is no protection against being fatally neurotic. And it points out to us that thinking as creative, original, and far-reaching as Goedel's may take a century or more for the rest of the world to fully come to terms with. This book brings us one step closer to doing that."
15,0393327604,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74572-brett,3,"This book is serviceable in being a readable introduction to Gödel's famous proofs and a general (very general) understanding of the intellectual and historical circumstances within which it grew. While I do not have the capabilities to judge whether she provides a completely faithful representation of Gödel and his proofs, it is within my power to deem her handling of Wittgenstein, whom she spends a great deal of pages discussing, to be sorely unsympathetic, uncharitable, and misrepresentative. Wittgenstein is set up as an intellectual foil against which Gödel prevails, and the story that she recounts is, though not unique within the world of mathematics (or philosophy, for that matter), is highly selective (without acknowledging the fact) and, unfortunately, mischaracterizes that which is not within it's primary purview. One may glean an accurate (though vague) understanding of Gödel from this book, but not, I'm afraid, of the greater intellectual tradition whence it sprang. And not of Wittgenstein."
16,0393327604,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17420254-megan-lawson,2,I very much enjoyed the second half of this book - in which there was a discussion (though I wish more mathematically and logically minded) of Godel's Incompleteness Theorems as well as stories of his life and interactions at Princeton.However I did not enjoy the first half of the book much at all. It felt like it was a 150 page set up to what the philosophical world was like that Godel was walking into. I didn't need that and didn't feel like it did much to move along my understanding of Godel and his work. Godel was sorely neglected in the first part of the book about his discoveries.

24,0393327604,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2881115-ed,4,"Goldstein, a novelist as well as a philosopher, writes engagingly. The story she tells about Kurt Gödel has all the drama of a tragic novel. As well as the book is written, I still had trouble getting my mind around the Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems. Goldstein's central argument is that the cultural appropriation of Gödel's work, as well as of Einstein's, has misrepresented them as icons of post-modernism. As someone who has tasted at least a few sips of the post-modernist kool-aid I found this argument bracing and largely convincing. Overall the book is a joy to read."
25,0393327604,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34138597-nick,3,"Godel's incompleteness theorem proves that, in any consistent formal mathematical system sufficiently complex to be useful (for instance, the one we use, with our pluses and minuses and our ten digits), there must exist certain arithmetical statements which are true, but impossible to prove. The gist is that it's impossible to remove all intuitive statements--for instance, that a=a--from mathematics, without rendering our system inconsistent, i.e. broken. This was, and still is, a huge deal for mathematicians. It even decimated an entire school of mathematical thought known as formalism, which existed primarily to advocate the removal of intuition, to make math airtight once and for all; incompleteness proved this will never be done. As for how he proved that, it's all rather complicated and I still have much more reading to do on this subject in order to understand it. Rebecca Goldstein does her best to explain but she isn't a mathematician (which she is forthright about), and I am certain better explications are available elsewhere. Fortunately only about a quarter of the book deals with the proof itself.The majority of non-mathematicians, and no small number of mathematicians, interpret the theorem despairingly. They equate it with the discovery of a great fissure in the foundations of math, ominous evidence that the dynasty of proofs from Euclid onward is based on a subjective, relative (echoing Einstein's theory), human perspective. At any rate this is how the philosophical school of positivism interpreted the result, in fitting with their agenda, and Goldstein spends the first half of her book arguing against this apparently glib, surface-level interpretation. Godel himself rejected the notion of math as subjective. In fact, he considered his incompleteness theorem as proof positive (no pun intended) of his own Platonist philosophy, nearly the opposite of positivism (Platonists believe in objective reality, and a Platonist mathematician views a new proof not as a creation but as a discovery). Ironically, for several years Godel was a member of the Vienna Circle, the philosophical rat pack most responsible for positivism's influence on 20th century thought (evident all over the landscape of postmodern fiction). He kept his Platonist views to himself during Circle meetings, and by nature he rarely spoke.The final quarter of the book is a semi-personal essay detailing Goldstein's first experiences with Godel's work, and the time she met him at a cocktail party (also among the attendees of which was Joseph Stalin's daughter, btw). She also discusses Godel's mental instability in the latter part of his life, especially after the death of his close friend Einstein. Godel suffered from paranoia, and believed (for instance) that the admission of a Canadian sociologist to the Institute of Advanced Studies, Godel's long-term residence, was a direct result of the sociologist's (non-existent) spy work for the Canadian government. He also believed that his refrigerator emitted poisonous gases. After reading this section the reader is flabbergasted that Godel could have held onto a wife for 30+ years. The anecdotes Goldstein provides are amusing and endear you to Godel as a man, but as biography ""Incompleteness"" isn't comprehensive or even a general overview of Godel's life. It would have been nice to hear more about the man himself. An interesting read nonetheless, especially for those wondering how philosophy influenced ""the greatest logician since Aristotle"", and vice versa. "
26,0393327604,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37511419-eric,4,What a fascinating and under appreciated man.
27,0393327604,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10293618-simon,4,"Coming from a background with limited mathematical and philosophical knowledge, I thought the author did an admirable job of creating an easy to understand narrative behind the intellectual climate in which Gödel came up with his theorems. I struggled to understand the more technical elements of the proof and will definitely have to go back to it some day to fully appreciate the beauty of it. What makes the book really enjoyable are the themes that the author skillfully builds on throughout the book. Platonism vs Positivism, sense of intellectual exile that Gödel shared with Einstein, the irony of Wittgenstein and Gödel holding similar convictions, and the paradox of the greatest logician since Aristotle starving himself to death due to his paranoia of being poisoned. These themes not only allow the reader to appreciate the historical significance of the Incompleteness theorem to mathematics and philosophy, but shed light on a fascinating character that was Kurt Gödel."
28,0393327604,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2674867-lynn,4,"This added to my understanding of philosophy more than mathematics, but the book was primarily a biography of Gödel, so the fact that a reader can actually take away some philosophical insights from a biography makes this book unique.The description of Gödel’s proof was short and well written, but it was only about 25 pages. I can say I have less of a misunderstanding of the proof, but I can’t say I understood Goldstein’s explanation. If you’re looking for a good explanation, this probably isn’t the book. But if you like a good biography and a better understanding of Gödel and his place in the history of thought, especially mathematics, this is a great book. It also does a great job in explaining the philosophical implications of Gödel’s proof.My favorite philosophical passage was on page 200 where the mind as machine is discussed. John Lucas states, “Gödel’s theorem seems to me to prove that Mechanism is false, that is, that minds cannot be explained as machines.” Lucas and Roger Penrose are convinced this is what Gödel proved, but Gödel wasn’t so sure. To me, this is the most interesting and far reaching aspect of Gödel’s theorem; probably because I don’t understand the implications of the revolutionary mathematics, but I understand the philosophical issues of objective truth and even the mechanistic assumptions of AI.This book changed my opinion about Mechanism to such an extent that I have a desire to reread Daniel Dennett’s book on consciousness, and I also think Roger Penrose’s ideas, specifically those in Emperor’s New Mind (I may have read that in the 90’s) would be a helpful counter to Dennett.I probably spent hundreds of hours in philosophy courses in the 70’s and never once heard anyone mention Gödel, at least the profound implications of his proof. My college education was pathetic, but I’m happy there are still books like Goldstein’s that help make up for the shortfall of a mediocre public university education."
29,0393327604,http://goodreads.com/user/show/145381-brian,3,"I found half quite interestingPerhaps it's narrow-minded of me, but I didn't really care too much about Gödel's upbringing and his (non-proof-based) philosophical views. It is good to cover early history in a biography, but the focus should have been on his incompleteness work. Goldstein spends far too much time on his philosophical views (to the point of feeling quite redundant to me) and how they contrasted with other leading thinkers of the time. I found her focus on this topic inexplicable (fully 1/2 the book) until I noticed she's a professor of philosophy. (Though I suppose that gives her a slightly higher allotment of words beginning with meta-, I still think she nonetheless far exceeded it!)Sadly, I still don't think I grasp the divide among the Platonists, formalists, Sophists etc. to whom she refers...so when she seems to argue that his philosophical views were the driving force behind his mathematical work as well as his failure to navigate the politics of academia, I was bored. I'll also excuse her giving in to the temptation of injecting herself into the narrative (we hear several times of her one encounter with Gödel at a garden party), but she clearly need play no role in the text itself.The discussion of Gödel's incompleteness proofs themselves, however, was fun. The meta-s nearly disappeared completely, and we got down to actual proof synopses and the reactions within academia. So I enjoyed the second half of the book, probably inflating my final rating a bit.I do appreciate some of the references she gives, and look forward to reading more into his proofs themselves. I'm sure they're pretty inaccessible to me, but there are some popular treatments of them that should be perfect. Of course, I can't write about Gödel without suggesting that you read Gödel, Escher Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid by Hofstadter (how clever he is, including that title)."
30,0393327604,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5862105-kirk-lowery,0,"This book is an intellectual biography of one of the greatest mathematicians and logicians of the 20th century. Gödel single-handedly derailed the Hilbert-Russell program of putting mathematical proof on to a purely mechanistic (formal) basis. He showed that in any formal system that includes arithmetic, there will be true propositions that cannot be proved within that formal system. There is much more to it than that, but the primary implication is that mathematical truth exists apart from how humans conceive of it. In other words, mathematicians *discover* mathematical truth; they do not *invent* it. This makes him a Platonist; something in common with another famous mathematician of our day: Roger Penrose. Goldstein puts her considerable literary talents into putting Gödel's life into historical perspective. Gödel was Czech, but was educated in Vienna during the late 1920s and 1930s. He fled Nazi Austria in 1938, required to exit the country eastward, traveled on the Transsiberian Railway to Japan, then by boat to San Francisco, and finally by train to Princeton University, where he became a member of the Institute for Advanced Study, where Einstein also was. The two of them formed a famous friendship, although Gödel was paranoid, and eventually died of complications from malnutrition in 1978. The book is eminently readable and the most valuable aspect is that she puts Gödel into context, explaining why he pursued the questions that he did and how that impacted and influenced the thinkers around him. The book is based not only on Gödel's published and unpublished works, but also on interviews with those who knew him personally. For those of us who apply formal systems to other domains than mathematics (in my case, linguistics), Gödel's work in an important caution about the limits of the method we use, as well as being instructive about the nature of those methods."
31,0393327604,http://goodreads.com/user/show/321673-jamie-collins,3,"Probably this is a really good book, but it’s intended for a more erudite reader. It was largely over my head. It's part of the Norton ""Great Discoveries"" series, and the other two books in that series I've read (on Marie Curie and Ignac Semmelweis) were more accessible than this one.The introduction is nice - she talks about the creation of the Institute for Advanced study in Princeton, and the unlikely friendship between Gödel and Einstein. Then she launches into a discussion of the Vienna Circle in the early 1920's and the philosophies that Gödel's work most disturbed: logical positivism and formalism. Then onto an explanation of Gödel's proofs, which lost me completely. I can almost grasp the importance of the liar's paradox, but I gave up trying to understand the use of Gödel numbering, deciding that, as Einstein’s wife said about understanding the theory of relativity, it is not necessary to my happiness.After explaining the proofs, the author begins relating party anecdotes about Gödel. She met him once in a rare congenial mood at a party at Princeton. He was considered strange even in a place full of eccentric geniuses. The book contains scant biographical information, and only touches briefly on the paranoia and mental illness that finally killed him (he starved himself to death).The final chapter tries to hammer home the impact of Gödel’s work. People who better understood the rest of the book will probably find it repetitive, but it did me some good to have the ideas restated a few different ways. I like this picture of Gödel and Einstein on their daily walk. At the end of his life Einstein claimed to be going to the Institute merely ""to have the privilege to be able to walk home with Gödel."""
32,0393327604,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53714448-jr,2,"Seems to have a major misconception.I got it as a gift and picked it up to see if I wanted to read. Actually, based on the subject I thought I might want to recommend to a book club I am part of because it's a subject I am very interested in and would make for a good discussion.However, diving in at chapter ii (which is well into the book) there was a discussion about postulates (or axioms) and intuition. That axioms are necessary for a mathematical system because you need a foundation to build on, but the discussion was all about whether you could know that the axioms were true in some more fundamental system -- that you had to arrive at that determination intuitively, inherently it is impossible to prove and there is no way to validate it for sure (but that real life and looking at examples could provide some clues but could also be misleading). I think this totally misunderstands the idea of axioms and mathematical systems more generally. Axioms are assumed to be true within the mathematical system. Mathematical systems may be more useful (practical) if they bear more resemblance to the ""real world"" but there is no assertion or need for them to be. An obvious example is the case of Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometries. Both are very interesting and useful systems but they have axioms that contradict each other.Also, it seems deceptive that one of the prominent blurbs on the book is by the author's husband."
33,0393327604,http://goodreads.com/user/show/272430-daniel,4,"This book is an excellent overview of the life and work of the greatest mathematician of the twentieth century. I love the way the book ties the biographical, philosophical, and mathematical all together -- describing how Goedel's philosophical worldview drove him to search for an absolute proof of his point of view. The treatment of the famous incompleteness theorem seems to me well done, though I confess I haven't studied mathematical logic in over 20 years and pretend to no deep understanding of his results. Still, Goldstein's treatment gives enough theoretical justification to give the sense of the accomplishment but not so much as to make the book a bore, and presumably she knows what she is about as she studied logic at Princeton herself (and once met the great man in person!). Perhaps the most touching thing about the book is the way it begins and ends with the warm friendship between Goedel and Einstein; imagine how lucky each man must have felt to be able to talk to one of the few people on the planet who could possibly serve as a genuine intellectual peer. Amazing. My only beef is about the editing; the German is sometimes wrong, and I just can't understand why editors don't correct those things (e.g., there is no umlaut on the noun ""Vernunft"" in actual German, but there is about 100 times in the book). All in all, it's a GOOD READ."
34,0393327604,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16054032-mike-tracy,4,"This was a very tough read for me, especially the middle section, where the author gets into a lot of discussion of Godel's layering and numbering system of proof. Very abstract and very difficult for me to follow, but, in the more general sections, an enjoyable, if still somewhat challenging a read. If I'm getting the central idea of the book, it deals with Godel's revolutionary idea that truth or falsity cannot be derived by reasoning from any closed set. Inevitably such a procedure will always produce a paradox; if Bertrand shaves all and only those citizens of Berkley who do not shave themselves,...does Bertrand shave himself? Or, more interestingly, ""this sentence is false,..."" The big take away I get from the book is that intuition, which is not supportable through the conventions of formal logic, is the unique province of human consciousness. The mind is not a machine, which makes it adaptable in ways no computer could ever be. The inverse is the implication that true artificial intelligence, in the way we think of it, popularly, is probably never achievable. No need to worry about SkyNet. "

It must also be a difficult thing to dissect, but Rebecca Goldstein did so fabulously. As is my preference for reading, I picked this book up for the biographical information, yet found myself studying the technical breakdown of the incompleteness theory. I don't know how well it set in my mind, but my curiosity was piqued. I will definitely look into it more. One thing that bothered me a little, and I read this in another review as well, was the overabundance of Wittgenstein. I never really liked him, what little I have heard about him, and Goldstein bolstered that opinion here. What amazes me the most now that I have read several books about reclusive, paranoid, egotistical geniuses is how down-to-earth Albert Einstein was. It could be one of the reasons he is so well remembered, if not understood, by the masses, while Godel has been all but forgotten. "

For the mathematically illiterate,Ike myself, all but one of the chapters is fully comprehensible and the confusing chapter filled with formulas is not necessary to understand and enjoy the overall book and its themes. Goldstein tells us of Godels life and his incompleteness theories' effects on math and philosophy. Perhaps the most intriguing issue she raises is to what extent can his theories be used to understand the ""mind""? If formal systems do have an Undecidable formula, does it follow that we can say something meaningful about the human mind, like there is so etching outside ourselves that is not mechanical or physical and could even be inferred as god? Additionally, Goldstein pays tribute to a very disturbed and disturbing mathematician whose contributions to math are, for a variety of reasons, not as well known as others."

It covers his life and the Incompleteness Proof that he formulated, making it understandable. I have read Kurt Gödel's proof, but as I said in my review of that book, I did not really understand it. Maybe now I will return to that book.Anyway, there are a number of things I did know about Gödel, but some things I did not. I remembered the Einstein-Gödel friendship, but I did not realize that his Incompleteness Proofs were taken the wrong way: that is, they were not intended to turn the world of mathematics upside-down per se, but rather to be an ironclad answer to the members of the Vienna Circle that supported Positivist Views.In any case, I would really like to find more books in this Great Discoveries series. Hopefully, they are all as good as this one."

But this book, despite its exuberant praise of notions of genius, got me excited about logic in a way I hadn't felt since undergraduate days. And lest you thought the life of the logician was all structure, Goldstein lets us know that Godel enjoyed walks with Einstein, reading Kafka and watching Disney's the Seven Dwarves.Perhaps it's Godel's quirkiness (which dissolves in later life to more profound mental illness) that makes the read so compelling, but Goldstein does an impressive job of making the marvels of his proof speak for themselves and to the layman. Still, I'd imagine it would be quite a slog without some previous grounding in logic or mathematics. "

It discusses his proofs, but also why they were so important, especially in the context of other scientific, mathematical, and philosophical thought of the time. The author does write a little bit about his personal life, mostly his later years, which is also quite interesting. I really wish, however, that she had gone into more detail about the actual content of his proofs. I guess the book is designed to be accessible to a non-mathematician so I will have to go elsewhere for the really technical bits. I can say she made me really want to read/study his actual proof."
42,0393327604,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23716435-sahil-moza,4,"Well written book about Godel's life. Has a dedicated section for the incompleteness theorems, but it could have been explained better, and is still for a reasonably mathematical audience. So if you are looking for incompleteness theorems explained in layman terms, this book is probably not for you. But if you want to know more about Godel's life and times at the Vienna Circle, the rise and (kind of) fall of logical positivism, and Godel's later life at Princeton, and his friendship with Einstein, this book is for you. Slightly strong opinions at places, and Wittgenstein has been quite nastily portrayed.In summary, a book for a niche audience who are interested in Godel, his life and his math."
43,0393327604,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6968193-jake,4,"Much of Gödel's work is the basis for much of modern proofs in mathematics and this books is a focus on his incompleteness theorem which in affect the keystone of his contributions to this discipline. It states that essentially in any closed arithmatic system there are true statements that cannot be proved. For instance, A=B/C=>C=B/A or A=--A. Both are true but cannot be proven. This may not seem like a big deal but in Gödel's day most mathematicians believed the opposite. I don't really know how to gauge what you need to know before reading this book. Gödel's formal theorem is incredibly complicated and I would be diluting myself if I claimed I understood it all. I didn't really enjoy the sort of person Gödel was but Goldstein covered that aspect of the biography well."
44,0393327604,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2390058-julie,4,"Reading Rebecca Goldstein's interview on www.EDGE.org reminded me of reading this book recently. Godel's theorem along with Cantor's infinity will put your mind in a loop that turns into a golden plait, a braid so interesting that it must call out to it's reader for a second read; this time alongside some interpretive work on Wittgenstein, with whom Godel had a long-standing mathematical disagreement and personally discordant relationship to the point that the two men practically tore each other's hair out, very professionally. To read Rebecca's interview see,http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/golds..."
45,0393327604,http://goodreads.com/user/show/247371-rod,5,"An important and accessible treatment of the Godel incompleteness theorems, perhaps the most important mathematical development of the 20th Century. The incompleteness theorems combine as a statement in formal number theory that there exist undecidable formulae, that can be neither proven or disproven. In simple terms, this means there are formulas that are true, but cannot, even in theory, be proven true. The implications of the theorems are profound, both in mathematics and epistemology. While this volume is quite small (260 p of text) it does require an investment of effort on the part of the generalist reader to grasp the basic concepts. Well worth it though!"
46,0393327604,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2348903-greg-talbot,2,"Focuses largely on the man, Kurt Godel, not so much the implications of the incompleteess theorem.No doubt, Kurt Godel lived an interesting life. He was in the exemplary Vienna Circle, friends with Einstein, and is generally considered one of the most important mathematicians of the 20th century. However, his inwardness, strangeness and general disinterest in human connection does not make for a particularly interesting story.If you're interested in the ideas of Godel, I don't think this is the best part to start. Maybe it's just the difficulty of understanding the material, but I thought the biography to be uninspiring and the math concepts to be very complicated."
47,0393327604,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10887798-bryan,4,"Short but fascinating book on the greatest mathematical result of the 20th century. For the most part, Goldstein makes it accessible to the layman, although I did find I had to Google certain mathematical terms I had forgotten. Also, the simplified derivation of the result sometimes caused me to pause and reread certain passages until I understood them. If you enjoy and can follow pop science books such as 'A Brief History of Time,' this book shouldn't present a problem. Although, Goldstein doesn't discuss religious implications since she's a Atheist, one could definitely say that this result points to the existence of a higher power. Very interesting and thoughtful book."
48,0393327604,http://goodreads.com/user/show/582889-chisho1m,4,"It's always fun to try to wrap my head around watered-down explanations of esoteric math & science, so I was primarily interested in Goldstein's walk through the Incompleteness Theorems. But that's only about 30 pages of this book; otherwise, there's an overview of some math-philosophy issues, a good bit of intellectual history, and a cursory profile of a fascinating intellectual figure.I blogged about the book here."
49,0393327604,http://goodreads.com/user/show/843957-stuart,5,This book is a great primer on Gödel and his theorems. It cleared up some misconceptions I had about his incompleteness theorem. Post modernists often cite Gödel as support for their world view. This seemed correct to me. Turns out Gödel is a Platonist (my least favorite philosopher) and it took me 2/3rd's of the book to understand why. I have a sliver more respect for Plato now but a ton for Gödel. Not being a mathematician I can only follow the explanation of the proof so far but it's clear Gödel is one of the true genius' of the 20th century.
50,0393327604,http://goodreads.com/user/show/583557-sue,4,"Rebecca Goldstein considers Goedel's achievement on a par with those of Einstein & Heisenberg in shaping intellectual scientific thought in the 20th century. In this short book she not only describes Goedel's strange life & personality, but also manages to convey just what his incompleteness theorem was about. (This is the same Rebecca Goldstein who wrote ""The Mind-Body Problem"" (fiction), ""36 Arguments fot the Existence of God: A Work of Fiction,"" and ""Betraying Spinoza: The Renegade Jew Who Gave Us Modernity,"" among other books.)"
51,0393327604,http://goodreads.com/user/show/647454-kristen,4,"I'm reading this book for my Social Psychology class. So far, it is actually very interesting. Godel was a fascinating man; I would have loved to meet him.Just finished this book about the fascinating man that was Kurt Godel. It was more about his incompleteness theories than about him, but the author provided a great balance between all the technical stuff and anecdotes. After having read this book, I'm able to look at the world differently, if only ever-so-slightly. It's a very thought-provoking read, and Godel's theorems are very mind-bending. I'd recommend this read to everyone."
52,0393327604,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9355842-nik,4,"This has been my first book on Godel. After reading bits and pieces here and there and then Logicomix, I got here. The author has written the book well but I don't know if her explanations of Godel's proof and paradox could be easily understood by all. Surely I had a bit to go with. It however is easy to read. Godel's proof can be a whole lot confusing so my suggestion would be to read few different books and some preliminary articles to get explanations from many directions. This book btw is mostly biographical."
53,0393327604,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29364299-jim,5,"Marvelous book. Though one of my undergrad degrees is Math & Physics, Goedel's work was well above my pay grade. I'm grateful for those greater lights that show us things we'd never have thought of without their help. And I'm also grateful for Goldstein for writing about one of these greater lights. There seems to be a strong connection between Goedel's understanding of time and that mentioned in another book I just read and reviewed, Eliade's ""The Myth of the Eternal Return."" This book is very enjoyable, and I highly recommend it."
54,0393327604,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46422-tk-keanini,5,Rebecca Goldstein did such a great job in representing the many faces of Kurt Godel. Godel was mentally ill and one of the greatest minds in the history of our race. There is a picture on my wall of Godel because his work was so important in understanding the limits of any system. I think that Godel would have been proud of this work and it is clear in the book how much respect and influence Godel had on Ms Goldstein.
55,0393327604,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10039680-harish,4,"A uniquely interesting book that is neither entirely a biography nor a full elicitation of Godel's Incompleteness Theorem, but both in about equal measure. I enjoyed reading the proof, especially for the accessible presentation to someone semi-literate in math. Few theorems in math can say something so profound about math itself, but the fact that its proof depends on self-referential paradoxes makes it a little less awesome to me (or at least a little less satisfying)."
56,0393327604,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1583312-christopher,2,"This book attempted to be a biography, a history of an idea, and a history of an intellectual time all at the once, and it passed with average colors. This is the kind of book where nothing went terribly wrong, but nothing went terribly right either. So while I don't really have any major problems with it, it remains stubbornly ""OK.""Also note: Godel really needed to read some Chesterton, even though he would have hated it."
57,0393327604,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9410676-lou,5,"An excellent book on the incompleteness theorem, and the time and events surrounding Godel. Because he was such a recluse, there is not much information about the man himself. While I enjoyed the story, I would have liked more in-depth info on the man himself. It's likely that this was not possible. The book is still very worthwhile, and gives wonderful insight into one of the most amazing math theories of the 20th century (or any century). "
58,0393327604,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34001776-josquin,3,"Her usual poetic sensitivity infuses the writing, particularly with respect to her clean diction. The writer's word finds itself beneath her pen. The exposition of the proof is good as to clarity, but thin for those more interested. But, for those more interested, there are other books. I would have had it that she dwelled more on the relation of Wittgenstein’s thought to Godel’s work. Elegant and informative."
59,0393327604,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7841651-jim,3,"I would call this book a decent introduction to Kurt Godel but incomplete. Rebecca Goldstein presents interesting biographical information but it is sketchy and anecdotal. And good luck to anyone who tries to explain Godel's incompleteness theorems to a lay audience or lay readership, as she valiantly tries to do.Overall, not a ""wow"" reading experience, although it has whetted my appetite for learning more about this very private, eccentric, and reclusive genius."

204,0393327604,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1098963-jim-tarvid,3,The story about citizenship (p. 233) is worth the read.
205,0393327604,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4517208-dutch,5,For what it was I think it is an excellent book. Good for anyone wanting an introduction to Godel and his theorems.
206,0393327604,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5618435-jacob,0,"Fun read! If you're not a math major (=won't be learning this stuff out of a textbook), but you are someone who likes full explanations and not just hand-waving, then check this out!"

209,0393327604,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4465582-alexander-curran,4,An exceptional look (theorem) at Gödel by Goldstein. 
210,0393327604,http://goodreads.com/user/show/778508-gunner,5,"This really is a great biography of Kurt Godel, it's entertaining and interesting. It doesn't delve so much into what he did but more into who he was, it was quite informative, full of things I didn't know before. Unfortunately I lost it on a plane when I was about 10 pages from the end, I should just go to the bookstore to finish it or something."
211,0393327604,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1869399-kenny-johnson,0,"An interesting look at the fundamental theory by Kurt Godel that, in set theory, no set is ever complete and that axiomatic preconditions must exist. The author's writing style is sometimes burdensome with jargon but overall it explains well what remains borish or misunderstood by most of society. I give it 8/10 ... ~ Kenny"
212,0393327604,http://goodreads.com/user/show/710326-shawn,3,"Does a decent job of explaining Gödel's contributions to logic and mathematics, even for those who, like me, are not anywhere near mathematically well-enough prepared to absorb the mathematical details. While Goldstein does spend a little time discussing the impact of these ideas in areas beyond logic and mathematics, I would like to have had a good deal more of this."

She does an excellent job of exploring the implications of Godel's theorems while at the same time delving into the life of the man himself and his relationships with others. She also does a good job of debunking the idea that Godel was a relativist or logical positivist, which is a pet peeve of mine. "
215,0393327604,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30982871-james-f,4,A biography of G��del; not too much in depth on the proof itself but very good on the philosophic background and implications. The book goes into G��del's Platonism and his early relationship to the Vienna Circle and Wittgenstein as well as the mathematical background such as the Hilbert program and the various paradoxes.
216,0393327604,http://goodreads.com/user/show/150648-tiffany,3,"A decent book, even though some of the math of it went over my head. Luckily (or not), there wasn't actually that much discussion of math in the book. It was more about Godel's life than just about his actual incompleteness theorems. "

219,0393327604,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1721143-bob,5,"Rebecca Goldstein's lucid history and memoir of Goedel taught me that Einstein and Goedel were both Platonists, which is why they were such close friends, and why they suffered and struggled against the zeitgeist that the two of them had had such a major role in creating.

221,0393327604,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4557573-samantha,5,  I did not want this book to end. Every time I picked it up I loved reading it and was acutely aware of it not lasting forever. I will now reread it as I continue to work at understanding the theorems. 
222,0393327604,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3000753-lani,4, Goldstein´s seemingly effortless explanation of Gödel´s Incompleteness theorem in biographical and historical context is no small achievement. A fascinating look into its proof and the philosophical ramifications it has beyond the field of mathematics.
223,0393327604,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5283085-brian,2,"I respect the book more than I like it. It does clarify some of the issues of the Incopmleteness theorem, but there's still much ambiguity and technicality here. Also, I didn't feel for Godel. He needed to get out more."
224,0393327604,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1601398-russell,4,I love k. Godel. One of the most fascinating people to ever live and probably produced the most important mathematical result ever. This book is a very good contextual narrative for godel and incompleteness. It will launch a lot of curious sub projects for the dedicated reader. 
225,0393327604,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10397335-ben,3,"An informative book. When Goldstein weaves the story of Godel's life and the figures who played a role in it, her writing is engaging.

226,0393327604,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24898510-lorenzo,4,"A lucid account of the relevant biographical details of Godel's life relating to his incompleteness theorems, which this book also clearly and accessibly explains.
