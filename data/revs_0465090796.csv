0,0465090796,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5885760-andrew-smith,3,"The idea sounded good: using scientific methods it would investigate unusual topics, it's aim being to explore such areas as the psychology of lying and undertaking quests such as that of identifying the world’s funniest joke. Most topics are offbeat and the methods of discovery are usually through observation or via the completion of questionnaires. Scientific? Well, sort of. In truth, about half way through I started to wonder why I'd picked this one up – I hadn't found any life enhancing truths and I'd go as far as to say that most ‘discoveries’ felt little more than you'd deduce from exercising a little common sense. There was some interesting reminders as to how the mind works, but not much more. Did the author discover the world’s funniest joke? Well I won't spoil it for future readers but I will say there's one or two contenders that did raise a smile. My personal favourite: What’s brown and sticky? A stickThe highlights for me were sections on how to spot a fake smile, the truth about female van drivers and why people born in summer are born lucky. It won't change your life but it might turn a few light bulbs on for you."
1,0465090796,http://goodreads.com/user/show/166376-david,3,"Definitely one of those books which promised more hilarity in the bookstore than it was able to deliver at home. I think Richard Wiseman Ph.D. would dearly love to have us believe that he is a brilliantly zany individual, but - truth be told - most of this material never rises above being mildly interesting, and the style is a closer approximation to 'dorky' than 'zany'.A couple of chapters fail completely in my view - pretty much all of the material related to ""what your birth date really says about you"" is fluff. There's not much substance in the chapter on superstition and people's belief in the paranormal either. And surely people should have figured out by now that ""explorations into the psychology of humor"" are invariably notable only for their soporific, humorless quality, so including 50 pages on this topic was a decision with high albatross potential.More successful were the chapters on how to tell if people are lying, decision-making (including how to write a personal ad that will succeed with men/women), and altruism.A decidedly mixed bag. The author's decision to end his introduction with the sentence ""Let the quirkology begin"" could possibly have been considered adequate warning."
2,0465090796,http://goodreads.com/user/show/173550-devin,2,"Reading through the book, I came across a few notable errors- some very questionable conclusions in a study, basing a section on a ""quote"" from Freud that he never said, a statistic that the author admitted in the footnotes that he made up- and I couldn't help but wonder how many other errors the book contained that I didn't know enough to correct. While it was an entertaining read, that level of uncertainty left me feeling like I couldn't necessarily accept it as a fact, so it could only be entertainment to me."

4,0465090796,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1383849-patrick,2,"The book covers psychological facts of everyday life. Although the book proves a bunch of common sense facts such a positive environment creates a positive mindset, there were couple of interesting factoids that I did not know before reading the book such as:1)Certain people can will themselves to live longer by focusing on a goal with a deadline2)It is easier to detect liars through the words they uses instead of non-verbal cues a. Liars tend to provide less details and be vague and they try to distance themselves psychologically from their false statements so they have fewer statements about themselves/their feelings in their story line. They also tend to remember detailed facts. b. A real smile can be told by a deeper wrinkle in their eyes. People who smile more are happier. c. Da Vinci's Mona Lisa is enigmatic because you do not know whether or not the woman in the painting is happy or not. If one looks at the mouth, the woman looks like she is unhappy but if one looks at the eyes it looks like she is genuinely happy.3) People tend to believe in superstitions more in times of uncertainty because they want control in their lives. I guess this is the reason that religion is against superstitions because it supplants the belief in God.4)Subliminal messages in TV do not work5)Names can determine your fate6)Your environment can influence the way you think7)Presenting yourself well can make other people like you better8)Getting the object of your affection heart rate up when meeting them can make them in loved with you. This happens in war situations or scary movies9)Love at first sight happens when you are keyed into the object of your affection non-verbal cues of interest10) Laughing is good for your health and well-being11)Comedy and religious fundamentalism do not mix because great humor involves mixing elements that do not go together, threaten authority, contain sexually explicit scenes and laughing means a loss of self-control and self-discipline all antithetical to the principles of religious fundamentalism12) TV anti-social programs have no effect in real world violence13)People tend to help others more often if they are similar to themselves (related to kin altruism)14) People have no problems stealing from an institution or a machine but do not steal from people they relate to.15) Religious tend to be more altruistic16) People who live in a fast pace city and increase population density tend to be less friendly and helpful because they suffer from sensory overload. People who experience sensory overload tend to prioritize what they need to focus on so they become goal-oriented and thus less friendly/helpful. Because, they are less friendly to others, they tend to become more isolated and lonlier17)To combat the worlds trend of becoming a more isolated, creating a sense of community is important. One can create this sense by first initiating others to smaller acts of altruism followed by larger acts.18) People become what other expect them to be19) Lucky people tend to be lucky because they believe that they are luck and create opportunities for themselves20)People born in warmer climates tend to be luckier than people born in colder climates because the weather forces people to be kept warm in colder climates thus less likely to explore21)Astrology works because it engages in flattery and being vague"

To be honest, I'm not sure who should read this book - it is bad. BAD!If Mr Wiseman spent more time researching fresh material and less time jumping to wild, baseless suppositions this might be a better book. How could it not be? One thing that annoyed me is his desperate need to prove how clever he is. Constant references to his kinship and associations with the world's greatest minds and how ""Wiseman"" is a very fitting name for such a smart one, if he does say so himself. We are constantly reminded about his PHD and the fact that he is a scientist - does it really need to be stated this often? At one point he visually likens himself to Sigmund Freud by having a photo taken on Freud's very own couch imitating the founder of modern psychology! I'm no psychologist, but me thinks someone is insecure...Most of the stuff in this book could be written by anyone with a vague interest in the behaviour of people, which is nearly everyone who can read. In fact, most people would actually draw some conclusions or insight about mankind instead of proverbially jumping about the book like a manic first year psychology student on acid. I kid you not, at one point in the book he fills most of the chapter with jokes. The first couple were interesting as you think he's going to explain about reasoning behind the humour, but he goes on to list dozens of them and I could tell he was running out of ""interesting"" little nuggets to write about. He then makes some rather weak minded claim that all jokes are made because of the sense of superiority the joke teller feels when laughing at someone else. Professor Wiseman forgets that jokes generally paint a scene about a person or typecast that is iconic and known to everyone and this is the reason jokes seem to be targeting other people. It has to be this way so that the joke teller can relate an image to the listener. The only way around this would be to tell a joke about a person of non specific race or gender, who has a mean average IQ of 100, walking into a high street bar of a non specific town or city. The barman or woman or robot asks ""Why the averagely long face Sir or Madam?"" All jokes are about The wife, husband, celebrity, blonde girl, Irishman, solicitor or social workers etc etc. They have to be about somebody!Also, Mr Not-so-wiseman seem to think it's odd that cause and effect relate to each other. Hmm. Numerous times throughout the book he states examples whereby people have been exposed to a certain stimulus, for example been forced to listen to prejudice religious and ethnic propaganda disguised as jokes about Jews, and then afterwards they are asked their opinion on Jewish people. Guess what? Those exposed to the propaganda are slightly affected by it. Wow. Also, did you know that Women tend to prefer jokes about things that interest them as opposed to things that interest men??? Mind = blown!The fact that he is an iconic celebrity and that he looks like a stereotypical scientist is why the book sells and why people read it. Very disappointing. Avoid. "

7,0465090796,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1825090-angie,4,"This is a great book. Granted it is a tremendous bubble burster, it's like the day your learned there was no Santa Claus. Wiseman debunks all my favorite myths. The hardest myth to fall was astrology. Thank goodness I have such strong rationalization skills! I was able to rationalize that his great hate of astrology stemmed from Virgo impotence! I am really enjoying it!"
8,0465090796,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,4,"A very fun read! This book is sort of repetitive of a lot of other pop psychology books. Nevertheless, a few of the chapters are quite unique: ""The World's Funniest Joke"" was quite entertaining. "
9,0465090796,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2147949-victoria,2,"Quirkology is a collection of apparently ‘quirky’ scientific experiments into social psychology. It covers a wide area of life, from luck, to humour, to deception. Some are very interesting – I particularly enjoyed the ‘world’s best joke’ section (who doesn’t love a good giggle?) and the parts about superstitions and ghostly apparitions. There were factoids that I have repeated already and I’m sure I will again. There were, however, other parts I either skimmed or skipped entirely. That, I am sure, is pretty much down to personal preferences and interests. 	Throughout all the chapters, there are a great many experiments, both Wiseman’s and his peers’, which are explained and discussed. ‘Explained and discussed’ might be a little generous actually. It was more like they were brushed over and regurgitated in quick succession, with little or no discussion attached at all. The topics changed quickly and there seemed to be either no real conclusion or too firm a conclusion based on little evaluation. Fair enough, I guess, since I imagine that a book like this could easily become bogged down and boring. And like I said, it was amusing enough in parts and there genuinely were plenty of ‘huh, that’s interesting’ moments. There were sly drops of humour too – like the mistyped ‘untestable’ (view spoiler)[typed as 'untesticle' (hide spoiler)] within the Freudian Slip section. I just couldn’t help feeling like I wanted something with a little more…depth, I suppose. 	I was infuriated, too, by ‘The Big Secret Experiment’ section on p.272, purporting that the book and its readers are all part of one big experiment and that you can take part or find the results of the experiment at www.quirkology.com. The website merely re-directed me to Wiseman’s blog/promotional page and I could find no research results anywhere. A shame, because I would have enjoyed reading it, I’m sure. Now I am merely put out. 	Books are not just about the content though - even non-fiction books. The way it reads is just as important and here, the narrative is dry, dry, dry. I know, I know, it’s science and science, by its very nature, is dry, cold and methodical…blah blah blah. But when writing pop-science and trying to engage an audience that doesn’t want to read scientific journals, perhaps one should add just a touch of flourish and emotion to one’s writing. Wiseman tries too hard to be ‘fun and funky’. His definition of ‘quirky’ is almost definitely only quirky within the world of science and seems pretty much mainstream elsewhere. Moreover, his need to be liked and thought of as ‘fun’, well-connected (talk about name-dropping!) and an integral part of popular culture is much more evident than his intelligence, which, although apparent, is hidden behind a thinly disguised veil of craving and social insecurity. It’s a shame, because he is obviously a clever man (if a little arrogant – what was that ‘wise-man’ Wiseman crack about?) who wants to share his love of science with the world. 	The trouble is, he doesn’t seem all that excited about his experiments. Not in the way that I would expect any scientist (or indeed person) to be about discoveries within their field of work. In fact, in some instances he comes across as almost bored, unattached and uncaring. I know – he’s a scientist, he can’t help it, but if the author himself can’t rouse a bit of emotion about that which he writes, do the readers have any chance at all?"
10,0465090796,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6327289-lydia,4,"I'm torn over rating this book. I have rated it 4 stars for doing what it says on the tin, not because it was a 4 star worthy reading experience for me personally, but because it would be unfair of me to hold this book to a standard it doesn't claim to adhere to. Ideally I would've given it 3.5 stars, and here's the more detailed breakdown:As other reviewers have mentioned, some of the research in this book is a bit iffy, and the methods used are questionable. Wiseman announces the conclusions of some of the small scale quirky studies in terms of sweeping generalisations and not enough detail is given to back up some of his claims.However, this IS a work of pop psychology, and not a research paper. Citations refer you to all the original articles if you want to go into the research critically. This book on its own offers tasters and quirky factoids and focuses on entertainment more than the academic side of things - which it never claimed to do anyway. What it DOES claim to do is give you plenty to discuss over dinner, and it does fulfil that goal. As a psychology student I already had general ideas on a lot of the research mentioned in the book. But based purely on entertainment value, I enjoyed reading it and would recommend it to anyone with an interest in psychology, particularly if they are not yet very knowledgable in the field. "
11,0465090796,http://goodreads.com/user/show/639407-tulpesh-patel,4,"This is one of the better collections of pop-science books filling shelves at the moment, largely down to Richard Wiseman's obvious love of the work and direct involvement in some of the studies.There are a number of retreads of studies that you'll have come across if you've read any other pop-psychology (Milgram etc.) but it's full of interested factoids you immediately want to tell your friends, and a great way to learn of the methods and fallacies in psychology.The search for the world's funniest joke is probably the highlight. The Worldwide eradication of FTSE-itis is also very clever, taking full self-knowing advantage of the psychology that fills some of the book."
12,0465090796,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2006699-tariq-mahmood,5,"Nobel attempt to explain many human behaviours by painstakingly conducting experiments on unsuspecting public. And that’s what made the book so great for me as these sort of experiments are done by all of us individually all the time, because we need to know the odds for our survival. Very engaging book."
13,0465090796,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10860999-bryan-murphy,5,"The author is someone who lets his curiosity get the better of him, and we all benefit. It deals with the kind of question I hoped to learn to answer when I majored in social psychology some, erm, not so few years ago. I think it would make a fine introductory text. And it is indeed a good read."
14,0465090796,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8464281-darnell,3,"A solid first book on the subject, but a bit basic: it stops to define words like ""introverted"" and ""extroverted"", for example. There are also a number of issues where it describes as controversial research that has, to my knowledge, been generally discredited (holiday-related deaths and name acronyms). Those things aside, it was fun and readable."
15,0465090796,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59759424-quan,5,"Interesting and hilarious scientific research about psychology.If you're only looking for something to read for fun about psychology, read this.I don't know if I got any valuable info from it but I enjoyed reading it anyway"
16,0465090796,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2674867-lynn,3,"My brief March 2008 five star review:I guess I just like quirky things about human behavior. I really enjoyed this book. Worth reading, several times.What was I thinking? I did read this a second time and although it was interesting, I was disappointed.The Q test described in the beginning was still fascinating; even though I don’t take it seriously. It’s still fun, and I’m surprised that didn’t make it into his final chapter on quirky dinner conversations.The chapter on deception was still worth reading again. I applied the lie detector test on something a known prevaricator wrote and it was surprisingly predictive. I suspect it wouldn't work in all cases though, and I definitely think Wiseman oversold it, as he oversold most of the experimental conclusions in the book.By chapter 6 I began to see that many of the experiments he had described were not examples of good science (if there is such a thing in the social sciences), but examples of the things Wiseman wanted to propagate. By the end of the book, it was apparent that entertainment and not understanding was the goal of this book. I’m not sure he really cared how shaky the science was for these quirky conclusions about human behavior. As long as it was quirky, he described it with the utmost praise.I think it would have been a more interesting and even more entertaining if he actually directed a knowledgeable critique of at least some of the studies. He praises Milgram and Zimbardo, but I’ve read things about both of their designs that should have been mentioned if for no other reason than giving the reader a taste of how interesting and controversial disputes in the social sciences are.There are other quirky studies he describes that show his own biases, or at least his gullibility and lack of skepticism toward results he likes. It’s ironic to see a leader in the skeptical community become so credulous when he finds any experiment that confirms his world view. It just shows how strong our biases are.But it wasn’t just the biased studies. He also left some important information out of his joke chapter that would have been extremely entertaining and fascinating. Christopher Hitchens wrote about it in 2007, the inherent difference between men and women with respect to humor. I don’t know why Wiseman didn’t mention it. Maybe he didn’t agree with the conclusions.By the end of the book he came off as a gullible social scientist that swallowed practically anything done by his colleagues if it was interesting and quirky and he liked it. It was Wiseman the entertaining magician, not Wiseman the skeptic who wrote this book."
17,0465090796,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1020619-educating-drew,4,"Brief Summary? Quirkology opens with Wiseman explaining that he had ""long been fascinated by the quirky side of human behavior."" While earning his degree in psychology, he began paying attention specifically to these behaviors and random tests. (If participating in psych tests are something that interest you, check out their website ). The book is divided into many chapters that cover chronopsychology (does the time of birth, astrological sign, weather really play a part in your personality?), the psychology of lying and deception, the role of humor in psychology, how we make decisions, psychic and paranormal psychology, and why we help or hinder others. *Whew*My thoughts? This book was just plain fun. At times it grew to be tedious because you're just reading test and study, one after another. So yah, it blurs in together. But, really, I want to focus in on the fun. There were handful of times I would stop what I was reading and find someone to share an interesting anecdote. (Like his research in finding the funniest joke in the world!)Wanna know how to spot a liar? ""The most reliable signs of lying are in people's voices and in their unconscious choices of language: the lack of key details in their descriptions; the increase in pauses and hesitations; the way liars distance themselves from their deceit by avoiding self-reference such as ""I""; the failure to describe their feelings; and the way liars seem to remember minute information that truth-tellers forget"" (64)Yay, Nay, or Eh? Yay. This was a -what's-the-word- OH YEAH --> FUN(!) book and not something that you necessarily need to read over a short period of time. Read a chapter, set it aside for a couple of months, and read another if you like. Or, you can devour it like I did. :))**I'm really doing a disservice in this review. I read Quirkology weeks (?) months (?) ago and should have immediately written the review while still smitten. I marked up this book. It's highlighted, annotated, tagged. I just don't have the energy to go back and re-read through all of my notes and make a stronger post. "
18,0465090796,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31264299-stephanie-jane-literary-flits,3,"I picked up a copy of Quirkology on a French campsite book exchange having previously enjoyed reading Richard Wiseman's self-help book 59 Seconds. Quirkology is a much thicker tome(!) which sets out to explore the findings of many different and unusual psychology studies undertaken over the past century or so and explain their results in layman's terms. I was disappointed by quite how low the bar is set, having hoped for a deeper view of the work with more science and less joky padding, but there are lots of nuggets of interesting information dotted throughout the book. Eccentric Victorian scientist Francis Galton gets several mentions which reminded me of the interesting biography of him I read a couple of years ago: Extreme Measures by Martin Brookes and, in a small world moment, recently read science author Simon Singh crops up too having been involved with making a Tomorrow's World feature where the great British public were asked to determine whether Sir Robin Day was lying. Sir Robin? Surely not! Although some huge studies are described, I was surprised several times by apparently significant findings being decided from very small samples and I didn't agree with all the results either. Apparently women find jokes funnier than men do because in social situations we laugh at over 70% of jokes told by men, whereas men laugh at less than 40% of jokes told by women. Hmmm. Nothing to do with women traditionally being 'trained' to bolster male egos then? Perhaps the fake smile identification study should have been carried out in tandem? Overall Quirkology kept my attention for a few hours and it is a humorous, light read, but not really sciencey enough for my tastes.See more of my book reviews on my blog, Stephanie Jane"
19,0465090796,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2425272-gabriel-tang,0,"Although I have read only four of the six chapters, as well as the epilogue, I have gathered many interesting information from this book. The following is not, strictly speaking, a review but a brief, selective list of what I have learned in this book:Chapter 1:--Geoffrey Dean's refutation of the ""time twins"" hypothesis--Why people believe in astrology despite its scientific invalidity: The Barnum Effect and the Flattery Effect--Chronopsychology as a relatively new but obscure academic discipline--The BIRG (Basking in Reflected Glory) EffectChapter 2:--Hitler's lie to Chamberlain regarding Czechoslovakia--Richard Wiseman's ""Q test""--The signs of a liar: few details; little or sporadic use of the pronoun 'I'; more hesitation and pauses; the seemingly admirable ability to recall even the slightest or the most trivial of information.--Body language as a common misconception of distinguishing liars--Why Leonardo's ""Mona Lisa"" is considered enigmatic --The ""Pan American"" smile vs. a genuine smile --The use of suggestive language to conjure false memoriesChapter 4:--Questioning the efficacy of subliminal messages in the media--The subtle persuaders: how our names, height, facial hairs, and the use of suggestive language influence our decision-making--The 70-30 principle of personal adsChapter 6:--How likeness or similarity affects our decision to help others (The Similarly Principle)--The direction relation between a city's ""pace of life"" and altruism (Robert Levine; there are exceptions to this relation, which invariably means that a slower pace of life is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for altruism)"
20,0465090796,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20508475-raluca,3,"Meh. That pretty much sums up how I felt about ""Quirkology"". I've actually read my share of pop-psych-slash-""let's-translate-academic-articles-into-common-English"" books, so it would be unfair to to criticize the book for containing a whole bunch of stuff I already knew about. My complaint, rather, is how tame and unengaging it was, especially having been (assumedly) written as a collection of outlandish research, either in topic or method. Most of the findings are predictable (oh, so my star sign doesn't directly affect my life? Wouldn't have thunk it) and the volume as a whole lacks any sort of structure or general point. (With Gladwell, I was complaining about his need to beat you over the head with the book's central idea every other page. Turns out I dislike the opposite attitude as well. I'm hard to please.)It's not a bad effort, though. I would actually recommend it to students of social sciences who have to do their research, maybe not so much as direct inspiration on what to study, but rather as proof that serious, publishable articles and theses don't have to rely on the same tired questionnaire you pass on to your undergrad friends. Plus it has an extensive reference list, so that's help with the lit review. Why did I think of this two years ago?"
21,0465090796,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51454575-nick-davies,4,"06/09/2007: Enjoyable - perhaps a little more so because the author appeared to embrace the fact he was writing a quirky, but not earth-shattering, popular science book. It was nicely written and entertaining, a book about some of the more unusual scientific experiments that have been undertaken - especially in the areas of psychology and sociology. There's stuff in there about pick-up lines, how height (with reference to success and people's assumptions) is associated with other positive attributes, subliminal messages, and 'The World's Funniest Joke'. I've read a few books of this type, so sometimes they can feel a bit repetitive of the same few key experiments, but this was fresh enough to be fun.12/05/2019: Re-read as prep for a work thing, having purchased a six months ago without realising I'd already read it, I would award 4* again, getting a similar amount from this enjoyable and approachable effort to detail some informative examples of popular psychology/sociology. Though (as previously commented) details of some of the most-cited experiments were far from new and exciting for me, I did get a lot from other parts of the book which I had forgotten or hadn't absorbed first time around."
22,0465090796,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7614560-sleepless-dreamer,4,"More like 3.5 stars but after reading those bits about altruism and because it's sunny outside, I'm feeling generous. I'm not sure what to feel about pop science books. I often feel like they're kind of the desserts of the science world. Lacking substance and not considered actual research. But also easy to read and likable. So yeah, I learned a few fun facts but I also feel very skeptical about this book. A lot of the facts don't see 100% researched and there's a lot of room to criticize the researching ways. I don't think you should read this book and immediately believe each word. I guess, all in all, I had a nice time reading this. I feel like I'm reading less and slower so finishing a book already is like a celebration. It was very readable.  what I'm taking with me • Thinking of yourself in a certain way is already incredibly influential. • Humans are more alike than we think and we all fit into statistics, the statistics are talking about us, even if we're individuals. • Small things can determine our lives apparently.

23,0465090796,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5316176-melanie,2,"I enjoyed psychologist Richard Wiseman’s previous book, 59 seconds, but found this one grated me. The author seems to be convinced of his own genius and is always name dropping how he worked with the BBC on this, or worked with such and such on that. And some of the subject material is dull, especially (ironically?) the chapter on the world search for the funniest joke, which is best avoided. And yet I made it to the end of the book. Because, as the book itself claims, reading it does make for better dinner party conversations. There were just enough fascinating little tit-bits in the book to keep me reading. Including how body language is no help at all in pick up liars, how easy it is to create false childhood memories in most people, and all the experiments on how honest we are (compared to how honest we say we are)."

29,0465090796,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2097880-schissel,3,"don't know if I'll finish this one. It is, as the title suggests, quirky, but not meaty. The sections are disjointed bits of pop psychology, much of which is retread from other articles/books I've read. Fun, but not filling."
30,0465090796,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50889691-sheng,3,"I've subscribed to Quirkology Youtube channel for a few years now and I was quite surprised to see that there was a book with the same name in the bookshelves of my Airbnb host. It was quite different from the usual content on the Quirkology I was used to on the Youtube channel (namely optical illusions and brain tricks) and this was instead a collection of quirky studies on human behaviour and other areas. Sample studies include finding the funniest joke in the world, witnessing a four year old girl best a professional financial expert in the stock market, seeing if horoscopes really have any effect on our lives and the influence your birthdate could have on you. I really appreciated how this book tried to take a scientific approach in finding out all these curiosities about life and the results they obtained too but of course, there's always murky areas in determining causations and associations plus speculations about the results. Towards the end of the book, the studies mentioned were beginning to be content that I had heard of before which is probably testament to the book's influence since it is relatively old. The premise of these quirky studies got a little tiresome towards the end too as if the more intriguing material had been placed in the front of the book and the behind portions felt more like fillers. Nonetheless, it was an entertaining read that made many long train rides bearable. 3.5/5"
31,0465090796,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4235397-sarah-clement,5,"I am shocked that I hadn't read this book before, but I also feel happy that I have been able to experience it now. This book is a classic among critical thinkers, and to my mind it also affirms Wiseman's place as one of the best modern popular science writers. The book is light-hearted but evidence based, entertaining but also serious. In other words...it exemplifies the sort of work that the Ignobel prizes honour. First it makes you laugh, then it makes you think. It covers all sorts of cognitive biases as well as every day curiosities, some of which you may have thought about, and others that you may wonder why you never thought about before. I found the whole book engaging, insightful, and entertaining, but I also can't help but view it from the perspective of a science enthusiast and researcher in 2019. In particular, I wonder how much of this psychological research has been replicated, given the replication crisis in science that has cast a dark shadow over the field of psychology in particular. This is not to undermine Wiseman's work. To the contrary, it is instead a call for people like Richard Wiseman, who is a big name in the organised skeptics community, to confront these issues head on in a new book. And no, I wouldn't leave it so long...I would read it right away!"
32,0465090796,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48229605-kellie,1,"About 40 pages into reading this, I knew it was getting a 2* rating. I've anticipated reading this book, given my interest in psychology and with this book being presented as an easy book to understand and follow to those who aren't in the field.However, the writing style and the looseness of the experiments and scientific data (some of which the subject groups were laughably small) seems to incline its marketing towards children, which it is not.From 2* down to 1* because towards the end of the book, not only were there loose anti-Semitic tones (one of which being an offhand topic about big noses); some loose sexism; but also a slur (faggots). Oddly misplaced in a non-fiction book which wasn't at all referencing any sort of LGBT history or the use of derogatory langauge.I was counting down the pages until I was finished this book and now I shall return it on my shelf to collect dust."
33,0465090796,http://goodreads.com/user/show/111943557-ellie,4,"Dedicating his life to the weird and wonderful quirks of life, Professor Richard Wiseman has written a great book about 'the curious science of everyday lives'. This is a great starter book for anyone that is interested in psychology, human behaviour and the such. As I was reading the book, I often considered what I would do in the various experiments that Wiseman described, and I imagine many people will do the same. I raced through the book, Wiseman was great at describing technical details in layman's terms, as well as making even the most scientific research sound intriguing. I imagine that this book will provide a great source for dinner conversation debate, and it certainly makes you wonder what you would try and research about the weird ways in which humans behave!"
34,0465090796,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18592182-andra-peeph,3,"This book picks up after the first half.It starts by talking about his experiments on debunking astrology (which is pretty predictable and became boring quite quickly) then moves on to the psychology of deception ( where there's nothing you haven't heard before really). It started getting interesting on the chapter about humour and searching for the world's best joke, which was my favourite part. It doesn't feel like a scientific book and you should take it with a grain of salt.Use it more of a conversation starter (which is what the author suggests) than basing any of your own opinions on it before doing your own research."
35,0465090796,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35400624-theodore-kopoukis,4,"""I don't know it for a fact, I just know it's true""How many times have you said that for the quirks of life, that seem like common sense? This book presents the psychology and studies done on topics such as humour (and lack of by certain groups), biases, dependability, social cohesion, belief in luck or zodiac signs etc. They may read like common sense indeed, but it's always heartwarming to know that you can provide research backed up facts to an argument with, say, religious fundamentalists."
36,0465090796,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68024313-que-le,3,"I was so curious on the introduction about the book. It is truly intersting and makes me choose between others on the bookshelves. But honestly it turned me into disapointed then. I got the the author’s message but the writing styles might be so complex (not same as the introduction since the beginning). He seems to talk too much about how to do the experiment, about the methodology, or about how good his partner is (who did that experiment with him). The conclusion was ok but sometimes it was just 2 sentences while it took him 1 page for narrative. And it was not so funny as my expectation."
37,0465090796,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57341941-sam-ho,5," This book is about general psychology of the population in everyday situations. We pride ourselves on our free will, our ability to do as we wish, our irrationality Yet psychologists have pointed out trends in our behaviour. This book archives some of the more fascinating things. Our superstitions, humour, charity..., can all be quantified in a page or two.If you too are intrigued by these attempts of rationalizing our irrationality, try out this book."
38,0465090796,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7061202-adrian,3,"Quirkology has the potential to be thought provoking and interesting, but many of the insights create a sense of déjà vu in the reader.The first couple of chapters concern a skeptical explanation of certain forms of supernatural phenomena, however, the interesting part comes during the latter chapters concerning psychological responses, with the part on dating ads and chat up lines been perhaps the most insightful.Overall, not bad, but pales in comparison to Malcolm Gladwell."
39,0465090796,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2324650-rebecca,3,Quirkology is full of fun and interesting facts to do with psychology. It talks about a lot of different studies. I feel like I learned quite a lot reading this book but at the same time there were a couple of sections that I already knew most of the content. Overall I enjoyed this book and am keen to read more by Richard Wiseman in the future.
40,0465090796,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67151632-tessa-clare,5,"I enjoyed this book a lot! This is one of those books that you should read before a dinner party so that you can whip out some facts to impress people.I also enjoyed Richard Wiseman’s humor interspersed throughout the book. It’s definitely a British book and has the British sense of humor, which I enjoyed."
41,0465090796,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40180140-ian-mcgaffey,5,"This was a very fun look at human psychology. I found the style very similar to freakonomics, which is one of my favorite books and series. The author shows how different aspects of human life can be examined to shed some light on human behaviour. A great read that is very approachable and thought provoking."
42,0465090796,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61162663-emma,5,"Brilliant, I loved it! A fascinating and fun look at some of the more unusual psychology experiments that have been done over the years, written in an accessible and engaging style. Excellent narration on the audiobook, too. This book makes me want to become a quirkologist!"
43,0465090796,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38511152-alan-menachemson,3,"Nice quick reading. Reading books like “the outliers” spoils this a bit, because it is so much shallower. But parts like religion does not make you better, smaller cities make you nicer and the search for the funniest joke in the world redeem this book. Glad I read it "
44,0465090796,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66918653-akvile,5,"I actually loved it so much. The most exciting part of it is that you can learn so much about the world and most importantly about yourself. World is a machine, and quirkologyst knows exactly how it works! "
45,0465090796,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10449878-naomi,4,"Quite interesting book and easy to read, but a lot of the results from the experiments were common sense. Though it was nice to see the results scientifically proved rather than just assuming correlation and causation."
46,0465090796,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39009625-alan,5,"Another great book from Richard Wiseman. I love this kind of book.It is a collection of quirky research by various psychologists including Richard, that has been put into a readable & well presented format, rather than just a collection of random facts. "
47,0465090796,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6675118-conrad-toft,5,It took me until half way through the book to connect the author with a familiar face on Tomorrow's World during my childhood. I knew of many of the experiments (I read far too much on social psychology) but there were a few interesting new ones to me.
48,0465090796,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20004676-heidi-sinclair,5,"This was a great read and several interesting studies on the psychology of human behaviour were discussed in an engaging humoristic manner.Entertaining as well as educational, I can highly recommend this book."
49,0465090796,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37925908-psychonout,4,"Science is everywhere.I really enjoyed listening about the strange questions and answers we could be asking and answering instead of say... ""what is at the center of our galaxy""?It's also rather sad to hear how and why we're getting more alone."
50,0465090796,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16375495-sarah-m,3,Alternative title - The Quirky Bitch Book - As given by the lovely DaraThis was good. I enjoyed this book. Learned quite a bit and now have two more lame jokes that I can say to make people instinctively roll their eyes. Success!(Zooey Deschanel also gives this an emphatic thumbs up)
51,0465090796,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5522665-jackie-farm-lane-books,2,"This book would probably have been really good if I'd read it on its release in 2007. Sadly, now it feels a bit dated. I'd heard most of the research before and things that were new to me were probably no longer true, because the world has changed so much. Good audiobook production though."
52,0465090796,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7612524-betsy,2,I just couldn't finish this one... there are some ok parts but I recommend skipping around to chapters you are interested in. 
53,0465090796,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5785731-zach,4,Fun about about the lil things in life. Super easy read. Some stuff you've probably seen before but overall a nice easy book
54,0465090796,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14021854-monica,4,Interesting however some conclusions of experiments seemed to be an opinion rather than confirmed by the results. 
55,0465090796,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71145875-juanxo-ram,4,"Amazing discovery on heterodox psychology, based on a lifetime of experiments.Worth the read if you are interested in how people lie, how people smile, or how people believe in things..."
56,0465090796,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31173493-francis-shaw,4,"A fun read that covers the strangeness of us humans. How our odd responses reinforce, that facts about us are indeed stranger than fiction! "
57,0465090796,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53715229-ionu-b-jescu,4,"Not bad although many of the ""quirks"" are very trivial."
58,0465090796,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52278616-satya-kalyanpur,5,"Absolute fun read! How fickle is our mind, what dictates the decisions we take, and how easy it is to deviate, manipulate other's choices. Wise read!"
