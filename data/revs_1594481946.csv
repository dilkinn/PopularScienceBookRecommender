0,1594481946,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1036930-michael,3,"Despite the critical readers on here giving this book one star for not, you know, being RELIABLE, I'm going with four. I'm rating it based on what I usually rate books on: entertainment value. That said, the logic here is severely shitty. Thesis: modern films, television, and other technologies are more complex than they used to be. People nowadays have slightly higher IQs on average than they used to have. Therefore, modern media is making people smarter. This is flawed in too many ways to name, but I'm gonna give it a shot: first of all, I don't think ""Transformers 2"" or ""Harry Potter 6"" are really that much more complex than ""Alien"" or ""Taxi Driver,"" thankya very much. Movies now, as I notice every fucking time I go to one, FUCKING SUCK THESE DAYS. Have y'all seen ""Repo Men""? Television, if we just look at shows like ""The West Wing,"" ""House,"" ""Lost,"" and ""The Sopranos,"" looks like a pretty thoughtful terrain. But we can't forget about ""2 and a Half Men,"" ""The Flava of Love,"" and ""The Bachelor."" Television has more stations now, so the variety is a lot greater than it was back in the days of ""Green Acres,"" but most of it's still pretty stupid. And other technologies? Well, there's this website, which pretty much proves the web is frickin' awesome. But, you know, there's also this: . The web is a pretty mixed bag. We have greater ACCESS to knowledge through the web, but I don't think that proves the average man in Pennsylvania actually uses it for anything but finding videos of midget sex or watching goofy videos on YouTube. (No offense to PA; that was a totally random state.) Those are my qualms with the first of the three sentences of his thesis. Let me sum up for the rest: The IQ test is fallible and culturally biased, and even if sentence 1 and 2 were sufficiently proven, the third sentence wouldn't hold true, because correlation doesn't prove causation. Why would we not assume that, as people naturally get smarter through evolution or eating their Wheaties, they will start wanting more complex forms of entertainment? Why is entertainment the cause, not the effect? Okay, done ranting about the logical suckiness at work here. THIS BOOK WAS FUN! His arguments were outlandish and creative, and I would love to think that by watching ""The West Wing"" I'm strengthening my synapses. I'd also love to think that my time playing ""Grand Theft Auto"" was me challenging myself with a difficult game. I personally thought I was just running around and shooting people with flamethrowers. The coolest thing was when you were such a menace that the army tanks started coming after you! Did anybody actually play that game the way they were supposed to? And is ""The Legend of Zelda"" any more challenging than playing poker, or Dungeons and Dragons? D&D go back a long way, and poker a looooooong way. So, no. Homeboy doesn't know what the shit he is saying. Read this for some nonfiction entertainment, when you want some trash but don't feel like reading something about vampires or killer crabs. "
1,1594481946,http://goodreads.com/user/show/361207-arlynda,1,"This book is so poorly written that I don't know where to begin. By the end of the introduction, Steven Johnson has already told us that he doesn't care about morals, and apparently neither should we. Well, I do. Knowledge with out serious thought about the implications of misuse of such knowledge is worse than ignorance. I think that nuclear technology is amazing, but I don't think that we should make bombs out of it and use them. Morals helps us to decide how to use technology. I think that a discussion of morals is very important to assessing any impact of technology on a society. I would tend to think that the ""increase"" in the IQ of the general population has more to do with the fact that more of us are more educated. My grandma dropped out of school in eighth grade, my grandpa wouldn't have been considered functionally literate. A story like that is not as common as it use to be. More of the population can read, more of the population learns about history, more people learn about science. We are more well educated. Also, I have a BS in physics. The physics that I was learning as an undergraduate is what people were writing PhD dissertations about and spent their whole lives studying in the early 1900's. So, one could argue that as an undergraduate in physics I knew more physics than did those making amazing discoveries at the beginning of the 20th century. That is what an IQ type test would tell you. I don't think it has anything to do with video games and TV, I think it has to do with the increase in the breadth and depth of education in our society.Don't read it, it is a waste of time. Find a good novel, there are a bunch on my list, curl up and feel like you haven't wasted time in your life."
2,1594481946,http://goodreads.com/user/show/207548-greg,2,"Correlation and causation; there's a difference, and the author doesn't understand it. A sensational thesis opens the discussion: those once-dismissed hours spent playing video games watching reality TV are actually making you smarter! Sounds too good to be true, right? That depends if you buy the author's argument: the average IQ has continued to rise over the past 30 years due to more intellectually demanding media, i.e., more complex video games, film, and television. Sadly, the author's case fumbles through specious argumentation and an embarrassment non sequiters. To wit, he boldly asserts the Lord of the Rings film trilogy to be more intellectually stimulating than the original Star Wars series. Why? Because there are more characters. That's it. That's the argument. Aside from Lucas himself citing Tolkien's trilogy as an inspiration for Star Wars, the character count should hardly be thought to represents a film's intellectual bent. Alas, this is the type of evidence you can expect. Speaking of evidence, the citations annoy the hell out of me. As in, there aren't any. Not one. There are a few occasional notes in the back referencing a specific resource for a certain page, but these rarely cite statistical, scientific studies or sound evidence, and no footnotes indicate their inclusion (so you never know when to flip back while reading). And this is the failing point of the book - information stated as fact lacks any statistical backing. It makes me wonder if the poor citation format was intentional since the book's scholarship rests on nothing sturdier than conjecture.To be honest, this reads like an undergraduate paper looking for those 1000 extra filler words. Read it for fun, or entertainment, or whatever-- it's not all bad, and he makes a few clever insights into our shifting media ingestion. But for the love of Durkheim, don't consider it science. "
3,1594481946,http://goodreads.com/user/show/108138-trivialchemy,1,"This book makes the following its central thesis:Because popular media (TV, video games, movies, etc.) are becoming more complex, and requiring more cognitive work to process them, they are making us smarter. This is the so-called ""sleeper curve.""The logic of this argument is identical to the claim, ""market heroin is steadily growing in purity, therefore heroin is good for us."" HOW DOES ANYONE BELIEVE THIS RUBBISH? It wouldn't have anything to do with the fact that its target audience consists of vapid-headed slobs sucking down oreos and 4 hours a day of Joe Millionaire with their globulous buttocks quivering inside their couch cushions, desperate for someone to affirm the worth of their pitiful, mediacentric existence, now would it? See Ryan's review from 06/04 for some suggestions on why Johnson is an incompetent sociologist as well. If you gave this book more than 1 star, you are an unembarrassed dolt."
4,1594481946,http://goodreads.com/user/show/107003-ryan,1,"i wanted to throw this book against a wall, many, many times while reading it. my main problem with the book is the lack of data to support the hypothesis that johnson argues. if it were simply a polemic arguing that media has become more complex, and that complexity warrants closer inspection and not dismissal, i'd forgive it.however, johnson begins the book by admitting that he isn't a scientist and then goes on to try to support his claims with scientific data. i'm not a scientist either, but trying to correlate the general trend of rising IQs over the past fifty years to the growing complexity of media is absurd. he notes that improved education and nutrition could also be responsible for this trend, but he still uses the trend in an anecdotal way to support his hypothesis."
5,1594481946,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11269813-kai-schreiber,5,"A refreshing thesis and a convincingly told story, paired with a healthy dose of cultural and psychological optimism. This would ordinarily have gotten four stars from me, but I give it five to cancel the silly deluge of very bad reviews based on sciencey catchphrasing and moral bias.Yes, ""correlation is not causation"", thanks for the clich√©, but Johnson doesn't really claim to have good evidence. In fact, he says quite clearly that he could have made the argument, as his evil twins on the other side have done repeatedly, purely ad hoc and without any data to back it at all, but chose not to in order to encourage research being started. And I wholeheartedly agree that too little is done to counter the insulting arguments cropping up every time somebody does something bad and has played a computer game before doing it.Of course it is entirely possible, likely even, that the Flynn effect of rising average IQs is caused by a number of other things, and that the complexity of entertainment has risen along with the rising demand of audience brains for quality input. But Johnson has compelling arguments for technological changes causing more complex content (mainly the repeatability mechanism in all its forms), and repeated exposure to challenging content trains cognition. Evidence or no, this is hard to dismiss.But the most important contribution, I feel, is the shift of perspective, viewing popular culture not as a poison, but as something worthy of study, an under appreciated form of cultural expression, and wholly inadequate straw man for the need for condescension some cultural factions seem to feel."
6,1594481946,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25276499-lexxi-kitty,1,"I do not specifically recall why I felt this way, but I've a vague recollection that this book was both stupid, tedious, and annoying to get through."
7,1594481946,http://goodreads.com/user/show/369209-michael,4,"In Everything Bad is Good for You, Johnson attempts to de-bunk the popular narrative that the culture industry is making us stupider, by feeding us more and more banal television shows, video games, and movies. He argues for understanding a Sleeper Curve in popular culture that is actually making texts more complicated over time. That is, many video games, television shows, Internet sites, and movies are making us smarter by challenging out mental faculties: we have to make more mental and social connections, these texts leave out information that we have to figure out, and they rely on delayed gratification, and we have to figure out the rules of the game/text because they aren't told to us explicitly. Johnson shows that IQ tests scores have been improving over the last few decades, and while it's problematic to compare IQ tests across cultures, races, and locations (because the tests probably are biased), it's not as problematic to compare them across generations. (He readily admits that IQ tests don't actually test all of our mental capacities, but rather serve as an indicator that at least gives us some data.)I think Johnson provides some pretty good nuance to his book and gives some pretty strong evidence for his case. A lot of the first half of the book reads like James Paul Gee's What Video Games Can Teach Us about Learning and Literacy, though without the methodological explanation and some of the depth. Additionally, Johnson is clear to explain that he's not advocating quitting reading books, and that books do provide a kind of intellectual work unique to them. He's less likely to see declined book reading as a threat to culture, because he notes that all sorts of activities are in decline (television viewing, movie going, etc.). Also, he's not advocating playing video games 24/7, and he cautions that his book is not about the effects of texts' contents (e.g., violence, sexism, etc.). He argues that ""[t]he work of the critic, in this instance, is to diagram those forces [neurological appetites, economics of culture industry, changing technological platforms], not decode them"" (10). Overall, this is a pretty good read and makes a convincing case. I am inclined to agree with him, though I do wonder more about the economic effects of all of this, and who benefits and who is left out of his narrative. Johnson, defending himself against critiques of his book that he is supporting capitalism, notes that some of the effects of gaming culture have been to question capitalist notions of private property, and also states that he sees himself as ""much more of a technological determinist than an economic determinist."" He doesn't want to ask ""What is capitalism doing to our minds? Rather, the question is: What is the reigning technological paradigm ‚Äî combined with both market and public-sector forces ‚Äî doing to our minds?"" (205). While I don't see myself as much of a determinist, I do think there is much to be said of the economic consequences (who is getting rich, and who is ""feeding"" those that get rich). Additionally, what does it much matter if we are getting cognitively smarter when most those energies are focused on perpetuating a capitalist system? Okay, that's cynical. It matters. But, from my vantage point, systems analysis needs to be coupled with an imagination for what's outside the system: what other worlds are possible, and how can they be achieved? Perhaps this is best left to follow up work to Johnson's text."
8,1594481946,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1429082-daniel-solera,2,"Ironically, this was a difficult read. Not because the theme is hard to digest, or because Johnson's diction is criminally elevated (neither of those are true), but because I couldn't really decide whether I believed him.The crux of Johnson's argument relies on the increasing complexity with which our popular culture is deliberately built, a complexity which forces its audience to multi-task, follow and understand multiple narrative threads, all the while developing advanced cognitive abilities and therefore becoming ‚Äúsmarter‚Äù. He then goes on to describe the high-level thinking required of modern video games, movies, television shows and the internet.I agree with him on only one of four claims.It's no secret that I love video games, so forgive the bias. Because of rapid technological advances, many of the newest video games play cinematically, feature engrossing characters, convoluted storylines and play right into Johnson‚Äôs argument. He frequently cites Grand Theft Auto and popular simulation-based games like Civilization and the cultural phenomenon The Sims as landmark games that challenge the intellect much more than PacMan. In these cases, I agree. These multifaceted games are possible because of technological innovation, and required with these improvements are players who can handle tasks of greater difficulty. As a footnote, it is a mystery why Johnson overlooked Myst, an inarguably difficult experience and once the all-time bestselling computer game as an example.But when it comes to movies and television shows, I don‚Äôt buy it. Although both mediums have benefited from technology and increased budgets, saying that newer movies are more complicated than older movies is a stretch and Johnson definitely cherry-picks his examples. He compares ‚ÄúBambi‚Äù to ‚ÄúFinding Nemo‚Äù as an example of this progression, citing that you have to follow the lives of twenty characters. Even though it‚Äôs one of my all-time favorite movies, you can process the majority of ‚ÄúFinding Nemo‚Äù by following Marlin, Dory and Nemo. He even cites the Lord of the Rings trilogy, which is based on books that were written sixty years ago. To say that modern films are more complex today than they were in decades past is an obviously visual one, not one at all based on narrative technique. But that‚Äôs just me.Finally, the most criminal case he makes is that of the internet. Like his modus operandi for the previous three arenas, Johnson picks only the true virtues of the internet to illustrate his point, and conveniently avoids the intellectual perils of Twitter, Facebook, MySpace, etc. He also reassures us that though we are reading fewer books, we are ‚Äúspend[ing:] much of [our:] day staring at words on a screen: browsing the Web, reading e-mail, chatting with friends, posting a new entry to ‚Ä¶ 8 million blogs‚Äù (183). Because nothing increases our intelligence like reading amateurish articles devoid of any proofreading. This is the kind of apologetic ass-covering that plagues this book from start to finish.In short, no, I don‚Äôt think reality television promotes high-level thinking, movies today are no less compelling and layered than they were forty years ago, and reading blogs over published works by reputable authors doesn‚Äôt make you a smarter person. Sure, you can make an argument for each of those if you pick and choose, but all in all, I‚Äôm not sold."
9,1594481946,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1241339-clif,2,"This little book might be considered a tiny landmark, no let's call it a bookmark in the history of Western man.Time was just about everything that brought pleasure in this world was said to be bad by authority (the church). Even such harmless things as dancing or getting a little rowdy with too much wine could bring on guilt. One dared not speak of sex! Going to confession to escape guilt was a very common activity in the hope of forgiveness. Agreement was general that only the next world was a good place while this one was laced with traps set by the devil to take a good soul off the straight and narrow path to salvation in the afterlife.Thank goodness we've left that time behind. And have we ever! Entertainment is now everywhere in a multitude of forms all very enticing leaving a person in a fix about how to spend time. There are critics of popular culture, but they are ignored by a populace that spends billions on everything from video games to movies to cable TV. Fun is the word of the day and would anyone even think of feeling bad about too much entertainment?There must be a few else who would be interested in this little book that seeks to soothe anyone who feels a tad guilty for pursing leisurely things. We live in Disneyworld now where restraints are gone and those importuning us to have more fun (for a fee) are smiling at us from all sides.Back in those long gone times of oppressive moral guilt, an author would have appealed to some aspect of religion to soothe it. It might be written that Jesus enjoyed a glass of wine from time to time and that he was all about forgiveness. There'd have to be a moral slant, that you are a better person because of the little pleasures you enjoy now and then.But these days, science is all and unless one can make some kind of hypothesis about real facts that can be tested and evaluated, there'd be no credibility.Steven Johnson takes up this challenge, attempting to show that our brains are improved by all the TV watching, the video-gaming, the movie going that we do. Sit on the couch watching Naked and Afraid or bend over the Xbox controller with Red Dead Redemption II and you're beefing up your brain without even realizing it! He cautions that you shouldn't spend your life playing Final Fantasy or watching reruns of The Simpsons, just as the ancient Greeks said, everything in moderation, nothing to excess. Point taken.The book isn't long, but it does take patience to wade through the examples he gives of scenes from West Wing or Hill Street Blues that he believes challenge our thinking processes. I Love Lucy was just plain silly compared to the deep plots and complicated action we now follow. While we've been enjoying the ride all along, these shows are pulling us on to ever greater mental ability as they get more complicated. He's eager to report that IQ scores have been steadily improving, surely our immersion in popular culture has been responsible, no? It's just not right to claim we've been dumbed down.I've spent some time reporting on a book I give only two stars. I do so because he ignores glaring problems with immersion in entertainment that dwarf the supposed mental improvement that comes from media stimulation.If you do anything other than stare at a wall, you are going to get better at it and the parts of your brain involved with what you do will develop. Whether this is meaningful and can be transferred to other things you do is open to question. I'm sure you've seen the drawings of the brain that show the size of the different parts in proportion to the work they do. The tongue and lips get lots of territory because we use them so intensively. These days, the neural territory claimed by the thumb must be growing daily due to smartphone use! I ride a bicycle, often after dark when I might just be out for a ride or possibly going for groceries. It's scary. Not because I'm afraid of the dark but because I pass house after house where there is a huge flat screen flashing pretty colors. I know that in front of all those screens are people, each possessing the most amazing mental organ known, passively watching what is presented to them, something which they have voluntarily turned on to the exclusion of all the other things they could be doing. House after house after house. Why not, aren't there hundreds of channels, DVD's, streaming services? Steven Johnson tells us they are all improving their minds without thinking, I would say probably many of them are seeking not to think as they watch after a day's work. Surely they are thinking less than if they were working on a project in the basement. Thinking less than if they took a walk around the block, where they might meet a neighbor if TV news hadn't convinced everyone that sidewalks at night are dangerous. Thinking less than if they were conversing with each other about the need to do something about all the problems pressing in on us, instead of banishing thought watching the endless cornucopia of video that covers more and more of the wall as flat screens get bigger and bigger. Religion may have been an opium of the people but it can't begin to compare with video. Many, way too many Americans are in dire straits, strung out on opioids, deep in debt, fearful of their fellow citizens, afraid of job loss or a medical bill. You'd think they might be out in the streets making a fuss for change, but each night it's back on the couch with remote in hand. That's a terrible misuse of the brain, choosing inaction when action is so needed. Joe Public has little but at least he can watch the rich, beautiful and famous in full color and accept what he is told that has no bearing on his neighborhood as ""the news.""I play video games. They're fun. They may be building my hand-eye coordination and I am sure I am getting better with my Xbox controller. I travel in fantastic realms, the scenery is breathtaking in The Witcher 3 to the extent that I sometimes stop killing things and just enjoy looking around at beautiful fields of flowers waving in the virtual breeze backed by towering snow capped mountains (while the real world is imperiled). Dialog and characters really are getting more interesting. The magical power I have at my fingertips is AWESOME! But it's all make believe and I'm learning about pointless things. My intense curiosity won't settle for it. I want real world knowledge, I seek wisdom that can never be imparted by fantasies in which one can never die, one can never lose (just start again and again until you succeed or check the Internet) and where one can get bored, yes that terrible thing that once was always ready to strike but can now be kept forever at bay by endless distraction, endless amusement that requires zero mental investment, even if parts of the brain are stimulated.Don't bother with this book. Instead, take up drawing, take up hiking, take up public speaking, teach yourself fully about just one single major issue that faces us so you can speak about it with knowledge rather than empty opinion. Entertainment is fine but it isn't life and it is a tremendous time killer with psychological research, viewer studies and high tech advances directed toward luring you in.If you feel a bit guilty for indulging in all the things that are offered you at great reward to those offering it, you should. Be the fish that has misgivings about the bait. Hold the fabulous world of popular culture at a distance when it sits right in your living room, an insidious kaleidoscope, the opposite of a stimulant to the intellect, dangerous to your mind for offering vicarious action to passivity, something Steven Johnson all but brushes aside."
10,1594481946,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39595324-jay-green,5,"Much of what I love about this book is its polemicising effect on readers that helps me to distinguish the culture snobs from the rest of us - particularly helpful because culture snobs tend to be snobs not just culturally but also socially. There isn't much new in Johnson's work that can't be found in Flynn's examination of the rise in IQ and various structuralist literary and cultural analyses, but it's nice to see the argument being made outside of sociology and cultural studies that the distinction between high and low culture is a socially constructed sham. You don't need to be a Bourdieuvian to recognise the way cultural choices are made by individuals as a way of distinguishing themselves from their peers rather than on the basis of intrinsic merits, and indeed, Johnson isn't anything close to a Bourdieuvian, but he does provide a mainstream version (I say that deliberately, rather than 'dumbed down') of an argument that is well supported in the academic literature. "
11,1594481946,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3278283-ed-wagemann,1,"If everything bad is actually good for you, like the title of Steve Johnson‚Äôs study of pop culture suggests, then his book must be the best thing since penicillin. In attempting to make the argument that pop culture is actually making mankind smarter, Johnson is guilty of huge lapses in logic which stems from a very limited view of reality that pretty much totally misses the point on almost every level. Even the one tool of pop culture that actually is improving mankind, that being the internet (since the internet has obviously evolved into one of the most important sources of information and communication in modernized civilization), Johnson‚Äôs off-base argument is that the Internet‚Äôs value comes from its ability to allow fans of pop TV shows to gossip about the fictional characters and plots in their favorite the shows. What he doesn‚Äôt explain‚Äîprobably since it isn‚Äôt true‚Äîis how gossiping on a Desperate Housewives website better is for you than actually talking to a live person about real things happening in your real life.Throughout his book Johnson continues to grasp for straws as he reaches one bizarre, unscientific conclusion after another in his attempts to legitimize all the time he has wasted in his life watching sitcom/melodrama TV and playing fantasy games on the computer. One such bizarre conclusion Johnson reaches is that ‚Äúmost‚Äù video games do to the ‚Äúreward‚Äù circuitry of the brain what the game Tetris does to one‚Äôs visual circuitry. Never mind that he can‚Äôt cite any scientific proof for this, most likely since this claim is in fact a totally unfounded conclusion. Johnson rationalizes that the time, energy and money he has wasted during his life on playing video games is making him more evolved by arguing that millions of other people have wasted just as much of their time on these same video games. So it must be good for you right? That‚Äôs the kind of pedestrian logic that Johnson‚Äôs book is littered with. This is bad stuff, but Johnson compounds his illogical conclusions with a bad habit of making annoyingly off-base generalizations. He says things like people don‚Äôt ‚Äúexplore‚Äù movies or music in anything but the most figurative way. That‚Äôs obviously false. Even the village idiot knows that movies and music have many layers (in which the more you learn about, the better you can experience them in various ways). So less than 60 pages into his book it became obvious that Johnson is an ignamaroon. His main problem is that his view of the world is limited strictly to the world of pop culture. He seems to think the entire world watches as much TV as he does, plays as many video games as he does, and spends all the rest of their time sitting in front of a computer screen gossiping with others about the latest Survivor episode. And although there are certainly millions of Americans that do spend hours in their parents basement hypnotized by the intricacies of fantasy video game worlds, and millions who have closer relationships to fictional TV characters than they do with real humans, Johnson offers no statistics as to how many or to what extent, and he certainly doesn‚Äôt explain how all of this is bettering mankind. He just assumes that everybody is like him, totally ignoring (or perhaps he doesn‚Äôt realize the fact) that many people simply use video games, TV and movies as diversions from their daily lives for a few hours of entertainment here and there, not as the sole tool for giving their life a purpose. I guess what I found most offensive about Johnson‚Äôs book was his attempt to promote being obsessed with pop culture as being for the betterment of mankind. To me there is no benefit to society in having a worldview that is limited in scope to nothing but pop culture. In fact it makes me wonder how those who are seeing the world from such a limited view are interacting with the real world and affecting it at all. From reading Johnson‚Äôs book it wouldn‚Äôt surprise me in the least if Johnson (and those others with the limited perspective of a pop culture junky) would rather have someone who was a champion player at Sims 2000 become mayor of his city over someone with real world city council experience who has dealt with the complexities of community politics. It also wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if they would rather have a champion Nintendo player managing their favorite baseball team over someone who was an actual former big leaguer. And who, I wonder would they want as the top policy makers of America‚Äôs Department of Defense, a hotshot whiz at Dungeon and Dragons and Command and Conquer or someone who had military experience in real world conflicts? The point I‚Äôm trying to make here is that while the couch potatoes that make up the population in Johnson‚Äôs world are doing amazing things on a video game or coming up with incredible insights to reality TV show strategies, it is the people who are actually living in the real world who are putting their stamp on reality. Obviously video games cause you to make decisions while playing, but so does taking a walk, so does hiking or biking or rock climbing or going to a library or music store or a job interview. The difference of course is that in real life your decisions have real life consequences, consequences that actually matter. In video games they don‚Äôt. In video games you can start over, you can use ‚Äòcheats‚Äô, you can be killed and come back to life.  Johnson doesn‚Äôt seem to get this. In fact he compares playing video games to studying Algebra. And although mastering algebra may not give the average person skills that they use every single day in real life, Johnson doesn‚Äôt site even one skill that is learned from playing a video game that is going to help the average person in real life. Johnson‚Äôs main argument is that video games cause the player to ‚Äòprobe‚Äô and ‚Äòtelescope‚Äô yet he doesn‚Äôt explain how these two skills have any relation to real life. Without any scientific research on the subject, it seems pretty obvious that skills you learn playing a video game are not likely going to be skills that will help you in real life, and one reason for that is that in video games the possibilities of what you can do are all limited to the confines of the game. In real life hobbies like biking or taking roadtrips, even collecting baseball cards, you can make up any rules and values you want. You determine the goals instead of having some fabricated limitations assigned to your ‚Äòcharacter‚Äô. I do however concede that the Internet is a good tool for mankind, although Johnson‚Äôs case for it is way off base. I also see how video games can be of some minimal benefit, beyond just entertainment. But by far the weakest of Johnson‚Äôs many weak arguments is that pop culture is making mankind smarter because TV show narratives have become more complex and that their characters have become more complex. That‚Äôs probably true if you are comparing them to TV characters of 30 years ago, then yes, perhaps they are more complex. But compared to real people, or even compared to literary characters, or film characters then no, they are not more complex. In fact most of what I‚Äôve seen on TV is rehashed and repackaged bits, plots and characters from older foreign films, off-Broadway theatre and radio programs of yesteryear. Again Johnson doesn‚Äôt seem to get this. In fact at one point in his book Johnson goes on and on for several pages, making a total fool of himself by blubbering on about what a cutting edge and original technique is employed in Sienfeld by something that is nothing more than a simple running gag. In this case the running gag is that the character George Costanza uses a false name (Art Van Delay) to try to impress people. Even though similar running gags go back to the beginnings of performance, Johnson treats it as if it‚Äôs the most original and creative thing since sliced bread. Yet he offers no explanation at how this running gag is any more creative than Jack Benny‚Äôs ‚Äòtightwad‚Äô jokes or Mr. Ropers ‚Äòturn to the camera and grin‚Äô bit that was worked into several Three‚Äôs Company episodes.Still, this doesn‚Äôt prevent Johnson from concluding that these more complex TV characters and narratives are turning all of mankind into this super insightful observer that can read emotions, intentions and motives better than someone who doesn‚Äôt watch TV shows. And the ridiculous thing about Johnson‚Äôs limited thinking is that if people really are learning their life lessons from so-called ‚Äúcomplex‚Äù TV characters and content, and if they are really operating under the false notion that being an expert on what strategies Reality show characters should use, or what plot twist the Sopranos is going to take, makes them an expert on real life issues, then they are going to make some terrible decisions in real life. I‚Äôm talking ‚Äúvoting for George W.

Sept 2010 update below.
Excellent book. Not a convincing argument, but a very refreshing and provocative contrarian perspective.Johnson provides evidence that much of our mass entertainment, even the stuff we often shudder at, is gradually pushing the IQs of its consumers steadily up. He focuses our attention on aspects of television -- including reality TV!, video games, and much else in this effort.Two things are crucial to note, though.First, Johnson‚Äôs title and subtitle (‚ÄùHow Today‚Äôs Popular Culture is Actually Making Us Smarter‚Äù) are deeply ambiguous, since ‚ÄùSmarter‚Äù and ‚ÄùGood for You‚Äù are extremely subjective concepts. He really shouldn‚Äôt have used such loaded terms, and doesn‚Äôt go anywhere near far enough to explain and narrow his objective. His text only does an excellent job at arguing that many aspects of modern culture are making humans better at solving certain kinds of puzzles, and better at thinking about complex situations.He provides fairly persuasive evidence that consumers of 
mass
 media can now understand and enjoy entertainment that would be bewilderingly too complex for the masses just a few decades ago. He provides broad evidence for this, but most convincingly in television and video games. The reason behind this is quite astonishing: in order to keep voracious audiences coming back for more, producers have to ‚Äùkeep it fresh‚Äù, adding something interesting and new to the mix with each iteration. One way of doing that is to tease the brain with subtlety and complexity, and thus we are in effect trained over the decades in understanding and even enjoying this complexity. [The quest for novelty has also long been seen as a reason for the inexorable spread of sexuality and violence in media, although I don‚Äôt recall Johnson exploring this sidebar.:]But Johnson doesn‚Äôt really argue that this makes anyone more moral, or happier, or that it makes society better, or even that a complex show is in any other sense qualitatively better than a simpler show.This is related to the second point: Johnson‚Äôs argument should be taken as descriptive, not prescriptive. This is something that many readers seem to have problems with: many folks automatically assume that anything an author spends a great deal of time and effort elaborating is something that author must approve of. But often -- and I believe this book is a good example -- the intent instead is to explore a fascinating topic and to illuminate it to a broader audience for pondering.Johnson doesn‚Äôt do a very good job at explaining this, which is a shame. We spend so much time agreeing with ourselves that mass entertainment is corrosive that the contrarian point of view becomes almost shameful. And even after reading this book, it is easy to still conclude that popular media is destructive, but due to the morality of its content. It is possible that McLuhan was wrong, or at least that the story is more complicated than we‚Äôd previously believed.And frankly, that‚Äôs good. Even though I haven‚Äôt watched more than an hour or so of television per year for about a decade now, I do appreciate the increasing complexity of stories offered up in Western culture. And the story of technology‚Äôs impact on humanity is, itself, a tale that becomes more delightfully engrossing as it becomes more curious and twisted.‚ÄÉ ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄÉ ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄÉ ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄÉ ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄÉ ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄÉ ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄÉ ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄÉ ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄÉ ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄÉ ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄÉ ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄÉ ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄÉ ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄÉ ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄÉ ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄÉ ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄÉ ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄÉ ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄÉ ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄÉ ‚Ä¢ The Economist has an article and opinion piece that provide yet more evidence of this book‚Äôs message.

Three cheers for that. The book is quick and succinct, an easy but thoughtful and though-provoking read.Johnson argues that over the last three decades, popular culture has become more complex, sophisticated and challenging, in spite of everybody's eagerness to dub it ""lowbrow fluff."" That is, for all the crap they get, programs on ""the idiot box"" and ""those damn video games"" are actually more of a brain workout than most critics are willing to give them credit for...I like some of his arguments (which are too in-depth and numerous to summarize here), although there are times when the logic gets a bit patchy and I just don't buy it. That said, I can't wait to tell Mom and Dad that all those years of sitting at the computer, eyes glazed, playing Commander Keen Episode IV: Aliens Ate My Babysitter would actually improve my set of problem-solving skills and exercise areas of my brain I didn't even know I had.Time to go see what's on TV."
14,1594481946,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1072582-kaethe-douglas,1,"""bogus""(you can hear the Bill & Ted in my voice, right?)Johnson's idea is that the entertainment that everyone else says is bad for you really isn't, it's really good for you. Because IQs are steadily rising over time. It must be crappy TV and video games.Yeah, that's pretty much the quality of the logic. me, I'm inclined to believe that the entertainment some says is bad for you isn't any worse for you than anything else, and neither highbrow art (Mozart for brilliant babies?) nor lowbrow video games is inherently superior. But that's just me and my unwillingness to believe that correlation equals causation."
15,1594481946,http://goodreads.com/user/show/792329-amanda,3,"This book would have been 4 stars as it is really interesting and puts science behind theories that I've held for a while (i.e. that video games are good for your brain), but gets downgraded to 3 stars for poor editing, being repetitive, not having enough science, and for being dated. Those last two aren't really the book's fault though, I don't think at the time, they were looking into the sorts of claims that the author makes.My favorite passage is one where he describes a theoretical land where video games were invented before books, and the outcry that would arise if books became popular.Books are tragically isolating. While games have for may years engaged the young in complex social relationships with their peers... books force the child to sequester him or herself in a quiet space, shut off from interaction with other children.... [These books] risk instilling a general passivity in our children, making them feel as though they're powerless to change their circumstances. Reading is not an active, participatory process; it's a submissive one. the book readers of the younger generation are learning to ""follow the plot"" instead of learning to lead.""Since reading this, I took back up playing the last Zelda, because, you know, it's good for my brain."
16,1594481946,http://goodreads.com/user/show/757838-lyn,2,"Okay, my book club read this several months ago, but I didn't read it (couldn't get my hands on a copy before book club). The author had me convinced of his arguments until the last 15-20 pages. I can ""buy"" that pop culture has gotten more complex... I can ""buy"" that the average person today is smarter than the average person 100 years ago. What I can't buy is that content doesn't matter. You can throw statistics at me all day long, but I just don't believe that our sense of values and ethics are not influenced by the media that we take in. I also think that he glosses over the addictive nature of the types of media he is arguing for... yes, he says that it is ""part"" of the whole diet, BUT, I think he significantly undersells how much of the media we take in."

18,1594481946,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1045774-mehrsa,3,"I think if the author would have stuck to his narrow thesis, this book could have been a tight and convincing argument, but he unjustifiably broadens it and weakens his argument. The narrow thesis, ""the sleeper curve"" argues that popular culture has gotten slowly smarter. TV shows give us less clues, demand more of our attention, and ask us to remember things from prior episodes, seasons, and even to incorporate popular events. Video games have become much more complex and demanding and engage the player in many long-range and short-range tasks that require planning, foresight and disciplined focus. All of this is fine and it actually gave reason to why I often prefer modern ""classics"" to ""cannonized"" classics: cultural IQ has slowly increased and writers today are smarter and thus their texts are much more nuances and complex and demand much more from the reader without offering clues that insult the intelligence. I have often been put off by an older classic because of obvious plot lines or cliches without realizing that those are clues that the author was throwing out and we, the modern readers, no longer need them. Where the author goes wrong is in suggesting that some of these forms of entertainment can be compared to or are even better than reading (he suggests this and then backs away from fully saying it) or other forms of engagement that conventional wisdom says are better for you. I can't be convinced of that. While playing video games and watching TV now will make you smarter than those activities did 30 years ago, they still do not compare to engaging in complex social experiences (playing with friends), free play in nature (READ: Last Child in the Woods for this argument), or reading. In addition, the author spends less than two pages dealing with the criticism that morals have anything to do with it. If you ignore this, the book is essentially beating a straw man. Not many people criticize pop culture because they say it has gotten dumber, but more violent and more sexually explicit or morally ambiguous. And the author concedes this, but says that it is irrelevant. Kids are smarter today and they will learn their morals from home anyway so no need to worry that they are seeing, participating, and becoming desensitized to dramatically more sex and violence. He even notes in a parenthetical towards the end of the book that perhaps this involvement in violence in the visual world has served as an outlet for violence, causing decreased violence in real life. What I know about vice and addiction, however, makes me dismiss this unsupported argument as ridiculous (at best). It is unclear whether smartness or the ability to adapt to new media and manage complex situations (all of which has been gained in the last 10 years by youth engaged in popular culture) will result in societal gains or whether it will just present itself in higher IQ results will soon be seen. I am just not sure that what is lost when you spend time in a visually distorted world as opposed to the real one is less than what is gained. I am no puritan, however, and I really did appreciate the (narrow) thesis. I like the idea of lean-forward entertainment as opposed to the lean-back entertainment of the past. When I watch LOST, I often have to wait until the commercial break to breath or loosen the tension in my shoulders. I often spend time reading reviews online afterwards trying to decipher all the clues. I appreciate that level of entertainment and I appreciate that the market rewards that now. Still, I am not sure I am comfortable with my children watching ""complex"" cartoons as opposed to reading any kind of book "

20,1594481946,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7074096-shane-moore,5,"Before I read this book, I believed modern entertainment was progressively getting dumber, catering more and more to the lowest common denominator. Now, I have been convinced otherwise. Even the worst dreck of modern TV is in many ways more complex and intellectually demanding than comparable programs from earlier times.Does this mean books will soon go extinct, to be replaced by superior modern media?Mr. Johnson writes, ""No cultural form in history has rivaled the novelÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩs capacity to re-create the mental landscape of another consciousness, to project you into the first person experience of other human beings. Movies and theater can make you feel as though youÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩre part of the action, but the novel gives you an inner vista that is unparalleled: you are granted access not just to the events of another humanÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩs life, but to the precise way those events settle in his or her consciousness.""In this statement he sums up precisely what I love about fiction. Authors distill the best parts of their imagination and then translate that distillate into words. Impossibly, I inhabit and assimilate their imagined lives.Other people have written about the benefits of literacy, social interaction, exercise, and sports. Maybe I'm too fond of contrarianism, but I loved reading arguments for the benefits of junk entertainment."
21,1594481946,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13059813-andrew-miller,5,"The book has a simple and counterintuitive message: playing video games makes you smarter.Of course I'm going to like a book like this! If only I can somehow convince my wife that the hundreds of hours ""wasted"" on video games is actually time spent making me a better person. Johnson's book argues that video games instill within players the skills required to think critically and analyze complex relationships. For example, SimCity teaches players the delicate balance of taxes, industry, and government to create an urban utopia, rather than wasting the player's time. While the media is often critical of games as the dumbing down of society, these games have rather improved society.My only reservation with his argument is with games such as The Sims or Second Life. While these games create rituals and culture, they do create a community that lacks, in the words of Sherry Turkle, real consequences. A child can learn social skills and develop connections, but in the world of video games these connections are increasingly isolating. Therefore, we need to be cautious that these communities do not withdraw us from the valuable relationships we need."
22,1594481946,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34589414-samuel,4,"Upon beginning reading this book, I just picked it up and started reading, it had a cool lookin' cover so I decided why not? After getting through the prologue and all of the other opening ""junk"", I found myself oddly compelled to learn more because my views were not only being challenged, but proved wrong, and in just a few (rather long but still few) sentences! So I naturally wanted to read more to find out why I could hold to my opinion, but not because I was interested in the book, no, the published author had to be wrong. As I read more of the book I quickly found out that it was indeed true, my thinking wasn't old and outdated, but rather skewed in its perception. Steven Johnson persuades effectively what he set out to do, popular culture ain't so bad. "
23,1594481946,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51223600-lucas-johnston,3,"This book is split into two parts with two distinct but related theses:1. Pop culture is getting more complex2. IQ has been trending upwards because of thisHe defends (1) by comparing television, film and video games to their mid-20th century counterparts. Depending on what particular time slice he chooses there is a question of whether these things are truly popular or mass culture; television and film are more likely to be mass culture regardless of time whereas video games mostly picked up at the turn of the century which is far too close to publication date to produce any meaningful results.There are also concerns of his examples having been cherrypicked - he uses The West Wing and Sopranos as his contemporary examples which, at least in 2019, are not at all indicative of popular culture. I know of only one person who has watched The West Wing (though religiously) and the same for the Sopranos. Shows like The Bachelor(ette) and relatively uncomplex shows seem to dominate the zeitgeist now - complex and non-linear shows such as Sopranos, The Wire, etc. are more of cult classics than pop culture. Even shows that were at one point complex and great - Game of Thrones - when entering into the popular culture rapidly decrease in quality (as seen in the latter two seasons, although this can also be attributed to the inept writers who no longer had source material to simply adapt the show from). Even in the age of streaming, relatively uncomplex shows like The Office, Friends, Trailer Park Boys and Family Guy (all categorized as 'Trending' on Netflix) are immensely popular when compared to more complex shows such as Dark and Black Mirror. Maybe this does nothing to undermine the thesis - the point is rather modest, that pop culture now, compared to pop culture formerly is more complex. This says nothing of the complexity of pop culture compared to its alternatives currently. Is Trailer Park Boys more complex than any show, though? (The same largely goes for film - most pop culture films currently are superhero films or part of a series. While I am a fan of the MCU, I would not call them complex [for the most part], especially if Johnson wants to claim than David Lynch and Tarantino's films were pop culture in the 2000's.)Also ignored (seemingly going right under his nose) is that much of popular culture is not necessarily something actively taken in - more often than not it is done passively. Sure, it is possible to watch television or play video games actively but more often than not it is passive. Television is often barely paid attention to - it often serves just as background noise or even if at the forefront, is not viewed as analytically as necessary to get the most out of the intricacies of shows. Video games, especially at the highest level are essentially mindless - speedrunners have reduced games to muscle memory and use next to no active brainpower when playing, the most popular video games are often 'grinders' i.e. requiring long times to achieve some reward which results in the user essentially turning into an automaton as they perform the same mundane task over and over until they eventually reach some reward (and then they repeat the same process).The second thesis, that IQ is trending upwards because of it, surely correlates if the data is not false, but the case for causation is pretty weak. Johnson thinks that education hasn't improved and so the best explanation is pop culture complexification. However, education probably has improved - knowledge of metacognition and active learning are fairly recent developments and are very beneficial to learning. Teaching methods exist in a sort of reflective equilibrium so even if test scores remain static over time (as difficulty probably varies), general intelligence probably increases as educators realize what does and does not work.Aside from this, IQ tests just generally suck. As he notes, they test only specific forms of intelligence and it just so happens that what he is concerned with are these specific forms. Sure, if we want to only examine spatial reasoning then a population playing more video games that require spatial reasoning may explain these increases. However, there appears no good reason to prefer spatial reasoning or other forms supported by his thesis to those that are neglected by IQ tests and not supported by his pop culture thesis.Lastly, he notes that he thinks video games and television ought to be supplements in one's mental diet, not the entire meal. This ignores that video games and television are often created to be as addictive as possible in order to take as much of the mental diet as possible. After all, in a profit-driven capitalist society, devoted consumers brings about more profit than non-devoted consumers. If pop culture was good for us, it would not cause us to neglect the other important parts of our mental diets. Reading is dramatically more popular in the 65+ crowd (who just happen to also be the least technological), which supports the idea that technology crowds out reading. There is a vast amount of literature on how modern tech is addicting and crowds out other habits and the average user's screen time is out of control which is utterly ignored by Johnson. If we caveat every bad things as Good In Moderation and ignore the difficulties surrounding putting this into practice, we may find ourselves soon suggesting cocaine to combat depressive episodes. Things are not separable from their baggage and Johnson commits a grave sin by suggesting that we can do so with pop culture."
24,1594481946,http://goodreads.com/user/show/180135-ghoti,0,"This book was preaching to the converted and it still managed to annoy me with its inaccuracies.  However, one thing I did get from it was a potential reason why I like tabletop games but mostly don't get on well with computer games. It describes the joy of computer games as largely being rules you have to figure out, and what I love about tabletop games is that there are clearly defined rules to work within. That matches my experience of frustration and boredom, so I'm going to ponder that some more. I wouldn't recommend the book though."
25,1594481946,http://goodreads.com/user/show/661677-elly,2,"Somewhere between 2 and 3 stars. Obviously at this point, this book is quite outdated (part of the issue with my promise to read books on the first couple of pages of my ""to read"" list...). The central premise is that media has become more complex (be it the thought process necessary to beat a video game or character/plot depth knowledge necessary to ""get"" a show) and as a result, our cognitive processes are improving and we are becoming smarter. The problem is there is not much causal research in the book to back this up (which Johnson touches on very briefly in the afterward) and increases in IQ or cognitive development could be attributed to so many other things. So, do I believe media has gotten more complex? Absolutely. You don't need to look further than the fan analyses of Breaking Bad episodes or Netflix original programming or any number of other sources to see that, IMO (a bummer these things didn't exist when the book was written!). Are we smarter because of it? I mean, maybe? It's possible. If you're interested in culture and media studies, you will likely enjoy this book more than if you are say, a statistician or researcher."

I paused briefly to consider these. And I am sure one can be critical of his relatively ""large"" assertions based on simply contrarian ways of countering our gut reactions to nearly everything ""modern."" But here's the thing: we NEED to consider that more is going on than our first instincts about everything pop culture.The next time we walk past a group of teenagers sitting at a lunch table, refusing to communicate and instead scrolling through hundreds of images, instead of predicting the doom of our country and our species, imagine what ELSE might be going on...Johnson's book just may help you do that.(I am also currently reading Steven Pinker's ""Enlightenment Now,"" so I am a bit prone to optimism at the moment.)"

32,1594481946,http://goodreads.com/user/show/349264-tracey,3,"First heard about this on NPR's Morning Edition in May; then Johnson appeared on The Daily Show early in June. I'd read his Mind Wide Open a month or two ago & really enjoyed it, so I put this book on hold at the library.Johnson's basic theory is that popular culture has gotten more complex and challenging over the last few decades, and our consumption of such has assisted us with problem solving and dealing with complex relationships, referring to this as the Sleeper Curve. He also references the Flynn Effect - a study that shows an increase of approximately 13 IQ points in the average American population over the last 50 years. In the gaming world, the most popular games require strategy, forethought and probing skills. Users spend time learning not only the interface and the underlying rules, they also have to put together a set of goals in order to finish the game successfully. He references Grand Theft Auto as well as the Sims as examples of terrifically complex worlds, comparing game guides to Cliff Notes for literary works. In terms of television - he cites the larger number of characters and multi-episode plots as elements that challenge our social intelligence. Shows intended for syndication, such as Seinfeld or The Simpsons are expected and encouraged to be more complex, so as to reward multiple viewings. Johnson does a little handwaving over the topic of sex & violence in the media, coming to the conclusion that since crime has generally declined over the past decade, maybe the media is not as big as influence as we thought. I would have liked to have seen more of an exploration of that topic. He wraps up the book by pointing out how the technology has influenced the Sleeper Curve - learning new technologies at a much higher rate than that of previous generations. While popular media may not necessarily increase our knowledge of facts, Johnson believes it gives us the tools we need to learn more efficiently and interact in a social network more effectively.Recommended to anyone interested in the sociological aspects of media.

34,1594481946,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77536251-modern-major-general,5,"I'm quite taken aback at the number of 1-star reviews that this book has received, for it is both an excellent read, very entertaining, provides numerous thought-provoking hypotheses, and overall paints a very optimistic vision of the future.I consider myself an ""elitist cultural snob,"" but seeing some of the comments regarding this book, I realize that my level of cynicism is no where near that possessed by those who love the odorous nature of their own flatulence.This book is written very intelligently, and those who claim that the author does not understand the difference between causation and correlation apparently didn't read the book...or most likely only skimmed through it because they had already prejudged it and didn't want to face anything which would challenge their own bias, lest it cause them to question their own self-righteous indignation. The author himself points out numerous times that the increase in intelligence and the complexity of entertainment today versus that of a few decades ago seem to match too closely to be coincidence, but he never directly says as such, leaving the thought open-ended.For myself, as someone who's hobbies typically include those of the more intellectual pursuit, the author's description of the increased complexity of video games and tabletop role playing games is spot on accurate. The only people who would continue to denigrate such things are the exact people whom criticize this book and give it 1 star.Let me show you the 400-page rule book that governs Warhammer 40,000 someday, and you tell me that the rules are not extraordinarily complex compared to something like Monopoly. And each edition only adds to the complexity. The game evolves every few years or so, the rule book grows larger, and the rules grow, evolve, and change.In the nearly three decades that I have played Dungeons & Dragons, and a slew of other role playing games, the rules have grown more complex, with continued added nuances and new twists on old rules as each edition comes to pass. And yes, much like the author, I have gone on to create my own version of the game. Nearly every gamer I know has their own dedicated ""House Rules"" to shape the game in a way that they consider more to their liking.Which is exactly what the author is trying to say. Older forms of entertainment did not feed into this. People simply read the book or watched the show. Perhaps they would discuss it amongst themselves, but that was the depth of their interaction. Newer forms of entertainment are participatory in nature, and encouragement further thought, development, discussion, and have actual impact upon the media, as many forms are now interactive.""Water cooler"" discussions are no longer about last night's episode, but now encompass the entire series as a whole."
35,1594481946,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5818273-alex,4,"The theme of this book challenges the assumption that most people have about the world: that it's all going to shit - and quickly. It's very much in the spirit of Steven Pinker's book 'Better Angels of Our Nature', drawing on multiple disciplines in both the humanities and social sciences to explain that in fact our culture has gotten steadily more complex over time, rather than dumbed down. This thesis will be difficult to believe at first given the proliferation of rubbish television in the last 10 years. People have a tendency to wax nostalgic about what media was like when they were younger. And here is where the trouble begins, as they're likely to be comparing today's garbage with yesterday's award winners, thereby distorting the sample by forgetting the hundreds of cancelled, stillborn, or rubbish shows of their day.The first half of the book walks the reader through the evolution of the video game, with its narrative complexity growing in lockstep with the number of rendered pixels on screen. From here the switch is made to syndicated television, the rise of the internet, film media, and finally how the invention of DVD changed the way we consume television shows. The argument is that as people have become more intelligent over time they have demanded more complex media to entertain and challenge their minds. A common critique I've seen leveled against this book is that it confuses correlation with causation. While there is an important logical point there, it's often the case that *no* amount of correlation could convince these hyper-skeptics of causation. And in any case, it need not be either-or. There could be a virtuous circle going on where higher intelligence leads to more challenging media (on average) and more intelligent media (amongst other factors) leads to higher IQ scores in the bulk of the population. The second half of the book explains the how and why, and is quite clear that this need be only one piece of the puzzle rather than some new overarching social science theory. I give this book four stars because I enjoy books that challenge preconceptions I have about the world, and I will long remember having my priors updated after I've forgotten the explicit contents of the book. The book is fairly fun to read as the author writes well, though you'll find yourself wondering why there's no mention of smart phones or Facebook. The reason for this omission is that the book was written in 2005. No doubt there have been new findings in the last 11 years that will either support or refute the thesis of this book."
36,1594481946,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4360729-david-mason,1,"The book that inspired me to join goodreads. This book inspired both hope and despair in me. Hope because it means the bar has been lowered for what gets published meaning it'll be that much easier to fulfill my dream of paying off student loans by writing a book. Despair because it was pure tripe and I'm concerned someone might actually take it seriously. I would say that he pulled most of this out of his a** except that he was so good at referencing actual research and then COMPLETELY MISSING THE POINT! (I mean seriously, who builds their entire argument around g?! If you know what I'm talking about then join in my scoffing. If you don't know, well, there's a reason no serious scientist talks about g). Not to say that this book was ALL bad. As an example of false dichotomies and straw man arguments, I'm not sure you'll ever find a better example. And he did have several interesting (well, one or two) insights from which he would then, in his inimitable style, proceed to draw wild conclusions. Lastly, you know when you meet someone and they're trying desperately to coin a new phrase and it gives you that awkward, icky feeling? It doesn't feel any less desperate when the guy trying is 40. It was like he read Tipping Point, sat around trying to come up with something like that (Sleeper Curve! that's pure gold!), and then structured his entire book around it without bothering with tropes like ""logic"" or ""making sense"". (And I'd like to commend myself for not availing myself of the low-hanging fruit like how he played fantasy baseball throughout his entire childhood and this book smacks of trying to justify how that was better than actually ""playing"" with ""friends"".)"
37,1594481946,http://goodreads.com/user/show/610907-jessica,2,"Johnson discusses the background and implications of what he calls ""The Sleeper Curve"" or the positive cognitive impact popular media has on the mass culture. In a nutshell, he relates how today's video games, television, and movies, are created with the expectations that players/viewers will be active participants parsing out relevant details, organizing the social networks in their own minds, and taking advantage of syndication, TiVo, etc. to watch episodes over and over (calling for a complexity that can withstand repeated viewings and scrutiny). He also suggests instead of parents concentrating on ratings based on violence and language, they should consider the shows that are forcing their kids to think. He also questions the results of the studies that show we are reading less books than we used to, by pointing out the amount of reading that is done via the Internet every day (browsing, chatting, blogging, posting, etc,). While acknowledging the cognitive demands popular culture is placing on us and even the possibility of higher IQs as a result, he doesn't forget about the books. (yea!) The Sleeper Curve doesn't train our minds to follow a sustained textual argument that doesn't involve interactivity, doesn't allow us ""recreate the mental landscape of another consciousness""; therefore, the importance of reading books (fiction or nonfiction) cannot be underestimated. "
38,1594481946,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4230067-mohammad-abdelkhalek,4,"the book we have here is divided into two parts, the first part is arguing that the popular media (Games, Tv, the internet, film) has developed so much complexity in the past few decades, a complexity that made us smarter by challenging our brains to process more data, the second part is telling us why the media has grown so complex in the first place.But before we jump into quick judgments about the book, let's first try to understand what the book is actually trying to tell us, the book is trying to make a deeper study of today's media, instead of just simplifying the whole matter with the conventional ""more sex and violence"" argument, now the author is not saying that it's good for kids to watch movies and play games with this kind of content, but he's trying to ignore the content for a while to study more the underlying process of analysing the content, it's not about ""what"" we learn, it's about ""how"" we learn.This book has helped me to understand why are my collegues are spending alot of time doing things that i ""thought"" were useless, and still getting higher grades. "
39,1594481946,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1008236-bookmarks-magazine,0,"Though the research behind Johnson's theories proves interesting, most critics found a few quirks in the construction of its delivery. Driven by a fervent desire to prove that today's media are more beneficial to the human mind than they are damaging, Johnson, author of several books on science and technology (see Mind Wide Open, **** May/June 2004), fails to adequately define his agenda other than showcasing his research. Though his prose is captivating and his enthusiasm infectious, Johnson does not muster enough evidence to prove that today's games and television shows help one's mind; and yet, in his defense, there doesn't seem to be enough evidence proving him wrong. Either way, Everything Bad Is Good for You is a creative, flawed look at a society where the term ""reality"" refers to television rather than, um, reality.This is an excerpt from a review published in Bookmarks magazine."
40,1594481946,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1255007-becky-tyrrell,2,"Johnson is a man on a mission. He selectively cites a few theorists to push his view that popular culture has become increasingly more complex over the past 30 years and that this shift from books and simple television shows to complex video games, film, television, and internet media is the reason for increases in IQ scores across the same time span. Insisting that he believes children should be taught to love books from an early age and that he is not disparaging print media, he essentially returns to the same examples that seem to contradict these statements and instead posits that more technological forms of media are what will really serve us in the end. To his credit, Johnson does formulate interesting examples for a few of his theories, helping readers to think in new ways. Ultimately though, I find his view narrowminded, not well-supported, and reductionistic, and the text to be repetitive."
41,1594481946,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1406812-jmswtsn,1,"Decent premise, gets old & repetitive pretty quickly. Actually, the title is the best part of this book - it pretty much tells you everything you need to know about it.For those who want a tiny bit more: the book chronicles how pop culture entertainment such as TV & video games has gotten more and more complex and required more brainpower to follow, asses, and figure out than in the past.He also notes that an American philosopher and civil-rights activist James Flynn investigated IQ scores, and found that over the last 46 years, average IQ has increased by about 13.8 IQ points. Then he provides no other supporting evidence while continuing to browbeat his ""more complexity in life & entertainment"" thesis.I skipped to the ending shortly thereafter and found nothing surprising, nor anything that made me wish to catch up on what I missed."
42,1594481946,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1023151-jenny,2,"A little bit repetitive and somewhat simplistic, but an interesting idea to explore the complexity of popular culture and how it compares to television, videogames, and other distracting entertainment technology. Johnson's basic argument is that popular culture today requires more from its audience-more mental involvement, whether it is making decisions in a highly complicated video adventure game, or arguing the pros and cons of keeping particular reality show characters on the island / on the job, or figuring out the multi-threaded story lines that are featured in so many of todays television dramas - people are required to think and to feel and getting sucked into that, might not be so bad...I don't necessarily agree with his argument, but it was interesting nonetheless."
43,1594481946,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13615581-jp,4,"It's about time someone wrote a view in opposition to continuous reactionary stance that every new trend is bad for our future. Steven Johnson is effective in this work because he's balanced yet unapologetic. For every criticism we can make about video games relative to time spent reading, we can also find a plus. Video games require logical thought. They train quick decision making. Increasingly, they foster new relationships and teach communication. Reading has it's place, but it's passive and isolating. Johnson show similar advantages about Dungeons & Dragons and modern TV. Compare the complexity of Lost or 24 with that of the top hits of the 1970s. This book makes and important point, and it does it in a compact, enjoyable format."
44,1594481946,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51530607-salsabrarian,4,"The author puts forth a compelling argument that today√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s √¢‚Ç¨≈ìprogressive trends in popular culture√¢‚Ç¨ are making us more intelligent rather than less. He cites the more complex storylines of today√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s television which kicked off with √¢‚Ç¨≈ìHill Street Blues.√¢‚Ç¨ Video games require decision-making, often quickly, and he describes the probing and telescoping techniques that players use to understand and advance in a game.

Pop culture is not worse than before. There are always been shitty tv programs, songs, movies, etc... we just forgot about them like in 50 years we will have forgotten about the shitty part of nowadays culture. Are games better ? definitely. Movies, songs, tv shows ? The same. some good some bad. I think the best ones are getting better but also that the worst are getting worse. Also bad idea to put the morale of the content aside. it is important. I am always sad to see people who dreams of getting in a reality tv show.In the end, you just need to choose what you want to see and it is possible to always find good things, mostly thanks to internet"
46,1594481946,http://goodreads.com/user/show/540436-rebekah,2,"This book set out to explain how video games, tv, the internet and movies are actually making us smarter, not dumbing us down like conventional wisdom would lead you to believe. Interesting idea, but a flawed arguement. These things aren't making us smarter. There are a lot of other factors at work...things he even alludes to in the second part of the book, but doesn't follow to their logical end. I think maybe he was just trying to rationalize his life spent playing games. The arguements he makes about the skills needed to pursue and understand certain kinds of entertainment are valid, but he leaves out most of the story."
47,1594481946,http://goodreads.com/user/show/902623-sharon,2,"Not impressed. I'm still processing the ""why"".It was interesting to think about gaming and other media as good for the brain, but other than that, I thought his writing was boring and his arguments thin - he didn't really answer everything he brought up. Attempting to deal with morality and flesh and blood relationships was beyond the scope of the book and he couldn't adequately address those things.I'm sure modern media does stretch us, but I'm also sure that a cognitive six-pack isn't the best defense of gaming. I'd actually be more comfortable with someone just saying they game because it's fun. As Melodie says, it would've made a good article."
48,1594481946,http://goodreads.com/user/show/244914-lindsay,3,"I found Johnson's argument that pop culture has become more complex to be interesting, even compelling. I'm still not sure I completely agree with him, but if nothing else it gave me a little more respect for video games and the people who play them. One thing that did bother me (and perhaps it's because I've been spending a lot of time lately reminding students to evaluate their information sources) is that I didn't get a good sense of Johnson's credentials. Based on some of the things he mentioned in the acknowledgments, I'm guessing he has a scholarly/research background, but the jacket copy just says he writes for Wired and Slate. "
49,1594481946,http://goodreads.com/user/show/167451-suzanne,2,"Maybe I should've read this book when it first came out in 2005. Yes, I realize that's only three years ago but books about pop culture become dated extremely quickly and I think that's what might have happened here. The TV discussion uses shows that are now waning in popularity at this point, and the Internet section was ridiculously inadequate. On top of that, I just found the whole thing rather dull and I skimmed through the last 50 pages. Overall, I was really disappointed at how underwhelming I found this book, especially since I was originally quite excited to read it."

The entire book is Johnson's argument that popular culture is actually making us smarter. He is not very persuasive and much of his points are very weak. I really didn't buy into most of his argument. The only thing I can say, is now I have a very weak defense for my love of reality TV! I also want to add, that Johnson seems to be really obsessed with video games and this is where he totally lost what little interest I had."
51,1594481946,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1467154-desiree,2,"I thought this book was alright. At first I thought his theories were great, but as he went on and on and on, I felt he was kinda beating a dead horse. Alright, we get it, 'Lost' makes us smart. Thank you J.J. Abrams. I also had a hard time understanding what he meant by the 'Sleeper Curve.' Maybe I skimmed through the part where he explained it. I guess I didn't think it would come up over and over again throughout the book, like Art Vandalay. Oh well, I wish I could make it to discussion this month. Have fun without me.Desiree"
52,1594481946,http://goodreads.com/user/show/558553-darlene,1,"Steven Johnson wrote one of my all time favorite nonfiction books, The Ghost Map, so what a suprise this book was. Johnson proposes that there is a sleeper curve, based on the Woody Allen movie of the same name, which shows that popular culture is making us smarter. I know this is not a scientific book, but give me a break. I do agree with the author that there are cognitive benefits to computer games and technology in general, but he completely lost me in his claims that because tv shows are more complex and by watching reruns of the complex shows, we are getting smarter. "
53,1594481946,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2281160-jen,2,"I found this book to be a letdown. Johnson's premise that just because TV shows are more complex nowadays means that today's generation is smarter, just didn't sit right with me. What really put me off was when he was comparing shows like Dragnet and Hill Street Blues to The Sopranos and 24. Well, of course they are different! Today's kids weren't raised on 70's and 80's TV shows, so the ones they see today are all they know. If that is what they grow up on, sure they are going to be able to process the difficult plot lines better, it is the only way they know how."

I was a bit disappointed to realize the book is actually from 2005, so the book felt stale, especially the section about the Internet. I kind of wish Steven Johnson would update this in an article or something because I think some of the points he makes are even more valid ten years later.

72,1594481946,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116812917-ctep,0,"In October, I read Everything Bad is Good for You: How Today‚Äôs Popular Culture is Actually Making Us Smarter by Steven Johnson. (New York: Riverhead Books, 2005.) Johnson‚Äôs main argument is that, contrary to what we hear and might think, pop culture isn‚Äôt turning our brains to mush. He writes about Video Games, the Internet, and Movies, but he makes his best points when talking about Television.Johnson admits that there is a lot of junk on the air. But, he argues, the junk that‚Äôs out there now is less junky than the junk of 30 or 40 years ago. And the ‚Äúgood‚Äù stuff has gotten way better. Johnson doesn‚Äôt try to argue that the quality of the content is better‚Äîhe makes the interesting case that the complexity of shows is really what challenges our brains; it‚Äôs really what makes TV shows worth watching at all. You wouldn‚Äôt find sex or gruesome violence on an episode of Dragnet, for instance. Compare that to an episode of The Sopranos. While you (or my parents) might think that Dragnet was the good ol‚Äô days of television, guess again. Johnson points out that Dragnet was pretty easy for our brains to zone out to. It followed three or four major characters through one plot thread per episode. It was full of ‚Äúflashing arrows‚Äù‚Äînarrations and camera shots to keep us all on the same page. The Sopranos, while it‚Äôs full of language and themes that would make Joe Friday blush, is an example of a show that does a better job actually exercising our brains. Each episode follows as many as a dozen separate but interconnected plotlines, with over twenty characters in a bogglingly-complex social network for us to keep track of. If you miss an episode, or a crucial conversation in the episode you‚Äôre watching, you might get lost. Speaking of Lost, did any non-fan of the show try to jump in halfway through? Good luck. Even shows like Seinfeld, that a casual viewer can enjoy without having seen every previous episode, offer rewards for those viewers who do appreciate the full humor of an Art Vandelay reference. They‚Äôre just complex enough to still be entertaining (to some) on a second or third viewing.I came across this book while working on a short write-up about why video games are circulated (and played) in the Library. I‚Äôd recommend it to other members‚Äîthe first half, at least‚Äîwho work with media and youth. I'm an optimist, and it was nice to hear that we're not all doomed, for once. The second half focuses on measuring IQ and the Flynn Effect, which wasn‚Äôt quite as interesting to me, but was still worth reading."
73,1594481946,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1708987-amy,4,"Steven Johnson puts forth the idea that popular culture is actually more mentally stimulating than before and, as the byline states, how popular culture is making us smarter. His main thesis is called the Sleeper Curve. ¬®The most debased forms of mass diversion-video games and violent television dramas and juvenile sitcome-turm out to be nutritional after¬®. It is an interesting and well thought out concept. He is right that the most popular TV shows, movies and video games are ones that make us think way more than before. You have to follow shows from the beginning of the entire show to understand them and there are references that are so fast that we have to work hard to connect the dots. Movies for kids are also more complex like Toy Story. One of the truly wonderful things about Toy story is how it entrances kids and parents because there are references to things only adults will get and the story line has many subplots. Video games require mental dexterity he states, and while this book was written in 2005 before the explosion of e-gaming and blockbusters like Fortnite, it has only become more apparent how consumption of video games has increased along with the challenge of them.He also explains that mental dexterity when it comes to electronics and video games is almost innate in younger generations now. Kids don¬¥t read pamphlets on how to work an iphone, they just do it and figure it out as they go.The author does not say just let your kid go on technology and pop culture. He advises that reading books and fostering a love of reading will always be a good idea, but we shouldn¬¥t be as quick to jump to the conculsion that video games, internet, television and movies are rotting our brains. I would love to hear his take on social media because this book was written in 2005 and Facebook was only founded in 2004. This is a fast read and I highly recommend it."
74,1594481946,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10270148-mac,3,"Because I enjoyed, and was impressed by, Steven Johnson's How We Got to Now, I decided to read Everything Bad Is Good for You. Though I'm still impressed with the author's writing abilities, I didn't enjoy this book quite as much.All the Johnson writing positives are on display in Everything Bad Is Good for You--the clarity, the ability to develop an extended logical argument, the capacity to persuade, and the movement among levels of abstraction from broad concepts to specific examples. As the book jacket says, ""Drawing from fields as diverse as neuroscience, economics, and media theory, Johnson shows that the junk culture we're so eager to dismiss is actually making us more intelligent.""However, Everything Bad is not as enjoyable or convincing as How We Got to Now. Johnson is so thorough and so wide ranging in his argument that I began to feel worn down by his ideas. He makes his point early on, so after a while I found myself saying, ""OK, I get it,"" not ""Well, that's interesting."" And I found myself saying, ""Well, that's a stretch,"" not ""Right on!"" Question. Since Everything Bad was published in 2005, I'll ask, ""Are Johnson's ideas still valid in his mind?"" Because so much has evolved in the intervening years and some research contradicts his thinking, I'd be interested to know what he believes now. Even if he has changed his mind, I bet he could comprehensively present his new point of view, perhaps too comprehensively."
75,1594481946,http://goodreads.com/user/show/106016771-vivek-gupta,3,"I would have loved to take this book and show it to my wife - ‚ÄúSee? I told you that all those hours playing video games and binging Stranger Things are making us SMARTER !!!‚Äù. Sadly, I won‚Äôt be honest to myself.In his book, Johnson argues that popular culture / mass media is getting a lot more complex and thus making the consumers (us) smarter. I don‚Äôt disagree with the first part of his hypothesis. 24 (the TV series) probably has 100x complex plot than The Tramp (Charlie Chaplin‚Äôs silent classic). But IMHO, ‚ÄúThe Tramp‚Äù teaches a lot more about humanity, chivalry and relationship than 24. And the video games today (like Fortnite) probably has 1M x more lines of code than ‚ÄúDangerous Dave‚Äù and requires a lot more thinking but I am not sure its making me any smarter.One of the biggest flaw of his hypotheses is NOT considering that the motivation behind popular media is not to make us smarter, its to make money. The games today are designed to be addictive and media is created to grab max eyeballs !!!The only pass that Johnson gets on this is that he wrote this book in the pre smartphone era. Its still an interesting read and you might be tempted to agree with everything Johnson says but do pause for a second and try to be honest to yourself :) #culture"
76,1594481946,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62429828-yannick,4,Despite what readers criticize here.... I do not even think that the author did not understand the difference between causation and correlation. He did not even claim causation. He just stated there are two trends and an opinion about mass media that it dumbs down society but it is probably not that way because average IQs are raising. So media cannot be THAT overwhelmingly dumbing down people.. And he outlined his opinion why causation might be there. Which is itself a valid thing to do. You do not always need to make scientific causal experiment (which is not possible in large-scale phenomena most of the time anyway) to say something smart. He conducted some kind of pattern finding and that's a good and creative thing. Even though you cannot scientifically correct infer causation from it. Good book that points out some positive trends of modern human evolution. BTW i really like his assessments of complexity within tv shows and games. Only negative thing I have to say it was sometimes a little boring but which is probably due to the fact that I am not thaat interested in discussing media.
77,1594481946,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47889157-thomas,1,"Disappointing. Maybe, when this was first published, some twelve years ago, its main hypothesis was provocative enough to cause a stir. This was a gift - and with so many books that you didn't ask for or buy yourself in the first place - it was always relegated to the back of the line ... however, when I found myself repeatedly referring to it by title and ""blurb-on-the-back"" only in the past couple of months, I resolved to give it a go. It is very much an account of self-serving confirmation bias wrapped into a slender 200 pages. I suppose your average thesis supervisor even in 2010 would throw this back at you with ""must do better"". The central idea is the fact that popular culture is becoming more ""demanding"" in its technical delivery is meant to serve as proof that your ""average Joe"" is getting smarter. Not so, I'm afraid. Examples cannot be accepted as proof. Certainly not in the presence of numerous examples that would underscore the opposite hypothesis. Should have left it at the back of the line for another twelve years ..."
78,1594481946,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86135055-sravya-tanikella,4,"Everything Bad is Good for You by Steven Johnson is a book that is addressing social media and what Americans are doing. He heavily stresses the fact that a lot of the things that Americans think they are doing that are ad for them are actually not that bad for them, and that perhaps they are what is making Americans smarter. This book is very intriguing the way that it shows so many examples of places where this is true and this really could be the case. Although it was written in 2005, 14 years later this book still resonates and makes a real impact on the way I view the factors that make up my daily life. Johnson says that the entertainment around us is arguably shaping humans for the future, and this was a refreshing take on the world's so-called ""issues"". The only reason I would give this book less 5 rating is because it tends to focus a lot on research, and I would love to hear Johnson's own theoretical approach elaborated more. "
79,1594481946,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42597140-kelly-massey,5,"Steven approaches the argument he's making, about the positives of our technological revolution, knowing that many will shout him down and that technology and thereby the modern media is making us dumber, less sociable, etc., and yet he's able to intelligently discuss that the complexities of technology actually make us better problem solvers and that we're finding new and different ways to be sociable, just through our technology.It will take a lot of convincing for a GenXer or older to actually pick up this book and read the argument from beginning to end with an open mind, but I think it's a good place to start for anyone who has engaged in these kinds of debates before.It is noted that he adds that reading and playing outside are just as important as well, he just feels that technology often gets bashed without anyone stopping to take the time to think of the positive aspects it has on our lives. "
80,1594481946,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42253451-yuri-martins,3,"Throughout the book, the author presents a number of arguments, facts and studies to make his point that pop culture is actually making us smarter. Yup, you read that right.He does such defense by use of consilience approach, that is, making use of different disciplines and showing a convergence of evidence, which solidifies his arguments even more and that he has really done some research for his book.That is precisely why I found the reading so interesting, since it feels like you‚Äôre having a conversation with him and he keeps refuting each preconceived idea we might have about pop culture ‚Äì like how it is numbing our minds or making us all dumber, for example.It is a great book and since it‚Äôs short you can easily read on a weekend (or a day if you find the time). Nice option for geeks and fans of pop culture."
81,1594481946,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71367800-ahmed-hawamdeh,1,"It was a book that was good for it‚Äôs time. The book gives us an analysis of the media that people were watching, and listening to in the early 2000‚Äôs and how it stimulates the brain in a good way. However, reading this book in the mind of a someone born in the early 2000‚Äôs it misses the mark. When they talk about television they are not mentioning bing watching a show straight on Netflix. Or when talking about reality television not mentioning one of the largest empires in the world, the Kardashians. In the Internet chapter not mentioning Facebook, instagram, Twitter, etc..... This is not the author‚Äôs fault because it was a very great analysis for the time period however things change.The story had a due date and it is long due. "
82,1594481946,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62536555-david-snook,4,"It nearly convinced me to run out and buy some video games! I didn't, of course, but it did give me a new appreciation for the increasing complexity of our modern mass media entertainment and how it might actually be making us a bit smarter. Having previously bought in to the dystopian view of mass media as a race to the bottom, I also have a little more hope for the future. I may not be completely convinced, because I still think that moral content (or the lack of it) matters as much as the complexity of the structure or the delivery, but I am at least encouraged that our cultural obsession with mass media (including the Internet, which is my own preferred poison) can have some redeeming value."

Well researched.We're constantly being told that popular culture is just mindless entertainment - but, as Steven Johnson shows in Everything Bad is Good for You, it's actually making us more intelligent.Steven Johnson puts forward a radical alternative to the endless complaints about reality TV, throwaway movies and violent video games. He shows that mass culture - The Simpsons, Desperate Housewives, The Apprentice, The Sopranos, Grand Theft Auto - is actually more sophisticated and challenging than ever before."

I have to say that the author talks about some captivating issues and, even though the author arrives to some interesting conclussions, I don't agree with almost any of them.I am not going to say that it was a bad book for me, because I was enterntained and I learned some new things, but I just couldn't understand why the author thinks like that some times."
86,1594481946,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51850029-amy,2,"This book has been on my reading list for years, but I think I waited too long to read it. Johnson makes this wonderful case for why media (video games , reality tv) is actually making society smarter, but it was before the advent of media as we know it today (with Netflix, Facebook, Twitter, Twitch). I don't know if he could have predicted that these new mediums would create a more segmented society, one in which people can evade reality.  "
87,1594481946,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4204328-ryan-price,5,"I loved his treatment of video games, instead of looking at them in terms of graphics or sales numbers or pure technology, but as a storytelling medium, and exercise for the brain. The analysis of television is dated but not irrelevant. For example, he would have a field day with Game of Thrones and some of our other main stream modern television dramas.Plus, as the author points out, he is not simply stating his opinion, as a cultural observer, but using research to back up his theories."
88,1594481946,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1831078-jennifer,5,Johnson shows that the junk culture (video games and TV) have actually made us smarter. Games such as the Sims have raised IQ scores 10 pts. They also teach abilities that can't be learned from books. He explains in detail how video games increase our intelligence by forcing us to probe deeper. He also insists that reading books is important and necessary and teaches different things than games. Fascinating stuff!
89,1594481946,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63709987-dennis,4,"Finally,after having to hear all throughout my youth and adolescence that tv, computer games and stuff like that are dumbing me down and I should read a book instead, here it is. A counter argument to all of that. Steven Johnson presents a fresh view on the pop culture that emerged over the last 30 years, and it's nicely written to boot. The only thing that could've been emphasized more would be scientific studies to undermine the authors arguments."
