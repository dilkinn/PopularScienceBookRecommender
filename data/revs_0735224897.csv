0,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1045774-mehrsa,2,"This is a very narrow and small-minded book parading as a big thoughtful one. It says it is about the American Mind, but the data and the theory only support ""the coddling"" of a very narrow subset of the American mind: upper middle class college kids born after 1995 that got to college in 2013. As far as that group is concerned, this is really good advice. I totally agree with his three untruths--your feelings are not necessarily true, the world is not good and evil, and adversity does not make you weak. I also agree that children need lots of free play and that social media is bad for kids and they are over-protected. There is nothing to disagree with here (even though I sometimes chafe at ""when we were kids..."" arguments)HOWEVER, using this group's specific problems, the authors make vast over-generalizations. The few anecdotes highlighted are meant to be examples of a deeper problem, but to me, they are the sum total of the problem. Left leaning students are behaving very badly toward conservative speakers. At most, there are 10 or so highly publicized events that seem to play on a loop among conservatives and intellectual dark web types. And there are no defenses to these behaviors, but it hardly represents our nation. And they provide no data whatsoever that it does. It's too soon to even tell that the next generation will be like this one.And for people who seem to care a lot about both sides arguments, they seem to leave out a lot of counter-examples. Here are a few: 1. They talk about the metoo movement once in the beginning. Is that not a product of this ""call out"" generation? None of us ""old"" women had the ""balls"" to speak truth to power like these young women do. Good for them.2. And the Parkland teens and all the ways in which this generation is more compassionate and engaged than we were. My generation (I'm 40) thought it was cool not to care about anything. My middle school kid stays up after school making protest signs and watching political debates. Is that not progress?3. The authors also focuses on one particular subset of an entire generation (left-leaning, and mostly women and LGBT or Trans students asking for safe spaces). They leave out that Gamergate and the trolls and the alt right are also made up of this generation. Why not talk about them at all? Seriously. They are literally the same age and except for one aside in the entire book that ""the right does it too"" there are no examples at all of the right doing the thing they are decrying. It seemed like a half-assed ""both sides"" argument without support.4. Do you know how many books I've read written by old people decrying the hippie generation of the 60s (Alan Bloome's Closing of the American Mind is an example)? Bloome was talking about Haidt and Luianoff. Boy do they grow up fast. 5. It makes me sad that more people will read this book than will read books highlighting actual big problems like inequality. The authors give a nod to the fact that inequality should definitely be remedied, but they would rather you do it the right way and not call it ""social justice."" Again, I agree with all the parenting advice and the cognitive behavior advice, but this is not a self-help book. It's meant as a polemic and it strikes at the wrong target."

Upon arrival, you notice that management has removed all of the weights, concerned that heavy weights can cause stress and injury. Instead, you are instructed to perform light body-weight exercises that you can already safely handle. As you go through the motions of exercise, progress is nonexistent and you’ll be entirely unprepared for any activities that might require greater strength and endurance. Welcome to (some) modern universities, which engage in the intellectual equivalent of removing the weights from the gym by creating safe spaces, disinviting speakers, removing offensive material, and inhibiting free speech and inquiry that should be the staple of a college education. Attending a university with these policies to prepare for the challenges of the outside world is like training for a marathon in our weightless gym. The analogy is apt because the human mind, like the musculoskeletal system, is antifragile. Whereas fragile systems break under pressure and resilient systems can withstand pressure without change, antifragile systems become stronger under pressure. If you want to enhance your physical strength, you have to lift progressively heavier weight; if you want to enhance your intellectual fortitude, you have to expose yourself to different and sometimes controversial or offensive ideas. This is the topic Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt tackle in The Coddling of the American Mind. They frame the issue around the “three great untruths” that are promoted on some campuses across the US, which are creating an environment that not only blocks open inquiry and learning but that leads to polarization, emotional immaturity, fragility, violence, and mental illness. The three untruths are 1) what doesn’t kill you makes you weaker, 2) always trust your feelings, and 3) life is a battle between good people and evil people. These three untruths, taken together, create a student body that is unreceptive to other viewpoints, dogmatic, easily offended, and self-righteous, eager to earn points within the group by calling out and ostracizing those with different views. The great untruths are damaging both socially and psychologically, and run counter to both the principles of cognitive behavioral therapy (used to treat anxiety and depression) and ancient wisdom regarding well-being and happiness. The great untruths therefore lead to the types of mental habits that our best therapy aims to eradicate, such as catastrophizing, emotional reasoning, overgeneralizing, dichotomous thinking, labeling, blaming, and negative filtering. Universities are encouraging, in other words, the very habits that lead to anxiety and depression and emotional stunting. The authors dive deeply into these issues in the first two parts of the book and then describe the historical, social, psychological, and political reasons why we find ourselves in this situation. The fourth and final part of the book offers solutions, which I would summarize as follows. The problems on campus can ultimately be solved by focusing on developing the virtues of intellectual courage, humility, and emotional resilience in our children and students. First, intellectual humility forces one to recognize that humans are fallible and prone to bias and error, both individually and collectively. Since we are often blind to our own errors, the only possibility of correcting our misjudgments is through exposure to competing ideas. As the authors put it, exposure to someone that disagrees with you is a gift. They can either change your mind, thus correcting your errors and biases, or else strengthen your own beliefs in the process of defending them. The second virtue, intellectual courage, is the habit of pursuing the truth wherever it may lead and embracing the values of free speech and open inquiry. It’s the recognition that you may be wrong, that you may not have all of the answers, and that the development of your intellect depends on defending your ideas against competing views rather than shutting them down through force or violence. The third virtue, emotional resilience, is the habit of handling adversity appropriately and taking control of your own emotions and reactions. Words are not violence, and being offended does not count as a point or an argument. This reminds me of three quotes by Christopher Hitchens that captures the spirit:— “If someone tells me that I've hurt their feelings, I say, 'I'm still waiting to hear what your point is.’”— “In this country, I've been told, 'That's offensive' as if those two words constitute an argument or a comment.”— “Those who are determined to be ‘offended’ will discover a provocation somewhere. We cannot possibly adjust enough to please the fanatics, and it is degrading to make the attempt.”The best defense against false or immoral ideas is rigorous intellectual debate and criticism, and the censorship of ideas only makes those ideas more appealing to your opponents and to those who are never exposed to the proper criticisms. Shouting down a speaker is immature and intellectually and emotionally cowardly and has no place within a university. If you want to call yourself a liberal, you should have no problem winning the war of words with religious fundamentalists or racists without having to suppress their speech. Sticking with the Christopher Hitchens theme, can you imagine if, instead of engaging in dozens of debates with religious conservatives, he instead called for their speech to be suppressed? How much weaker and ineffective would his position have been? As the authors point out, this is not happening at every university, and there is some debate as to whether or not this is as big of problem as it appears. In fact, it might not be; but it’s important to get out in front of the issue before it becomes a bigger problem. The authors cite some fairly egregious examples from a handful of universities, but also note that there are many exceptions. In particular, the University of Chicago remains a leader in free speech and inquiry and published the Chicago Statement on Principles of Free Expression, which every college student and parent should read. Over 40 institutions have adopted this policy, and hopefully more will follow suit."

I'm also curious about this notion of kids being overprotected or ""coddled"". It's looking more and more like the developed world's need to protect its kids, wrap them in bubble wrap, and disinfect everything might be the cause of a variety of unsavoury things, from Berkeley banning speakers to the rise in childhood leukemia. I don't necessarily agree with all the authors' ideas - such as their thinly-veiled disdain for feminists who talk about rape culture - but I do think they make some important points.The truth is, though, this essay-turned-book should really have just stayed an essay. The authors' three Great Untruths make a thoughtful opinion piece, but there's not a full-length book hidden in the idea. The result of them trying to extend their commentary to a modest 269 pages is a lot of repetition, weak graphs that demonstrate a very small number of people doing a very small number of things, and odd tangents. An example of this latter is the lengthy instruction in how to do Cognitive Behavioural Therapy.A lot of the ""evidence"" is anecdotal, and focuses on a few extreme cases. Perhaps these are indicative of a larger trend, but I don't see anything in this book to convince me of that. I guess I should have just read the article this book grew out of.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube"
3,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"This is a fascinating but very disturbing book about how college students have recently been caught in the three great untruths. The first untruth is that one's feelings are the best guide to correctness. The second is that one should avoid pain or discomfort; what doesn't kill you makes you weaker. And the third untruth is that one should find fault in others, and not in one's self.This book is not about helicopter parents, although they certainly contribute. It is about a new culture of safety-ism. In this culture, one should always seek safety, even emotional safety. If someone says something to you that makes you uncomfortable, then what he says is unsettling, harmful, and the person who said it is evil. Each person is either good or evil, and there is no middle ground. And, if someone says anything that makes you feel uncomfortable or stressed, then that person is evil.From time to time, we hear about college students who protest speakers who have been invited to give talks on unsettling subjects, or who have unpopular viewpoints. The college administration is then pressured to retract the invitation, even though the speech is bound to be a learning experience for all. Sometimes a faculty member tries to help a student, is sincere and respectful, but a student takes the attempt the wrong way. The student raises a big stink, characterizes the instructor as harmful and therefore evil. Other faculty members secretly agree with the instructor, but are scared of voicing their dissenting opinions. The college administration is cowed into placating the students, and is not true to the mission of a college.What is the purpose of a college? While some would argue that a college's purpose is to teach skills, an equally important purpose is to prepare students for their post-college life. After college, people are exposed to all sorts of viewpoints, including both good and obnoxious points of view. An important purpose of a college is to inoculate its students, to make them stronger for the future. The best way to do that is to expose students to differing points of view, even unsettling ideas, so that students can become more critical thinkers and not over-stressed by people of other persuasions.Many years ago I went to a public university, and heard invited speakers give talks that were very controversial. Students who didn't want to hear these speakers always had the option not to attend. They did not protest against the speakers, depriving others of a learning opportunity. It was that simple.This book takes the reader on a journey through recent events on college campuses. These events are extremely disturbing, and made me sick that today's students, teachers, parents, and college administrators are often so weak-minded. They have lost their way, and forgotten that while physical safety is absolutely important, emotional safety is not necessarily bad for one's health. But now I have a better understanding of what is happening in college campuses today.I didn't read this book--I listened to the audiobook, which is narrated by one of the authors, Jonathan Haidt. He is an exception to the rule--Haidt is an amazingly good reader, and I truly enjoyed listening to his narration."
4,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3536004-jenna,4,"Education should not be intended to make people comfortable; it is meant to make them think."" ~Hanna GrayI'm not sure how to begin this review other than to say it was both interesting and disturbing. Having read iGen: Why Today’s Super-Connected Kids Are Growing Up Less Rebellious, More Tolerant, Less Happy--and Completely Unprepared for Adulthood--and What That Means for the Rest of Us, I was somewhat aware of what is taking place in universities across the US. The authors of ""The Coddling of American Minds write a similar book but giving many more examples of the erosion of free speech on campuses. I'm flabbergasted! How can universities, the very places where freedom of speech was most protected, now be censoring both professors and students in order to not offend anyone? In order to not ""harm"" students with ideas? Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt explain why this is taking place, how we have turned into a culture of fragility and over-protection. It is one thing to not allow hate speech, hateful and truly harmful ideas, as the authors are quick to point out, but quite another to suppress any view that might go against what students believe, in order to not ""harm"" them by exposing them to alternate points of view. Why are universities firing professors for bringing up ""hot"" issues? Why are they banning controversial speakers? Why are they limiting what even the students can say? It all starts with over-parenting and treating children as fragile things that cannot withstand anything. Of course, this comes from a good place -- a good parent does not want their child to be hurt and wants to protect them from all harm. I'm not a parent but I can understand that. We don't want those we love to be hurt or suffer. However, we as society have gone too far, from ""protecting"" our children from peanuts and thus greatly increasing the number of children with deadly allergies to them, to protecting them from alternate views and conflicting ideas. We don't allow children to grow if we keep them from being exposed to things that challenge them. The authors say that children are not fragile, but anti-fragile. We need to protect them from serious harm of course, but by coddling them and treating even teens as young children, we are hurting their future prospects and making it more difficult for them to succeed in the adult world. The authors cite numerous examples of this overprotection, both of young children and extending onto college campuses. They list 3 Untruths that now often govern how children are raised and are causing them to be more anxious and depressed than previous generations:•The Untruth of Fragility: ""What doesn't kill you makes you weaker.""•The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: ""Always trust your feelings.""•The Untruth of Us Versus Them: ""Life is a battle between good people and evil people.""  The 3 criteria for an idea to be classified as an Untruth are:•""It contradicts ancient wisdom.""•""It contradicts modern psychological research on well-being.""•It harms the individuals and communities who embrace it.""I will not expand on these in my review but highly recommend the book for any who is interested. I would like to say though, that I do not wholly agree with the first criteria, that of something being untrue in part because it contradicts ancient wisdom. I would argue that just because something has always been held ""true"" doesn't mean it is. In fact, just because something has always been held true is reason in itself to challenge the assumption. Society would make no progress if ""truths' were never questioned, and each generation merely accepted what the prior ones said. We would still be burning people at the stake, still be stoning people to death for adultery, still be cutting off hands for the theft of bread, still be enslaving people (well, we are in a way, if you look at the prison industry in the US, but that's for another discussion), still be locking up gay people. Sometimes we NEED to contradict ancient wisdom. That said, I mostly agree with this book and the assertions put forth by the authors. I think there is a fine line at times between hate speech and free speech and I'm still not sure where the line needs to be drawn. Drawn it must be; people must be protected from those who would harm them and incite violence against them. However, people do not need to be protected from merely hearing differing points of view, ie a young person who is taught creationism at home is not emotionally harmed by learning about evolution in a school setting (where facts are supposed to be taught).As was pointed out to me by a reader of my original (flawed and perhaps somewhat racist or at least racially insensitive) review, ""There is a very important distinction between thinking differently and holding a position that is objectively wrong"". This is true and this is where the line needs to be drawn. And it needs to be drawn by those at whom hateful and false ideologies are directed and who are thus affected by, not by those who are not. The majority cannot dictate what is allowed to be taken as harmful to the minority.Objectively false ideas do not need to be entertained, nor should they be. When it comes to mere differences of opinion though, I love the following advice from the book:
""Argue as if you're right, but listen as if you're wrong (and be willing to change your mind). Make the most respectful interpretation of the other person's perspective. Acknowledge where you agree with your critics and what you've learned from them.""

There are some good points about the necessity to develop resilience in children, but with little strong substance to back things up. The arguments seem one-sided and cherry-picked. Reading this book you'd think that snowflake liberal children are rioting on every campus in America. Also the focus of the book is a bit unclear to me: is it a critique of the commercialization of the university system in America, where students have become consumers, or is it a critique of current child rearing practices in the USA? Mostly it seems to be a criticism of a few selectively picked incidents that have occurred over the last year in the America, without giving any credence or context to the aggressive culture wars occurring throughout the USA at this moment. Two-stars."

Towards the end of the book, I wanted to shoot myself everytime I read the word ""saftyism."" The book started out as an article, which explains a lot. It should've stayed an article.Also, the Authors fail to provide compelling evidence in support of their hypothesis that we are facing a generational crisis. They largely backup their sweeping generalizations about ""I-Gen"" with extreme anecdotal cases. The section on mental health included a lot of good data, but that was the exception.Lastly, this book (like many others) seems to be confused about whether it's descriptive or prescriptive in nature. Sure, it can both, but there was a confusing blend of the two that made it feel awkward. For example, there are sections with highly detailed instructions on how to practice CBT which seemed completely out of place given the general thrust of the book."

In case the rating and tags aren’t abundantly clear, this is a *negative* review.	If you slither in here with partisan kvetches about “triggered ““lefties” heaping criticism on poor, picked on bigotry apologists, you will be eviscerated, deleted and blocked. No exceptions.	I’m under no obligation to be polite when I heave assholes out of my house and I’ve no inclination to do so here.	If you’d like to make a case for/extoll the virtues of bigots, kindly pen your own review or hold a political rally in a friend’s review space. 	I’m not here for your counter argumentative analyses or your pitiful, presumptuous attempts to change my opinion on this dreck.	 so, do yourself a favor and find other, more receptive audiences for your “opposing views”; expressing them here is nothing short of boorish and creepy.	Finally, if you are unable to distinguish polite disagreement with a review(hint: this is always welcome here) from trollery (eliminated on sight), it might behoove you to figure out the distinction before commenting.  I'll also refer you to the following; were I to engage you, these would be the responses.https://whatever.scalzi.com/2015/03/0...*************	Holocaust denial, lynching/rape /domestic violence apologia, fundamentalist arguments for misogyny/ the execution of the LGBTQIA population and other flavors of bigotry ought not to be admitted to the clubhouse for ideas worth considering.	More often than not, the folks fighting for such a thing are privileged snowflakes who are themselves triggered by the presence of people from marginalized groups at their university.	They hold repugnant views about some of their classmates and want to regain control of a terrifying reality (Oh nos, teh women’s, teh gays, and teh brown people are invading academia, calling us out and threatening our place atop the sociocultural hierarchy!), one in which their deeply entrenched ideas aren't accepted as universal truths.	The authors and their acolytes are being disingenuous when they claim that the exposure of young people to simple disagreement is the goal.	Ostensibly, they aim to inoculate current and future generations against the deleterious effects of echo-chambers	What they really want is to be back in control of discourse communities and to be treated with the deference they think their ethnicity, faith, and socioeconomic status affords them.My takeaway? Waaaah!!!; we don't get to be publicly racist, sexist, homophobic or transphobic with impunity anymore! Waaaaah, students are exercising their first amendment rights to speak out against antifeminist, pro- lynching, social Darwinist religious fundamentalists who want ""safe spaces"" at their institutions of higher learning! Waaaaaa; groups I hate and with whom I disagree are being heard and taken seriously!Waaaa!!; fewer and fewer people are buying into the socially constructed idea that one permutation of subjectivity is inherently superior to all others.Waaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!; students and teachers (and of course, the lurkers support them in email and in department meetings. LOL!) with toxic and ignorant opinions about entire groups of people continue to conflate free speech with consequence free speech and are shocked and “confused” when they get dragged by the public and made to face professional consequences!	Are some children overprotected? Yes. I agree that this may be a huge problem. In fact, one of the things I appreciate is that my parents never prohibited me from watching horror films or reading violent or ""controversial"" books; E C comics were my favorite.	I especially loved the Judy Bloom books, as she neither sugar coated life’s tribulations nor talked down to her readers.	I also got to run around outside and fight, fall and skin my elbows and knees and wear shorts; no one forced me to sit in the house like “a little lady” and play with plastic emblems of upper-class Western beauty.There were clear rules for play, rules designed to keep my name out of the hat stuffed with those who weren't so lucky. If the chance of a child ending up like Elizabeth Smart, Polly Klaas, Jaycee Dugard or Gina DeJesus is more than zero, why take the risk, particularly if you are in an economically disadvantaged neighborhood and belong to an ethnic group whose children often get ignored by the media when they are victims of crime. Those outside the bubble of privilege know all too well how cops and media regard little brown skinned children who go missing.To continue, should we allow our feelings to take the lead, absolutely not. This is why I abhor those who apply their “feelings” about entire groups of people when making decisions about who deserves to be hired, protected, respected and regarded as human.	And yes, there are ideas and social, political, economic and academic phenomena that are flat out evil. Full stop. The architects and benificiaries of said ideas and phenomena need to wear the shoes they made, no matter how uncomfortable the fit. This is equally true of those who support and facilitate them. 	And I’d like to know how being pummeled with ableist, racist, xenophobic, transphobic, homophobic, religiously intolerant or misogynist vitriol in a classroom setting is supposed to prepare already marginalized people for the real world. Being othered and ostracized *is* their real world, and unlike the more fortunate subjectivities, they didn’t get a preparation period.But maybe the concern isn't so much for *those* groups as it is for straight, white, able-bodied CIS gendered students who might learn to question notions of their inherent superiority. Perhaps that's where the moral panic that underlies this book comes from.	All in all, this is a terrified,defensive and embarrasingly reductive argument for a return to the days when harmful behaviors and the repugnant, taken for granted attitudes from which they sprang were “just the way it was.”"

Its insights into the various developments over the past couple generations(parenting, social media, identity politics) weave a fascinating (if often dispiriting) and comprehensive picture of how we got to the current political climate, particularly on campus. The book is challenging in many respects, while remaining accessible and engaging. I’ll be thinking about it for a long time to come, and hope others will, too."
9,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14526744-robert-miller,5,"There can be little doubt that students entering our colleges and universities for the past several years are traveling to the beat of a different drum. For the most part, many of these young men and women are developmentally challenged in several ways. Their stunted growth is the result of their parent’s upbringing; the students have been coddled by their parents, trained to fear anyone outside of their immediate circles, prohibited from engaging in creative thinking, stopped from normal play activities, subjected to increased study activities following a typical school day (even at the kindergarten level), denied opportunities to explore their neighborhoods without adult supervision (lest they are kidnapped), and the list goes on. The authors explore the negative impact of obsessive “screen time” (I-phones, computers, etc.) use and the pitfalls of social media where (especially girls) are instantly judged and scored. All of these factors have to lead to record increases in reported cases of high anxiety, depression, impatience, intolerance, fragility, and a willingness to harshly judge others who they unreasonably deem to be threatening. These so-called “I-gen” teenagers formulate a culture where it is a “us against them” mentality—there is no middle ground. Speakers at their colleges who express ideologies different from these students are attacked and forced off of college campuses. Members of their group are “called out” and shunned if they deviate from the perspectives of the group. Even liberal professors who write or say something that even slightly hints at a philosophy different from the group are attacked. Administrators often take the coddled students to side out of fear—indeed, some college officials regard students as customers and design cushy and exotic surroundings for students—colleges are in the money business—officials also live in constant fear of lawsuits. Authors Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt write a book that defines the issues and problems of the I-gen and offer possible solutions. Great book."

Against going with your knee-jerk reactions. Against Safetyism.A culture of safety is NOT the same thing as providing a safe physical environment. It should be obvious, but often is not, that having seatbelts in cars is not the same thing as students shouting down speakers on campus, issuing rape and death threats for people speaking of ANYTHING that they don't agree with, or equating social justice with REAL justice.Stopping the KKK and lynchings is Justice. Making a school administrator fear for their lives because they misused a pronoun, or turning the misuse of a specific pronoun into something as nasty as actual physical molestation IS NOT JUSTICE.And yet, people everywhere (and I mean, EVERYWHERE) are getting more and more scared of doxing, public shaming, and anonymous trolling campaigns. It has become an accepted practice to turn anyone of a different ideology into targets of ridicule and slander until both sides have no idea what the hell is going on.What is truth? What happened to the search for truth ANYWHERE? They sum up the book in three main points. 1. We've forgotten the adage of ""What doesn't kill you will make you stronger."" If someone insults you, you ought to ADAPT. If someone betrays you, ADAPT. And yet, increasingly, we're all climbing into our safe ideological niches, surrounding ourselves with ONLY those things we think we can cope with, until nothing else remains except a narrow, narrow worldview. Open up your minds. Broaden your horizons. You don't have to agree with everyone or even anyone, but the experience WILL enrich you.2. Following your feelings is often really, really stupid. We have minds and we must always combat our own biases every single day. Remember when you fussed about a food when you were a kid and then you realized, later, that you loved it? If we always did what our feelings said, (especially for those of us who suffer from depression,) then our suicide rates might jump higher than the death rates of cancer. Oh, and let's not forget... following our feelings when surrounded by a bunch of other fearful and angry people has another term associated with it:MOBS. And we all know that no one is as stupid as all of us together.3. Oh, and we must always look for fault in others. We're never wrong. It's always someone else that has done this to us. This way of thinking could NEVER backfire, of course. Unfortunately, the first two points described above are exacerbating everyone's mental health issues. And let's face it... we have TONS. Rates of murder and violence and abductions are as low as they were in the 60's and yet everyone is growing up coddled and fearful and crazy. We've lost natural socialization, not only in the physical sense (scheduled playdates versus running around and getting into and out of trouble), but also in the amount of screentime we're ALL getting. Children are maturing much, much slower than at any other time and they're unable to cope with the real world. Hell, most of us are.We all need to open up our minds to listen as if we're wrong even while we argue passionately as if we're right.The point is... TRUTH is getting lost in mob mentality. We all need to wake up and get courageous and stand up for our beliefs while simultaneously RETAINING AN OPEN MIND.Otherwise, unofficially, our vaunted love of free speech is now DEAD."

The Untruth of Fragility: What doesn't kill you makes you weaker.2. The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: Always trust your feelings.3. The Untruth of Us Versus Them: Life is a battle between good people and evil people.Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt contend that these three bad ideas constitute a well-intentioned but toxic basis for a campus culture of ""safetyism."" They argue that these ideas contradict ancient wisdom, psychological research on well-being, and are harmful to the individuals and communities who embrace this mindset. Lukianoff, the president of FIRE (Foundation for Individual Rights in Education) and Haidt, a social psychologist perhaps best known for his recent work, The Righteous Mind, began to notice, from 2013 on, an increasing trend of concern on university campuses about ""triggering material,"" efforts to disinvite, or obstruct controversial speakers by heckling or even violence, coupled with reports of increasing levels of anxiety and fears about safety.There seemed to be an increasing perception by university administrators that students were ""fragile"" and needed protection and ""safe spaces."" They noted the priority given to feelings, and that the response to anything that evokes negative emotions is not to consider how one ought think about the external cause, but to simply remove whatever offends or causes stress--be it course material or offensive speakers, or perceived ""microaggressions."" They also noted the framing of the world in terms of a toxic form of identity politics, focused on common enemies rather than common humanity--us versus them, good versus evil.After delineating the contours and problems with these ""three great untruths,"" the authors chronicle a number of incidents in the last five years that they believe result from these often well-intentioned but bad ideas. They chronicle violent outcomes to this thinking at Berkeley after Milo Yiannopoulos was invited to speak with no disciplinary action by the university, and at Middlebury College when controversial scholar Charles Murray attempted to speak and a hosting faculty member suffered a concussion and whiplash requiring six months of physical therapy, in attempts to disrupt the event. Perhaps not as well publicized were the ""witch hunts,"" often against liberal faculty like Erika Christakis at Yale, who objected to an administration's paternalistic instructions about offensive Halloween costumes, suggesting that students might be mature enough to set their own norms. Students called her out as a racist, for creating an unsafe space, and sought her firing. She ultimately resigned. On many campuses, faculty feel they are walking on egg shells, often choosing to avoid anything controversial for fear that it may evoke complaints, or a witch hunt.The authors identify six contributing factors to this culture of safetyism, devoting a chapter to each:1. Rising political polarization, with campuses shifting leftward and increasingly distrusted by those on the right.2. An increase in adolescent anxiety and depression beginning in 2011, significantly correlating to smartphone usage. This group began arriving on campus in 2013.3. Paranoid parenting resulting in far less unsupervised play and greater fears of abduction (even though crime rates for this crime have dropped).4. The decline of free play and the rise of emphasis on test preparation.5. The growth of a bureaucracy of safetyism at universities, driven by federal mandates, risks of lawsuits, and a consumerist mentality, in which students are the consumers.6. The quest for justice, evoked by events between 2012 and 2018 that sometimes focuses on ""equal outcomes social justice"" in which any demographic disparity is assumed to be the result of discrimination, and alternative explanations are themselves considered discriminatory.The authors observe that many of these factors arise from good intentions taken to extremes and are careful to distinguish between legitimate forms of concern (like protecting physical safety) and more extreme forms of safetyism.They conclude with three chapters on wising up, with applications to children, to universities, and to the wider society.  They argue for preparing kids for the road rather than the road for the kids. They propose that our worst enemies cannot harm us as much as our emotional reasoning. And they encourage the recognition that ""the line dividing good and evil goes through the heart of every human being,"" and that we ought be watchful for any institution that promotes a common enemy rather than common humanity narrative. They commend the Chicago Statement (including a version of it in an appendix) that promotes free speech, academic freedom and free inquiry and sanctioning efforts to suppress speech.The authors, particularly Greg Lukianoff, who benefited personally from this approach, advocate for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) that improves mental health and coping skills through recognizing cognitive distortions and maladaptive behaviors, and challenging and changing these. Essentially, they would contend that their ""three bad ideas"" are both cognitive distortions and lead to maladaptive behaviors good neither for the person, nor the university, nor society. Hence, it should be understood that CBT is integral to their critique and recommendations.Working in a collegiate setting, I've seen many of the conditions the authors describe. Most faculty I know readily resonate with the feeling that they walk on egg shells, even while being deeply committed to academic freedom and challenging students thinking. I've seen the growing sensitivity to microaggressions. I've witnessed the surprise when I've suggested that being offended is a choice--that no one can offend us unless we let them, and that there are other options. I have been concerned that universities often seem to be echo chambers for the progressive end of our political discourse, blind to the very practices they excoriate on the right.Given the character of our wider society, it seems the last thing universities should be doing is engaging in the kinds of ""coddling"" Lukianoff and Haidt describe. If we are to have any hope, it will take resilient, anti-fragile people who will engage and keep engaging differing and even off-putting ideas. Most of all, in a climate of us versus them, we need people able to follow the Pauli Murray's principle: ""When my brothers try to draw a circle to exclude me, I shall draw a larger circle to include them."" Here's to drawing larger circles!"

All three untruths can be easily heard and observed in various fields of teaching and higher education environments especially. I have observed them to an increased extent even within my Roman Catholic university employer environments. The last untruth about worldview or ideas being either good/evil is becoming so endemic and evident, not only in education, but in the media language of nearly all bents that I myself, I've become discouraged to the true vitality of proper debate or discussion any longer. What role models too? Only role modeling for closed minded and grim / self-satisfied superiority to judgments of ""evil"" seem to have become predominant and visible. Like anything physical, any muscle or system- if it is not used and tested it goes from weak to weaker. Human endurance and strength toward wide avenues of ideas are no different. This book illuminates the 3 tenets of ""safety"" practices. And what has been the results measured and oftentimes observable.Protection and safety are not harbors for growth. This book will illuminate why that is and what can be measured since safety places and identity politics self-identity mantras have dominated environments of ""learning"". This book defines what has happened and what is observable. And what we see in ""reactions"" to attacks on free speech in the last decade. I could not believe the reaction of DePaul University when Ben Shapiro came to do a speech and question/ answer session in Chicago. (They caved to the mob anger reactions and didn't let him or any of his aides set foot on campus with VISIBLE police/ campus security presence to keep him off. He ended up doing the session at an off campus last minute space rental. I saw the Dean tell him that he would be ""arrested"" if he set a foot on the campus. IN AMERICA!!) And how that administration then censored and allowed the terrible behaviors against free speech to continue, even afterwards in physical and property damage tirades- like babies having a tantrum. In the USA, this lack of regard for the 1st Amendment is disgusting. And it hurts the ""protected"" the most. These tantrums are becoming multiple, multiple. Some of them with anarchy destruction and vile garbage affronts as in the Berkeley repeats. Always negating the 1st amendment base American Constitution premise beyond the human ""failure"" of their violent property or assault crimes. Yes, failure will be the result of swallowing those 3 listed untruths. Especially the last one which composites inherently that every one with different ""eyes"" or avenues to address a solution differently than the ""approved"" line is not opposed or different but just ""evil"" on the good/bad scales of ""group think allowances"".Three ideas (fallacies that are also being role modeled as well) that have been woven into our ""protecting"" American minds:1. What doesn't kill you, makes you WEAKER.2. Always trust your feelings.3. Life is a battle between good people and evil people.Safetyism is pitiable, IMHO. Political correctness ""group think"" judgments a major component and a symptom. This book will detail all the social trends in establishing safetyism throughout youth, childhood etc. in various social and community environments, beyond just the bureaucracies of schooling."

Standing comfortably aside modern intellectual heavyweights such as Jordan Peterson who have critiqued our cultural milieu, I was not the least bit surprised with the message within. However, I was particularly surprised to discover that A: the authors are neither Republicans nor Right-Wing in any fashion (as stated in the book, they’ve voted Democrat their whole lives) and B: That Political Correctness is just one gear in the machine of the world before us.Compounded with Safetyism (which is mind-bogglingly out of place in the safest era in recorded history), For-Profit-Colleges (that want to rope in customers for as long as possible), and a newly mutated ladder in life in which most every aspect of maturity has been delayed, Haidt and Co. have presented a well-rounded picture that is deservingly multi-faceted and complex yet eminently readable and accessible for anyone with an IQ over 90. Given all the source material used, I was pleasantly surprised to read such an enjoyably well written tome that is as pertinent as it is convincing.While I certainly don’t agree with all their politics, conclusions (and even some of the research itself), having found myself working with Millennial peers over the past few years, this book has made me all the more aware of the immense shifts in culture and attitudes that have forged this generation and their values. For the most part, there really is, “nothing new under the sun,” but, for this generation, and the next, a whole host of changes have occurred and will certainly continue to occur and I hope we can have excellent researchers and educators as Haidt and Co. to help us make sense of the complexity before us.Thanks for listening.

A perennial since Plato. The book is deeper much more interesting than that. It is more a call to get over our desire to overprotect the next generation or smother them. Human beings need some sling and arrows in developing to build some resilience. It also is a call to drop some assumptions that have crept into the culture that any frustration, slight, or adversity makes one weaker. This cultivating of hypersensitivity can make later adulting very hard. the second bad idea is to trust your feelings, It may help with destroying death stars in sci-fi movies but can make it really hard to navigate a complicated social world and make dealing with people and life nearly impossible. People often have to check their feelings in real life or they can become wrecks. The third bad idea is that the world is good guys vs. bad guys. This is a prescription for extreme tribalism. These three bad ideas are driving a lot of the craziness of late. I am much farther to the left than the author who I am guessing is a centrist but there is a lot of wisdom in this book."
16,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6689871-justin-norman,5,"When I read Haidt's book, ""The Righteous Mind"", I found it to be the most important book I'd read in years, because it so accurately seemed to capture the central issues liberals and conservatives in America were having communicating with one another. This book zooms in to highlight these issues in even more accurate detail, in great part due to the fact that it was very recently written and published. Some examples: the blocking of political opponents from speaking publicly, the trending lie that if one feels unsafe one *is* unsafe, and the practice of ""common enemy identity politics"" as opposed to ""common humanity identity politics"". While the authors focus their attention on these issues as they appear on college campuses, I see very similar problems in many areas outside of colleges and outside the usual college age range. If I could recommend one political book for my friends to read this year, it would be this one, regardless of where they sit on the political spectrum. It skewers poor, distorted forms of communication using very recent examples, and offers productive suggestions for how to achieve social justice goals in healthier ways."
17,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1500718-ryan,4,"Much as I've come to admire Haidt, I'll admit that I was worried to see this title, which seems like a typical ""culture wars"" click bait. How did the book hold up upon reading it?This is a reasonably argued book about extreme incidents on American college campuses and how they relate to the larger culture. The title is bad, however, because it makes the text at first glance combative in a way that I don't associate with Haidt. (I generally view him as persuading from a pretty easily established common ground, such as when he discusses his use of prozac in The Happiness Hypothesis or how he explains in Righteous Mind that he was motivated by Al Gore's defeat in the 2000 American presidential election to study moral psychology.) In my humble opinion, it is easy to see where Haidt is coming from and why he finds his conclusions convincing. That is true here, even if the title is awful.Briefly, the book worries about a culture of ""safetyism."" There are three ""great untruths"" in safetyism, which are: 1) Fragility: what doesn't kill you makes you weaker 2) Emotional reasoning: always trust your feelings and 3) Us vs. Them: life is a battle between good and evil. They also highlight 10 distorted automatic thoughts, which are: mind reading, fortune telling (negatively predicting the future), catastrophic thinking, labelling, discounting the positive, negative filtering, overgeneralizing, dichotomous thinking, shoulds (""I should do well; if I don't, then I'm a failure""), and personalizing blame. The culture of safetyism does not challenge these distorted automatic thoughts, perhaps because it fears that it will make people feel bad about themselves, which sets off the untruths. As much as I distrust ""great"" anythings in social commentary about the present, I don't think it's hard to understand what they're talking about.For anyone who's reluctant to engage with a book that gives off even a whiff of ""culture wars"" discourse, I'll note that there are other interesting ideas here, such ""concept creep."" Haidt and Lukianoff explain that ""trauma"" originally described physical injury. It was then expanded to psychological trauma, but with the caution that psychological trauma happens in response to extreme situations. The unexpected death of one's spouse from a sudden illness would not qualify as traumatic under the second generation definition. However, the third generation definition now is determined by how the person characterizes the emotion. So if the unexpected death of one's spouse feels awful and the bereaved labels it traumatic, by this definition it is traumatic.As much as I'd like to promote Coddling as more than a book about culture wars questions, it does explore how they play out in Gen Z on college campuses. I was familiar with some of the violent protests the book explored, but not all of them. They really are awful, sometimes obnoxious, to read about. Are they typical of the larger culture or does it just feel like it?I was also surprised by Haidt and Lukianoff's history of how right-wing media outlets respond to anything that even vaguely threatens their worldview. At one point, they discuss a professor's theory about ancient statues--that they were not alabaster white originally but only later aged to those colors. In other words, the ancient world has become whiter in historical accounts. Fascinating! What happened when this theory was reported on right-wing news outlets? Threats of rape and death from people near and far. Let's imagine that we might include Coddling as part of a stack. What else might one read? I'd include Haidt's previous book, Righteous Mind, Ronson's So You've Been Publicly Shamed, and Nagle's Kill All Normies. What about Storr's Unpersuadables, a book that explores things that seem ridiculous and twists them until they seem convincing, or at least not ridiculous. (Russell is also quite good at this in his History of Western Philosophy, perhaps because he feels one should understand why people feel they are right before figuring out why they are wrong.) I've since read Saslow's Rising Out of Hatred, which may be one very effective demonstration of how campuses are not inherently dysfunctional. In it, the college population ostracizes a white nationalist, but some students also reach out to him to try to reverse his views. Maybe Haidt is focusing on atypical scenarios.We are not as good at empathy as we think we are, and it's difficult but worthwhile to charitably study views we are skeptical of. It's perhaps worth noting that I only picked up this book, with its click baity title, because I had a reading relationship with Haidt from his previous work. We live within bubbles that we are hardly aware of.*P.S. Since reading this book, I've heard Ezra Klein talk about these issues on his podcast (It's the Ask Ezra episode, somewhere around 3/4s in.) He is also going to have Haidt on the show--update again: it was interesting."
18,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18181298-tristram-shandy,4,"Never Judge a Book by Its TitleAdmittedly, a title like The Coddling of the American Mind might make you expect of cultural pessimist’s rant on how things in this word, or, preferably, country, are going to pot because people are just no longer what they used to be. And they never will be, any more, so that if you want to keep up with things, there is no alternative but mental potty-training. However, the authors, lawyer and First Amendment expert Greg Lukianoff and psychologist Jonathan Haidt, explain in their introduction how it came about that this rather provocative title was chosen, and if you care to read further than the first few words before indulging in the emotional pleasure of feeling offended, you will find that there is a second title, How Good Intentions and Bad Ideas Are Setting Up a Generation for Failure, which at least gives the other side the benefit of the doubt, by assuming they are being motivated by good intentions.The authors are concerned about the change of the intellectual climate on university campuses with the advent of the iGen students, a development which is marked by calls for safe spaces, trigger warnings, demands to disinvite speakers who voice ideas that may challenge certain students‘ beliefs, thereby making them feel uncomfortable, the establishment of a call-out culture and the spread of the ideology of safetyism. The latter is characterized by the creep-down of the word safety, which is no longer restricted to meaning physical safety but also the more vague concept of safety from unsettling feelings, mental discomfort and doubts, or simply from having to face thoughts, ideas and beliefs which one actually opposes. In short, the climate at universities, but also in society as a whole, has become more and more hostile to the free expression of thoughts that are incompatible with mainstream beliefs.Lukianoff and Haidt make out three ideas or modes of thinking which they hold responsible for this change in attitudes and intellectual climate and which, they say, not only endanger free speech and productive academic discussion but also, in the long run, harm those who embrace them in their daily lives. These bad ideas are1)	What doesn’t kill you makes you weaker. (The Untruth of Fragility),2)	Always trust your feelings. (The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning),3)	Life is a battle between good people and evil people. (The Untruth of Us vs. Them).I don’t want to explain these three detrimental ways of thinking in this short book review, mainly because you might want to read about them yourself in the book discussed here, but also because anyone who has noticed how indignation and public shaming competetions are run in social but also mainstream media knows in a way how these untruths work and how we are heading more and more towards a . Before I go on talking about this book, using these seemingly bad, bad words, it may be well to say that Lukianoff and Haidt are anything but polemical. Instead, they work upon the academic principle of presenting the arguments of the other side in the best light possible, trying to understand the motivations and intentions that lead to ideas and measures they themselves strongly disagree with. There is sound intellectual honesty and fairness at the bottom of this book, which is, by the way, a good example of how to avoid the third of the above-listed untruths, and which is also a prerequisite for starting a real discussion instead of shouting at and vilifying each other.The authors show how the three untruths work in university life where they start to hamper scientific progress and the exchange of ideas and viewpoints but also make it hard, or even impossible, to really prepare students for life. Then they present the sources from which the three faulty ideas sprang, namely the change of the political and social climate as such (e.g. through the rise of a provocation culture and apodictic thinking on both sides of the political spectrum), the rise of depression and anxiety among adolescents and children, the rise of overprotective parenting and the decline of free, unsupervised play due to a culture of safetyism, a „Cover Your Ass“ bureaucracy in schools and universities, and erroneous assumptions about the concept of social justice in modern-day political discussions and governmental acts.At the end of the book, the two authors dedicate a lot of time to showing how some of the fateful developments that lead to the spread of the three untruths can be remedied, one of them being the approach of preparing the child for the road rather than the road for the child, thus making children and adolescents actually stronger. All in all, their criticism and analysis of the three untruths is highly convincing, all the more so as they avoid simplistic finger-pointing and instead treat their subject-matter with an impressive degree of intellectual honesty. This book may be a bit repetitive at times, but on the whole, it really helped me get a better understanding of a trend I have also noticed in my own country, Germany, and which I think is something to worry about."

I wasn’t aware, however, until reading Greg Lukianoff and Jonathon Haidt’s book “The Coddling of the American Mind: How Good Intentions and Bad Ideas are Setting Up a Generation for Failure”, how things have changed so terribly.If you’ve followed the news at all in the past couple years, you’ll get a sense of how fucked up things are, but the media doesn’t always capture the whole story, and in today’s politically divisive atmosphere, the media is going to skew facts depending on where one stands, politically: those on the left see its significance overblown and exaggerated by the right, while those on the right see it as a sign of the apocalypse. The truth is, as always, somewhere in the middle.But things are really bad, and Lukianoff/Haidt have spent nearly a decade rigorously studying the whys and wherefores and hows of the whole mess. Their conclusion? Well-intentioned but nevertheless bad parenting, coupled with the rise of social media and roughly three extremely awful ideas that seemed to have permeated our culture as a whole, have created the perfect storm of an overprotected, anxious, depressed, and fragile generation of kids who can’t do anything.Lukianoff/Haidt can pretty much pinpoint exactly when things started going to shit. The year 2013; which is the year when kids born in 1995 started going to college. These kids, known as the iGen (anyone born in 1995 and beyond, during the years in which the Internet basically exploded in popularity), were a generation of kids who have, for the most part, been coddled and protected by smothering, overprotective “helicopter” parents. These are kids who, for the most part, spent most of their childhood indoors in front of a computer screen rather than socializing with other kids the old-fashioned way: outdoors and completely unsupervised, like those of us who grew up in the ‘60s, ‘70s, and ‘80s.For some reason, parents of the iGen instilled in their kids the sense that they were fragile creatures who could be easily hurt, maimed, or killed by anything that made them uncomfortable or frightened. Whether it was walking home from school, going to the mall with friends, watching zombie movies, or listening to speakers who espoused ideas that threatened to jostle their set religious and political beliefs, these kids learned that taking risks and being challenged was a bad thing. Herein lies the first of the three Great Untruths that Lukianoff/Haidt refer to as one of the underlying reasons that kids are the way they are:
The Untruth of Fragility: What doesn’t kill you makes you weaker.
Clearly, this is a reworking of Friedrich Nietzche’s famous aphorism, “What doesn’t kill you, makes you stronger”, which is basically a common theme in most classic literature and philosophy. It is the idea that in suffering and adversity one gain’s an appreciation for life and true consciousness. Seriously, everyone from Fyodor Dostoyevsky to Sigmund Freud has alluded to this idea.Yet, somewhere, somehow, in the late-20th century and early-21st century, this idea got flipped on its head.Lukianoff/Haidt believe that it started out with the best intentions. Parents want their kids to be safe. There’s nothing wrong with that, but when parents started going overboard and sheltering kids from everything out of a misguided belief that keeping kids away from things that could potentially cause injury (physical as well as mental), they were unknowingly creating paranoia and crippling anxiety in their kids.Protecting kids from dangerous objects is one thing. Protecting them from dangerous ideas goes against everything most psychologists and scientists would deem a healthy upbringing: “A culture that allows the concept of “safety” to creep so far that it equates emotional discomfort with physical danger is a culture that encourages people to systematically protect one another from the very experiences embedded in daily life that they need in order to become strong and healthy. (p. 29)” This culture of “Safetyism” that has evolved as a result is what has contributed to college campuses in which students have protested professors, speakers, and other students for saying things that they not only deem “offensive” but also “damaging” to their worldview and belief systems. Conservatives have cruelly dubbed these kids “snowflakes”, but it is simply a natural byproduct of what Lukianoff/Haidt refer to as the second Great Untruth.
The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: Always Trust Your Feelings.
We’re probably all guilty of spreading this one. Some of the blame can be handed to our collective national reactions to 9/11, in which it became an acceptable knee-jerk reaction to report anything suspicious, regardless of how trivial. “See Something, Say Something” was a popular ad campaign in the years immediately subsequent to September 11, 2001.There is something to be said for listening to one’s inner voice sometimes. If you get a bad vibe from your weird uncle or that older kid down the street that’s always trying to lure kids into his house with candy, maybe you should listen to those feelings.Unfortunately, some kids have taken this approach way too far, to the point that anyone who says anything that is deemed “offensive” (a rather subjective label), intentionally or not, is an awful bigoted person who has committed a crime against their person. Needless to say, this does not cultivate a healthy learning environment.This is why the incidents of “disinviting” guest speakers to college campuses has risen in the past few years. It’s why the UC Berkley campus---a college once known as a bastion of free speech---recently erupted in violence by protestors who refused to let guest speakers speak.It goes against everything that a free speech advocate believes in, and the irony is that these students believed that they were protesting in the name of “tolerance”.It also goes against the very idea of education, as expressed by Hanna Holborn Gray: “Education should not be intended to make people comfortable; it is meant to make people think. (p. 51)”Unfortunately, in this toxic atmosphere of political divisions and bitterness, the third Great Untruth rears its head.
The Untruth of Us Versus Them: Life is a Battle Between Good People and Evil People. 
Life isn’t simple, or black and white. There’s a lot of grey areas that can be confusing and uncomfortable to deal with.One of the toughest grey areas to grasp is the idea that no one is completely good or evil, that we are all split down the middle. Unfortunately, an entire generation has apparently grown up to believe the opposite: that there are good people (us) who must constantly, vigilantly, stand up to the forces of evil people (them). In the nineteenth-century, Karl Marx simplified the dichotomy of man by separating people into the bourgeoisie (the capitalists, or rich people) vs. the proletariat (the workers). Today, the split has morphed into liberals versus conservatives, or the Left vs. the Right. There used to be a time when the Left and the Right simply disagreed on issues but managed to remain civil, knowing that neither side was necessarily right or wrong, good or evil, just different. This has changed, especially in the minds of young people. Today, most college students (a vast majority of which tend to lean left) view those on the Right as an enemy; a particularly evil one, too. College campuses, which are predominantly liberal, have made it very difficult for conservatives. Conservative professors have seen a rise in administrations chastising or firing them for seemingly innocuous slights, more often than not interpreted as offenses against a student or students.This has resulted in a stressful “walking on eggshells” by conservatives in an attempt to not garner the wrath of liberal students. It has become so bad that many conservative professors simply remove parts of their curricula that they think students will find “offensive” or simply quit. Neither option is conducive to a healthy learning environment. 
A Simple Fix
Lukianoff/Haidt don’t just examine the problem. They even offer solutions, some of which are so common sense that it is frightening that most parents, teachers, and college administrators haven’t already enacted them. Unfortunately, therein lies part of the problem.While it’s easy to make fun of or even feel pity for these college kids, it’s not always easy to assess blame, especially when the blame rests on all of us: parents, teachers, college administrators, politicians, scientists. Everyone has helped to perpetuate the untruths mentioned here, so it is up to us to recognize what we’ve done wrong and correct it.One way to do that is read this book. Seriously, this book should be required reading for every parent today."

To be strong, they need a Darwinian fitness environment that exposes them to calculated levels of stress. On a physical level, we all accept that the stress of exercise at an appropriate level makes us stronger. But something similar applies to our psychological lives. Some level of adversity and discomfort is not just desirable but necessary to make people mentally and spiritually strong enough to face the vicissitudes and challenges of existence. Without struggles and hardship, which, whether we try to avoid them or not، at some point are inevitable in life, we will be unable to become well-rounded people.As the authors contend, a younger generation is now coming of age which, reared in certain institutions, has been raised on an unhealthy expectation of insulation from discomfort. They are likely to become the new elites of society and have an attitude unfamiliar to older generations, as well as people from lower classes (the majority of people). The habits of mind being inculcated to them are ones of catastrophic thinking, emotional reasoning and Manichean moral frameworks. Rather than as a political disagreement, even a fierce disagreement, the presence of unwelcome ideas is being medicalized and described as a threat to people's physical safety and mental well-being. Even wrong words, regardless of intent, are considered as somehow ""violent"" in and of themselves. To put it another way people are being encouraged by certain institutions to be as psychologically weak as possible. The authors identify three ""Great Untruths"" being taught to many young people: that bad experiences make you weaker, that life can be described simply as a battle between oppressor and oppressed classes and that emotional reasoning is something positive. This is bad advice and something like teaching millions of people to do the opposite of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy on themselves. It is inculcating ideas of intense victimhood even in materially privileged people and teaching them at this is a normal way to feel, while also make them hyper-sensitive to perceived signs of disrespect. These attitudes are now slowly trickling down through elite cultural production and also undergoing ""concept creep"" in which old definitional categories of negative social phenomena are slowly and steadily expanding to a wider range of behaviors without anyone knowing where the boundaries are really located. Needless to say this is not a recipe for creating a happy and well-adjusted society.There are certain expressions of language and sociological behaviors among the generation that came just after millennials that are difficult for me to comprehend. This book helped me understand them a bit better. There is also a fascinating (and somewhat disturbing) intellectual lineage going back to the critical theory scholar Herbert Marcuse and an essay he wrote titled ""Repressive Tolerance"" in the 1960s that seems to inform much cultural left-wing discourse today and that also receives some attention here. Some of the sections about ""campus culture"" left me wondering whether previous generations of university students were not also similarly culturally alien to those older than them, but simply aged into more sensible views later in life. This had long been my assumption, though I'm admittedly unsure of the mechanics. In any case, this book helped me understand several things like that which were culturally unfamiliar to me. It is soberly written, reasonable and non-polemic despite its provocative title."

The authors are directing their exposition to the parents of the generation that followed, what they call iGen (internet generation), sometimes referred to as Generation Z. I agree that what they call Three Bad Ideas are bad. Our approach was the opposite. As soon as our kids were old enough, we explained that life was a process of overcoming their fears.I was already familiar with their examples of overreaction on both the Right and the Left from following the news. And have already read many books on the impact of social media on the psyche and social life of users. I agree with the authors that the release of the iPhone in 2007 is a major milestone in all of this.----------Some firsthand reportage from a former dean of students at Stanford....https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/e..."

That is nothing remarkable in itself, unless you realize that these issues and the perspectives shared in this book have become taboo in our identity-saturated culture. What the authors have done is spoken the unspeakable. In so doing, they have nobly spotted the dangers of political correctness, 'vindictive protectiveness', and 'safetyism', and provided a stark warning to educators and laymen alike.Lukianoff and Haidt do not provide the most robust explanation of how we got here, preferring to remain local and focus on the psychological rather than sociological, political, economic, or philosophical. This is to their credit as non-partisan observers. But it does leave the reader hoping for more depth. It is telling that the authors do not mention Allan Bloom's masterpiece precursor to this work, which takes a broader philosophical view and more adequately explains the origins of our problems.So too do the solutions provided leave much to be desired. Most are commonsensical and some are not practical. The intention is good, and they follow the argument, but they leave the reader wondering if there is something more.Still, The Coddling provides a number of valuable insights. The open-eyed reader will be astonished at the richness of the psychological concepts that Lukianoff and Haidt infuse into their narrative: Concept Creep, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Institutionalized Disconfirmation, and Problems of Progress to name a few of the more fascinating ones. Combining these with the plentiful on-campus examples of coddling gone amok, the authors offer perhaps the best summary of our modern university problems to date.Altogether, this book will serve well anyone who is bold enough to face the uncomfortable truth that we are setting up our future generations for depression and failure, and hopeful enough to do something about it."

The authors examine the root of divisiveness plaguing American society, the increasing inability of individuals of all political persuasions to engage in rational, intelligent, thoughtfully reasoned debate and dialogue. Complicit in this alarming decline are institutions of higher learning embracing emotionalism over critical and analytical thinking, dialectics, and abandoning their sacred obligation to defend academic and intellectual freedom. Equally complicit are parents who smother their children with overprotection to the point that they are emotionally and intellectually infantilized. The consequences of having a generation unable and/or unwilling to engage intellectually and thoughtfully with ideas that make them uncomfortable are profoundly dire for society, opening the door to forms of authoritarianism across the political spectrum."

It tackles issues within both the political left and the political right. The book mainly focuses in on college campuses which have become increasingly left-wing but the authors also zoom out and look at the poor reactions from right-wing fringe groups and even mainstream conservatism. The two authors have presented a strong case for free speech and a renewed sense of trust in the American people to be able to sift through different ideas and make smart choices about which ones reign true and which ones prove false. Highly recommend!

32,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28777221-sharad-pandian,3,"If you've been following the fracas on and surrounding American universities, there's nothing new in this book for you.As the title suggests, Jonathan Haidt and Greg Lukianoff argue that American children from the iGen generation (born 1995 or beyond) are raised in situations and using methods unique in ways that make them interpret discomfort as danger. This makes them unable to cope, and harms them and their causes.I. Why this book is a waste of spaceTo understand why this book goes wrong, its important to appreciate a central tension in the way we think about ideas. On one hand, clearly people have been wrong about so much in the past and therefore as Mill suggests we should keep avenues for debate and change always open. On the other hand, the content of ideas currently held actually matter because they shape the world we live in both symbolically and materially. Therefore, if a certain idea is deemed wrong, it is important to resist it and its spread. It's the inability of creatures like ourselves, condemned to live in time, to resolve this tension in any general way that leads to so much chatter about free speech and its limits.The problem with the authors of this book is that they model debates as though ideas don't matter except for debate, as though fermenting debate itself were the point of ideas. The notion that there power differentials that are deeply entrenched and might not be removed by polite argumentation doesn't even come up.For example, a convenient manner to think about oppression is through ""structural analysis"" which helps make sense of the institutions and experiences that are frequent and persistent. To live in this miasma isn't merely about encountering scary ideas but actually being harmed in a variety of ways, and it really is unclear what the best way to resist and liberate. But the authors are convinced that they know best, since obviously more speech and more ideas is how victory will be won. They make much use of how the recent victories for same-sex marriage included campaigning that stressed similarity and shared community, but conveniently leave out how Stonewall was a riot.When they come close to discussing the obviously relevant idea of power, they just manage feebly to say:In calling for the dismantling of power structures, the author was using a set of terms and concepts that are common in some academic departments; the main line of argumentation fell squarely within the large family of Marxist approaches to social and political analysis. It’s a set of approaches in which things are analyzed primarily in terms of power. Groups struggle for power. Within this paradigm, when power is perceived to be held by one group over others, there is a moral polarity: the groups seen as powerful are bad, while the groups seen as oppressed are good. It’s a variant of the pathological dualism that Rabbi Sacks described in the quotation at the start of this chapter.All structural analysis are first reduced to ""groups struggle for power"" and then into instances of ""pathological dualism"" between the ""unimpeachably good and the irredeemably bad"".There are a lot of serious critiques possible about the relevance and fruitfulness of thinking about oppression as ""structural"", but this glib dismissal is intellectually embarrassing.Their unwillingness to take power seriously makes this entire book a slog through shallow liberal moralizing. Instead of responding to Down Girl: The Logic of Misogyny's point about how it is better to concentrate on the incident and impact instead of intent, because it makes it much, much harder to call out harmful behaviour, they just assume intent is what matters, and so anyone thinks otherwise is labouring under a ""cognitive distortion""The most evident is catastrophizing: If Milo Yiannopoulos is allowed to speak, there will be “broken bodies” on our side. I might lose my “right to exist.” Therefore, violence is justified, because it is self-defense. The author also engages in dichotomous thinking: If you condemn my side’s violence, that means you condone Yiannopoulos’s ideas. You must “pick a side.” You’re either with us or against us. Life is a battle between good people and evil people, and if you disagree with us, you’re one of the evil people…But if asking for peaceful dialogue is violent, then it seems that the word “violence” is taking on new meanings for some students.The point here isn't even that the Milo protests were the obvious way to go (although Milo's inability to get funding since suggests so), but that it's quite impossible to know antecedently or even in the short-term which strategies will be successful. Does treating every small incident as though it's important work better or does taking a more judicious strategy? Despite this lack of clarity about the truth, the authors frame the debate as young college students with good hearts making foolish choices instead of considering that they might possibly be engaging in successful resistance to entrenched evils.II. Why this book is still importantDespite this, there are three reasons this still remains a decent book.First, a significant chunk of the book concerns trends that converge in the iGen generation, including the lack of opportunity for free play, more bureaucracy, etc. It's really fun to read in one place, even if the information isn't new Second, it really is true that a lot of incidents of campus have been horrific, indicating that thinking you're on the right side of history allows for sadism and heedlessness. If you're on social media and have a functioning brain, you know the Left can go overboard in its mob mentality. As from above, I don't think we can say with certainty that these methods as a whole won't be successful, but they clearly do go against strong moral sensibilities at times. The Heckler's veto against anyone conservative, violence, cruelty all seem unacceptable, however much we tell ourselves it might ultimately be for the best.Third, the book is a lot more compelling if we don't think of it as a political project at all, but about psychologists simply talking about trends in the progressive movement that might be affecting mental health, fostering unhealthy ideas, and leading to irrational behaviour. At higher levels of explanation, trends might emerge that might be difficult to account for on a case-by-case basis, and I think the authors present a plausible case that taken as a whole, a lot of practices might be making the situation worse for students.Overall, a book better read as a summary of recent events on American campuses than as any kind of original contribution."
33,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2473528-roseanna-white,5,"Everyone with kids college-aged or younger needs to read this book! It addresses the trend of ""safetyism"" and student fragility--that the ideas of ""dangerous"" have crept from physical harm to emotional discomfort, which is proven not to make our kids STRONGER, but rather emotionally WEAKER. In it the authors not only discuss the problems that have come rather suddenly to college campuses, but the reasons behind them, and how we as parents and educators can correct it . The main theme is that there are Three Great Untruths that a generation has been taught to embrace, but which are what the psychology field knows are ""cognitive distortions."" Harmful ways of thinking that encourage us to see catastrophe, bias, and enemies where there are none. These are things we can universally recognize as untrue...but which are so easy to fall into.I'm not a big non-fiction reader these days, but I loved this book and have already made some changes to the rules for my kids based on the very sound evidence presented in it, as well as the wonderful advice.What I loved most about this book though is that it's quite possibly the only UNBIASED view I've encountered in recent years. Near the end of the book the authors do tell us their political views but up until they came out and said it, I had no idea whether they were liberal or conservative, D or R, even though they were discussing issues that dealt with the widening gap between them. They instead got at exactly what they encourage their readers to get at in our own lives: the wider circle of humanity to which we all belong."

35,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12766685-alison,3,"First - I agree with their argument on free-play time for children. As a mom, I see this as an essential part of growing up and their discussion really helped me to figure out some of the reasons why it has felt important but I was struggling to articulate that. I also appreciated the points they made about safetyism. It is something I have seen and I now have a label for it and can hopefully better communicate the risks.But, I also struggled often with this book. I think that saying someone shouldn't be offended by a comment that you didn't know would be offensive removes the responsibility from the speaker to learn anything that could stop them from saying hurtful/offensive things in the future - most of the examples they use are of ways in which people say things that perpetuate systems of oppression (racism, sexism, etc) and by shrugging things off, the system doesn't get fixed. If the speaker were able to listen and change, then getting offended wouldn't be useful, but too often that's not the outcome. This is a topic I have been working though - I don't always understand why someone got offended, but when I listen or read, I can usually get it. But it comes back on me to learn, not them to get thick skin (I'm not always the speaker, but usually a somewhat confused bystander in these cases).It will raise my hackles when a book uses the version of MLK Jr that only encompasses his Dream speech and not also his other letter, sermons, and speeches. I think they simplified things too much on this respect.The sections laying out how various professors and others in academia have been mistreated was good at pointing out the failings of those areas, but I think that if you are looking for it you could easily find bad behavior in religion, in business, in government, etc. Every aspect of our culture contains humans and within that subset, they may *misbehave* in different ways, but every area has people who misuse power or are unqualified. I also have a few gripes with the way they discuss campus protests. I think we would agree about a lot of this, but I want to point that people like Heather McDonald and Charles Murray have writt books, the people protesting them are almost certainly aware of their views (either by reading the book or discussing parts of it) and they are choosing to say that this person has bad ideas. It is not that HM or CM don't get any chance to speak or promote their ideas - they still have free speech. It is more that students wish the wouldn't be given platforms for these ideas. I agree with Coddling in that violence is abhorrent and counterproductive, but they way they frame the rest of the conversation is in error.Overall - it was a book that made me think, but had some very problematic portions."
36,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1655983-katie,1,"The flaws of this book cloud the conclusion. Some of the flaws:-Anecdotes about campus events are used despite authors demand that everyone be more focused on facts and data. Some of the incidents described are indeed examples of extreme sensitivity and intolerance. Worrisome trend, but not convincing that campuses have abandoned free speech.-Serious lack of time spent on investigating and confirming the issues college students care about. The Trump administration is a frightening turn, threatening institutions and norms - shouldn't we expect young people to protest?-CBT as a treatment for anxiety I get, but as a treatment for real threats and oppression? So insulting! We have an administration threatening to take away healthcare, women's health care, rights of immigrants, gay people, minorities. What happens when a lesbian girl is told a speaker believes she is deviant who needs to go to conversion camp? She should practice CBT and remember the speaker has good intentions? When Richard Spencer coming to campus to spout off about peaceful ethnic cleansing, should students practice CBT? Just because the book does justice to some topics - like IGen social issues, helicopter parenting and safteyism, - does not mean the book works. I also happen to agree this generation does not conceive of the First Amendment like my generation does. College kids raised with awareness of inequality in American, we were raised to worry about authoritarianism and the Cold War. I think the topic deserves scrutiny, but these authors failed in my opinion. "
37,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5862443-joseph-stieb,4,"Full disclosure: I am a Haidt fanboy, so I'm predisposed to like this book. Unlike the Righteous Mind, it is not outstanding. Books that are elaborations of long-form articles rarely are. If you follow Haidt and Lukianoff's work closely, this is mainly a summary of what they have been doing the last 4 years of so (see Haidt's excellent Wriston Lecture for a distillation). Still, this is a strong, well-sourced, and fair-minded argument about where higher ed has turned wrong and how it can be rectified.Haidt and Lukianoff argue for an older understanding of the purpose of higher education: the pursuit of truth rather than the furthering of a political agenda. They convincingly show how higher ed has become more partisan and less ideologically diverse, although they don't do much to show how this stultifies and biases research and teaching (for more on this, see Shields and Dunn's outstanding Passing on the Right). Their focus is on why things like trigger warnings, disinvitations, interruptions of speakers, micro-aggressions, etc have surged on campus in the last 5 years or so. The core of their argument is less about ideology than generational shifts. Despite the somewhat inflammatory title, they put forth a complex, nuanced argument that the I-Gen (born in mid 1990s, came of age with cellphones and social media as normal things, in contrast to millennial, who were teens when the iPhone and facebook came out) is a far more anxious and dependent generation that doesn't know how to handle conflict on its own and has been coached to go to the authorities instead. Take a far more polarized, bureaucratized university system, and you get more kids calling for ""coddling"" and more administrators giving it to them to prevent their school from becoming the next Yale or Missouri. The leftist intellectual framework that these students embrace (redefinition of safety and violence, identitarian common enemy politics, a radical interpretation intersectionality, the dismissal of anything written by a dead white guy as not worth reading because he must have been a racist/sexist) isn't the deeper cause of this surge in left-wing activism on campus. Rather, changes in the climate of US politics and the way kids are raised primes them to take in this ideological system. This can be changed on both ends, although I am more interested in how to change to college atmosphere and how to make these ideas (each of which has some value) more realistic and less polarizing and politically ""weaponized.""The intellectual cases put forth against all of these concepts that have crept into academia are excellent, as usual. They explain how each of these things encourages mentally and intellectually unhealthy thinking, feeds tribalism, and makes open, trusting conversation impossible on campus. Still, I thought they were getting a little loose from their moorings in their criticism of modern parenting. It is hard to tell parents to not be a little over-protective of their kids. There are ways to do this (like more unstructured time built into a kid's day, at school and at home, plus less screen time) but overall I think most parents do a pretty good job. I think they are both part of pretty elite social circles in which tiger parenting was very common. My middle class upbringing seemed to have plenty of free time, and my parents let me and my brothers roam the neighborhood pretty freely. I wouldn't dismiss all of their argument about parenting, but it was probably the weak link in the book.I'd recommend this book to anyone concerned about changes on campus or anyone who has heard about Haidt and is curious. It is concise, and very qualified. As usual, Haidt's critics have misrepresented his argument left and right, so make sure you go to the source."

While it's useful to have the earlier background on past decades in academia, Bloom's original is not required reading before enjoying Haidt's great contribution here.These authors lead the reader through some great analyses -- they show how a drastic shift in the mentality of arguments/debate on college campuses happened in 2013, along with a seemingly drastic shift in mindset surrounding the purpose of education. I'll list some of their principles here: Prepare the child for the road, not the road for the child. We are all prone to emotional reasoning and confirmation bias. Your worst enemy cannot harm you as much as your own unguarded thoughts. People are prone to catastroph-izing about the future. We are all prone to tribalism. Many psychological principles on college campuses encourage students to embrace foolishness, rather than wisdom. Young people are innately anti-fragile, but they learn helplessness in correlation with rising rates of adolescent depression and anxiety, a shift to more protective parenting, and widespread play deprivation and risk deprivation. We are seeing rising political polarization and expanded bureaucracy. We also see a rising passion for justice combined with a growing commitment to attaining equal outcomes in all areas. The rise in passion for justice is admirable on its own, but when combined with a demand to see equity, not equality, it becomes misguided.Some falsehoods: What doesn't kill you, makes you weaker.

This monograph explores how 'fragility' is being developed in children, adolescence and students on university campuses. While much of the attention is on the left and social justice politics, there is some focus on the polarization of politics from the alt-right.The problems with this book are clear. The authors confuse a diversity of facts and interpretations with emotions rather than rigour. EH Carr stated in 1961 that ""history means interpretation."" Only particular facts have survived to our present. Therefore assuming that the source material - the material culture - that remains in our present is accurate, true and convincing while alternative interpretations are emotional or intuitive perpetuates a mis-understanding of history, media and politics.Are students fragile? Perhaps. The greater question is why students are fragile. That is the question not asked or answered in this book. Unemployment, under-employment, exhorbitant fees for education, ridiculous payments for privatized utilities, and ill-information public policies are only part of our corrosive present.Protests exist because there is no space to be different, to be defiant, and - in the case of George Floyd - to breathe. This is not emotion or intent. This is verified and an outcome of claustropolitan structures. A provocative book. It lacks a deep engagement of the political economy. Therefore - and ironically - it is part of the identity politics superficiality it wishes to critique."
41,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7258380-dan-graser,5,"This collaboration between Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt is fantastic on many levels and addresses a thorny issue with precision, honesty, and language that is free of the usual superficial pejoratives found in such discussions. They begin with three fundamental Untruths that they have distilled from their own experiences working in academia and social psychology:1) What doesn't kill you makes you weaker.2) Always trust your feelings.3) Life is a battle between good people and evil people.These ideas are discussed in the context of current political divides, campus culture, parenting, and general discourse on social media. Throughout, they use 6 ""explanatory threads"" to understand how we have gotten where we are, sociologically and politically:1) There has been a steady increase in affective polarization since the 1980's, such that people don't feel a stronger kinship with their party but bond more over hatred of the opposition.2) There has been a nation-wide rise in adolescent anxiety and depression since 2011, mainly affecting those who belong to the ""iGen"" or Generation Z.3) There has been a shift, starting in the 80's and reaching a peak in the 90's among more educated families especially, to fearful and needlessly overprotective ""paranoid parenting.""4) The steady decline of unsupervised free play among children due to the above trend. 5) The growth of campus bureaucracy and the expansion of over-protection of students who themselves, don't wish it or need it, resulting in the transmission of the very type of psychological issues the campus is trying to prevent. 6) The rise of social justice activism, rightfully, in response to turbulent and emotionally powerful political events between 2012 and 2018.As someone who works in academia and is genuinely concerned about students' well-being, I always enjoy reading works that provide data, facts, and arguments based in psychology to suggest how we can improve that mission while dealing with the issues present in the larger social-political context, with which our students are dealing. This book contains the finest discussion of this I have seen in addition to great, level-headed discussions of modern parenting, social justice activism, and identity politics. Well worth your time!"

43,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2319320-melissa,5,"Wonder why the young generation seems so bad at thinking? This book sheds light on what ""we"" collectively as a society have done to cause it. We've taught three falsehoods as truth: That individuals are fragile, that we can trust our feelings, that life is a battle between good and bad people. Do you feel, like me, that there is no way you're going to write down your thoughts on a particular topic esp. publicly, because no matter how well reasoned or how good your intentions, if you use one wrong word, you're deemed evil for life by one side or the other? (You're ""cancelled."") We've hearkened back to the time of witch hunts, and I found that chapter of the history of what leads to the eras of witch hunts (which we're in a time of those right now) enlightening about why the heck one word in a well meant email can cause a person's complete ruin. We need to get back to a time where we give people the benefit of the doubt! The information on Cognitive Behavior Therapy was also enlightening. As a society, we are essentially going against good psychological practice and teaching bad ways of thinking. One of my sons is a doomsday thinker and I'm happy to have some of these CBT tools to see if I can help him stop the negative thinking habits of thinking the worst about everything and everybody. We see this reflected in society right now, everyone jumps to conclusions on a story that's not an hour old with nothing but a headline and decide they have the ability to be judge, jury, and executioner on that alone and then move on as if ruining that person's life was not a weighty matter. I don't want my son growing up to be like that and it's been frustrating to try to talk him out of his thought processes because I want him to grown up sound of mind unlike many people I've encountered lately, and I've wondered why it is they can be such bad thinkers, and this book enlightens on that some of the reasons.The practical application section is worth the price of the read on what we can do to turn the boat around. Thankfully, I've been already doing a lot of the suggestions for my kids in my determination to have them grow up sound of mind, but this was nice to have the facts and stats to help solidify what I'm doing to help. This is another book that shows our overly scheduled, screen-heavy existence is doing nothing good for our youth. The authors of this book reveal toward the end of the book what their political leanings are and they're nearly the opposite of mine, but I'd say there is no slant, because I agreed with nearly all of it, it was logical, reasoned, well laid out--we're facing a problem that affects both sides of the political spectrum. It is a bit of a slog at the beginning with all the research and the fact that they are very academic writers with the ""I'll tell you this, I'm telling you, and now I'll summarize what I just told you"" which probably is all right if you're one to read at leisure instead of read books from cover to cover like me, that would help you remember what you read if you put it down for any amount of time, but be forewarned that it isn't a fast paced read. But it's an excellent read."

But if that's how you're feeling, I would encourage you to give it a shot.Although there are lots of examples from college campuses, they're pretty balanced between things that overly-sensitive people are doing and things that crazy people are doing (usually white power weirdos). And while there is some condemnation of behavior, I felt like the author was very empathetic towards people and wasn't saying anything remotely like, ""These snowflakes need to shape up!"" or ""These iGen kids are ruining everything!"" If you read it that way, that's probably your preconceived notion and sensitivity lenses at work, not the real content of the book. The most interesting portions to me were related to parenting and how much it's changed in just a few decades. There was a section that listed a checklist for parents for school readiness for young kids. 30 or 40 years ago, the list was a lot of things like, ""You child can ride a two-wheel bicycle, Your child can walk alone to a store or home 2 or 3 blocks away..."" where now it looks more like, ""Your child can spell phonetically, Your child can understand basic mathematical concepts..."" So where once it was ""Is your child capable of managing their physical safety?"" now it's more ""Can your child fill out a worksheet?"" Which seems profoundly stupid to me. This is my Okay Boomer moment, so buckle up.When I was a kid we used to roam around the town in small groups of 2-4 kids. Sometimes on bikes, sometimes just walking. And it wasn't like we had to check in every hour with our parents. I rode the bus to the mall. I would go to the grocery store alone or with a friend. In the summer, this was basically all we did, screw around during unstructured time. You learn a lot without realizing it. You learn to avoid true danger, like weirdos and creeps. You learn how to do simple shit like walk into a grocery store, pick something out and pay for it. You learn how to take a bus. You learn the geography of where you live. I had a coworker who lived in a very safe neighborhood and wouldn't allow her son to walk to the bus alone. It was like a block. Eventually, she did let him do it, but he had to be on a walkie talkie and talk to her the whole time until he got on the bus. I've had a number of people tell me that when their kids are learning to drive, they have no idea where they are inside of their own towns. They don't know how to get from home to school. Every day, the school I work next to, parents line up their cars to drive up to the door of the school, at which point their child is released, gets in the car, and then the parents drive them home. Like they're goddamn diplomats in need of a secure escort. This line of cars extends several blocks, and parents will wait up to an hour in a line of cars to pick up their kids. The kids can walk or bike or whatever, but very few, if any, do this, and if they do want to do it this way the parents have to sign a waiver. I can already hear the parents: You don't have a kid, so you don't understand. If you don't have kids, you'll hear this all the time. And I totally agree, I don't have the emotional understanding of a parent. However, I would proffer this: I probably have a more realistic assessment of danger to children because I'm NOT a parent. I'm not emotionally invested, which means when I'm looking at the realistic dangers, my thinking isn't tainted by my personal stakes. There are some parents who agree with me, that kids should have a little more freedom. There was the mom profiled in the book, the sort of mother of the Free Range Kids movement, who let her young son ride the subway home by himself at one point, which turned out great.I do think kids probably need a little more room, a little more agency, and a little less structure. One of the more profound insights in the book had to do with the level of discourse we're experiencing today. In short, people suck at discussing things because they never had un-referee'ed disagreements as kids. When you're a kid, if you're playing a game with 4 other kids, you have to learn how to argue or disagree without the other kid getting up and leaving, at which point the game is unplayable. Newer parents tend to referee everything, jumping in if things get intense. But letting kids work these things out themselves might be a way to help them learn the skills of discussing things without getting to the point that everyone takes their ball and goes home.The best part of the book, however, is that it offers a lot of potential solutions. I've found that I'm a solutions-based thinking, so solutions speak to me. Even when I disagree with the solutions, I think solutions-oriented thinking speaks to me and gets me thinking along the lines of productive movement. Way too many books that I might put in the sociology category seem very focused on talking about the problem. I usually hear what the author is saying and think, ""Okay, I buy that this is a problem, but what now?"" To borrow an analogy from another book, a problem that's well-explained is great, but if you went to the doctor with a pain, and if that doctor could explain why you're feeling this pain, does knowing the pain's origin solve the problem? No. You go to the doctor not for an explanation of the history of the pain, but for the cure. It's how I feel when a cold is being passed around the office, and everyone wants to trace back to patient zero. As if it's really that person's fault. Sidebar: it's my pet peeve that people come in when they're sick. Don't do that. But once you're sick, figuring out who ""got you sick"" is a complete waste of time and energy. Once you know, does that help your symptoms? Does it speed your recovery? Absolutely not. Yes, I think the history of some things can be valuable in understanding them. But the history and origin of a problem without solution is not terribly useful. I think a lot of people don't have the guts to offer a solution. Because that's the easiest thing to attack. You can nitpick someone's solution, which will be seen as an effective way of discrediting their entire argument. Which is stupid. I deeply appreciate the solutions offered in this book, especially because they're solutions based mostly in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (which totally works) and because they're solutions that any individual can choose to apply. It's not a set of solutions that goes ""You motherfuckers need to stop doing X."" It's a set of solutions oriented towards, ""If you want to be a better person and have a better life, here are some realistic options.""Great read, and I'd definitely call it a must-read for parents of young kids who haven't given a lot of thought to giving their kid some rope. And parents who feel pressured by other parents, who are afraid of being seen as bad parents."
45,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31910342-josh,3,"I previously read Lukianoff's ""Unlearning Liberty"" earlier this year. While I thoroughly enjoyed that work, I was somewhat disappointed by this joint venture with social psychologist Jonathan Haidt. This is partly because while ""Unlearning Liberty"" was a searching examination of how higher education in recent years has failed in its central purpose to discover ""truth"" by prohibiting many forms of offensive speech on campus, this book tries to further that inquiry in some ways by putting together a composite of factors for why ""iGen"" (those who were born c. 1996) have embraced ""safetyism"" on college campuses. ""Safetyism"" is essentially the conflation of being offended with being in physical danger. The book is divided into three parts. The first unpacks what the authors call the ""three great untruths"" that iGen embraces: the world is divided between distinctly ""good"" people and wholly ""bad"" people; trust your feelings (i.e. emotional reasoning over logic); and ""safetyism"" which the authors describe as ""what doesn't hurt you, makes you weaker."" The second narrates a series of recent episodes of censorship and both far left/far right violence on college campuses, such as Berkeley Antifa protests against Milo Yiannopolis, the Alt-Right protests at UVA; and the Charles Murray episode at Middlebury. The final part explains what the authors believe are the six contributing factors that are the ""bad ideas [that] are setting up a generation for failure."" The last two chapters in this section deal with a) how parents should ideally raise children to be thick-skinned and critically thinking adults and b) how primary and secondary education can offer adolescents and teenagers the mental toolset to confront offensive ideas and grow intellectually from such debates. There is a lot of ground to cover in any review of this book (and much of what follows in this paragraph I explain in more detail in my review of Unlearning Liberty). But, the gist is that colleges and universities should be wholly focused on discerning ""truth."" Various public intellectuals, such as Van Jones, have argued that colleges provide people with a rare opportunity to grapple with offensive ideas and speech by using reasoning and argument. College should be a ""gym,"" to borrow from Van Jones, that trains people to debate and compromise within our democratic system. Since the early 2010s, though, many colleges (and almost exclusively the most liberal ones) have become distracted from the goal of seeking ""truth"" by protecting students from potentially offensive speech. There's an appropriate discussion within this section of how the left has stretched the definition of ""violence"" to include intuitively nonviolent actions, such as speech. By construing offensive speech as ""violent,"" college administrators, faculty, and students have effectively nullified the free speech privileges of a wide swathe of conservative intellectuals (and alt-right wackos) by appealing to the need to keep students ""safe"" on campus. The six factors that have contributed to the current climate of ""Safetyism,"" censorship, and unrest are best summed up as follows:1) American politics have become increasingly polarized (entering a ""polarization cycle"") where very little compromise is ever reached between left and right.2) The advent of social media and the internet has made ""iGen"" far more depressed and anxious than previous generations. 3) Parents since the 1980s have increasingly become ""helicopter"" parents, not allowing their children to experience any discomfort and sheltering them from the real world, so to speak. 4) What the authors term the ""decline of [free] play."" In other words, children have far less time relative to previous generations to socialize, initiate play, and be creative. This is caused by the fact that elite colleges and universities select from those with an abundance of extracurriculars (etc.) and parents respond by over-structuring their children's time with various activities. 5) Primary and secondary education have become obsessed with keeping students ""safe"" from offensive ideas and taboo subjects. 6) ""Social justice"" and its quest for equal outcomes has created a ""common enemy identity politics"" focused on subdividing people into various ""intersectional"" identities. The authors compare this to Martin Luther King, Jr.'s ""common humanity"" identity politics that sought to authentically include all Americans in the civil rights movement by appealing to the American civic religion. These six factors (covered in six chapters) are unevenly persuasive, although I generally agree with the authors that the cult of ""safe spaces"" and ""free speech zones"" on campuses is extremely problematic. I think I agree with some of the other reviews on Goodreads that some of their solutions contain assumptions grounded in a middle-class ethos. Specifically, their idea that children should be given more rein to explore their neighborhoods, talk to strangers, and even use public transportation at young ages (i.e. nine years old). The authors argue that our perception of danger is massively inflated by the 24 hour news cycle and John Walsh's crusade to catch ""America's Most Wanted."" I agree in part, but would argue that many parents (and single parents) living in certain rural or urban areas with high crime rates have legitimate concerns about allowing their children to be ""free range children."" Being a parent myself, I generally found their Dr. Spock parental advice annoying, at best, and naive at worst. Overall, an informative book that resonated well with my experience on campus the past seven years. Excepting the final two concluding chapters, I completely recommend this book to anyone seriously interested in learning more about what is happening on America's college campuses. But you should first read ""Unlearning Liberty."" "

The stories can definitely get your blood pumping and outrage you at points and I think that's the point. 10/10 would recommend this to most people.One of the best parts of the book is the way the authors write in such a humble and transparent way.

49,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3730838-maggie-boyd,2,"I'm always interested in books critiquing our current educational system and sat down to read this one with enthusiasm. However, this book is less about what is wrong with our system and more about criticizing liberals for the horrors they have wrought upon our society. It begins with vilifying our current crop of college students: kids born after 1995 who began going to college in 2013. These children are having three great untruths fed to them by liberal universities: 1. The Untruth of Fragility: What doesn't kill you makes you weaker. 2. The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: Always trust your feelings. 3. The Untruth of Us versus Them: Life is a battle between good people and evil people. They go on to say that by creating safe spaces, colleges teach students to believe the above. The evidence? Students are preventing speakers from holding lectures they disagree with at their universities. As others have pointed out, this in no way keeps the speaker from disseminating their ideas. Milo, the target of one of these riots, was still making television appearances and publishing books. The students were asking that he not be allowed to speak in spaces their tuition paid for, a very different thing than asking that he never be allowed to speak anywhere. Moreover, this wasn't a question of not giving the speaker a chance to present his point but a reaction to the point the speaker had already made. Finally, the United States has over 3,000 4 yr. universities and the author's ""evidence"" centers around approximately 1% of those institutions having students make demands they felt were unreasonable. This is nowhere near epidemic. Then the authors get to what I felt was the primary point: Viewpoint diversity reduces a community’s susceptibility to witch hunts. One of the most important kinds of viewpoint diversity, diversity of political thought, has declined substantially among both professors and students at American universities since the 1990s. To sum up the first portion of the book has two major points: Anything that prevents someone from making a point, even if that point is offensive, is ""coddling"" and colleges are too liberal. We need more balance. (They didn't speak to the 600 Christian colleges where the staff is predominantly conservative.) After spending several chapters ""building a case"" on how the great untruths listed in the first paragraph are destroying young collegiate minds, the author's come to a startling conclusion: You can see why it was hard for us to make a strong case that universities were causing students to become anxious and depressed by teaching them disordered ways of thinking. Anxiety and depression rates were already rising for all teenagers before they arrived at college, and for those who never attended college as well. Clearly universities were not causing a national mental health crisis; they were responding to one. With liberal universities out as a scapegoat, bring in liberal parenting policies. Safteyism, where parents go to purportedly unreasonable limits to protect their kids might be a factor in kids being more fearful, which might be a factor in them being depressed. No direct evidence of this is available but they offer up some random events and show how those few events point to liberals running amok and creating too much fear in our kids. They have to admit, grudgingly, that many of the safety measures have worked. Putting it all together, from 1960 to 1990, there was a 48% reduction in deaths from unintended injuries and accidents among kids between five and fourteen years of age, and a 57% drop in deaths of younger kids (ages one to four).Lukianoff, Greg. The Coddling of the American Mind (p. 169). Penguin Publishing Group. Kindle Edition. In summary, the authors offer anecdotes and a handful of studies to showcase their points but the math in no way supports what they are saying. If you are someone who feels PC culture is at the heart of what is wrong with our country, you'll love this book and may believe it supports your view point. If you know how to do elementary school level math and have an understanding of the basic principle of percentages, you will quickly realize this tome is meant to speak into a very specific echo chamber and provides no substantial evidence to support the view that liberals will be the death of America."

While there are specific recommendations that some may have differing personal preferences/opinions on, there is no lack of research in their presentation and arguments (and it’s safe to say they would welcome the discourse of another perspective). I especially appreciated their inclusion of CBT and how that could be a beneficial practice for many to adopt, as well as parents and institutions to encourage and teach. Looking forward to anything else Haidt writes. "

Why are so many university campuses coming up against student demands to disinvite ""dangerous"" guest speakers, to penalize professors who propone unpopular opinions, and to dismiss any who threaten their conception of safety? This very insightful book discusses 3 great untruths of the ""IGen"" (the generation born after 1994, coinciding with the ubiquity of the iPhone): The Untruth of Fragility: What doesn’t kill you makes you weaker. The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: Always trust your feelings. The Untruth of Us Versus Them: Life is a battle between good people and evil people.It shows have parents and institutions have unwittingly taught youth these untruths, and have - with the best of intentions - coddled them to the point of handicapping their ability to handle the adult world. Within this framework, I gained some new insights into the reasons for our increasingly partisan political world.One thing I really like about The Coddling of the American Mind is that, unlike many books of this genre, it doesn't just rip down the system, telling us everything that's wrong with society, then leave us hopeless. Lukianoff and Haidt give pages of good, solid suggestions for how to correct the problems we have created. I would absolutely recommend this book to parents today, as well as to anyone in education or educational administration. It is quite bipartisan, but not afraid to point out problems on both side of the political spectrum. I already put the audiobook on hold for my husband!4.5 stars."

Coddling of the American Mind did this. In brief, it is about three great Untruths that are affecting US universities and making them weaker: that we are protecting them from things that they see as dangerous, because – although there are good people, there are also evil ones. The great Untruths are:1. The Untruth of Fragility: What doesn’t kill you makes you weaker. 2. The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: Always trust your feelings. 3. The Untruth of Us Versus Them: Life is a battle between good people and evil people. (p. 4) Lukianoff and Haidt are provocative, but also good at bringing together diverse kinds of information together to help us recognize, as the subtitle goes, ""how good intentions and bad ideas are setting up a generation for failure.""For a book about the dichotomous and extreme thinking characterizing parenting, students, and the university system in the 21st century, Lukianoff and Haidt slip into dichotomous thinking. As do we all from time to time.We are in an age of helicopter parenting – even bulldozer parenting – where parents attempt to intervene with their college-aged children in a way that my daughters, frustratingly, would not allow me to do when they were in grade school. Rather than helping them, except in the short-term, this sort of parenting (and overscheduling, failing to allow or encourage free play, etc.) leaves students to becoming fragile, anxious, and easily hurt. Lukianoff and Haidt argue compellingly that college students should and must be exposed to viewpoint diversity, which will help them think more critically, understand diverse perspectives, and withstand events that would otherwise make them depressed and anxious. As the authors conclude, this means that we should beseeking out challenges (rather than eliminating or avoiding everything that “feels unsafe”), freeing yourself from cognitive distortions (rather than always trusting your initial feelings), and taking a generous view of other people, and looking for nuance (rather than assuming the worst about people within a simplistic us-versus-them morality). (p. 14)I appreciated Coddling of the American Mind, but I was often annoyed and irritated by it – which are not good outcomes for this time of year. Lukianoff and Haidt gathered interesting and often compelling threads, but I wasn't convinced by all of their evidence. Clearly, there is more anxiety and depression on campus than when I was in school, but that isn't necessarily a function of ""coddling,"" but of greater access on college campuses. Students who would not have been able to attend college 20 years ago can.While Lukianoff and Haidt criticize students' complaints about controversial and noncontroversial speakers (e.g., George Will, Bill Maher, Eric Holder, Madeleine Albright), I am less dismayed. I like that students are more likely to set limits about things that my generation accepted (e.g., #metoo).Current parenting practices, among many other things, have both strengths and weaknesses. Lukianoff and Haidt primarily focus on the downside here, but maybe we can look for some nuance and attempt to create a stronger model for the next generation of parents – and universities."
58,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3052770-teri,4,"This is an important read in today's society. This book is a look at the iGen generation that seems to be obsessed with technology and social media. The authors look at how ready access to news and social media affects attitudes and higher education. iGen students seem to be obsessed with protecting themselves against any other opinion than their own. They are less open to expanding their worldview and listening to opposing views to gain a broader understanding of today's society. This has led to students feeling ""unsafe"" when dealing with someone who does not share their views. Are they truly physically unsafe or are they just unable to process opposing views? Instead of engaging in open, civil debate or listening to gain understanding, students are sheltered and professors and administrators kowtow to students, offering special ""safe spaces,"" firing faculty who simply exercise their first amendment right, or even canceling guest speakers whose views are not shared with the majority of students. In essence, the authors suggest that we are coddling America's youth and young adults, sheltering them to the point that they are unable to process opinions and ideas that they do not identify with. The authors spend a lot of time discussing how technology and social media have affected current attitudes and lifestyles. Where once young kids would go out and play in the neighborhood, without constant adult supervision, they are today being watched by helicopter parents, suggesting that kids are being overprotected. Are we coddling the younger generations to the point that they are unable to psychologically handle uncomfortable positions? It is certainly worth thinking about and this book will open that discussion to consider if we are doing a disservice to our youth.I think this is a must-read for parents, teachers, and faculty of higher education.

Call-out culture needs to be better defined. Does #metoo movement count as call-out culture in the author's opinion? Jonathan Haidt calls himself a centralist. Yes the majority of the criticism in the book is aimed towards the political left. The author explains it is because American universities (the scope of this book) are left-leaning, and he does admit the right has bigger problem and more violent in general. I'd say his limited criticism to the right is not an intentional bias.Some discussions: - Intent vs Impact- Equal outcome vs Equal opportunity- Common Enemy Identity vs Common Humanity Identity- Make kids fit for the road, instead of demanding the road to be fit the kids- What doesn't kill you makes stronger or weaker?- One's own feeling is a bad guide for one's judgement.

Mostly, this from a review at Inside Higher Ed: ""For two, despite the title, students are never actually portrayed as “coddled” or “entitled.” Rather, the authors’ primary focus is on enhancing the well-being of “iGen” students who Haidt and Lukianoff recognize are more anxious and depressed with every successive year.If it seems odd that a book primarily concerned with the well-being of students would boast a title implying that those students are “coddled,” I agree, as does Greg Lukianoff, who has told both Jaschik and the Chronicle of Higher Education that he essentially disagrees with his own title – preferring “Disempowered” – but ultimately going with the publisher’s preferred “The Coddling of the American Mind” because it is “less boring.”The title is a discordant note coming from two authors who center the benefits of rational debate as a necessary part of our public discourse. It’s as though we should be truthful and accurate, except when it comes to having an attention-grabbing title which will help sell a lot of books.[1]Lukianoff wanted to call the book “Disempowered” because, as he tells Jaschik, “We [Haidt and Lukianoff] believe we [society at large] have unwittingly taught a generation of students the mental habits of anxious, depressed, polarized people, and we need to rethink how we do everything from parenting in K-12, through, of course, higher education.”Read more here: https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/..."

I highly recommend it to anybody who might be seeking some root-cause knowledge on how to understand the current society of American. That said, I find it a bit less exciting reading through the second half of this book (part 3 and above) compared with the earlier half. Thinking about it, it feels that the tone is a lot more definitive in the 2nd half. The authors, obviously with the best intent out there, became rather prescriptive in what fixes should happen. Obviously, their prescriptions might work. Or they might not. I think that there's no simple thinking or answer to this very complex problem - and the affective polarization is not really a contemporary American only problem, but a human society problem - for it's closely related to our basic human needs such as ""belongings"", ""group thinking"", ""feeling supported"", so on and so forth. I wish the book tried to dive a bit deeper into examples in other countries and in other era. I wish it did not end up in a way as if it was a simple problem to solve as long as people followed their prescription (which is not true, IMHO)."

Yellow tabs are passages I need to copy into my commonplace book, and pink are further reading suggestions. And yes, it was twenty pages in when I felt the need to order a copy of my own off Amazon. The Coddling of the American Mind is a book that put my feelings into words and answered a lot of my own questions about the direction our society has been heading in the last 10 years. The victimization, the rise in anxiety and depression, the overprotective parenting, the constant bombardment by public shaming and people being offended over littlest things, the anger, the tribalism, the great divide... you name it, this book ties them all in an intelligent, non-partisan, logical argument that our well-intended desire to create safe environment for all misdirecting us straight into hell of an existence. One of those books I think everyone should read."

The description of what's happening on university campuses, the hypotheses as to why they are happening, and the potential solutions are presented in a coherent and compelling way. This book has changed the way I see my students and children, and will change the way I live my life - higher praise isn't possible. Strongly recommended!"

74,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24682440-tom-stamper,4,"The Coddling of the American Mind is a riff on Allan Bloom’s classic 1980s book, the Closing of the American Mind, where Bloom, if I remember correctly, writes that most college kids aren’t ready for the rigor of a college education so college education is a watered down beyond the intellectual rigor that it was once known for. Jonathan Haidt and co-author Greg Lukianoff believe kids aren’t ready for the rigors of college and thus adulthood because they have been coddled by their parents and teachers and taught that they are fragile and must be protected physically and emotionally. This is due partly to the self-esteem cult that awards every kid a trophy and partly the terror in the media convincing everyone that kids are not safe without 24/7 supervision. Colleges have responded to these new students (customers) by creating speech codes and safe spaces. Rather than be shocked at the absurd idea that free speech is outlawed in a place of learning, we should instead see how this was the inevitable yield of the crop of kids we ourselves cultivated.There are very few free-range kids these days. Almost all activities are scheduled and supervised by adults so kids never really learn how to resolve conflicts and problems on their own. Further, parents are so afraid of something physically happening to their kids that they train the kids to grow up to be neurotic. This does make sense in my experience. I’m Generation X and we would to spend all day during summer vacation playing on abandoned construction sites and vacant lots. If we went deep enough into the woods we might get lost. It was part of the adventure. It was common for us to ride our bikes to our elementary school to play on the jungle gym without any adult supervision. I did these things at age 7. My mom’s only rule was we were not to cross the busy main thoroughfare. She never asked what we did or what we planned to do. And yet I felt downright constrained compared to my dad’s stories of taking his wagon for a 5 mile walk along a main road to pick tomatoes in order to come back to town and sell them for the purchase of baseball cards. In my day there might be kids that would take their ball and go home when the rules weren’t constructed to their liking. They were shunned until they compromised or left the group. The bossy ones would either learn to negotiate or be gone. It taught us how to be conciliatory. Looking back, I can remember kids who were the hardest to play with and I can see they were more coddled than us. Their parents would call our parents to complain. This splintered the neighborhood into allies and rivals which was also a good lesson to learn about adult life. Until reading this book, I didn’t realize how important these lessons were. I thought our play was wasting time when we could have been reading books. I felt guilty the first time I left my 10 year-old alone at home for 15 minutes to pick up something at the store. She was a little hesitant at first, but not wanting to leave her video game was stronger than the fear of solitude. Our kids rarely go knocking on doors to play with neighbor kids. Instead they play team sports at the YMCA or Girl Scouts or they participate in service clubs at school. I don’t know how we got here because it wasn’t something I intended to do, but neither did my parents give me free range as a strategy. Both situations were normal in their times. If there is one place I disagree with the authors, it’s that I tend to think this campus fragility isn’t evenly spread among conservative and liberal kids although he provides anecdotal evidence of both. Outside of political science majors or groups like college Republicans, conservative kids don’t study political philosophy and policies the way liberal kids do. The majors that are political in nature are liberal. There are no rightwing equivalents of environmental science and law, gender and race studies, sociology, and psychology. But while the conservative kid is less likely to be triggered by disagreeable speech his path to adulthood is still blocked by the same coddling. He will be less ready for office politics and group dynamics that were worked out previously on that vacant lot. One solution that Haidt and Lukianoff offer is for mandatory military or national service before college. I can see the appeal of this considering the current circumstances, but I think it’s a contradictory solution to the real problem he outlines earlier in the book. Parents need to stop treating their kids as fragile. So when parents actually give their kids the freedom to make mistakes and to learn and fail, they will ready for adulthood. The national service idea will be a punishment for the well-adjusted. Let’s not take the bad idea of parents giving their children less freedom and mandate a national law that takes away the freedom of young adults."

It was almost like reading a research paper (though I've never read one) but the findings contained were truly gripping.The book basically revolves around disproving the three great untruths (as per the authors),1. What doesn't kill you makes you weaker2. Always trust your feelings3. Life is a battle between Good people and Evil peopleAnd the authors take into account two main areas - upbringing of kids and the hostile climate at university campuses & how that lead to student actions, to illustrate how harmful these untruths can be.Also, you'll find 6 core pointers, that the authors keep coming back to, as reasons behind all that's wrong with the the upbringing of children, specifically iGens (born in 1995 & further) and the hostility on college campuses.1. Rising political polarization2. Rising rates of adolescent depression & anxiety3. Shift to a more fearful, protective & intensive parenting in middle class & wealthy families4. Widespread play deprivation and risk deprivation for members of iGen5. An expanding campus bureaucracy taking an increasingly overprotective posture6. A rising passion for justice and combined with a growing commitment to attaining ""equal outcomes"" in all areas. (I too was surprised to know that you cannot bring the equality debate to just about everything)There are tons of examples to showcase in what manners the culture of safetyism is affecting the kids today and how, once ingrained, they take this mindset to colleges which later transforms to ""how my views always need to be protected"", ""how I should not come across or listen to people with differing views"", ""how anything that I don't believe in is not just wrong but can harm me too"" and ""how I need to always feel safe in everything"".I came across Jonathan Haidt and this book on The Farnam Street Podcast (you NEED to check it out if you haven't already). So if you want to evaluate whether you resonate with the author's views, you can check the podcast out here - https://fs.blog/knowledge-project/jon...And if you wish to get a gist of all the things the book is about, here's the long article on The Atlantic by the authors which was the starting point of the book - https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/..."
76,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5109654-marks54,4,"This book is getting lots of play these days. I think the book is generally well done and the interest in the book is well deserved. Most of my issues with the book stem not from its content but from an effort to do too much within the context of a popular book on secondary and post-secondary education. Do not get me wrong here. The parts of the book all seem on target and well presented. The problem is in how they fit together and how a general reader can get his/her mind around the different parts of the book.Where to start?Going from the title “The Coddling of the American Mind” has broad ambitions to make a statement about American intellectual life, education, social values, and the like. OK, so far so good. But the book jumps in and largely focuses on events at a small number of elite and highly competitive private liberal arts colleges and universities, with a few public universities thrown in for good measure. No claim is made that the events and trends in the book are happening at more than a small number of these schools or that these are common occurrences even within the sample. While this set of schools is obviously important, it is a small subset of American higher education. For a long time, most students who attend and complete college do so at large public institutions and most do not study the traditional “liberal arts” but instead study in fields like business, social work, nursing, and education. So what is on display here is a subset of elite education in America.So this book is a highly visible representative of the genre of “wacky stuff that is going on within America’s elite undergraduate institutions”. Recent members of this genre include Deresiewicz’s “Excellent Sheep”. People my age might remember Bloom’s “The Closing of the American Mind” or could go back to Buckley and “God and Man at Yales”. Why the interest in the elite schools? Well, their alumni certainly read a lot, but there is also some level of intellectual voyeurism at work. And then there are the parents trying to crack the code to gain entry for their kids into these schools. I do not mention this to diminish the value of the book. If anything what happens at these elite schools is of high symbolic value to the rest of American higher education and will likely remain so.Now to the book.The book is a compilation and distilling of a wide range of arguments and research streams but the basic “hook” concerns the recent increase in importance of “three great untruths” - the untruth of fragility, the untruth of emotional reasoning, and the untruth of “us versus them”. These untruths are unjustified assumptions that when incorporated into one’s thinking produce significant and counterintuitive errors of potentially significant dimensions, most notably in the shutting down of speakers and discordant viewpoints for fear of causing emotional harm to those not in agreement or the taking of actions against those holding fringe opinions as a result of their holding such opinions. The central part of the book is a discussion of these errors and of a number of highly disturbing events at various colleges in which these errors are seen as having played a part and which involved intimidation, violence and even academic “witch hunts”.The book then expands on its initial chapters by discussing the role of other stakeholder groups. Few are left out and the book covers faculty, students, administrators, the news media, social media, parents, and secondary school educators (of the college students). The book makes a specific generational claim, namely that the events and trends it chronicles — the “iGen” or “Generation Z”. Yes, this is not a book about millennials but the subsequent generation. (Let me note here that I do not view the generational argument - here or more generally - as a strength of the book and that reducing matters to the lowest demographic temporal common denominator is seldom a compelling basis for argument. The authors themselves note that the trends they cover are not found in everyone starting college - or even a majority.)The book is an outgrowth of a 2014 New Republic article that focused on explaining these disturbing and highly visible events at major institutions.I am generally persuaded that the authors have brought together a relevant set of ideas and trends and that the book is informative about what is going on in colleges today. It certainly rings true with my experience. I am less certain about the incidence and prevalence of the issues that are raised. The examples discussed are not that common although common enough to merit attention.A strength of the book is that it tries to tie together are variety of ideas and trends together and to provide a broader and better integrated perspective than is commonly presented in the popular literature on university life today. If anything, the authors attempt too much. The later chapters on helicopter parents and the demise of play are not particularly informative. The treatment of the role of university administrators in the “coddling” process is plausible and even useful and the focus in the book on universities as complex educational organizations is a valuable.There are gaps too. The book could do more to point out the contributions of professors and niche academic fields to the mess. In fairness, this is a difficult and sensitive issue and all academic work can and should be actively criticized. The authors are spot on in detailing the rise of consumerist approaches to higher education and how that contributes to pathologies. (This problem is also present in graduate professional education.) The authors say virtually nothing about the difficulties that new students have in academically adjusting to college life and how academic demands may interact with newer social demands to produce some of the bizarre behaviors mentioned in the book.Finally, in discussing what to do, it would have been helpful for the authors to explain how some schools prevent outrages from happening my maintain the rights of all to speak and enforcing codes of student behavior (and local laws). Most colleges know how to maintain order while continuing to promote academic values.Overall, these concerns are minor. As these books go, this is a good one and worth reading."

This was an amazing book, so perhaps I should give it 5 stars. I think I will bring a print copy to my book club. The book outlines what many of us have discussed at parent council meetings: why are we trying to protect our kids from everything?! What is wrong with a camping trip? A ski trip? Yep, someone might get hurt. But so what. This book delves even deeper and it is just fascinating. I can see that I am doing some things right, but many things wrong. When my kid feels excluded from a recess activity, I can see now that I am coddling too much. Sometimes you might feel left out, your feelings might be hurt, but you are not actually hurt, and you are still safe, you just need to decide how to deal with it. I wish I had read it earlier, but since much deals with the teen years, I still have time. And it's not a parenting book, it's a ""what's wrong with our society"" book, as it addresses university education and entering the work force too, and how ""we"" have failed an entire generation or more. I don't mean to sound like a downer, because I actually felt quite good for much of the read! It was compelling at any rate :)"

There was a long wait list and I ended up having too many other things on my plate by the time it came back around—so this time I just bought a copy of it. I’ve heard it talked about a lot, so I feel like I had the Cliff Notes edition to begin with, on top of rereading the first portion of the book. Parts of the book felt a little drawn out to me, as if they were trying to extend their argument further than necessary (I was already convinced), but the numerous examples were well -researched to support their arguments. They push CBT specifically a little too much, but I think the principles are helpful to consider applying, and especially for Christians to apply alongside the truth of the gospel. As someone who works with college students, I think this book is really insightful, and the authors are spot on with many of their observations. It’s helpful in understanding this current generation of students, and it pushes me to think about what is true even for me as a Millennial—and how I want to parent my own children to be more resilient and more aware of their own thoughts and the world around them.

Looking at today's culture, I can't help but ask, ""what happened?!"" A lot of the culture shift that they explore in this book they claim happened around 2013, which was the tail end of my college experience. Looking back, I do feel as though it was evident that something was changing, and it seemed to be happening rapidly. I know that there is nothing new under the sun... but it seemed to happen so quickly. This book was helpful to see how it is that we have ended up in a world obsessed with feeling ""safe."" The authors traced back generations to see where it all began and showed how it wasn't just something that appeared out of thin air. I view myself as more middle of the road politically, and I felt as though the authors really tried to not blame one party over the other, which was good. Overall, it was a helpful book! I think the thing that kept me from giving it a perfect score was the fact that they kept making plugs for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). There's nothing wrong with CBT, but I felt like the plugs were awkward and irrelevant to the discussion at times."

In fact, it was so important to Haidt and Lukianoff (who are both left-leaning but are opposed to certain trends) that this book be bipartisan, they had multiple beta readers of various political views give their feedback prior to publication. This book, an expansion of an Atlantic article, asserts that modern higher education and society as a whole are doing young people a disservice by teaching them several ""Great Untruths."" These untruths breed conflict and tribalism, limit learning and exchange of ideas, and ultimately make people unhappier. Here are the Untruths followed by their counterparts, the principles that the authors believe we should follow instead:UNTRUTH: What doesn't kill you makes you weaker.PRINCIPLE: Young people are antifragile (they grow stronger from experiencing adversity).Prepare the child for the road, not the road for the child.UNTRUTH: Always trust your feelings.PRINCIPLE: We are all prone to emotional reasoning and the confirmation bias.Your worst enemy cannot harm you as much as your own thoughts, unguarded. But once mastered, no one can help you as much.UNTRUTH: Life is a battle between good people and evil people.PRINCIPLE: We are all prone to dichotomous thinking and tribalism.The line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being.I'd happily recommend this book to anyone (or at least I'd recommend the article, for a shorter summary), especially anyone involved in the world of education."

CBT was becoming a necessity at Napa State Hospital prior to my leaving it in 2012. The information was useful for patients with Personality Disorders, and staff for better interactions as well as lowered aggressions. This would be a fantastic book to read if you are ever around children: parents, teachers, mentors, god-parents, grandparents, aunts/uncles, you get the picture.I appreciate how they address the issues facing us today not just from one side of the aisle but from every angle and point out places for each side to change and improve on. I also second their opinion about giving the option to have a gap-year to work with other population or areas of the country world then your own to get a grasp on how other people think/act/live prior to going into school with only one narrow viewpoint and how colleges need to encourage this. Overall just a well thought out and helpful book. And I appreciate the website with sources available. Warning: Strong language when quoting."

Discusses the idea of ""antifragility"" - about how ""safe spaces,"" ""microaggressions,"" and how ""concept creep"" of some words like ""violence"" and ""harm"", combined with overparenting practices have made people unable to bear the consideration of ideas which contradict their own and, therefore, unable to hold an intelligent debate or come up with bipartisan solutions. This book also offers solutions for these problems, discussing campus policies protecting free speech, and a form of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy to expose young people to these ideas that they find ""harmful"" until they can prove to themselves that an idea does not hurt, a speech is not violent (unless it was specifically intended to incite violence), and that exposure to these things are necessary for proper education. "
83,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8331026-antti-v-rt,3,"I've been a bit worried about the things I hear about the ""campus left"": how there are protests at the campuses whenever some right-winger has been called to give a lecture, and how these protests have at times turned violent. How students are demanding the classes can't contain triggering materials, to the point of making teaching certain subjects nigh-impossible. How professors can get fired because their emails contain words that are deemed not sensitive enough. Etc. I'm sure you know the phenomenon. And since what happens in America now can happen here in North Europe after a slight delay, I decided to read Lukianoff's and Haidt's book about the subject to understand the situation better - and perhaps be prepared for the rise of the campus left in my own country.The book has a brilliant structure. First the authors describe the three ""Great Untruths"" they fell the iGen have fallen prey to:1) What doesn't kill you makes your weaker2) Always trust your emotions3) The world is a fight between the Good people and the Evil people.Then they show examples of these untruths in action: basically an in expanded list of the activities of the campus left I mentioned above.By this point, the reader is shaking their head and willing to call off the whole generation. But then Lukianoff and Haidt turn the tables when they start to explore WHY the campus activists do such messed up things: they point their finger to alt-right and right-wing demagogues, who have been stirring up hate and polarization for a decade or more; helicopter parents who don't let their kids play freely, so they don't grow into responsible adults; lawmakers and administrators, who try to minimize the risks and take safety to ridiculous levels. Basically L&H say that if the kids aren't alright, it's the fault of their parents' and other members of the previous generations - so you shouldn't blame the students, but look for solutions. The last chapter is then dedicated on the possible solutions to the problems.After reading this book I'm much less worried about the campus left I was earlier. Many issues seem to be wholly American: the idea that second-grade kids wouldn't be safe walking alone to and from school is very alien to Finns. We also don't have popular far-right talk show hosts or anything similar. If Lukianoff and Haidt are right in their analysis, the situation in campuses here shouldn't become as dire as in the USA."
84,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1617691-paul-stout,4,"This is one of the most eye-opening books I've read in a long time. Haidt explains what is happening in the minds of the Internet generation who are raised on three great untruths: 1. Feelings are the best guide to correctness.2. One should avoid pain or discomfort (what doesn't kill you makes you weaker). 3. One should find fault in others, and not in one's self.Because of these three great untruths, safety is more important than anything. We have prepared the road for the child, instead of the child for the road. Helicopter parents do everything they can to spare their children from anything unsafe. For example, peanuts in schools. In the end, a zero-tolerance against peanuts, according to documented studies, has CAUSED children to become allergic. The same is true for anything else unsafe. Fearing abductors and molesters, a whole generation of parents kept their children inside, playing video games. This marked the end of free-range children.Even worse, any idea that upsets the child, is deemed to be dangerous. Therefore youth entering college, starting in 2014, were afraid of any ideas that ran counter to their own thinking. Thus the removal of teachers and guest speakers that offered counterpoints from the opposite political end of the spectrum: both left and right. Anything they don't agree with can be labeled as dangerous speech. We have entered the era of identity politics where it's always ""us vs them."" "

89,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/502680-david,4,"If you are a parent or work with college students, this book is an absolute must-read! I'd say that this one, along with Jean Twenge's book iGen, are two vital books for people my age and older to understand those under 25.*Lukianoff and Haidt ask why university campuses seemed to explode with protest about free speech and safety around the year 2013. Why are more and more invited speakers being met with resistance to the point of being disinvited? Why does it seem that protests erupt over a few words in relatively innocuous emails or speeches by people who, it would seem, are solid members of the same group doing the protesting? Speaking of protesting, this is not a book that blames ""those silly liberals"" or anything like that. Haidt and Lukianoff point out the right also has its own form of identity politics and does its own protests in the desire to shut people down. Some of this should make the reader want to go back and read Haidt's The Righteous Mind. The point is, while it is easy or tempting to see these campus problems as a problem for the left and thus to expect this book to attack safe spaces and intersectionality, the reality is this book is not that The authors demonstrate good scholarship by affirming what is good and seeking to target the extremes.In the introduction they mention three great untruths that have spread in recent years:1. The Untruth of Fragility - What doesn't kill you makes you weaker.2. The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning - Always Trust your feelings3. The Untruth of Us Versus Them - Life is a battle between good people and evil people.Each of these goes against centuries of received wisdom and creates the sorts of people who always think they are unsafe, hear everything as a personal attack, and neatly group any who differ with them at all as bad. It is healthier to recognize that we become stronger through challenges, often our feelings lead us astray and that the line between good and evil cuts through each of us.The authors then go through six factors that have caused these untruths to proliferate. Young people did not just all of a sudden decide to believe these, they were taught them. Here again the authors are balanced. Despite our parents saying, ""Bah...we didn't wear seatbelts in the 70s, we played outside all day with no supervision...we were fine,"" the statistics are they were not fine. Safety measures have led to a drastic decrease in childhood deaths. This is a good thing. The problem is when we become so unbalanced that we seek to remove anything - physical or emotional - that causes even an iota of unsafety. Seat belts are good! Not allowing kids to fail because it hurts their feelings is bad!While I was reading this book I was chatting with some family members. My mom and her sister both declared that parents (my generation) today are too soft. We coddle our kids! We are not their friends! I asked my mom if she was a parent today, would she let her kid walk to the park alone? She was aghast! Of course not, it is unsafe, she said! I chuckled and pointed out she would be coddling her kids today too. Then she talked about the story of the kid abducted and killed in the early 80s. This child's father went on to host America's Most Wanted. It was a huge story and apparently shaped how my mom parented and her fear of child abductions.Literally the next day as I was reading this book, they mentioned that story! They pointed out this impacted millions of moms like mine, even though, statistically, kids are much more likely to be abducted by a family member than a stranger. The whole thing was just an interesting real life reflection on this book: the older generation accusing new parents of being soft not realizing their own softness shaped this generation; the realization that things are more safe now and when we seek safety we often fear the wrong thing. The truth is, all parents want what is best for their kids and often think the next generation of parents are messing up.So what do we do?After going through all of this, Lukianof and Haidt end with some ideas for how to fix things and move forward. They are hopeful and we should be too. We can resist this insane need for our kids to get into an Ivy League school. We can teach them it is okay to fail and that losing teaches good lessons. Of course, the challenge is that we do not always notice the cultural forces at work. My mom didn't realize it was highly unlikely I'd ever be abducted. She just knew it had happened and was all over the news. When the whole culture is swimming one way, its hard to swim the other.That's why this is such a helpful book for parents. I plan to put together some discussions on it for the college students and campus pastors I work with. There's a lot here to think about and keep thinking about.*I will be 40 in January 2020 making me one of the oldest Millennials. Millennials were born between, roughly, 1980-1994.

90,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27614432-justin-tapp,4,"The Coddling of the American Mind by Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan HaidtI am reviewing this book in June 2020 as both nonviolent and violent protests are rocking American after the death of George Floyd, which has quickly become a rallying cry both for justice for oppressed minorities and reform of law enforcement. At least initially, the activists of this movement were seen as being on the ""Left."" These protests are coming in the midst of another ""us versus them"" reaction, largely in certain quarters of the Right, to COVID-19 restrictions. The Atlantic's most recent work highlights the effect of QAnon's conspiracy theories to sow disinformation and encourage people to paranoia of anything also coming from ""them."" The call-out culture in America is on full display as activists, political candidates, news outlets, and even police and National Guard forces are documented on social media of calling on people to choose sides now. Watching from where I work abroad, it appears the media is escalating the outrage as each additional clip tries to top the previous. The authors first presented their ideas in a 2015 article published by The Atlantic, that was cited by then-President Obama who personally encouraged college students not to be afraid of ideas they disagreed with or possibly found harmful. This book sprang out of a need to further develop the authors' ideas and research. I reach back to Conor Friedersdorf's summary of their thesis as also published in The Atlantic: ""(Lukianoff and Haidt) argue that well-intentioned adults are unwittingly harming young people by raising them in ways that implicitly convey three untruths:The Untruth of Fragility: What doesn’t kill you makes you weaker.The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: Always trust your feelings.The Untruth of Us vs. Them: Life is a battle between good people and evil people.""...“Whatever your identity, background, or political ideology,” the authors advise young people, “you will be happier, healthier, stronger, and more likely to succeed in pursuing your own goals” if you do three things:Seek out challenges “rather than eliminating or avoiding everything that ‘feels unsafe.’”Free yourself from cognitive distortions “rather than always trusting your initial feelings.”Take a generous view of other people, and look for nuance, “rather than assuming the worst about people within a simplistic us-versus-them morality.”I would add to the above summary that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is presented by Lukianoff, in particular, as the potential solution to various anxiety-fear-anger issues in our culture. Teaching people to be more resilient through mindfulness, not overgeneralizing every mistake or criticism, and finding ways to cope are much better than a culture of ""safety-ism"" that create vulnerable populations. Just as vaccines and exposure to harmful substances (ex: peanuts) in small doses build immunity, exposure to different ideas and challenges make us more resilient and more cooperative with one another. ""Trigger warnings are counter-therapeutic"" and college campuses that insist on insulary thinking and over-protection are doing the opposite of what CBT prescribes. In an apparent attempt to please everyone, the authors are very careful about giving caveats in regards to data and such. They issue their own hypothesis on why this cultural phenomenon emerged in 2013-2017. Why is iGen more fragile than previous generations? Are females more vulnerable? Where is this going? There are six trends they examine: 1) An increase in polarization, including an escalation of threats on both sides. 2) A rise in rates of anxiety and depression. 3) The need for ""free-range kids."" 4) The effects of the decline of ""free play"" in childhood. 5) The corporatization of universities as the goal has shifted away from purely education and more on providing what the consumer demands. 6) The increased focus on social justice, distributive justice, Title IX, etc. Some simple proposed solutions by the authors: Let your kids gradually take on more risks and responsibilities as they grow. Beware the ""us vs them"" and call-out culture. Use principles of charity and humility and engage with organizations that foster these. Help schools oppose untruths. Statistically, kids are much safer than they were 20-50 years ago, so the fear and paranoia of not letting your kid ride his bike in the neighborhood is unfounded and harmful. Limit screens and devices and be aware of how they affect your child. Engage with your kids about online activities and culture. Should it really matter to your child if someone unfollows him/her on Instagram? Universities should not allow the heckler's veto. The stories that the authors present from various campuses on how a small group of active protestors could effectively take the campus hostage (in some cases quite literally) are very disturbing. (Aside: If you've read Nebraska Senator Ben Sasse's book The Vanishing American Adult you will find similar ideas and concerns about how to raise kids.)I give the book 4.5 stars out of 5. The fact that this book also divides people makes the authors' point well. "

95,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70965168-youp,5,"The Coddling of the American Mind is absolutely superb. It's engaging, thought-provoking, clear-cut and complete. One of the best books I've ever read.The premise of 'The Coddling' is that we're experiencing a significant shift in culture regarding raising and educating children. It is a shift towards keeping them more safe and sheltered, not only from physical dangers but increasingly from ideas and opposing views. However well-intended by parents, politicians and teachers, the phenomenon of 'safetyism' is ultimately doing more harm than good, setting up new generations for a future of failure. We would be wise to abandon these ideas altogether in favor of parenting and teaching styles that result in more resilient and able minded (young) adults.'The Coddling' is incredibly well-written and persuasive, but what makes it stand out are its structure and conciseness. The book can be divided into four major parts, each logically following the other. The first part is dedicated to describing the phenomenon of safetyism, and proving it actually exists. It answers questions such as 'what is exactly happening?' and 'how much is it happening?'. The following chapter makes a case for why it is bad to be happening, and how bad it could get in the future. Next, it gives likely explanations to explain 'how could this happen?'. Lastly, the authors provide solutions to the problem to tell us 'how can we solve this and prevent worse from happening?'. Each part is subdivided into smaller chapters, always properly introducing and summarizing, perfectly encasing its contents within the framework of said section. It's almost impossible to not follow the contents when the structure is so solid, even when listening to the book on tape.Secondly, the authors did an amazing job of being as concise as possible. 'The Coddling' is not a quick read, yet not a word is too much (or too little, for that matter). It never becomes tedious, and never leaves you longing for more examples or information. It provides the right amount of arguments; a solid combination of anecdotes, analogies, scientific data and relevance in psychology, the field of expertise of author Haidt. The style of writing is precise, explaining and defining concepts when referenced, and doesn't become pretentious or too technical even when going in depth on difficult subjects. Combined with the clear structure, it makes for an easy-to-follow book, which is quite an accomplishment for such a complex and controversial theme.It's hard for me to point out possible improvements for this book. I've read people's claims that it's too focused on the wrongdoings of the political Left, but I strongly disagree with that sentiment. 'The Coddling' gives plenty of examples on wrongs of both Left and Right, and doesn't stray too far into either territory. Some reviewers say that the subject matter is exaggerated, not being as big of a problem as the authors make it out to be. That argument only holds ground if you consider the numerous excesses, such as Evergreen College students holding teachers hostage or the rise of safe spaces and free speech restrictions, currently acceptable. To me it's perfectly obvious that we're dealing with a serious problem and potential threat for our future, and this book convinced me even more. Perhaps my critique is that the authors can be a bit too lenient on certain excesses, giving even someone who calls for white genocide the benefit of the doubt that they don't literally mean killing people. However, this is mostly me nitpicking to find some flaws, and it certainly doesn't take anything away from a nearly perfect book.The Coddling of the American Mind is a brilliant book. It's complete and concise, well-structured, persuasive yet nuanced, and grasps the reader from the very first page. Recommended to anyone with some responsibility for children, or who cares about their (and our) future."

97,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69317606-micke-goteman,5,"Lukianoff and Haidt have written a book that I think has the potential to serve as a very good starting point for further discussion and research on many of these sensitive but important topics that our society, families, and universities face today (with an emphasis on universites and parenting in this book).I've always enjoyed Haidt because of his research-based approach, and his pursuit of truth while being willing to recognize realities of diverse experiences and needs. This book is no exception, and I also appreciated the important experience that Lukianoff brought to the table.It has felt important to try to learn more as I've been listening to a variety of perspectives over the last couple of years. From what I've been able to gather, it seems to me that the time we live in, and many of the events we are seeing, are symptoms and effects of a long history of ""uneven treatment"" based on various traits and identities. Of course part of this treatment has been conscious, some of it less conscious based on ignorance. I however don't doubt that substantial amounts of systemic bias and injustice have indeed accumulated over time, in many (often intersecting) areas. A recent surge in the interest to increase awareness around this, and to work for change, has obviously lead to strong reactions and chain reactions across the political and social spectrum. I think the systemic problems are real and that the pursuit to learn more and seek to address them is important.What I think this book does well is pointing out the important principles and the wisdom that we want to strive hard not to lose in the process. I appreciate that the authors at least try to acknowledge problems that have lead to this movement for ""social justice"", I personally think the book may have benefitted from painting a more full picture here. But I do think their points are also important and need to be given lots of thought and consideration. Especially as they represent a more productive and fact-based critique of aspects of the social justice pursuit of our day (especially on University Campuses).I look forward to learning from the thoughtful debate that I hope will come out of this book."
98,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3957636-steve-solnick,4,"An important, thought-provoking and well-written argument for taking the bubble-wrap off our kids (and, in some cases, forcing them to confront the difference between discomfort and trauma). The authors draw on a wide range of sources, though their main argument is simple - we're succumbing to a pernicious ideology of ""safetyism"" and encouraging our kids (their main focus is universities) to demonize those they disagree with. The simplicity of the core argument is unsurprising, given its roots in a magazine article, and at times the book feels a bit repetitive or padded. In particular, the chapter summaries give it the feel of a management book, though perhaps it's just cueing it up for book clubs.The six chapters in the second half offering explanations of the rise of ""safetyism"" are illuminating though ultimately inconclusive, and the one chapter on social justice (chap 11) feels rushed and incomplete. Ultimately, as explanations for their core syndrome, this middle section could have been one meaty chapter. As treatments of modern parenting, political polarization or the rise of the higher ed regulatory state these chapters are intriguing but lack nuance.These shortcomings aside, this book offers an important and impassioned argument against ""preparing the road for the child"" rather than vice versatile, and deserves to be widely read and discussed. I enjoyed it very much I'm sure I will be will be returning to it often."

Wise and good men are, in my opinion, the strength of a state: much more so than riches or arms, which, under the management of ignorance and wickedness, often draw on destruction, instead of providing for the safety of a people.” -Benjamin Franklin This is a well researched book, it’s also well written. I enjoyed it very much and it kept me interested the entire time. My only beef with this here book is their misunderstanding of the alt right, white nationalist, white supremacist, and how they connect it to sites like Breitbart, Milo, Trump... I am not of the “alt right” although I voted for Obama in 2008 and Trump In 2016 and think of myself as center and patriotic and am a considerable news junkie I still don’t have a clear vision or understanding of the “alt right.” Most people don’t whether it’s Helen Lewis interviewing Jordan Peterson, CNN’s reporting and coverage of the incident in Charlottesville, or these two authors. People are utterly befuddled what the alt right is and it’s obvious as can be. Take for example the schmuck Jason Kessler who was an organizer of the unite the right rally in Charlottesville, he’s a leftist shill just like the lefts “head” for the “alt right” Richard Spencer who is a major shill, God only knows who he’s working for. And saying that Breitbart is a platform used heavy by the “alt right” haha, really? The “alt right” calls it Kikebart, it’s founder and current owners are Jews, why would anti Semitic white nationalist use a digital media news outlet run by Jews ? White Nationalist? What the hell does that mean, I am white, I am also a nationalist, so was Abe Lincoln. I am not sure what I am supposed to make of their “alt right” formula and how a guy like me who voted for Obama, watched CNN, voted for Trump watches Fox, reads Breitbart and also reads books like this somehow gets lumped into the “alt right.” Unfortunately I think they were looking for balance in their book and when it came to getting the right side of the isles profile they failed. They certainly did their homework for the topic at hand in the book but the little bleeps and bloops about the “alt right” and right and the conflation of the two was nauseating. Other than that the book was dope, totally worth reading and I highly recommend it."
100,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8967389-isaac,4,"I have a lot of respect for how the authors organized this book; juxtaposing 3 quotes from different wisdom traditions with the 3 bad ideas from their silly story of their trip to the oracle on Mt. Olympus. They clearly lay out their ideas, support them well and circle back with summaries so you get the repetition and an easy reference (very similar to Righteous Mind).Overall they hit a lot of points that I support strongly; intellectual humility, unsupervised play for kids, free speech, correlation does not imply causation and one of the tightest and clearest argument for equality of opportunities not outcomes I have consumed.That said, a fair chunk of the book relied on recent anecdotes of events on college campuses which I felt were written for emotional impact (certainly made my blood boil), but it felt strange to have that emotion stoked in a book that encourages carpe datum and a mistrust of emotions. There is trend data to back up these anecdotes, so they aren't put forward as sole evidence, but it still felt a little weird.It also felt a little weird how much of the the book seems to expose you to an idea, like free range parenting, reducing screen time or gap years, but then simply referred you to to other books and websites for organizations created by people who are promoting their own research. Felt a little lazy on the authors part, and again ran counter to some of the themes of critical thinking and differing opinions.Minor gripes aside this is a good resource and provides some excellent arguments and frameworks for thinking about some issues that are near and dear to me as a parent and an employee in a university."
101,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7208369-miles,4,"The Coddling of the American Mind is a book that every American should read. While this was my first encounter with author Greg Lukianoff, I’ve long respected and followed the work of his coauthor, Jonathan Haidt. In the early 2010s, Haidt’s 
The Righteous Mind
 was one of my gateway texts into the field of moral psychology, which has captivated me ever since.In this new book, Lukianoff and Haidt team up to take on a host of controversial issues, including freedom of expression, outrage on college campuses, and the general culture of “safetyism” that is on the rise in modern America:""'Safetyism' refers to a culture or belief system in which safety has become a sacred value, which means that people become unwilling to make trade-offs demanded by other practical and moral concerns. 'Safety' trumps everything else, no matter how unlikely or trivial the potential danger."" (30)The Coddling presents a fine-grained examination of safetyism, which is driven by an insidious form of concept creep that equates emotional/psychological safety with physical safety. The authors combine a battery of empirical research with clear, concise arguments that demonstrate the downsides of conflating these two concepts, and outline a number of positive methods for identifying and avoiding this cognitive distortion in everyday life.Before highlighting what I found to be the most important aspects of Lukianoff and Haidt’s findings, a few words of criticism regarding this book’s title and cover. I usually don’t comment on such trivial matters, but in this case I feel compelled to make an exception. I think The Coddling of the American Mind is a needlessly abrasive title that will likely put off potential readers before they have the chance to give the book’s content a fair hearing. Combined with a harsh red cover depicting nondescript young people in graduation caps falling off a cliff like lemmings, I’m afraid this book will be written off by many of the people who would benefit most from reading it. I hope this fear is unjustified, and certainly don’t blame the authors for the unfortunate decisions of their publisher.Contrary to what the title and cover might imply, this is not an anti-left screed or a histrionic lament about how “snowflakes” are ruining American society. Lukianoff and Haidt’s tone is consistently civil and charitable to the opposition, as evidenced by this representative passage:""This is a book about good intentions gone awry. In…the book, you’ll read about people primarily acting from good or noble motivations. In most cases, the motive is to help or protect children or people seen as vulnerable or victimized. Our goal…is not to blame; it is to understand."" (126)In their attempt to understand what’s going on when good intentions lead to negative results, Lukianoff and Haidt posit three “Great Untruths” that they claim are enfeebling American society:""1. The Untruth of Fragility: What doesn’t kill you makes you weaker.2. The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: Always trust your feelings.3. The Untruth of Us Versus Them: Life is a battle between good people and evil people."" (4)These Great Untruths run contrary to ancient wisdom as well as modern psychological research, and also harm the individuals and communities who embrace them (4). Lukianoff and Haidt pair each Untruth with a proposed psychological antidote, as shown here:One key to understanding why the Great Untruths can be so harmful lies in Nassim Taleb's concept of “antifragility”:""Many of the important systems in our economic and political life are like immune systems: they require stressors and challenges in order to learn, adapt, and grow. Systems that are antifragile become rigid, weak, and inefficient when nothing challenges them or pushes them to respond vigorously."" (23, emphasis theirs)When we seek to protect people from all possible dangers, we deny them the chance to exercise the inherent growth mechanisms that build up their antifragility and transform them into more robust, resilient citizens. Without strain and strife, people languish.Using myriad examples, Lukianoff and Haidt demonstrate how the Great Untruths can produce all manner of undesirable outcomes: unnecessary social acrimony; neurotic parenting; a fanatic adherence to safetyism; depression and anxiety; and even physical violence against innocent victims as a means of “protecting” vulnerable individuals and groups. These sections focus primarily on parents and young people, but will be engaging and useful for any curious reader seeking to shore up his or her own antifragility.Lukianoff and Haidt also have much to say about the touchy topic of identity politics. They distinguish between two types of identity politics: common-humanity and common-enemy. Common-humanity identity politics focuses on widening the reach of societal compassion with the goal of promoting equal rights and access to opportunity for all people, regardless of race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, etc. This approach, which was championed by Martin Luther King, Jr. and many other civil rights activists, seeks to overcome political division by positing our shared humanity as the most important (but certainly not the only important) driver of political and social progress:""The more you separate people and point out differences among them, the more divided and less trusting they will become. The more you emphasize common goals or interests, shared fate, and common humanity, the more they will see one another as fellow human beings, treat one another well, and come to appreciate one another’s contributions to the community. Pauli Murray expressed the power of this principle when she wrote, 'When my brothers try to draw a circle to exclude me, I shall draw a larger circle to include them.'"" (260)Common-humanity identity politics stands in stark contrast to common-enemy identity politics, whose practitioners succumb to the Great Untruth of Us Versus Them. This phenomenon is as old as humanity itself, and capitalizes on our native tribal instincts that crave an unambiguous distinction between in-groups (good people) and out-groups (bad people). Lukianoff and Haidt show how the practice of common-enemy identity politics on both ends of the political spectrum leads to a “call-out culture” in which intelligent political discourse degrades rapidly and heterodox views are suppressed. Other negative results include dehumanizing one’s political opponents, participation in violent protests, and cycles of mutual provocation that chip away at the political center and leave little room for nuanced and fact-based debate.Lukianoff and Haidt’s firm rejection of common-enemy identity politics and support for common-humanity identity politics is a great example of their readiness to compromise with those who might disagree with them. Given the recent idiocies that have been enabled by common-enemy identity politics on both the left and right, it’s becoming increasingly easy for pundits to reject identity politics outright, claiming that differences in identity should play no role at all in political life. Even if this is correct in some theoretical or idealistic sense, this approach comes off as ahistorical and dismissive of the perfectly legitimate grievances of minority communities and marginalized groups. Common-humanity identity politics provides a platform on which we can celebrate difference while simultaneously forming coalitions based on our common biological inheritance. Modern science has taught us that biological similarities trump cultural differences more often than not, and it’s time to bring that reality to the forefront of our political movements:""As a result of our long evolution for tribal competition, the human mind readily does dichotomous, us-versus-them thinking. If we want to create welcoming, inclusive communities, we should be doing everything we can to turn down the tribalism and turn up the sense of common humanity."" (70)The role of American universities in fanning the flames of political division is another hotly-contested subject that Lukianoff and Haidt tackle. The politicization of higher education is nothing new, but the most visible forms of protest that have exploded on campuses in recent years have taken on a new and particularly irrational flavor. The Coddling contains lots of good advice about how university students, professors and administrators can help one another take a deep breath and stymie unnecessary outrage and violence. Most importantly, Lukianoff and Haidt remind us that the main charge of a university is to seek out and disseminate truth, not to be a vehicle for social change:""Some students and faculty today seem to think that the purpose of scholarship is to bring about social change, and the purpose of education is to train students to more effectively bring about such change.""We disagree. The truth is powerful, yet the process by which we arrive at truth is easily corrupted by the desires of the seekers and the social dynamics of the community. If a university is united around a telos of change or social progress, scholars will be motivated to reach conclusions that are consistent with that vision, and the community will impose social costs on those who reach different conclusions––or who merely ask the wrong questions."" (254)Should universities abandon their allegiance to truth in favor of an ethos of social change, a great and powerful tool for enlightenment will become corrupted, perhaps irredeemably. People who denigrate the idea of truth and seek an activist agenda for universities, even with the best of intentions, are forgetting the fact that social change will happen no matter what––it always does. The proper role of a university is to inoculate the process of social change with facts and reason, not to direct the process itself or predetermine its outcome. Above all else, education should be about creating good thinkers:""It is challenging to think well; we are easily led astray by feelings and by group loyalties. In the age of social media, cyber trolls, and fake news, it is a national and global crisis that people so readily follow their feelings to embrace outlandish stories about their enemies. A community in which members hold one another accountable for using evidence to substantiate their assertions is a community that can, collectively, pursue truth in the age of outrage. Emphasize the importance of critical thinking, and then give students the tools to engage in better critical thinking."" (259)At its heart, The Coddling calls us back to a simple practice that, while it has always had positive utility, is now becoming a critical feature that will differentiate healthy 21st-century societies from lost or doomed ones. This is the practice of giving people the benefit of the doubt, of assuming the best of intentions (or at least neutral intentions) unless one has very good reason not to:""It is important to find out whether an acquaintance feels hostility or contempt toward you. But it is not a good idea to start by assuming the worst about people and reading their actions as uncharitably as possible. This is the distortion known as mind reading; if done habitually and negatively, it is likely to lead to despair, anxiety, and a network of damaged relationships."" (40-1, emphasis theirs)One of the pitfalls of the information age is that we suddenly think we’re so damned smart, that we can understand other people better than they understand themselves. We read books and articles that purport to teach us how to detect “unconscious bias,” and gobble up partisan podcasts that so keenly articulate the assumed stances of our political and cultural opponents that we don’t feel the need to actually engage with them. I am just as guilty of this as most people, but I’m trying hard to break the habit, as should all Americans.We can start with an enthusiastic revival of the principle of charity, and with following Lukianoff and Haidt’s rules for productive disagreement:""––Frame it as a debate, rather than a conflict.––Argue as if you’re right, but listen as if you’re wrong (and be willing to change your mind).––Make the most respectful interpretation of the other person’s perspective.––Acknowledge where you agree with your critics and what you’ve learned from them."" (240)Lukianoff and Haidt have offered up a terrific text that carries on the long American tradition of cultural critique; they clearly love America and want it to live up to its promise. Probably the best quote in the whole book is lifted from an interview with Van Jones, one of my political heroes:""I don’t want you to be safe ideologically. I don’t want you to be safe emotionally. I want you to be strong. That’s different. I’m not going to pave the jungle for you. Put on some boots, and learn how to deal with adversity. I’m not going to take all the weights out of the gym; that’s the whole point of the gym. This is the gym."" (97)Fellow American, whoever you are, wherever you are: I’m hitting the gym.

I guess it is alarmist enough that you could slap a fire engine red cover on it and expect to sell a decent volume of books? I'm unsure about the claim that the atmosphere at universities changed dramatically starting around 2012 (Part II) or the comprehensiveness of the list of drivers for this change (Part III). Claiming recent political events are as emotionally powerful as any since the late 1960's and have galvanized a generation to fight for social change seems like it might be a bit of an over-reach...

It’s also about much more than campus call-out culture, going into the parenting techniques and university policies that not only make young people weaker intellectually and emotionally but increase rates of anxiety, depression, self-harm, and suicide. This was the part of the book that struck me most: Identity politics that creates an us-vs.-them, good-vs.-evil mentality — as opposed to identity politics that creates a common-humanity mentality — is linked to negative physical outcomes in those who practice it. The first half of the book is very compelling; the next quarter is interesting; and the last quarter consists of recommendations on how to move forward. The book quotes Pauli Murray, a black and queer Episocopal priest and civil rights activist who, in 1965, at the age of 55, earned a degree from Yale Law School: “When my brothers try to draw a circle to exclude me, I shall draw a larger circle to include them.” Words to live by.

Haidt, as usual, has contributed to a book that is at once gracious and direct, to the heart of the issue: our social constructionism ideology is making our kids and society more fragile, thus (if you take the metaphor a bit further) more susceptible to diseases, of which, we used to be immune. It’s not every day that that two very prominent liberals, who have no record of voting for a single Republican candidate, write the most interesting and challenging book on the subject of free expression, antifragility, and social psychology that has come around to enthrall conservatives and liberals alike, in many years. Perhaps they are the once and future liberals we have always hoped would be amongst the “loyal opposition,” but as the cultural conversation shifts to a more antagonistic brand of scapegoating and “othering,” we need to stick together, for the health of the country and the virtue of our communities, individually and as a whole. The three great untruths in the first part of the book are worth the entire price. I’m going to use it, as I have with Haidt’s other books, to engage with my community to seek truth and justice in the (post)modern age of groundless identity. "

Haidt and Lukianoff, both excellent writers on their own, expanded their 2016 Atlantic article of the same title into a book length meditation on a number of things-- properly summed up: facts > feelings. They bring together research in psychology, internet culture, child-rearing and others to present a picture of the currently disenchanted generation of young people for whom ""safety"" is all encompassing. It's both very frightening (lose your livelihood because your face accidentally did a thing because you zoned out during a meeting and microaggressed someone in Generation Safe Space) and hopeful-- learning more about social media and device use can help people help their children become, in the words of Nicholas Nassim Taleb ""antifragile.""

111,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5857342-don,5,Ya'll have got to read this book. Two liberalish writers delve into the nonsense we're seeing on college campuses (trigger warnings and the like) and offer some surprising insight and suggest the way out.
112,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34426-shawn,5,"This is an important book that explains many of our contemporary social and academic ills. It argues that battles over freedom of expression, increasing anxiety and depression in youth, and political polarization are all connected to a set of ideas about childhood and educational practices. The book fits with many of my priors, so that likely colors how I think about it. Nevertheless, the arguments presented here are worth examining and exploring.Lukianoff and Haidt identify three ideas, what they call Great Untuths, that are main culprits:

   The Untruth of Fragility: the idea the kids are easily damaged or harmed. Parents and society must protect kids from any and all dangers and risks. 
  

   The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: Always trust your feelings: if you feel it to be true, it must be true. 
  

   The Untruth of Us vs. Them: Life is a battle between good people and evil people. We are always pitted against another tribe that is out to destroy us. 
 The gist of their argument is that these untruths took root in the 80s and led parents, teachers, and even children themselves to think that kids need constant monitoring and protection from all kinds of dangers and risks. This ‘safetyism’ led to reductions in free play, making it harder for kids to develop interpersonal conflict skills, personal risk assessment, self-confidence, and self-reliance. Moreover, the actual effects of these well-intentioned motives to protect kids made them more anxious and more at risk since they didn’t learn how to deal with potentially dangerous and risky situations. These untruths also encouraged various distorted ways of thinking about one’s self and others, leading to greater anxiety and depression, as well as a perception that disagreement about ideas and values posing a threat to one’s well-being and identity. If you think you are fragile and easily harmed, and think your feelings are an adequate guide to truth, then someone else expressing a different set of ideas can easily be interpreted as an existential threat from which you need protection. When the kids raised under these untruths — the so-called iGen or Generation Z — went to college they bring these distorted ways of thinking and demands for protection with them. The argument continues that these trends combined with other trends in parenting, education, and various concerns about social justice is what has lead to the conflicts we see on campuses and elsewhere today. Haidt and Lukianoff marshall social science evidence to make their case, building their arguments on their respective experiences in psychology, education, and parenting. I find it convincing and conclusive, but you should read the book to evaluate their arguments yourself. As a college educator, I see a lot of what Haidt and Lukianoff are talking about. I see it in the attitudes and behaviors of my students. I also see it in the reactions of university administration and how it tries to respond to the demands and needs of these students. And to be honest, I see it it in my son and my own parenting.One of the aspects I like about the book is its positive outlook. Though they are diagnosing and describing disturbing trends, they don’t see impending doom or catastrophe. They challenge us to see the counters to the untruths: 
   Kids are anti-fragile: they need to be exposed to and adapt to their environment so that they can deal with the inherent risks in that environment. “Prepare the child for the road, not the road for the child” 
  

   Emotional reasoning is fraught with bias and error: we need to be careful about the judgments we make and be aware of the cognitive biases we may have. 
  

   Tribalism is a dangerous way to approach life, often leading to greater conflict. Better to learn to use our inherent tribal instincts to reduce conflict by working to see our common identity.  
 By recognizing these truths, Haidt and Lukianoff provide a path out of the current state of things. They leave the reader with both hope and a set of intellectual tools.The book itself is accessible and a quick read. There is a lot of interesting and useful information, especially for parents and educators. This is not an academic book. Indeed, I think academics might find it a bit thin in some regards. There are plenty of sources and citations, but it is not written to satisfy the demands of academic rigor and comprehensiveness. But that’s not what Haidt and Lukianoff are looking to do here. It is more of a self-help guide for parents and educators. To help us see the problem and provide some advice on how to change and adjust our practices. In that regard, they are successful."
113,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3949130-lizzie-jones,5,"Incredible. One of the best books I've ever read. I'd give it 6 stars. Heck, I'd give it 8. Every chapter completely blew my mind. Many books I read offer supplemental material and links to websites and other reading. This is probably the first time I've ever actually looked up all the extra material. I looked at every video, every interview, every resource offered. This book was incredibly well-written and well-researched. It was organized and easy to follow. I listened to the book and this was also the first time I ever utilized the ""bookmark"" function on the audio book listening app I use. There was so much I wanted to remember and go back to. I got this book from the library and only a few chapters in I actually got online and bought myself both the physical hardbound copy AND the audio version, which I don't think I've ever done before. So what was so interesting? In short, everything. I happened to get this book from the library in early June, just as the country was entering a very desperate and devastating stage. I kept having to check when the book was published (late 2018) because it sounded like it had been published only days before given the things they were concerned about and the questions they were asking. If I had to describe this book in one word, it would be ""relevant."" This is a parenting book and a business book and a social psychology book and a clinical psychology book and a self-help book and a history book all in one. It talks a great deal about what parents can do to better raise their children to be self-sufficient, confident, and to fight their own battles. They talk about how helicopter parenting has gone to an all-time extreme and that, because of that, the culture of safetyism is dramatically changing the way children grow up. Safetyism is a culture or belief system in which safety (which includes ""emotional safety"") has become a sacred value, which means that people become unwilling to make trade-offs demanded by other practical and moral concerns. This causes children, teens, and young adults to avoid discomfort in many important forms. The authors blame this phenomenon for the overuse the college students of today being incapable and unwilling to confront anything remotely disquieting. Students protesting, sometimes violently, against certain speakers or certain professors or certain ideologies, for example, shows their incapability of dealing with opinions and viewpoints different to their own. I taught on a college campus for 5 years. I've seen this in action. I've seen students that are unable and unwilling to even consider the other side of an argument and as an educator I found it entirely unacceptable. I also see this every single day in the media and in politics and virtually everywhere else. People. don't. know. how. to. disagree. appropriately. It is a problem of monumental proportions and it needs to be addressed. In this book, they address the heck out of it. The authors also talk about the overuse of terms like PTSD, micro-aggressions, and trigger words. While all of these things are perfectly legitimate, they lose some of their power when usurped and commandeered by the uncomfortable rather than rightfully owned by the truly traumatized. They cover in the importance of political diversity and talk about the echo chambers that are very much a problem now, especially on college campuses. They cover the dangers of black and white thinking among other logical fallacies, and they talk in great deal about HOW TO FIX ALL THIS. The most interesting part of the book for me was the section about what happened at Evergreen University. I was not aware of what happened there and it entirely blew my mind. I was aware of the story they shared about the Halloween debate at Yale and I actually would teach a class on that one story to my college freshmen to talk to them about how to appropriately engage with an opposing viewpoint. The Evergreen case was 20 times worse than what happened at Yale. I though the authors were especially fair and pragmatic in their approaches. They acknowledged differing viewpoints and did very well to stick to proven data and true and factual accounts of real stories. I appreciated that even though I differ politically from both of these men, they still handled all political discussion with a great deal of respect. I thought their points were truly ground-breaking and I cannot recommend this book highly enough. One of the best and most influential books I've read in several years. If you're curious about what this book covers, consider reading the Atlantic article that started it all: https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/..."
114,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22356256-kyle,4,"This book has a long title that probably sets out the thesis in too provocative of terms. The authors are clear that by ""coddling"", they mean ""overprotecting."" They then proceed to explain what they mean. This means that the ""three great untruths"" are being propagated through society, to the detriment of the well-being of people. These three problems are ""Fragility: what doesn't kill you makes you weaker"", ""Emotional Reasoning: always trust your feelings"", and ""us vs them: life is a battle between good and evil people"". They are careful to make their claims defensible (such as these are not being taught explicitly, usually), and try to stick to the data we have. I find their analysis reasonable. They point out that kids are not coddled in being lazy, they are coddled in being protected and that we now have ""safetyism"" as a problem. Safetyism means that we want to reduce all risk on some measure (say chance of a child falling and breaking a bone) by taking away beneficial things with low risk (children playing in trees and exploring the woods). They point out that crime is actually down, and so under most risk/benefit evaluations we choose the worse option. This seems to be true from my anecdotal experience, and they usher some data, but I worry that the data is fairly inconclusive by itself. They examine parenting, college, and society in general. I think they give defensible ideas for the causes of safetyism and some ideas that could help. They are put forth tentatively, and so I give them credit for not overstating their case. They comment on many of the cases of colleges having breakdowns (the protests against campus speakers, Evergreen, the Yale episode with the Christakises), and point out the mental health trends for college age students. Again, the plural of anecdotes is not data, but they are careful and I find their analysis fairly convincing. It seems college students nowadays are less apt to be as strongly free speech as of just 5 or 10 years ago. I also personally think that supporting free speech in tough situations is the right call, so maybe I am too sympathetic to their argument.Overall, I think they give a good, balanced discussion. They point out that many of the reasons driving us towards this situation are good intentions. My strongest criticism is perhaps that the data they bring to support their interpretation is never strong enough to go beyond likely. When talking about recent events, it is perhaps inevitable, but I think their analysis of screen time over 2 hours having a negative relationship to mental health is fairly weak (I was able to find a NY Times article saying that such a relationship is not established). They are not advocating for a huge change, but they are advocating for change, and so it's always better to have a solidly backed theory, and I fear there's is likely, but not beyond a reasonable doubt.I would definitely recommend reading it if you keep up on the changes on college campuses vis a vis social justice. They do not strawman sides. If anything I thought they tried to inject balance everywhere. The stories are disturbing by painting a picture of some movement by universities away from truth-seekers, but the authors are careful not to make this apocalyptic sounding (not all universities, and most would still say they are truth-seeking). The chapters all have nice summaries, as does the book, and so it is quite easy to see their main ideas. I don't think I can award a full five stars because while they are nuanced, some of the themes do feel a bit repetitive, and it feels to me as if they are trying too hard to come across as fairly balanced at times. The style is quite readable, though."
115,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64313150-andrew-figueiredo,4,"I decided to read ""The Coddling of the American Mind"" because I felt like it might explain the experiences I had during my time at McGill and MAN was I correct. Haidt deconstructs the reasons behind and implications of the growing trend towards campus coddling. In a moment when cancel culture has extended to firing data analysts for tweeting out studies that don't conform with the ""woke"" position to forcing an overturning of the NYT editorial board for running a piece advocating for a position most Americans supported, this is an especially important read.The book centers around three central ""untruths"": fragility, always trusting feelings, and a Manichean view of the world. Haidt posits that not only are more young people thinking this way, but that university administrators, parents, and more push these untruths. Internalizing these untruths leads to examples like Charles Murray at Middlebury, the Evergreen State saga, and the riots at Berkeley. Identity becomes weaponized in a way that bolsters tribal attachment, instead of bringing people together around shared values. Speech, framed as violence, becomes easy censor on campus. Spirals of polarization result and academia adopt a self-radicalizing lens that discards the importance of real discussion. Normally, a back-and-forth leads to institutionalized disconfirmation. But under a system guided by untruths, an echo chamber results. The causes are varied: polarization, anxiety, helicopter parenting, decline in free play, expanding campus bureaucracy, passion for social justice, and changing notions of justice itself (towards equal outcomes). I was happy to see well-researched explanations on these points, as they go well beyond the ""political correctness"" the right often laments. I tend to agree with most of the causes, and Haidt doesn't make them all out to be uniformly negative. In fact, things like ""bias response"" emerged from the right intention but focused on the wrong issues. He sifts through the nuance, for example noting the importance of improved safety devices for children while lamenting parents' refusal to let kids be more independent. This adds credibility to an argument that in the media is often overly simplistic. One thing I loved is how the author sums up each chapter at the end. Because it's a quick-yet-applicable read, it's nice to go back and review key points.To his credit, Haidt isn't all problem-no solution. He gives tons of solutions for parents, students, and school administrators. Granted, I think some of the ""solutions"" would be ineffective and some are very vague, but it's good that he proposes them. Other ideas, like cross-partisan events on campus, are essential to revitalizing American academic culture. This is something I work on in my own life. Indeed, our campuses and social spaces would very much benefit from Haidt's approach to discourse. I become more convinced of it by the day."
116,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/129063-jack,4,"Really interesting. I like Jonathan Haidt, a co-author. As someone who has spent a remarkable, maybe ridiculous, amount of my life on college campuses, I think they make some great points, but also get some things wrong, or wrong for my experiences.Basically, they say that kids have been too coddled and have a tough time listening to opinions they disagree with, and colleges are playing to that. Conservatives will love those points: they believe, because all of their media and propaganda tells them this is so, that colleges are filled with liberal professors (true) who are brainwashing their kids (not true). I agree that elite colleges have become too protective of students, who complain of micro-aggression, and call for trigger warnings, and such. However, many on the left, including former President Obama, have argued AGAINST these positions. And I agree: college should be a place where all opinions and ideas are confronted. Bring people of all sorts of opinions and experiences and let them have their say, and audiences should calmly listen to them. I think this happens more than the authors care to admit, and I suspect that the issues the authors are writing about happen more often at elite schools, but elite college are important places. For me, at a community college, we're all too freakin' busy to get bogged down in a lot of that ideological ridiculousness. Also, I have invited right wing folks to campus, assigned conservative books, and I have never had a single protest or issue. I do indeed wish faculty AND student bodies were more ideologically diverse, but I also wish that was the case with Hollywood, the military, law enforcement, and corporate elite. What to do about it? The issue is, any ""fix"" would be worse than the problem (ideological/partisan tests in hiring? That’s actually illegal at many colleges; quotas?; affirmative action for ideology?), but talking about the problem in ALL of these areas is legit, and necessary. Colleges should ALWAYS stand for open conversation, critical thought, and respect for those we disagree with.The three untruths are fantastic and important:1) What hurts us makes us weaker; instead, we should see ourselves as antifragile;2) Always trust your feelings; no, trust science, data, and expertise, but be critical of all; and3) Life is a battle between good people and evil people; no, we all contain good and evil within us, and just because someone disagrees with you, it’s not useful to see them or their position as entirely wicked or immoral. Great stuff. "

What would you say if I told you that it was written by two self-described ""left-leaning"" Democrats? What would you think about me if I said that their chapter on Social Justice was one of the best I've ever read? :) *This book was fascinating in many respects. Anyone thinking of going into higher education, or raising children that they hope will attend college, should consider reading this book. It covers some upcoming problems in higher education and the, often, unprepared students that enter it.I believe that it also illustrates an issue that Love Your Enemies: How Decent People Can Save America from the Culture of Contempt didn't quite cover. What if people don't want to listen or be loved? What if they want you to be their enemy? It also slightly addressed potential causes of mass shootings, depression, microaggressions, and the mob mentality that seems to be brewing in locations in the US (I loved their response to the response to the Neo-Nazi mob in 2017. It was spot on). Being a fan of CBT and familiar with Burns, I was struck by their comments on the ways that society often reinforces negative patterns of thought. To be sure, I've found that many of the people I knew didn't do that, but society as a whole seems to. Perhaps that is just the side-effect of advertising. It struggled in two areas. 1st: It overlooks one other facet that I feel worth examining in connection with mental health and emotional well-being--- Family structure. ** 2nd: I really didn't like the word ""Coddling"" in the title. It implies a negative pity--- which I don't think is called for because most people are, as the title goes on to say, doing these things with the best of intentions. That being said, to tackle the topic as they do in the beginning is a brave endeavor. Especially given potential repercussions. *Don't disown me Grandpa... ;) They do advocate for more conservatives on college campuses, but not for the reasons you'd think. ** See Marriage and Caste in America: Separate and Unequal Families in a Post-Marital Age, The Home We Build Together: Recreating Society, and Becoming Attached: First Relationships and How They Shape Our Capacity to Love."
118,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52954740-caleb-hoyer,5,"This book was an eye-opening, illuminating examination of the current state of affairs largely on campuses of elite universities, but also more broadly our culture and the rising generation (referred to as iGen by the authors and the research they reference). I felt like this book put its finger on many issues that frustrate me but that I couldn’t even adequately articulate. I’m often exasperated at how annoyed/embarrassed/incredulous I feel towards the rhetoric and behavior of people who I actually agree with politically, and this felt like it was reading my mind and providing much needed context and explanation for why that is. The authors argue that several parties within the last few years have had harmless, even laudable intentions: students/young people with a passionate commitment to social justice, parents who want to raise happy, high-achieving, safe children, and university administrators who want to create an academic environment that serves its students well and fosters a culture where every student feels heard and valued. In pursuit of these noble aims, however, several trends have begun that promote counterproductive and sometimes destructive methods and modes of thinking to achieve those goals. They liken these misguided processes to common cognitive distortions found in cognitive behavioral therapy. It’s a fascinating hypothesis, and they have no shortage of examples to provide evidence for their theory. They’re on strongest ground when examining the psychological ramifications, with the sociological feeling more reaching, and the political being a bit dubious. And their focus is strongest when it’s restricted to the university, perhaps because it is a much more uniform environment than the entire country/culture. It was also very interesting reading much of their opinions after having recently read Robin DiAngelo’s White Fragility. Many could argue that these two authors are writing from a place of extreme privilege, and reaching conclusions that serve to reinforce their privilege. I’m not sure I’d ultimately agree with such an assessment, but there were a couple of times in the course of reading it that I felt it was rearing its head. However, even if that is true, I’m not sure that it actually invalidates any of the arguments they put forth. And regardless, they’re diving into such thorny but deeply interesting concepts that it makes for fantastic reading, and spurs the imagination on towards many more topics. "

Not quite as good as I had every reason to expect. The authors undoubtedly come from a place of concern and understanding. The fine people at the Heterodox Academy have highlighted important social trends around campus speech codes, trigger warnings, emotional reasoning, identity politics, the psychopathology of (self-enforced) mental fragility, etc... This book is a testament to that worrying and often puzzling empirical reality, and the first decent attempt at exorcising its demons. The faults of the book, however, undermine the coherence and credibility of the overall analysis. The three big ones are...1) An inability or unwillingness to provide a big causal story that makes sense. Quality is replaced by quantity. Everything gets blamed from bad parenting to school administrators to academic ideologies. No doubt all of these are important trends. I just don't find the ""shotgun"" method of analysis particularly helpful in pinpointing the ROOT causes of the problem. 2) A failure to seek to understand the philosophical and moral foundations of radical egalitarianism, transgressive social norms, the discourse on power, etc... For a proper understanding, one would have to read and understand Marx, Marcuse, Foucault, Derrida, Butler, etc. This is beyond the interests of the authors. We are thus left with a muddled narrative that replaces philosophy with psycho(patho)logy. This can illuminate some important aspects of the campus madness but not unearth its parallel metaphysical foundations.3) As a consequence of the descriptive psychopathological focus, the normative emphasis on cognitive-behavioural therapy follows naturally. CBT, while worthwhile as a general tool of self-improvement, may be partially misplaced as a particular remedy to identity politics and social justice wars. It psychologizes and infantilizes one's opponents (see point #2 above), and fails to address the root causes of tribalism, moral righteousness, and extremism. Nazism was not defeated by therapy but by guns and propaganda, and the Berlin Wall required half a century to come down. CBT could not have done the job, since ideology is different from psychic illness. Not even the best of self-help advice will be able to solve the trans rights or abortion or global warming debate. Only a prolonged ethical-political debate will, which is why free speech is so important. For all its faults, the book carries an important message on how to secure free speech. In addition, it offers some uncalled for but eminently useful practical advice on how to cure combative millennials. The book lacks robustness as a coherent thesis and therefore misses the final landing by a mile. But at least it manages to take off in a bold new direction over the horizon that is bound to attract more and better equipped Amelia Earharts."

People on the left lie and misinterpret what even their fellow leftists are saying in order to chase clout on the internet and look Woker Than Thou.I can't even express confusion about what's going on without being disingenuous, because it wasn't too long ago that I was part of this sort of outrage culture; despite my reservations about the viciousness I saw in some of my fellows, I rarely said anything to anyone. The biggest mistake this book makes is in assuming that this problem doesn't extend past college campuses - it does. Colleges aren't even the hottest locus for this culture anymore. This is the culture of almost every online leftist circle I've been in within the past eight years or so, hyper-focused on finding things problematic, unable to relax, treating every emotional reaction like a valid justification for claiming bigotry. My experience is biased - I am an extremely online person - but my experience is not terribly uncommon these days.I liked this book, but I'm not sure what else to say about it. What the authors point out as a problem in this book has mushroomed into absolutely bananas behaviour in the space of two years, and through no fault of its own, that's its weakness - it can't address what this problem has become because the problem has intensified to a startling degree. The advice the authors suggest (more unsupervised free time in childhood, teaching children to recognize and combat cognitive distortions, etc.) is fantastic, and hopefully, future generations will be raised with an eye to the problems of today; but it's a bit too little, too late. All we can do right now is hope that enough people realize how damaging the New Left can be to its own cause."
121,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7839801-george-p,5,"“This is a book about wisdom and its opposite,” write Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt in The Coddling of the American Mind. “It is a book about three psychological principles and about what happens to young people when parents and educators—acting with the best of intentions—implement policies that are inconsistent with those principles.” In my opinion, it is also a book every American concerned with the future of our nation’s public discourse and democratic culture should read.And yes, I am serious about that.The Coddling of the American Mind grew out of the increased support among college students for censorship of controversial opinions, a trend that Lukianoff began to notice in the fall of 2013. Lukianoff is president and CEO of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE), a leading advocate for free speech on college and university campuses. In his experience, until that time, the leading advocates for censorship had been college administrators. What was driving the rapid rise of support for censorship among students?For much of his life, Lukianoff had suffered clinical depression, even contemplating suicide in late 2007. In 2008, he underwent cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a form of psychotherapy that identifies distorted patterns of thinking that often underlie depression and anxiety, and this helped him tremendously. As Lukianoff interacted with students, he noticed that the way they reasoned about controversial issues often mirrored the same cognitive distortions CBT teaches people to control.This insight led to a conversation with Haidt, a social psychologist, Thomas Cooley Professor of Ethical Leadership at New York University’s Stern School of Business, and author of The Righteous Mind: Why Good People are Divided by Politics and Religion. That conversation led to a feature storyin the September 2015 issue of The Atlantic. The book builds out the article’s core thesis.Lukianoff and Haidt unfold their argument in three parts: Part I, “Three Bad Ideas,” looks at “three Great Untruths”:1. The Untruth of Fragility: What Doesn’t Kill You Makes You Weaker2. The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: Always Trust Your Feelings3. The Untruth of Us Versus Them: Life Is a Battled Between Good People and Evil PeopleTaken together, these untruths result in “a culture of safetyism” on campus, whereby students must be protected from opposing opinions that might “harm” their “safety,” no longer defined as physical safety but now as emotional safety too.The results of this culture of safetyism, ironically enough, are intimidation and violence on the one hand and witch hunts on the other, as the Lukianoff and Haidt argue in Part II, “Bad Ideas in Action.”They cite the February 1, 2017, anti-Milo Yiannopoulos riot at the University of California at Berkeley as an example of the former, though there are many such examples scattered throughout the book. But the threats of violence are not merely coming from leftwing Antifa activists on campus. The authors point to alt-right off-campus provocation as well, specifically the neo-Nazi march through the University of Virginia’s campus on August 11, 2017. The confrontation between protesters and counterprotesters the next day resulted in the vehicular murder of Heather Heyer by an alt-right driver.Lukianoff and Haidt cite several examples of academic witch hunts conducted against professors who utter heterodox ideas, even if they are liberal or leftwing. Prof. Bret Weinstein’s protest of the “Day of Absence” at Evergreen State College in Washington is a leading example of this. The school is quite liberal, as is Weinstein. On its annual Day of Absence, minority faculty students since the 1970s had gone off campus to make their absence, and hence contributions, palpable. But in 2017, organizers of the event asked white faculty and students not to show up. Weinstein thought this went too far and was subjected to vicious protests for saying so.As these events illustrate, college and university campuses, which are supposed to be beacons of free speech, have instead in many cases become their opposite. There is no one-size-fits-all explanation for why this has happened, but in Part III, “How Did We Get Here?,” Lukianoff and Haidt identify “six interacting explanatory threads”:""rising political polarization and cross-part animosity; rising levels of teen anxiety and depression; changes in parenting practices; the decline of free play; the growth of campus bureaucracy; and a rising passion for justice in response to major national events, combined with changing ideas about what justice requires.""This may be the most interesting part of the book, rich in social scientific detail and fair-minded in its analysis. As the parent of three elementary-age children, the chapters on “Paranoid Parenting” and “The Decline of Free Play” were thought-provoking and helpful.Part IV, “Wising Up,” builds on the analysis of the previous chapters and suggests a way forward for making “Wiser Kids,” “Wiser Universities,” and “Wiser Societies,” as the titles of the three chapters indicate. A table on page 263 summarizes the argument of the entire book, so I’ll reproduce it here:PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLE // WISDOM //GREAT UNTRUTH1. Young people are antifragile. // Prepare the child for the road, not the road for the child. // What doesn’t kill you makes you weaker.2. We are all prone to emotional reasoning and the confirmation bias. // Your worst enemy cannot harm you as much as your own thoughts, unguarded. But once mastered, no one can help you as much, not even your father or your mother. // Always trust your feelings.3. We are all prone to dichotomous thinking and tribalism. // The line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being. // Life is battle between good people and evil people.As I mentioned at the outset of this review, I am serious when I say that every American concerned with the future of our nation’s public discourse and democratic culture should read The Coddling of the American Mind. It stimulated my thinking as a parent and helped form a better opinion of contemporary events as a concerned citizen. As a person, it provided an accessible introduction to cognitive behavioral therapy, identifying the cognitive distortions that misshape our opinions and hence misguide our actions. And it reminded me that people across the aisle from me—politically and religiously—are also intelligent and public-minded and can have things to say I need to hear.So, buy this book. Read it. Then share it.Book ReviewedGreg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt, The Coddling of the American Mind: How Good Intentions and Bad Ideas Are Setting Up a Generation for Failure (New York: Penguin Press, 2018).P.S.

122,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5819312-sheryl-sorrentino,5," The Coddling of the American Mind offers a crucial summation of ""where we are"" as a nation. The book tears down the ""Three Great Untruths"" that have overtaken our public discourse: (1) “What doesn’t kill you makes you weaker,” (2) “Always trust your feelings,” and (3) “Life is a battle between good people and evil people.” The authors explain how these ""untruths"" are the polar opposite of the conventional wisdom needed to fairly evaluate opposing points of view with logic, critical thinking, empathy and open-mindedness, and are in fact based on various cognitive distortions.  The Coddling of the American Mind also discusses how tribalism is driving a wedge between various identity groups in this country. The authors do not downplay the realities of hate speech and verbal intimidation, but hail the virtues of the ""sticks and stones"" philosophy, where true strength and resiliency come not from ""safe spaces"" where people can shield themselves from speech they find distasteful, but by feeling ""safe"" in their own skin despite whatever someone else might be saying. Particular emphasis is given to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), which the authors maintain can ""correct"" the cognitive distortions that cause ""emotional triggers."" There is even a short guide at the end of the book that explains how to practice this therapeutic technique. Particular emphasis is given to the chilling of free speech on college campuses—the result of college students' emotional fragility and its resultant ""otherizing"" opposing points of view and the people who hold them. The authors make a strong case that the various developmental disadvantages suffered by the current generation of college kids (""iGen"") was caused by excessive early childhood ""screen time,"" overprotective parenting and the elimination of free, unsupervised play (with all of its attendant risks). As the parent of a college sophomore, this book spoke to me; I may have, indeed, been guilty of overprotective parenting.In spite of the polarization we are experiencing in this country—along with the threats of climate change and social injustice—this book ends on a positive note offering an optimistic perspective for the future. I would recommend  The Coddling of the American Mind to iGen kids and their parents, as well as anyone else concerned about the devolution of discourse plaguing our nation during these troubled times.

Parents are overly protective of their children and these protected children show their vulnerabilities when they go to universities, complaining about how they are offended by opposition or even opposition to their views. Lukianoff and Haidt argue that physical safety is essential but students should not be protected from people who challenge their views. If anything, it makes them better at developing their stance on things and at responding to criticism. The more impactful danger that looms behind this is that freedom of speech suffers. If there is anywhere that ideas should be openly discussed, it is at a university. If this is no longer possible, the polarization that is already happening will only accelerate. The two writers also provide very basic advice to parents who are raising young children by saying that it is important to let them discover things themselves and not resort to the helicopter-parent mode. It is good for them to look after themselves every now and then and build up responsibility that they will need down the line. It is exactly this lack of independence that shows later in life and makes them weaker, not stronger. The book ends with a few useful practical advices about how we need to risk getting ""hurt"" or offended in order to grow, at an individual but also at a social level. The message of this book feels very important to me, especially because there is so much going on around us and there is so much out there. It is vital to the survival of a democracy that we remain open to people who do not agree with us. We should think about raising responsible children instead of overprotecting them and sending them out into the world too vulnerable to assert themselves. "
124,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8745469-peter-kazmaier,3,"To my thinking, THE CODDLING OF THE AMERICAN MIND is really two books which I would rate very differently and as such the average overall rating (three stars) is misleading. The first three chapters are excellent and I would rate that portion of the book as four or five stars. They delineate the root causes behind many of the disturbing trends one sees in the thinking and conduct of undergraduates today and analyzes these causes in terms of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). They distill their observations and recommendations into three lies and about nine pit falls in thinking CBT attempts to counteract. I found these ideas very helpful and continue to use them to analyze my own thinking. I will read these chapters over and over again.I am much less sanguine about the second part of the book which provides anecdotes, supposedly in support of the early chapters. Reiterating the events at Evergreen State College was useful, but for most of the anecdotes and discussion, I found that the authors broke their own rules. They used labeling extensively without clearly defining their labels. Many of the labels were highly pejorative, yet as far as I could see the authors did not explain why the labels were appropriate. They seemed to engage in mind reading (another of the pitfalls) in that they seemed confident they knew what motivated the various non-university groups which they also seemed to blame for the anxiety-ridden undergraduate mindset.When I finished and thought about what I had read, it seemed to me the authors were aiming for an “equality of blame” in their analysis of the anecdotes. This made no sense to me. The university administrations establish codes of conduct, enforce them, hire faculty, permit or exclude external speakers, and ultimately decide if they will support or not support teachers and students that are under attack for their views. Similarly the reading lists, course work, examinations, and grading are carried out by the faculty. Furthermore professors, by their own conduct and the way they approach questions provide examples to the students on how one should behave as one purses truth in an unbiased and objective manner. It seems ludicrous to me to argue that outside forces or groups who have trouble even getting an invited speaker onto campus can share equal culpability for how students are turning out.In summary, the early chapter are excellent and deserve a rating of four or five stars. The rest of the book, to my mind deserves only one or two stars. The average or overall rating, is perhaps, 2.5 to 3 stars."

As I was reading this book and finding it quite interesting, I reached out to a few thoughtful and well-read friends to mention how I was enjoying it. Each said that they were avoiding it because they had a problem with the author Haidt. That got me a little worried about what I was overlooking and failing to consider. But the more I read, the more I liked the book, loving the way that the authors laid out their arguments and thinking that something important was being said. I finished the book very impressed. I'm not sure whether the authors' contentions are _correct_, but I respect their effort and am excited to have this topic further debated.After I read the book, to further investigate Haidt, I listened to about four hours of Haidt interviews from various sources (admittedly, mostly friendly audiences). He seems like a reasonable guy to me, sufficiently respectable to be able put forth an argument and have others review and respond to it. I read some book reviews, and the criticism felt jumbled to me. With The Guardian's review, for instance, there seems to be some legitimate criticism there, but it's too messy and fragmented for me to really grasp on to. My favorite piece of criticism that I've come across is the goodreads review by ""Mehrsa"" below. In the end, the criticism pushed me away from the 5.0 star rating that I was inclined to give, instead pushing me down to 4.5.I'm very curious what others think.

I finished my undergrad degree in May 2013, so right before all of this started to take off. All the stuff about Milo Yiannopoulus is so amusing to me. My book review for Dangerous is one of the top reviews on Goodreads but.....no one cares about Milo anymore and the 2015 Berkeley thing seems just embarrassing in 2020. If you're one of those speed reader types, there is an ""In Sum"" at the end of each chapter for what appears to be that purpose. If you have not read iGen, you should do so before reading this. I would almost call this work a response to iGen. With all that stuff being said, Zoomers/iGen are the only people who have ever vocally expressed concern about me being on my phone in a room full of people. ""Are you okay?"" ""Are you feeling left out?"" I was answering one measly text, but the presence of my phone affected them immediately and they were worried about my current mental state. Millennials, GenX, and Baby Boomers would never say this ever, to anyone.Side note on one of their suggestions: As a Children's Librarian & the Vice President of a local teen center for the past 5 years, I could tell you that forcing Zoomers to read iGen will probably not go over well. If you suggest that psychological problems stem from smart phones, their sole takeaway will be that you're a pearl clutching, crotchety 95 year old who was born in the nineteen hundreds. They will say ""nineteen hundreds"" to make 1990 feel like 1903. Lol."

As a moderate leftist I became increasingly annoyed, after I noticed I started participating in it myself and tried correcting myself on it, with the call-out culture and moralististic condemning of everyone that does not hold your opinion or world view. I learned the hard way we must always listen to everyone's opinion, how hard or stupid it may sound to you. Having read the Righteous Mind and The Happiness Hypothesis the Coddling of the American Mind is a perfect example of the wisdoms of Haidts books put into practise. Although I truly loved the new perspective on our modern day political culture I agree with many critics that the book ressembles more an enlarged essay than a true book. I would've loved a deeper dive into more flushed out evidence and psychological processes. Of course, not everyone likes this so the writers had to make some justifiable compromises. However deep, or undeep, you may be entrenched into the politics or college life of today, I encourage everyone to read this book, just to make you see things from a new angle. Maybe even read All Minus One, an easy to start (and I believe free, online) book that features John Stuart Mills ideas and arguments on and for free speech. Together these books make a very strong argument for leaving the current culture of safetyism, call-out culture, uninviting speakers, public outrage and shaming ect. behind."

It has me so concerned for our future, and we're seeing so much of what was discussed in this book happening around us today. I'm still processing some of it because I very much believe in the idea of ""when you know better, you do better."" How much do we know better and that's why we do the things we do. I do think we've made life for our kids too easy. The road has been prepared for them and they have not been prepared for the road. I found it very interesting that they discussed how kids are growing up slower--not faster--like we so often hear. This may be some of the issues I've seen in schools. The book says students who are 15 are acting like 12 and when they go to college at 18, they are more like what a 15 year old would be. This explains so much of the need for a ""safe place"" to go on campus when someone has an idea that offends you. I love the discussion of a ""call out"" culture in this book, and I see that every day around me. This is something that permeates the world--when someone has a difference of opinion, then we must call them out, and almost shame them. "

This book—written by two liberals—discusses three bad ideas that result in a culture of ""safetyism"" in higher education, recounts specific instances showing the consequences of these ideas, traces factors that led to the embrace of these ideas, and attempts to propose solutions.1. The Untruth of Fragility: What doesn't kill you makes you weaker.2. The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: Always trust your feelings.3. The Untruth of Us Versus Them: Life is a battle between good people and evil people.The authors identify six contributing factors to this culture of safetyism, devoting a chapter to each:1. Rising political polarization, with campuses shifting leftward and increasingly distrusted by those on the right.2. An increase in adolescent anxiety and depression beginning in 2011, significantly correlating to smartphone usage. This group began arriving on campus in 2013.3. Paranoid parenting resulting in far less unsupervised play and greater fears of abduction (even though crime rates for this crime have dropped).4. The decline of free play and the rise of emphasis on test preparation.5. The growth of a bureaucracy of safetyism at universities, driven by federal mandates, risks of lawsuits, and a consumerist mentality, in which students are the consumers.6. The quest for justice, evoked by events between 2012 and 2018 that sometimes focuses on ""equal outcomes social justice"" in which any demographic disparity is assumed to be the result of discrimination, and alternative explanations are themselves considered discriminatory.Every college administrator should read this book, and as Gen-Z enters the workforce, corporate and business leaders probably should too.

They don't nail the hypothesis exactly, but they do enough damage to make this book necessary reading. As someone who always looked at university as a four-year paid vacation, I felt like these authors schooled my uneducated self on what university is supposed to be like and why it's important. There was a great deal of discussion on how proper education can teach you how to think critically, and why differing opinions are so important to that. While the two authors do seem to be classic liberals, they do also become very critical of where higher education has gone. Yet, they do a good job of explaining why that has taken place. I found their explanation to be fair and wholly bipartisan. When they start diving into studies of what happens to mammals without socializing play...man, it gets trippy. The cognitive distortions caused by new technology and different attitudes...it gets you worried for these kids. Highly recommended. "

Very helpful to understand the terms, definitions, sources of authority, understanding and actions of a segment of IGen that gets a lot of airtime on national news. A solid description of what is going on and why.As a Christian, I found the authors prescriptions for change lacking in a substantive foundation (confirmation bias, I know what you are thinking). We need to ground our understanding of humanity in something larger than ourselves (as image-bearers of God intrinsically worthy of respect and care). Because this is how I think and want others to treat me is not sufficient grounds. I really appreciate the authors desire to break the destructive cycles we are presently caught (and they in fact offer some very good ideas) but we now need a Truth that transcends human experience and reality and that lays claims on us all to live righteously and with integrity.

While it may not be the end-all guide for how and why the younger people in our society sometimes behave (positively and negatively) the way they do, it does provide an alternative viewpoint and thought path to seeing things through their eyes.If you are interested in a different, albeit more in-depth viewpoint, into the mind of today's youth, this is an informative read. It gives you things to look for and ideas as to why people react the way they do as well as tips for helping kids that are growing up in the turbulent atmosphere.This is the first book/study that I have read on this subject. Definitely something to think about and a good conversation starter for engaging with parents, educators, children, or just about anyone interested in understanding today's atmosphere."

The peculiarities described in the book on the American iGen are far from exclusive. The trends seen in the West are alarming and don't spare the Christian subculture as I've seen many of them during my college career. I judged it a helpful yet discouraging read.

I feel like they have a very fair-minded approach to the topics, and aren't trying to push forward the left or right agendas.Some highlights for me:Anti-fragility: What doesn't kill you makes you weaker is a common misconception. Children are not fragile, but anti-fragile.Safetyism is harmful. Our children live in a safer environment than when I grew up.Emotional distress != physical harmFree play, and unstructured outdoor playing is crucial for children to learn how to take risks.Chief Justice John Roberts' talk: I hope you have just enough pain to learn compassion. iGen's use of electronics and social media is a large contributor to depression and anxiety.Cognitive behavioral therapy to combat depression and anxiety.Children are safer than ever before, but are taking longer to grow up.On Being Wrong.

I used this for a book study with college students. Haidt gives the reader a brand new vocabulary for a culture being built around fragility, safetyism, and plummeting mental health, and provides practical ways to counter. This has to be one of the most important book to read in the next few years. "

Taking a centrist position, the authors provide examples of people in left and right who have fallen into psychological traps which could have been avoided using cognitive behavioural therapy. This book really helps understand the iGen (internet generation, born 1995 onwards), parenting in the turn of the millenium, as well as some CBT techniques that help anyone lead a better life. They also provide their arguments in a moderate manner, giving them rather as suggestions than authoritative advice. That actually gives them more weight."

154,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13571110-reid-mccormick,5,"“It is the ultimate mental gymnasium, full of advanced equipment, skilled trainers, and therapists standing by, just in case.”A few years ago I read The Righteous Mind by Jonathan Haidt and I loved every second of that book. So when I heard Haidt was involved in writing a book about college students and how we prepare them for the world, I knew I had to read this book. Let me start off by saying I loved the book. I could not put it down. It was engaging from start to finish. Each chapter of the book stretched my mind until it felt like mush. There were moments when I thought the authors were geniuses and other moments where I thought the authors were completely nuts. And looking back on it, I realize this is the problem. We want to put everything into categories. Everything has to be either right or wrong. Nothing is allowed to be the middle. You must be for something or against something, there is no room for anything else.However, we must accept tension. Living within tension is beautiful. It is not easy but it can release our limitations. If we instantly put things into categories before we think through them, then we have already lost. The authors point this out: “Teaching people to see aggression in ambiguous interactions, take more offense, feel more negative emotions, and avoid questioning their interpretations strike us as unwise.”I can love this book even though I think the arguments in the book are at times weak and other times amazing. I have worked with college students for many years now. I know there are generational differences, but they are all human and college student problems are all the same they just manifest themselves in different ways. This is the challenge we see today. College students can be very resilient when they want to be, the trick is challenging them to be resilient. Colleges are imperfect places and there are a no quick fixes to higher education woes. For example, I worked on a college campus that did not provide on campus medical staff and I was shamed by a parent for it. I said it wouldn’t be a problem, but we would need to raise tuition a few thousand dollars per student just to cover the costs of staff, facilities, and insurance. Let’s just say, the parent did offer to donate any money. (And no, we did not have a climbing wall or lazy river on our campus either)Again, I loved the book and I loved the message of resiliency but here a few items mentioned in the book that I am not so quick to blame:Social Media: Are social media and smartphones powerful and dangerous tools that can do major harm? Absolutely. Will television and video games rot my brain? No, it didn’t though I was warned incessantly by my mother and other so-called research. That said, I think technology gets blamed way too quickly for society's problems. It is easy to blame because adults usually don’t understand it (for example, Congress had no idea how Facebook works and the government looked silly trying to blame them for modern problems).Extreme Anecdotes: A professor gets fired for an unassuming email. Protests erupt on campus because of speaker. A mother gets shamed online for her parenting. These are all real issues, but they are all extreme cases. I have worked long enough to know that what we see covered in media is not the full story. Even in this book, the authors use a throwaway line such as (and I am paraphrasing) “Now we don’t know about other events that led up to…” That’s a pretty big throwaway. It may be a case of an overreacting student, but it could also be the straw that broke the camel’s back on a campus strife with innate racism and sexism. A lot of things change when you raise the temperature just one degree when water can begin to boil.Risks to Democracy: Yes, if we cannot have civil discourse, democracy suffers, but I think it is a little much to say that “coddled” college students are setting us all up for failure. Young people rarely vote and that is probably because they do not understand a lot of things yet about themselves.Near the end of the book, there is a line that I think sums up perfectly why college students are recently acting differently: “College students today are living in an extraordinary time...They are identifying injustices that have been well-documented and unsuccessfully addressed for too long.” Perhaps they are tired of the same old thing. This is a great book and it deserves to be read thoughtfully. I loved the end where it said “Prepare the child for the road, not the road for the child.” I think this is very true. We can’t make the road safe, but we can wear seatbelts and get upset when the same darn pothole hasn’t been fixed."
155,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69455267-samuel-m,4,"As Carlin said in his last special: ""Fortunately, all is not lost, because we know that when he does get to play, whatever games he is allowed to play, the child will never lose. Because in today's America, no child ever loses. There are no losers anymore. Everyone's a winner. No matter what the game or sport or competition, everybody wins. Everybody wins, everybody gets a trophy, no one is a loser. No child these days ever gets to hear those all-important, character-building words, ""You lost, Bobby. You lost, you're a loser."" They miss out on that. You know what they tell the kid who lost these days? ""You were the last winner."" A lot of these kids never get to hear the truth about themselves until they're in their twenties, when their boss calls them in and says, ""Bobby, clean out your desk and get the fuck outta here; you're a loser.""Of course, Bobby's parents can't understand why he can't hold a job; in school he was always on the honor roll. Well, what they don't understand is that in today's schools, everyone is on the honor roll. Everyone is on the honor roll because in order to be on the honor roll, all you need to do is to maintain a body temperature somewhere roughly in the 90's.Now, all of this stupid nonsense that children have been so crippled by has grown out of something called the ""self-esteem movement."" The self-esteem movement began around 1970, and I'm happy to say it has been a complete failure. Studies have repeatedly shown that having high self-esteem does not improve grades, does not improve career achievement, it does not even lower the use of alcohol, and most certainly does not reduce the incidence of violence of any sort, because as it turns out, extremely aggressive, violent people think very highly of themselves. Imagine that; sociopaths have high self-esteem. Who'da thunk?I love it when that kinda thing happens. I love it when these politically correct ideas crash and burn and wind up in the shit house.The self-esteem movement revolved around a single idea: that every child is special. Boy, they said it over and over and over, as if to convince themselves. ""Every child is special."" Every child is clearly not special. They're incomplete; unfinished work, and I never give credit for incomplete work.But let's say it's true, that every child is special. What about every adult? Isn't every adult special too? And if not, then at what age do you go from being ""special"" to being not-so-special? And if every adult is special, that means we're all special, and the whole idea loses all its meaning.It's all bullshit, people, and it's bad for ya."""

Fragility - What doesn’t kill you makes you weaker“Young people are antifragile”2. Emotional Reasoning - Always trust your feelings“We are all prone to emotional reasoning and the confirmation bias”3. Us Versus Them - Life is a battle between good people and evil people“We are all prone to dichotomous thinking and tribalism”+ 6 explanatory threads for how we ended up embracing the 3 great untruths1. Rising political polarization and cross-party animosity of U.S. politics, which has led to rising hate crimes and harassment on campus2. Rising levels of teen anxiety and depression, which have made many students more desirous of protection and more receptive to the Great Untruths 3. Changes in parenting practices, which have amplified children’s fears even as childhood becomes increasingly safe4. The loss of free play and unsupervised risk-taking, both of which kids need to become self-governing adults5. The growth of campus bureaucracy and expansion of its protective mission 6. An increasing passion for justice, combined with changing ideas about what justice requires+ People are more than resilient, they are antifragile- “...They require stressors and challenges in order to learn, adapt, and grow. Systems that are antifragile become rigid, weak, and inefficient when nothing challenges them or pushes them to respond vigorously”+ The Principle of Charity- “One should interpret other people’s statements in their best, most reasonable form, not in the worst or most offensive way possible”+ The politics of common humanity- “Identity can be mobilized in ways that emphasize an overarching common humanity while making the case that some fellow human beings are denied dignity and rights because they belong to a particular group, or it can be mobilized in ways that amplify our ancient tribalism and bind people together in shared hatred of a group that serves as the unifying common enemy.”+ Marxist ideology is psychologically unhealthy- “[In] Marxist approaches to social and political analysis… things are analyzed primarily in terms of power. Groups struggle for power. Within this paradigm, when power is perceived to be held by one group over others, there is a moral polarity: the groups seen as powerful are bad, while the groups seen as oppressed are good. It’s a variant of pathological dualism”+ 4 features of call-out culture1. Dogmatism2. Groupthink3. A crusader mentality4. Anti-intellectualism+ How “scientific” research can get skewed- “When a field lacks political diversity, researchers tend to congregate around questions and research methods that generally confirm their shared narrative, while ignoring questions and methods that don’t offer such support”+ 4 properties of witch hunts (which is basically what campus mobs are)1. They seem to come out of nowhere2. They involve charges of crimes against the collective3. The offenses that lead to those charges are often trivial or fabricated4. People who know that the accused is innocent keep quiet, or in extreme cases, they join the mob- “Viewpoint diversity reduces a community’s susceptibility to witch hunts. One of the most important kinds of viewpoint diversity, diversity of political thought, has declined substantially among both professors and students at American universities since the 1990s”+ 3 distinct attributes of victimhood culture (versus dignity culture)1. Individuals and groups display high sensitivity to slight2. They have a tendency to handle conflicts through complaints to third parties3. They seek to cultivate an image of being victims who deserve assistance- “In an optimally functioning dignity culture, people are assumed to have dignity and worth regardless of what others think of them, so they are not expected to react too strongly to minor slights. Of course, full dignity was at one time accorded only to adult, white men; the rights revolutions of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries did essential work to expand dignity to all”+ Human beliefs about justice- “Humans naturally favour fair distributions, not equal ones… When fairness and equality clash, people prefer fair inequality over unfair equality” Christina Starmans, Mark Sheskin, and Paul Bloom+ 4 rules for productive disagreement1. Frame it as a debate, rather than a conflict2. Argue as if you’re right, but listen as if you’re wrong (and be willing to change your mind)3. Make the most respectful interpretation of the other person’s perspective4. Acknowledge where you agree with your critics and what you’ve learned from themQuotes:“Prepare the child for the road, not the road for the child.” Folk wisdom, origin unknown“Your worst enemy cannot harm you as much as your own thoughts, unguarded. But once mastered, no one can help you as much, not even your father or your mother.” Buddha, Dhammapada“If only it were so simple! If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being.” Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, The Gulag ArchipelagoMany parents, K-12 teachers, professors, and university administrators have been unknowingly teaching a generation of students to engage in the mental habits commonly seen in people who suffer from anxiety and depression. We suggested that students were beginning to react to words, books, and visiting speakers with fear and anger because they had been taught to exaggerate danger, use dichotomous (or binary) thinking, amplify their first emotional responses, and engage in a number of other cognitive distortions.Whatever your identity, background, or political ideology, you will be happier, healthier, stronger, and more likely to succeed in pursuing your own goals if you… seek out challenges (rather than eliminating or avoiding everything that “feels unsafe”), free yourself from cognitive distortions (rather than always trusting your initial feelings), take a generous view of other people, and look for nuance (rather than assuming the worst about people within a simplistic us-versus-them morality).Most people report becoming stronger, or better in some way, after suffering through a traumatic experience. That doesn’t mean we should stop protecting young people from potential trauma, but it does mean that the culture of safetyism is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of human nature and of the dynamics of trauma and recovery. It is vital that people who have survived violence become habituated to ordinary cues and reminders woven into the fabric of daily life. Avoiding triggers is a symptom of PTSD, not a treatment for it.Teaching people to see more aggression in ambiguous interactions, take more offense, feel more negative emotions, and avoid questioning their initial interpretations strikes us as unwise, to say the least. It is also contrary to the usual goals of good psychotherapy.“Love is the only force capable of transforming an enemy into a friend… Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.” Martin Luther King, Jr.“For hate is not conquered by hate; hate is conquered by love. This is a law eternal.” Buddha* “I intend to destroy segregation by positive and embracing methods. . . . When my brothers try to draw a circle to exclude me, I shall draw a larger circle to include them. Where they speak out for the privileges of a puny group, I shall shout for the rights of all mankind.” Pauli Murray“I don’t want you to be safe ideologically. I don’t want you to be safe emotionally. I want you to be strong. That’s different. I’m not going to pave the jungle for you. Put on some boots, and learn how to deal with adversity. I’m not going to take all the weights out of the gym; that’s the whole point of the gym. This is the gym.” Van JonesSpeech is not violence. Treating it as such is an interpretive choice, and it is a choice that increases pain and suffering while preventing other, more effective responses, including the Stoic response (cultivating nonreactivity) and the antifragile response suggested by Van Jones: “Put on some boots, and learn how to deal with adversity.”“From time to time in the years to come, I hope you will be treated unfairly, so that you will come to know the value of justice. I hope that you will suffer betrayal because that will teach you the importance of loyalty. Sorry to say, but I hope you will be lonely from time to time so that you don’t take friends for granted. I wish you bad luck, again, from time to time so that you will be conscious of the role of chance in life and understand that your success is not completely deserved and that the failure of others is not completely deserved either. And when you lose, as you will from time to time, I hope every now and then, your opponent will gloat over your failure. It is a way for you to understand the importance of sportsmanship. I hope you’ll be ignored so you know the importance of listening to others, and I hope you will have just enough pain to learn compassion. Whether I wish these things or not, they’re going to happen. And whether you benefit from them or not will depend upon your ability to see the message in your misfortunes.” John Roberts, the chief justice of the United StatesBe willing to entertain the possibility that people of different genders and people from different cultures may have different preferences. Focus as much on procedural justice as on distributive: Are people in all identity groups treated with equal dignity? The answer to that question might be no in an organization that has achieved statistical equality, and it might be yes in an organization in which some groups are underrepresented."

162,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1171340-nick,1,"3/4 even 4/5 of this book was absolute genius. The three untruths were fantastic and made me look at things completely different. Still, this book left me unsatisfied every time I ended a reading session.It started with little things. They mention universal truths without ever mentioning the Bible. I figure, maybe they just don't want to alienate some of their audience. The three universal untruths are all easily conquered through Biblical truths, but it's never mentioned. Avoiding an obvious reference because it offends you is the first untruth (what doesn't kill us makes us weaker)The ideas got crazier. They mention how to make a lasting change (pre-2013) people still had to act civilly because they would have to get a vote to get their representatives in to make any kind of lasting change. Then they applaud the Supreme Court giving homosexuals the right to marry. This wasn't done through a vote. In fact, the Supreme Court ILLEGALLY overturned multiple states' voter approvals of Gay Marriage Bans. The justices should have all been impeached for that very act. Instead, the president lights up the Whitehouse like a damn fool, celebrating the fact that more people lost rights than gained them that day. To think the courts were heroes is to be reasoning emotionally; the second untruth.Then the thoughts started straying further. An entire chapter becomes dedicated to how the Left shouldn't be held responsible because the Right provokes them. Except, their examples don't make any sense. A university dean claims a deluge of emails caused him to discipline a professor, how horrible that the right would send threats of violence! Except . . . there wasn't a deluge. The authors admit that the emails were all fabricated and this was another example of the Left still attacking the Left . . . The guy from New Jersey going to ""start executing people?"" Well, that was just a hoax, but other people were arrested. To put the blame on someone else is to create an Us V. Them mindset: the final untruth.Then the ideas started to become completely wrong. The first time they mentioned America as a Democracy I thought I just wasn't understanding them. Surely two educated professors would know that the USA is a republic. In fact, the founding fathers hated democracy and made sure we would never become one. Then they have a complete chapter about the Democracy of America. These guys clearly have no idea what they are talking about.It came to me as to why the book just made me mad after I read it. Without the grounding work of Christ and God, they have no ability to argue morality, sanity, or truth. Their own book is peppered with the very type of thinking they are trying to get people to avoid because they have no lasting reason to argue differently.The authors are democrats because they want to end sexual harassment (as opposed to the Republicans who want to see their wives and daughters attacked). The videos of police shooting black men are everywhere on the internet (despite the fact that statistics from everywhere show that white people get shot just as much as black people). The two finally lose all respect when they define being a democrat with these two lines. This isn't rational. This isn't trying to come to the table with an open-mind and fix anything. This is simply creating an Us V. Them mindset and excusing your side of emotional reasoning and avoiding conflict because you think you are right. The entire framework of the book dissolves and there is no more reason to listen or believe any of this.We're not arguing for equality anymore. The only examples of inequality these guys can dredge up are from the 1960's. Pre-1968 even. They spend more time talking about the 1950's race problems then they spend talking about problems today. These problems only exist in the minds of the people using the Three Untruths to find the problems. Statistically speaking gender and racial inequality don't exist. It's not about inequality anymore. It's about government meddling in areas better left to the private sector. The chapter these two guys admit they are democrats then includes a list of everything DEMOCRATIC Presidents did to screw up rights protecting minorities. It includes reasons why overreaching government and bureaucracy messed everything up by getting involved and getting in the way.This isn't about equality. This is about power. The government uses the media to create a State of Fear among the people, divide the people over petty, stupid, things, and then they cash in their huge paychecks and take more power and control.These two authors end up encouraging the very things they are trying to condemn by continuing to beat the same drum.Very frustrating read and only really worth the anecdote at the very beginning.I recommend trying Judicial Tyranny by Mark Sutherland if you want a better look at how the government should be run and what they are really doing wrong."

I started listening to this book, but after hearing Haidt discuss the more foundational idea of Antifragility, I decided to first read Taleb's book, which I think was helpful. Antifragile is a much broader, more original take on a concept that Lukianoff and Haidt then show a few particular, concrete examples of the idea in practice. I think the book is very relevant for those in education, which is partly why I think I found the ideas very useful. Powerful central message, and a bit fluffy in typical self-help fashion. "

The authors talk about the ""3 Great Untruths"" and refer to different frames for viewing the world as well as problems with emotional reasoning and cognitive biases that have ramifications for a free, democratic society. There's a great section on cognitive behavior therapy as a way of thinking about the world to improve resilience and as an anti-fragility method.They value diversity of opinions, open-mindedness and pursuit of the truth -- and self-awareness and self-reflection to reduce the tendencies built into humans toward tribalism and ""us vs them"" binary perspectives. I really enjoyed the case studies of college campus issues -- and the discussion of parenting styles in the last couple of decades.

This book is not an attack on Social Justice Warriors, nor is it a catalogue of the various weaknesses of millennials. ""We have always been ambivalent about the word 'coddling,'"" write Lukianoff and Haidt, "" We didn't like the implication that children today are pampered, spoiled, and lazy, because that is not accurate."" But something has gone amiss in colleges and universities, with a sharp increase in disinvitations of speakers, demands for professors to retract their work or be fired for ideological nonconformity, strict student codes of conduct including long lists of microaggressions, and violence and intimidation of opponents, often enabled by school administration. Lukianoff and Haidt show this as a recent trend starting in 2013, the year that a group of students known as “iGen” entered post-secondary education. Born after 1995, these young people have been raised in a culture of “Safetyism”, in which every social interaction has been mediated by an adult authority. Paradoxically, they have also been connected almost from birth into the most unregulated platform imaginable, the internet. The result is a highly anxious population prone to cognitive distortion when engaging with a world they are unprepared to confront without punitive authority on their side.The culture of Safetyism rests on three basic untruths, “Whatever doesn’t kill you makes you weaker,” “ Always trust your feelings,” and “Life is a battle between good people and evil people.” Haidt and Lukianoff show how these untruths are enabled at the administrative level of colleges, and in turn produce cognitive distortions in students such as catastrophizing and negative filtering that can infect campuses at the group level.Of course, there was a safety culture in many college campuses in the sixties and seventies, at least for women. Dormitories were single gender, with controlled visitation and strictly enforced curfews. Here the concern was safety from physical violence; for iGen, violence now includes speech and opposing ideas. This difference is always made clear throughout the book; at every point Haidt and Lukianoff draw clear distinctions between the genuine threats that exist in students’ lives (from racism, antagonism from the political right, and actual threats of violence) while showing how many of the ideas and words they treat as violence do not meet that standard.This book contains as case studies many injustices that will make the reader angry, such as the professor who was driven off of campus after an email offering to help a student contained a single misinterpreted word. We want Lukianoff and Haidt to tell us that these activists are evil and contemptible (those Basic Untruths are attractive to everyone, after all), but their message is actually one of concern. They never once doubt the sincerity of activists, nor the validity of the causes. Instead, they wish to show us how the culture of Safetyism drives students to see threats in potential allies and works against the process of open inquiry that make academic institutions effective seekers of the truth.I read this after Jonathan Haidt’s “The Righteous Mind,” and I would recommend reading the two books together. Many of the ideas Haidt presents in this book, such as the evolutionary basis for group behaviour, are explored in greater detail. It also presents his Moral Foundations Theory, which explains how people operating in good faith can have such different values and political stances. Just like this volume, it is non-partisan, meticulously researched, and written in an accessible style that engages the reader.The picture painted in this book is bleak, but its message is one of hope. Lukianoff and Haidt end with a discussion of how parents, educators, and institutions can begin making kids more autonomous, more resilient, and better able to resist cognitive distortions in how they perceive their communities. “The Coddling” might have a polarizing title, but after reading it you will be better convinced of the value of open dialogue in creating a kinder world."

It is a very academic read so it can be dry at times but very interesting. This gave me good perspective on how I would like to parent. I would recommend this book to anyone who plans on working with this generation.

As a fan of Jonathan Haidt's work and someone who has been following this Great American Culture War for a long time, it really pains me to do so. I had great expectations. But this book is a mess full of speculation.Allow me to explain.1. The Three Bad IdeasThe allegory of Misoponos, a fictional Greek guru peddling gobbledygook called ""safetyism,"" is amusing but misguided. First, I truly doubt that the problem (and I really do agree with the authors that there is a serious problem) is limited to these three absurd teachings. Second, I'm incredulous toward the claim that this is a Generation Z problem. People rarely are more radical than they are in their early 20s—they are old enough to have understood that their parents don't have all the answers and not old enough to know that they themselves have even fewer. Students have always been radical in a way that reflected the spirit of the times. The hippie movement can't be blamed on smartphones and paranoid parents and yet the same radical elements can be seen in it as in today's youth. I'm afraid that the problem is far more widespread than the authors want to admit, and even if some of the students make a lot of noise, it is the society as a whole that is out of touch with reality. Just read any op-ed from any major news outlet and you'll see what I mean. 2. How Did We Get Here?The Polarization Cycle; Anxiety and Depression; Paranoid Parenting; The Decline of Play; etc—all pure speculation. I do agree with the authors that, for example, paranoid parenting is a major issue. I have lived in a Scandinavian country where it's not an issue. In fact, the parenting style is just the opposite and almost all kids walk to school alone since the age of 7 and are independent in ways that would be an absolute culture shock to most Americans. Yet they are just as glued to their smartphones, laptops, and other devices—and suffer from the very same hurricane of political correctness and polarization that is ravaging the U.S. (though with their local flavor). While I do find overprotective parenting to be a form of child abuse, and do believe that it has a role to play in this, the problem goes deeper than that. Thomas Sowell wrote books about the culture wars for decades and if you read any work of his (whether you agree with his politics or not), you'll see that numerous iterations of these ideological battles have taken place since the 1920s. Paranoid parenting has probably ruined the childhood experience of millions and explains the rise in female anxiety and depression, but the authors should have done their homework and do deeper intercultural and intergenerational analysis to isolate the real causes.3. Wising UpThis is an absolutely ridiculous part of the book and goes so beyond speculation that it can only be called yet another manifesto of parenting. If you are a parent who wants to raise your child this way, please do, and if you don't believe in the ubiquitous harm of screentime then don't make a huge deal out of it. There are tradeoffs to everything. Yes, face-to-face play is important but the debate about the right amount of screen time has been ongoing since the first black-and-white TVs became popular—and only the devices change. Choose a generation that is still alive and you'll find that their parents believed them to be ruined either by violent movies, rock 'n' roll, video games, personal computers, internet porn, social media, or smartphones. And don't even get me started with the idea of ""mandatory civil service."" If people can't coexist peacefully without euphemistically introducing a form of slavery to hold them together, maybe it's better to just let the society to fall apart. "
177,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22965833-j-s-b-morse,5,"Some of the rhetorical techniques in the book (eg the fictional trip to the modern oracle) are unnecessary and a little cheesy as the content itself is gripping and entertaining. I was particularly interested in the review of literature concerning electronic devices and psychiatric disorders, which is in line with what we saw in Paleo Family. All the other angles lined up nicely with that for a comprehensive argument about dangers of mental coddling.I was shocked that the authors didn't address the epidemic of psychiatric disorders in the general population and especially in children with dramatic increases in autism, ADHD, and depression in the population in question. As such, this only provides half of the story with regard to behavior in the Internet Generation. I think a good complement would be Anatomy of an Epidemic by Whitaker."

179,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41417722-michael-williams,4,"The Coddling of the American Mind is an eye-opening explanation of how certain well-intentioned efforts of parents, schools, and societies to protect young people have led to debilitating outcomes for Generation Z. The majority of the book consists of an explanation of how we got to this place where our young adults seem to lack the skills necessary to productively navigate the social and emotional challenges of adulthood. The “what” and the “why” of this problem make up the bulk of the book and are described systematically through a series of related concepts established by a growing body of research, including that of the authors. But the book isn't all exposé. Lukianoff and Haidt close with several chapters of optimism. Specifically, actionable advice on how we (as parents, teachers, school administrators, etc.) can help our kids and young adults obtain the necessary skills and tools to grow (rather than hide) from adversity and disagreement. The authors identify three “Great Untruths” as the key culprits in the weakening of American youth:1. The untruth of fragility: ""What doesn’t kill you makes you weaker."" 2. The untruth of emotional reasoning: ""Always trust your feelings."" 3. The untruth of us vs. them: ""Life is a battle between good people and evil people."" The proliferation of the Great Untruths can be traced to six main causes: 1. Increasing political and group polarization. It’s easier than ever to remain in one’s own group bubble, resulting in an increased likelihood of seeing those with differing views as evil and wrong.2. The rising rates of depression and anxiety among adolescents. This rise is due in significant part to (a) frequent use of smartphones and electronics, (b) intensified “safetyism” culture (i.e., the idea that a kid’s safety is of paramount importance and that the concept of safety applies not to just physical harm, but to the effects of words and ideas that should be avoided), and (c) less unsupervised time, which reduces the child’s ability to achieve important life milestones and autonomy.3. Overprotective, paranoid parenting. Overprotecting children harms them. Children are manifestly “anti-fragile,” meaning that as they deal with setbacks, challenges, and risks with minimal supervision they become stronger, more resilient, and better equipped to overcome greater challenges ahead. Depriving children of those experiences of autonomy hinders their development into strong, competent, independent adults. 4. The decline of unsupervised free play. Free play is required in order for children to “finish the intricate process of neural development” necessary to make them socially and physically competent adults. Free play helps children develop important skills around cooperation and dispute resolution. Insufficient free play is shown to lead to anxiety disorders and unhealthy levels of intolerance toward risks. The decline of free play is caused by several factors, including (a) parents’ unrealistic fear of strangers, (b) rising emphasis on testing and homework, (c) increased competition in university admissions, (d) a societal deemphasis on physical and social skills, and (e) high availability of smartphones that facilitate pseudo-social experiences. 5. The growth of campus bureaucracy and the expansion of its protective (safetyism) mission. A combination of good intentions, federal mandates, concerns over lawsuits, and market pressures (from students paying very high tuition rates) have resulted in a rapid growth in the number and duties of school administrators. They’ve largely taken a “better safe than sorry,” CYA approach that has led to policies that restrict speech, encouraged students to report one another based on emotional discomfort, and insert administrative authorities into student disputes. All of this fosters a culture of safetyism and promotes the Untruth of Fragility and the Untruth of Emotional Reasoning. 6. A misapplied commitment to social justice. People’s intuitive notions of justice include two major types: distributive justice and procedural justice. Distributive justice is about achieving a ratio of outcomes to inputs that is equal for all participants. Procedural justice is about how decisions are being made and how people are treated during the process of administering justice. When social justice efforts are consistent with both distributive and procedural justice, we call it proportional-procedural social justice. Proportional-procedural social justice aims to (a) remove barriers to equality of opportunity and (b) ensure that everyone is treated with dignity. Alternatively, when social justice efforts aim instead to achieve equality of outcomes by group at the expense of distributive or procedural fairness, these equal-outcomes social justice efforts violate most people’s sense of intuitive justice. Unfortunately, ideas, policies, and efforts around equal-outcomes social justice are increasingly common, especially on college campuses. The authors suggest several remedies for combating the Great Untruths: Remedies for kids and teens at home and at school.1. Prepare the child for the road, not the road for the child. Give children meaningful opportunities to be independent, demonstrate new capabilities, take risks, be alone, and to experience how to disagree and debate productively. 2. Teach children the cognitive and social skills necessary to temper emotional reasoning. This includes teaching kids the basics of applying cognitive behavioral therapy/techniques in moments of stress or unhealthy thoughts and teaching them to practice mindfulness. 3. Help kids and young adults develop a common-humanity way of thinking. Teach kids to give others the benefit of the doubt and to practice the virtue of intellectual humility. Seek out schools that teach common-humanity politics over common-enemy identity politics. 4. Help schools avoid the Great Untruths. Parents can seek schools that, and encourage schools to, (a) assign minimal homework, (b) provide more recess with less supervision, (c) discourage the use of the word “safe” outside the context of physical safety, (d) have a no-devices policy, (e) protecting or expanding recess, (f) cultivate intellectual virtues (i.e., the “qualities necessary to be a critical thinker and an effective learner”), (g) teach debate and offer debate club (to learn the skills of civil disagreement), (h) assign reading and coursework that promote reasoned discussion (e.g., a media literacy class).5. Limit device time. Research indicates that heavy amounts of screen time are associated with bad social and mental health outcomes. This is a complicated issue and there are several factors that improve by limiting device time (more sleep, less FOMO, more time performing tasks that build lasting confidence and mood, etc.). 6. Support the norm of service before college. The authors suggest that, “High school graduates can spend a year working and learning away from their parents, exploring their interests, developing interpersonal skills, and generally maturing before arriving on campus. The year after high school is also an ideal time for teens to perform national service as a civic rite of passage.” Remedies at Universities.1. Help students entwine their identity with freedom of inquiry. Colleges should review and ensure their policies are consistent with the First Amendment. College presidents and top administrators should establish a practice of not responding to public outrage and not permitting the “heckler’s veto” to silence minority viewpoints. 2. Pick the best people for the mission. Colleges should admit more older students that have shown an ability to live independently. Colleges should admit more students from schools that have a track record of effectively teaching critical thinking skills and other “intellectual virtues.” Colleges should include value statements about the value of “viewpoint diversity” in their diversity statements. 3. Orient and educate for productive disagreement. Colleges must explicitly reject the untruths of fragility, emotional reasoning, and us versus them.4. Draw a larger circle around the community. As colleges emphasize common goals, shared fate, and common humanity, its students will better see one another as fellow human beings, treat one another better, and better appreciate one another’s contributions to the community. As Pauli Murray wrote, “When my brothers try to draw a circle to exclude me, I shall draw a larger circle to include them.” Remedies Across Society.1. Recognize that social media is a big part of the problem and that we must be thoughtful in adapting how we live with it in our society, just like we do for things like cigarets and junk food. 2. Spread the norm of allowing kids to engage in unsupervised play. 3. Rethink identity politics in a way that emphasizes synergies and teamwork across disparate groups rather than reinforcing tribalism.* * *You probably won't find The Coddling of the American Mind in the ""Parenting"" or ""Education"" sections of libraries or bookstores. But it belongs on every parent's, teacher's, and school administrator's reading lists nonetheless. This will definitely remain a go-to resource for my wife and me as we navigate the daily challenges of parenting."

Addressing an issue that tends to be a far-right talking point I had some concerns about how the authors would be able to thread that needle, but writing from a left-leaning perspective, balancing their comments, and focusing heavily on the impacts on children cleans and clarifies this issue well. The authors are at pains to explain all sides of the story (e.g. devoting an entire chapter to the right-generated provocations of campus protests and threats of this sort), while discussing at length the good intentions driving the very dynamics they are criticizing.This shifts what could have seemed like a polemical work into a thoughtful and thorough examination of the data, a debunking of points on both sides that lack data, an exploration of those points that are supported by the data, and a loud and concerted warning cry for the health and welfare of our children. In particular the depression, self-injury and suicide rates of children born in or after 1995 were shocking, and were for me among the most effective aspects the work. For any who decry this issue as irrelevant or overshadowed by other issues, this point alone sold me on the trend being one we can't afford not to focus on and address. And while the authors are at pains to clearly delimit which parts of the cultural and social strata are affected, the overall takeaway is that the trend is concerning regardless of degree.I did have somewhat mixed feelings about the efficacy of the solutions suggested; some of them are good but some seemed a bit wishy-washy. That said, I don't have better myself, and I do think that a high degree of the path forward rested on a clear, thoughtful, and careful diagnosis of the problem, and the authors accomplished that here so it alone may be the best cure.Finally, the topic being so timely was also its one downside; this is a book focused very narrowly on a current and (hopefully) temporary issue in a handful of countries in the hopes of helping us recognize how we're harming our children and turning this around. This makes it incredibly important now but I doubt it will age that well. The child-rearing advice in particular is useful in a way that will last, but a more complete and thoughtful discussion of such is already contained in the fantastic book The Vanishing American Adult: Our Coming-of-Age Crisis—and How to Rebuild a Culture of Self-Reliance, where it is also balanced with a far more interesting historical perspective and broader discussions of parenting across all life. I'd bet that in a few years that will be the clearly better read over this one. That's the basis for the missing fifth star."

The authors touch on several of the flashpoints of this decade, from the rise of tribal thinking, screen usage, safe spaces, college fragility, to overprotective parenting, and they tie them together to explain how these are setting iGen (the generation following millennials) up for failure. Rather than making a moral argument as many do, what makes this book interesting is the argument from psychology. There are a dozen or so cognitive distortions they introduce which really help to understand and analyze society. For example, 'emotional reasoning' is letting your feelings guide your interpretation of reality (""I feel depressed; therefore, my marriage is not working out."") 'Catastrophizing' is focusing on the worst possible outcome and seeing it as most likely, 'negative filtering' is focusing almost exclusively on the negatives and seldom notice the positives. They consistently tie how these different behaviors and more can induce depression and social panic, and they seek to apply cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) methods to diagnose and cure the pains of both political correctness and depression. These methods were made more poignant when one of the authors, Greg Lukianoff, discussed when he was suicidal and how these CBT methods saved him. These cognitive distortions, they convincingly argue, are weakening an entire generation. They are the ingredients causing the moral and psychological panics nationwide.Format-wise, I thought it odd that the first chapters told a fictional Greek fable in order to introduce their “Three Great Untruths” about modern society, but after that, the rest of the book was excellent and devoid of similar gimmicks. I really appreciate how the authors summarized each section in bullet points at the end of each chapter—someone could read all those bullet points and understand their entire argument. All the filler information for the chapters was interesting and useful too though, and I learned a fair bit more about some of the college protests, the philosophy of free-range parenting, and more.For those who consider themselves progressive or politically correct, please read this book. It will not offend you, it's written in a positive and uncontroversial language by two well-known liberals. If you consider yourself open-minded and willing to admit that there may be a psychological issue with safe spaces and social protectionism generally, it may surprise you to find how deep those problems go. For those who are classically liberal or conservative, you will be nodding your head in agreement for much of the book. Either way, the acuity of the psychological analysis is sharp and worthwhile for everyone. Highly recommend.View my best reviews and a collection of mental models at jasperburns.blog."

This is definitely the most important book today for college students, soon-to-be college students and new parents.Greg and Jon do such an INCREDIBLE job writing out a potentially controversial argument that even the folks they are directly countering might find it hard to argue against. This book is about how the radical left is creating a dangerous culture of building fragile humans and societal structures, driven less by fact, more by feelings. There is also a ton about the alt-right abusing this and creating their own sort of hell.Basically, this book is about good intentions gone bad. About the polarization of our already polarized minds. And more importantly, the susceptibility of ""untruths"" that are contaminating the developing minds of our youth, especially in the developed countries. The authors systematically and eloquently unveil and dethrone the 3 great untruths of today's age - (1) What doesn't kill you makes you weaker, (2) Always trust your feelings and (3) it's always us versus them, ""good"" versus ""evil"". And their focus is primarily on today's campuses, especially on ""Gen-Z"" - not quite millennials but folks born around 1994-1995. I don't remember being so engaged and enthralled reading a book about psychology before. Throughout the book, I was somewhere between being disgusted and screaming ""preach"" in my head. I'd like to think I am not infected by this disease, but I am genuinely shocked by it. I have not been able to really communicate why or how this makes sense, partly because I am scared the radical left will pounce and partly because I don't have the psychological knowledge or the wherewithal to do so. But, Greg and Jon do, and they do so splendidly, with fact-based logical arguments that you have to be sufficiently delusional to not agree with at least a majority of what they are saying. For me personally, there two key takeaways from this book. One was CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) and the other was the resounding importance of everyone reading this book, especially students and new parents. With CBT, I think I have found a tool that can ground my irrational self-destructiveness with rational thoughts. And for the other takeaway, I have already bought a couple of copies for some cousins who are about to embark into college and am trying to get some folks from my family that are new-parents to read this book.It's a weird one this - recommending this book profusely to someone can be taken the wrong way.

Rarely have I read something that was so generous to both conservatives and progressives. My son has just left for college, and he is listening to it and enjoying it as well. "
186,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5999538-aaron-west,4,"After having this recommended to me by someone I deeply trust, I thought I'd give it a shot. Imagine my surprise when I see that it was coauthored by none other than The Righteous Mind's Jonathan Haidt. I generally trust Haidt's approach and analyses as honest and well-intentioned, so my initial misgivings of whether this was a Ben Shapiro-esque 'complain-about-the-snowflake-liberals' book (given its title) were abated.With Lukianoff and Haidt's tell-tale graphs, well-researched statistical data, bullet-pointed lists and designations, anecdote-tinged analyses, and a slightly unbalanced scrutiny applied to the liberal/conservative line, the book didn't disappoint. Both writers strike me as good—they want to bring about good in this nation, which seems more divided than ever. In my review of Righteous Mind, I had wondered what Haidt made of the 2016 Election. Now it is clear, and he is trying to bring about common ground where it's more necessary than ever.Both men do a thorough job describing the phenomenon seen growing across the nation—especially on college campuses and online: the swift reaction against and degradation of honest dialogue and academic debate, unhindered by scary ideas and concepts that ~should~ be sorted through rationally by what I've colloquially called ""Woke Culture,"" what Haidt and Lukianoff call ""Call-Out Culture,"" or what is more widely accepted as ""Cancel Culture"" in a way. The fear of judgment and mob-mentality retribution has done damage to honest dialogue in public spheres where genuinely good intentions are concerned. There must be room for grace and redemption in these conversations about how to better society. However, their ideas within this framework aren't without their own fundamental misunderstandings. It's true, as a teacher, I've seen the spread of concept-creep and safetyism, especially among Generation Z, or ""iGen,"" those born in and after 1995. But this rise of safetyism (outside the statistics on rising and falling crime rates) has some authentic origins. For example, while I was teaching the Holocaust, a Jewish student approached me and asked that she be exempt from reading portions of Elie Wiesel's Night. I could have told her no and lamented the inability of this young generation to handle the weight of the world's real issues. But I had the wherewithal and understanding to know that she was well aware of her people's history of persecution—that denying her the ability to read supplemental material was in no way helping her learn from the horrors of the Holocaust. She didn't, as an eighth grader, need to read the two most gruesome scenes in the book to know that gruesome events occurred, which we'd discussed regularly in class.My main qualms with this book are as follows (in true bullet-pointed, Haidt form):- Haidt and Lukianoff seem to grant a moral equivalency between ""sides"" on different issues: almost in a pained, over-compensating way, where it isn't necessary. Things can't always be boiled down so easily.- Following that, the most extreme examples seem to have been cited in the book. While Lukianoff and Haidt admit this, they tend to weight the scales, so to speak, in order to drive home the importance of their message, which doesn't need shock-inducing backing to establish its foundation.- The two lament speech codes (anti-racist and use of proper gender-pronouns) on campuses, seemingly ignoring the true physical (mental) impact that negative speech has on the recipients and their stress levels over time. Some stress cortisol is fine, and inevitable, but it deteriorates mental health when it is sustained.- People who don't experience the same discrimination/bigotry as others tend to write off these people's pain as ""fragility."" The subjective nature of personal trauma is also the subjective nature of the ones who deem that it is NOT, in fact, trauma. What does one do with that? Throwing the word fragility around like confetti doesn't somehow solidify one's stance.- The authors take specific issue with the term Microaggressions, as aggression insinuates intentional, directed harm. I raise the question: Can't microaggressions be subconscious? Aggression can, at times, not be a conscious decision. So why not admit they are an issue founded in actual aggression, at least at times? While they may be unintentional, they still have a real impact.*** - The disinvitation of provocative speakers is passed off by Haidt and Lukianoff as cognitively-lazy, safe, sensitive students, but this assumption is extremely tone-deaf and narrow in my estimation. They never stop to consider that students HAVE heard/read these speakers before, and have thus formed their desire to keep things like hate speech away from a platform. Words have real implications and can cause real harm. The authors bemoan that students see discomfort from what they hear as literal harm, whereas I think they fundamentally misunderstand what students feel. It is no secret that hate speech and ideas CAN be dangerous, or lead to physical harm: as one who teaches the Holocaust, this is central to our exploration of how hateful ideas spread. Look at the rise in hate crimes since Trump took office. To say that Trump is literally responsible isn't necessarily true as stated, but I believe there's a definite correlation between hateful rhetoric, and a permissive attitude to speak things that weren't openly acceptable to be spoken before—for good reason—and the violence that has ensued. Can we truly sum up the avoidance of platforming/showcasing/disseminating dangerous (yes, potentially harmful, violence-inducing) words as whiny millenials/members of Gen Z intent on becoming offended? Again, words carry clout and cause real actions.- The ""Principle of Charity"" —the idea that we should give the benefit of the doubt to those who do or say offensive things—may be good in principle. But intentions aren't always so crystal clear. How much should this be applied? How much in history could marginalized groups have been told to effectively be quiet because they're not ""showing charity""?- Intersectionality: privilege. The authors suggest that some have taken the discussion around privilege to label others' morality. But this does not mean ""evil and good."" Privilege needs to be discussed and termed as simply advantages. Perhaps this has been taken too far by some, but it should not demean the integrity of the conversation, and the very real advantages (privileges) that affect groups differently.Overall, though, the book is important, well-written, and it begins a conversation that is so often shut down by internet trolls, Russian bots, or a mob of self-appointed woke watchdogs. The ""Three Great Untruths"" developed by Lukianoff and Haidt have real implications for the future we are creating: 1) What Doesn't Kill You Makes You Weaker; 2) Always Trust Your Feelings; 3) Life Is a Battle between Good People and Evil People.When we dismantle these untruths, raise a resilient group of critical thinkers, and open honest academic dialogue instead of run in the opposite direction for fear of critical backlash, we will have a more secure, sound, and hopefully just, society."
187,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3388338-lisa,2,"The authors began with a plausible trio of premises but went on to use anecdotal evidence to support their points, cherry pick evidence to support their premises, and to use their opinions to over generalize beyond the facts. I strongly disagree with majority of their examples as they are rare occurrences. The authors neglected to state that the provocateurs on university campuses were external to the community. These individuals intend to evoke fear and anger and do not have the right to spew hatred. Free speech does not include lies and racially motivated rhetoric intended to invoke violence. If anything can be learned from nazis and klansmen it is that societies must not tolerate all speech in the name of free speech. If life has gotten more equitable for people other than wealthy white men it is, in part, because derogatory language is no longer as acceptable as it has been in the past. The trolling online and on campuses described in the witch-hunt chapter is rare and the authors ignored the fact that these disagreements have always been present. The authors did not mention the immediacy of social media that has escalated these differences. The chapter on mental health takes a reductive view of the issue as though screen time is the only factor in increasing rates of mental health diagnoses in college students. The chapters on higher education neglected the role state politics plays in university policies and the fact that the contingent faculty at the heart of each dispute are a new, inexpensive method of staffing university classrooms with people external to and less embedded in the institution’s community. The last part, offering suggestions to improve for raising children and improving universities is absurd. Maybe wealthy white people can take their privilege and take gap years but it won’t work for everyone. I’m also a fan of cognitive behavioral therapy but I don’t understand the prominence of this clinical tool in this book. How can it intervene when people are targets of death threats? The book is basically a 270-page opinion piece and in my opinion about two thirds of all they say is inaccurate or incomplete. "
188,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73029907-cav,4,"This was a decent read. My second from Jonathon Haidt, after his 2011 book  The Righteous Mind.While it wasn't a bad book, per se, I didn't enjoy it as much as ""The Righteous Mind"".The authors talk about the current PC run-wild climate of modern academia, but take virtually every opportunity to also talk about how bad the shadowy ""alt-right"" is, too.I think Haidt has somewhat red-pilled himself in the last ~10 years or so. But I get the feeling he's muzzling himself to a degree here, as he is still a prof at NYU, and probably worried about the witch hunts he talks about in these pages coming for him...The book centers on 3 ideas. As they put it:""This is a book about three Great Untruths that seem to have spread widely in recent years:1. The Untruth of Fragility: What doesn’t kill you makes you weaker.2. The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: Always trust your feelings.3. The Untruth of Us Versus Them: Life is a battle between good peopleand evil people."" This book also surprisingly contained a good bit of talk about cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Co-author Greg Lukianoff has battled depression for years. They talk about how CBT is a gold standard of therapy. How to recognize ""catastrophizing"", ""dichotomous thinking"" and ""labelling""; among other patterns of negativity. They even included an intense account of a near-suicidal episode he had.  The authors also devote a large part of the book to the concept of ""safetyism"", including the helicopter parenting that they theorize has helped cause a generation of fragile children who equate language they don't like with violence. I do like the way Haidt writes; he summarizes the important parts of a chapter at the end of each. Effective communication. Overall, I did enjoy this book, despite rolling my eyes a few times.3.5 stars."
189,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10311964-jessie,4,"Discusses what has led to America’s new culture of “safetyism” (the idea that students are vulnerable and need to be protected from differing points of view). I particularly enjoyed the discussion of widespread cognitive distortions that people learn to recognize in CBT (e.g. emotional reasoning, dichotomous thinking, mind reading, negative filtering), and how these are used on college campuses and in the political sphere. Also a fascinating explanation of tribalism (especially the study that showed that people feel more empathy for those who belong to the same group as them—even if the group assignment is completely arbitrary). Describes the political shift toward negative partisanship. Best chapter was the one on the decline of play (the comparison between first grade readiness checklist from 1979 vs the one from 2000 blew my mind)“Wiser kids” was a helpful chapter too. Love the suggestions to learn about the free-range movement, print the “Let Grow License,” to encourage your kids to engage in more productive disagreement, and to teach kids the basics of CBT and mindfulness.Another fun thing: The book says that 18 year olds of the igen generation (right after millennials, starting around 1995) are “younger” (have less cumulative experience from their lifetime) than other generations—including millennials, and the book says the shift was abrupt beginning around 1995 (so entering college around 2013). One of the recommendations the book makes is that it become more widespread for 18 year olds entering college to take a “gap year” to volunteer or work. The book suggests that this will help give incoming students the experience they need to not participate in the “coddling” going on on college campuses. ANYWAYS. All this to say—isn’t it cool that in 2012 the Church lowered the age for missionary service to 18 or 19 years old, effectively encouraging more than half of the Church’s youth (beginning with igen) to take a gap year before entering college?"

It seems an idea worthy of debate.” And proceed to decry safe spaces.The theory of this book is decrying the coddled mind, when many examples are the imperfect push and pull of marginalized groups getting a toehold on respect, resources, etc.Here are things they attempt to undermine in the book:- rape culture- safe spaces- therapy- microaggressions- the canceling of milo ySure some things like the word “trauma” become trendy (although the DSM definition of PTSD hasn’t changed) but this just the authors using cherry picked examples and misquotes to support their own self-narrative.

The premise of this book is the “call out culture” on many college campuses actually impedes free speech and the pursuit of truth, which the authors believe is the purpose of college. They make some really good points about the cognitive distortions that people with this mindset have really bought into as a worldview, and offer helpful suggestions as to why we should reject these “great untruths.” My favorite untruth that they unpacked was #3: there are bad people out there who do all the bad, and the only answer is to fight against them. Strongly recommend, especially to help sift through the why behind our increasingly divided culture. "

Wish we would have had this book as younger parents--but to be honest I'm not sure we would have had the grit of our own to argue with what were mainstream ideas at the time. My favorite parts: Sending a strong message and teaching kids/young adults that they are NOT fragile. They are ANTI-FRAGILE. They are strong and resilient and can (and should) deal with adversity in their lives. ""A university devoted to the pursuit of truth prepares students for conflict, controversy and argument.

The real target of this book seems to be affluent parents of Gen Y/Z children, and the argument is framed as a curious sort of self-help manual (checklists and bullet points etc.).

In ""The Coddling of the American Mind"", the authors take a devastating look at the dumbing-down of debate on US campuses and look further at how it not only debases the students' educations but also feeds mental illness.

207,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5712415-sandra-ross,5,"While Haidt makes his case in a very narrow sense that focuses on the current higher education environment, the reality is this is the current pervasive American (regardless of age) mindset. We've, collectively, just turned off our brains from any kind of critical thinking and just absorb the opiate of the masses around us until it becomes the tainted glass through which we see and respond to everything.We're dumbed down and weakened by not be aware enough and courageous enough to stand alone and think for ourselves using common sense, logic, and reason within a moral and ethical framework that is unchangeable. Haidt nails the three great untruths that have become the pervasive American mindset: ""What doesn’t kill you makes you weaker""; ""always trust your feelings""; and ""life is a battle between good people and evil people.""This is the mindset behind the polarized environment that has gripped every part of American society, from education to politics to sports to religion. It is appalling that we've allowed ourselves to be enslaved to this insanity.""What doesn't kill you makes you weaker"" is behind the ""nobody can fail/everybody's a winner"" mindset that we see everywhere. The reality is that what doesn't kill you does make you stronger. Life is a fight from the day we're born until the day we die. We lose a lot of battles in the war - failures - but we learn from the failures and we grow from them. Without failure and loss, there can be no change, no maturity, no growth. That's why it's baked into the cake of our lives.""Always trust your feelings"" is scary. Feelings (emotions) are not always sane. We have a lot of neurological activity going on between our ears that has been, is, and is going to be shaped by imperfect nurturing (nobody's fault, because we're all imperfect), imperfect natures (you and me), and imperfect environments. That means just because we feel a certain way doesn't mean that's how things really are. We tend to overreact to our feelings and not realize that they are spark plugs that are short-lived because logic and reason and discernment should kick in to give us context as the engine of our lives. When we start trusting how we feel (which is subjective and many times not true in how we're perceiving things), instead of objectively looking situations using common sense, we are doomed to being caught up in cycles of despair, hate, aggression, anger, and fear. Whatever stance we take on anything, we will, because our feelings are driving our lives, hammer it to death and drive it into the ground, refusing to see anyone else's point of view, refusing to believe we could be (and likely are) wrong about some things, and refusing to even think about anything outside our own little ideas of what we ""feel"" is the ""truth."" Very dangerous territory for anyone to be in.""Life is a battle between good people and evil people"" is balderdash. Where is love your neighbor in that kind of thinking? Absent. Totally absent. Life is actually a battle between good and evil. People who are essentially trying to lead good lives do some pretty evil things sometimes. I have. You have. Look at King David in the Bible. He's called a man after God's own heart. Yet, he took the wife of one of his 30 top soldiers and tried to hide her pregnancy by getting the man (Uriah the Hittite) drunk so he'd sleep with his wife. When that didn't work, David sent Uriah back to battle carrying the letter ordering Joab (the commander of David's army) to put him at the front lines to make sure he was killed.We all do evil things. It's how we respond when we realize we've done something evil that determines our character (good or evil). Read Psalm 51 for David's response. That, if it's ours, is our character.Conversely, there are people who live lives that are debauched and deplorable and they do good things (sometimes on a scale much grander than any of the good things you and I may do from time to time).Every person has potential and every person has some of the same blood and DNA that you and I have running through their veins. I may not want to spend time around someone who is doing a lot of evil things, but I'm not warring against the person. Instead, I'm warring against my own nature that can think evil, speak evil, and do evil. If we all focused on that, we'd understand that the wars we fight are inside ourselves, and we need to be the change - and make those changes, which is a battle within itself - we want to see. There'd be a lot less of villainizing, indemnifying, and cursing other people, however different from us they are, and there would be a lot more forgiveness, mercy, and compassion (what we want and need as well).Good book and good food for thought."
208,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6410286-brittany,2,"I was pretty disappointed with this book, especially given I had previously rated The Righteous Mind five stars (a relatively rare rating for me). The book was quite interesting when it talked about things other than politics, but when it did, it read like a list of fallacies. Consider that the book opens with the proverb ""prepare the child for the road, not the road for the child"". The charitable interpretation of this statement is that there are some things that can't/are extremely difficult to change and so you must prepare children to deal with them in a responsible manner, even if one doesn't condone how things are currently done. The uncharitable interpretation of this statement is seeing it as a call to reinforce the status quo. That is, don't change the road. It is fine how it is, even if it is a sexist, racist road which would probably be better to be demolished and rebuilt. Instead, change the child to fit the road, and learn to deal with its sexist and racist ways and don't expect there to be any construction to fix the worsening potholes. Now imagine the entire section on politics talks about the ""SJW left"" in the most uncharitable way possible - your response to the uncharitable interpretation I provided regarding the child and the road likely mimics my own response to those sections of the book. As in, no, there are other interpretations possible, some of which are much more likely and much more nuanced than presented.The book uses singular examples of their suggestions working to demonstrate why they are generally true. Yet, the book cautions against using singular examples of the opposite to demonstrate the flaws in their suggestions (if you do, you're ""negatively generalizing"". When they do, it's...different, surely). They talk about appealing to the humanity of others to achieve social justice and provided an example of an Episcopal priest and his wife changing their views on gay marriage once their son came out as gay. The flaw in this argument seems quite obvious to me - that is, the appeal to the humanity of others was lost on these two people until they were intimately affected. It's a necessary, but insufficient step.The authors are quite concerned with the idea that intent matters, to the near exclusion of impact. So, you know, if your boss or professor sexually harasses you, but didn't intend on doing so, well, it's not that bad. They provide an example of intending to murder someone vs. accidentally committing manslaughter and spend minimal time exploring the differences between the two. They fail to realize that the impact is the same, and the harm and distress is still experienced regardless of intent, and yet this doesn't matter to them.They state, ""But students in politically homogeneous departments will mostly be exposed to books and research studies drawn from the left half of the range, so they are likely to come down to the 'left' of the truth, on average...Sometimes the left-leaning view turns out to be correct, sometimes it's the right-leaning view, but on average, students will get closer to the truth if they are exposed to debates among credentialed scholars who approach difficult problems from differing perspectives."" This is some /r/enlightenedcentrism bullshit mixed in with an argument to moderation and it is presented without evidence. This position assumes that the left is right ~50% of the time and the right the other ~50%, for which there is no reason to believe that this is actually the case. Something something reality has a liberal bias something something. The authors talk about the issues associated with subjective standards, such as when they discuss speech codes and how they ""use an overboard and entirely subjective standard for determining wrongdoing"" and then a page later, talk about how ""of course, there should be easy way to report cases of true harassment and employment discrimination"", as if their own subjective standard of ""true harassment and employment discrimination"" is somehow objective and shared by others, and not the entire issue under discussion. Even more amusing when they later quote Alexsander Solzhenitsyn: ""If only it were so simple! If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them.""""Until [the moment of realizing you are wrong], the feeling of being wrong is indistinguishable from the feeling of being right. We are all wrong about many things at every moment, but until we know it, we are often quite certain that we are right.""""Mass movements can rise and spread without belief in a god, but never without belief in a devil."" - Eric Hoffer ""The only point of having more is having more than everybody else.Nobody needed 20,000 atomic warheads until the other side had 19,000.

Why?3 Great Untruths in ‘safetyism’1. What doesn’t kill you makes you weaker2. Always trust your feelings3. Life is a battle between Good and Evil. And if you disagree with us, you are Evil. A Witch-hunt:1. Arise all of a sudden 2. Perceived to harm the ‘common good’3. Actual crime is often trivial4. People who secretly are supportive of the victims turn a blind eyeDevelopment:1. It used to be that Trauma means actual physical injury. PTSD used to define psychological trauma as extraordinary stress such as war. However it has been extended to mean any hurt feelings, which is defined as ‘violence’.2. Intent used to matter; an accidental knock is different from a premeditated punch. However intent does not matter now. 3. Since undergrads are assumed to be fragile and must be protected from all harm at all costs, if the feeling of anyone’s feeling is hurt, the speaker is assumed to be at fault. This is ‘microaggression’, first coined by Pierce to include intent but later expanded by Sue to include any hurt feelings. 4. The Left-leaning Professors who have become the majority in American colleges, in trying to push for the enlightened ideal, try to enforce perfect egalitarianism where no one’s feelings is hurt. However this over-political correctness drives college students and staff to become more and more detached from the others, especially the far right. So left-leaning students start to think it is ok to use violence to stop alleged right wing speakers from speaking, and witch-hunts ensued. This is not helped by the really racist alt-right sympathisers and neo-Nazis who doom counter-protested, doxxing the student organisers and giving them death threats. 5. I-Gen girls suffer more anxiety and depression, from being excluded by peers, especially in social media. The media reports of street violence and the rare abduction causes parents to be overprotective of their children. A mother was charged when she left e her daughter alone in the car - but the child is 11! Also the kids are over scheduled to prep them for elite college, so they have no time for free play. As a result when those kids grow up they are fragile and gets anxious very easily. 6. Colleges have more administrators now, and need to get the best students to charge them outrageous fees so they are corporatised. Thus they need to protect themselves against lawsuits and bad press of all kinds. Thus a student sharing about her sexual assault to her counselor was later served a cease and desist letter not to ‘distress other students with her sharing’. Professors are fired for discussing sensitive topics which caused emotional distress in a student. This does not prepare students for the real world. 7. Parents may need to step in to hold athletic boys back from joining contact sports as those cause lots of injuries. The conventional wisdom that boys need to be toughened up is wrong. Boys need to be in touch with their feelings for exercising bravery, skill development and endurance training. Solutions:1. Let children play on their own as circumstances permit. Let them use hammers and nails. 2. Let them walk home or cycle themselves home as soon as it is safe. 3. Allow children to talk to strangers, though never to follow them. Petition state laws to allow such open minded children care. 4. Teach children that to be annoyed or irritated is not ‘violence’. Avoid catastrophising small set-backs. 5. Petition colleges to have an open environment for discussion. 6. Limit social media use. 7. Teach cognitive behavioural therapy techniques, to reflect on their feelings and not to trust them too much. 8. Teach that the line between good and evil is within each of us, there are no ‘good’ vs ‘bad’ guys. "

There is a strong polarization, people are unwilling to accept an opinion that slightly differs from theirs and it gets harder not to offend somebody even with a harmless remark. It is especially noticeable in universities. This book concentrates on America but as it says same problems now happen in Canada as well.What makes it sad is how much we praise diversity these days and yet act against it. Diversity of race, gender, sexuality etc is a great thing. But the diversity that truly makes us strong is the diversity of opinions and ideas, the ability to look at things from different perspective, be able to debate them and with this choose the best direction. University should be a place where such diversity is praised and have student come out of it with a well developed view on the world. Hopefully this will change soon. I may be catostrophizing what is happening now because I am not very optimistic.This book is a great analysis of this problem. It is written in a pretty unbiased way showing how both sides of the political spectrum provoke each other and make the situation worse. It breaks down what exactly is the problem (the three untruths) and also gives an explanation on why this is happening. We learn how it gets harder in universities to avoid confirmation bias and what is different about the new generation which may cause this culture of safety and victimhood. Interesting how the generation who remembers the moments they played without parental supervision as best moments in their childhood also shelter their kids the way they do. OF course sheltering isn't the only thing that caused this, it is way more complex and the book is really good at explaining it. I was a bit less interested in the last part because I have no children so it isn't for me to raise them differently but it is definitely useful for parents.I have read Haidt's other book, the Righteous mind, and it was just as great. I would recommend people to read it as well. It shows a similar us vs them problem but looking at broader demographics.The only thing that bothered me, which is pretty minor and not important for this book but that I still want to mention, is bringing up Trump's ""very fine people"" comment. Look, I am not some huge fan of Trump even though it may seem sometimes these days. I was laughing at the idea of him being elected when following American election in 2016 because I couldn't imagine that he is in any way a good candidate. although it was for different reason than people who are against him now, I never saw him as a modern Hitler. But nowadays I end up defending him all the time because what he says is being twisted to make the situation look even worse and dangerous (as she says ""fake news""). The ""very fine people"" is the issue that bothers me the most because it is so easy to check, so I am a bit disappointed that people who wrote this great book didn't do it. He never called white supremacists ""very fine people"", in literally the next sentence he says that he doesn't mean them. He was referring to people who came to protest taking down the Robert E Lee statue. This was the intention of the event before it was taken over by white supremacists. People may say that them being against it makes them racist too but this would be incorrect. Even in countries that were part of USSR many people were against taking down the Lenin statues because they saw him as an important part of their history, and they weren't communists. In this interview Trump says that these people should not be seen the same as the racist who marched there. And he is right.But besides this minor problem I think it was an excellent book that did a great job covering this issue of our time."

Part one covers three ""great untruths"" believed by Gen Z, which are commonly held but counter to established research on healthy psychology. These three are:* What doesn't kill you makes you weaker (challenges cause trauma and weakness instead of strength through overcoming)* Always trust your feelings* People are either good or bad (us vs. them mentality)Part two covers some of the more egregious examples of these untruths in action on college campuses where free speech is being suppressed and people are being witch-hunted. Part three covers six societal trends that the authors argue contributed to the adoption of the untruths by Gen Z (including trends in parenting, social media, changes in university bureaucracies, polarization of politics, etc.), and Part four contains recommendations for parents, schools, and universities.The book's strength is in how the authors make their arguments intuitive, while at the same time providing tons of evidence and references. Like Jonathan Haidt's previous book Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion, the writing is accessible while not watering down the research. It's pretty clear that believing the three great untruths (which are all universal black/white type statements) leads to a distorted view of the world, and mature people have a more nuanced view. So if nothing else, it's a good reminder to avoid that type of thinking. The book touches on a lot of current happenings like campus protests, identity politics, mental health etc. which made our book club discussions lively.A weakness of the book might be that it is a little unfocused. The explanations of the three untruths is clear enough, and they have many psychological and behavioral and societal effects beyond just the effect on the intellectual climate of universities, but the book in part 2 mostly focuses on universities and the issue of free speech. I also thought that the way this part was structured, presenting all the bad stuff that is happening one after the other, made it really unpleasant to read without really providing any analysis. In addition, some of the chapters didn't trace the lines back to the great untruths as much as I thought they would. Perhaps this is because there are multiple authors, and one of them (Greg Lukianoff) works for an organization that promotes free speech on campus. But also, sociology is hard and pinning all of our societal condition on three ideas would be reductive anyway.The biggest value of the book for me was that it put names on some of the trends that many people see but don't know how to describe, and that it tries to tie together so much of what is happening in our nation nowadays and show how they all fit together in some way. I don't think I'm taking away any ""knock-out punch"" ideas from this book as if they are the keys to describing all of what's going on, but that's probably an unreasonable thing to expect anyway. Overall, this book was very thought provoking and has lots of ideas that I think should be discussed more."
212,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1762694-kari,5,"Wow, this book is so timely and highlights such important points to consider. It has basically assured me that I'm not crazy, and I'm not the only one that has these observations and concerns about the way we interact with each other. The basis for the authors' research and commentary is behaviors they have noticed swiftly increasing on college campuses, where vocal, sometimes violent, activists have actually weakened free speech and curtailed critical thinking. What's tricky about it is that, generally speaking, these arguments are well-intentioned. Yes, let's call out racists, sexists, homophobes, misogynists, etc - people who perpetuate the continued injustices or inequities facing particular subgroups of people. Let's label them, openly and vocally, so all shall know their true colors.But are those judgments always accurate?The authors here chronicle what has led to this call-out culture of narrow-minded thinking that's quick to label individuals or entire populations and that values impact over intent (the point I found most stunning). It's no simple cause and effect, but they have done a fantastic job of trying to track the many threads that have led to where we, as a nation and society, are today. This is not a book of large generalizations; they use evidence (legal, anecdotal) to back up their claims and try to track trends back as far as they can, to illustrate long-term cause and effect, when relevant. The footnotes are numerous and detailed, including many resources to explore further, if interested. Also, just from a writing/reading perspective, this book has a very satisfying organization. It is unlike some nonfiction that, though thorough, just rambles its points into a confusing monologue; the authors clearly put thought into the structure of this book and designed it so their message is clear and strong. As a reader, I SO appreciate that!It was hard to read most of this book and NOT feel like we are utterly doomed. However, the final section of the book offers advice on how to combat the negative social trends described, and it actually made me exhale with relief of, ""Oh thank god, there's hope."" This ""advice"" is framed on multiple levels - as individuals, schools, society - which makes it easy to see how even small actions and belief systems ultimately have such a large impact. Before I finished the end, I told a coworker/friend that my optimism tells me society has always proven reactionary, and perhaps, with an awareness, we will begin finding ways to combat the negative energies that have been flourishing. This, also, is the authors' conclusion - that there is already evidence we are learning from our mistakes. As quoted: ""On what principle is it that, when we see something but improvement behind us, we are to expect nothing but deterioration before us?""My only critique is one the authors' fully recognize and state in the book's very beginning: this is a very white, middle-class perspective. While it speaks to larger social trends in society, the individual behaviors and belief systems that it identifies - the points that can be used to help remedy some of these trends - are based on a white, middle-class lifestyle and value system. My students are not white, and they are not middle-class. I need more exploration of these ideas, and how they connect to the value systems of different cultures within our local communities, to feel well-equipped in tackling these great ""untruths."""
213,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11424703-chad,5,"This is an important book. I'm tempted to summarize the whole thing for you right here, but that would likely get too long too fast, and I want you to go read the book after all. Along with Amy Chua's Political Tribes, Coddling are two of the most important books of the year.Jonathan Haidt is a fairly new author to me. I hadn't heard of him until a couple of months ago. He is a moral psychologist at the New York University Stern School of business. I listen to a TED talk now and again, and I stumbled upon this one by Jonathan Haidt entitled ""The Moral Roots of Liberals and Conservatives"", and I found it very compelling; he makes an argument, based on his book The Righteous Mind, that the central differences between liberals and conservatives stem from different constructs of morality, what he terms ""the moral matrix."" On five essential scales (care/harm, fairness/unfairness, loyalty/betrayal, authority/subversion, and purity/degradation) liberals selectively weight care and fairness, and have little room for aspects of loyalty, authority, or purity. Conservatives weight all five a little more evenly than do liberals. In order to understand someone on the opposite side politically, you need to try entering their ""moral matrix"" to see why they value the things they value. At one point in the talk, Haidt says something along the lines of, ""After studying this, I finally got conservatives!"" Perhaps it sounds slightly condescending, like your in a laboratory being examined by a doctor/scientist in a lab coat, but this is virtually the first time I had heard someone left of center really engage with conservative thought rather than ridicule or reject it outright. Politics is a nasty game, and we rarely spend time thinking about why the other side arrives at different opinions. Haidt offered what to me seemed like a meaningful way to engage in dialogue about political issues without resorting to oversimplified arguments and ad hominem attacks.After listening to this first talk by Haidt, I found a couple more by him (including this interesting one given at the Museum of Sex titled ""It's Hard to Gross Out a Libertarian: Jonathan Haidt on Sex, Politics and Disgust.""). Eventually, YouTube began referring videos to me by a host of other individuals with similarly fascinating arguments: Jordan Peterson, David Rubin, and Sam Harris. I had heard of Jordan Peterson before, as I had his book Maps of Meaning on my reading list, but I was hesitant to read it, because I felt like he was going to ""explain away religion."" Similarly, I balked when I looked up Sam Harris, because he's considered what is called a New Atheist, and is very open about the fact that he sees little use for religion in a modern world. His books Letters to a Christian Nation and The End of Faith, just the titles speak for themselves. But despite some fundamental differences in our backgrounds in terms of both religion and politics (all four consider themselves to hold liberal views, and voted for Obama-- well, except Peterson; he's Canadian), I was able to appreciate their arguments that allows for an essential space for dialogue in an increasingly polarized society. It creates a space where ideas have to be defended on their merits rather than appeals to emotion or pathos. It is refreshing to hear ideas instead of insults.https://www.ted.com/talks/jonathan_ha... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmz10...Coddling also has a co-author, Greg Lukianoff, of whom I hadn't heard before. After looking at his author bio, I found out he was the founder of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE). I had stumbled upon FIRE previously, after reading a rather obscure academic book on free speech You Can't Say That!: The Growing Threat to Civil Liberties from Antidiscrimination Laws by David E. Bernstein. The book was sometimes uncomfortable to read, because you have to stomach a lot of things you disagree with, regardless of your political persuasion, when you advocate for free speech. But Bernstein's central thesis is that to maintain a free society, you have to be willing to put up with a few noisy jerks. And increasingly, some in society are unwilling to do so, and they are getting their way on university campuses in particular.Enter The Coddling of the American Mind: How Good Intentions and Bad Ideas Are Setting Up a Generation for Failure. The idea for this book came from a few shared experiences of the authors. Haidt shares his own personal conflict with the forced quieting of free speech in the classroom when he showed a short video to his students. In the video, students were being interviewed on their ideas on gay marriage. One student expresses that while the idea of gay sex makes him uncomfortable, he himself was able to see the value of letting individuals choose for themselves, and he would support gay marriage. Take his statement for what you will. One student found the video absolutely offensive, and interrupted the classroom, demanding an apology from Haidt. Haidt didn't apologize immediately, and explained the context of the video, and that the individual was actually pro-gay rights. As the class wasn't going to continue until this student was appeased, Haidt gave an apology. Not satisfied, the student filed a complaint against Haidt accusing him of homophobia and hate speech. Haidt was able to defend himself, but he got wrapped up in months of investigation to clear the matter up.Lukianoff noticed similar issues on campus. He took issues that many of the ideas being promoted on campus directly conflict principles of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT a method based on the idea that you can't achieve mental health until you learn to question your feelings and free yourself from common distortions of reality. The three ideas prevalent on campus are the central ideas that are challenged in this book:What doesn't kill you makes you weaker. Students are fragile, and if they encounter anything from discrimination to ideas that challenge their beliefs, they can be harmed psychologically. The opposite of ""sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can never hurt me.""Always trust your feelings. If you feel hurt, then you were hurt. Haidt spends some time about how the idea of microaggressions no longer focuses on the intent of a potentially offensive statement, but rather the impact. This has developed into a call-out culture where individuals get virtue for identifying individuals who can be found guilty of being a part of the system of systemic oppression.Life is a battle between good and evil people. Rather than trying to find the good in other people, you make those you disagree with look as reprehensible as possible while admitting no faults of your own.Haidt examines each of these ideas in turn, and counters them with both scientific evidence and ancient wisdom. He also examines several cases of the effects these ideas have had on campus: faculty members being forced to resign after a single misplaced word, students willing to resort to violence shutting down speakers they disagree with, and student mobs patrolling campuses. It sounds frightening. Haidt tries to answer the question of why these ideas have become ascendant, and he traces six narrative threads that he argues contribute to the problem:rising political polarizationrising rates of adolescent depression and anxietya shift to a more fearful, protective, and intensive parenting in middle-class and wealthy families.widespread play deprivation and risk deprivation for members of iGenan expanding campus bureaucracy taking an increasingly overprotective posturea rising passion for justice combined with a growing commitment to obtain ""equal outcomes.""I would reiterate that Haidt considers himself a centrist and agrees with many policies left of center. This is not a conservative propaganda machine, although many have tried to paint it as such. Haidt's book is as much a diagnosis as a prescription. He makes several recommendations at the end for individuals, parents, and universities. Universities need to be committed to free speech. We parents need to perhaps rethink some of the ways we are parenting our kids. Haidt also has created a website Heterodox Academy where readers can find additional resources and stay up to date on free speech issues on campus.Again, highly recommend this book!"
214,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4651295-jason-furman,4,"I am impressed with most students I have encountered at my university and other universities for their willingness to challenge themselves, take risks, have open conversations, experiment with different points of view, and empathize with the arguments of those they disagree with. I am also struck by just how many students--including many liberal ones--how afraid they are to fully speak their minds, how carefully they check their surroundings before speaking, and how they worry that something they do might get misunderstood and lead to their being ""cancelled."" In a recent survey 44% of self-identified conservatives at Harvard said they did not feel they could speak their minds, the only political, racial, ethnic, gender, or class background group where a majority did not feel comfortable speaking their mind.The Coddling of the American Mind is an important book that attempts to diagnose that second set of problems, understand its causes, and offer remedies. They do all of this from a very sympathetic perspective to progressive causes--both consistently vote Democratic--but also a deep commitment to an ideal of education and free speech. The book is well written (although occasional seams showing as it passes between the perspectives of the two authors), thought provoking, but sometimes seems to miss some of the point and lack the broader perspective I opened with.The book centers around the ""Three Great Untruths"": (1) fragility (what doesn't kill you makes you weaker); (2) emotional reasoning (always trust your feelings), and (3) us vs. them (life is a battle between good people and bad people). The authors argue--somewhat implausibly to my mind--that there was a discontinuous increase in these vices in recent years as what they call ""iGen"" showed up on campus with a new outlook shaped by political polarization, increased anxiety and depression, paranoid parenting, the decline of play, the bureaucracy of safetyism and the quest for justice. Much of their analysis these individual factors seems right and important (e.g., my children walk around on their own less often than I did as a child even though it is far safer today than it used to be). But I am not as convinced of the causal link between all of these and an abrupt discontinuity which seems to understate how much the three vices were present in the past and how much the majority of students don't live by the three vices even today.The long descriptions of every rejected conservative speaker in recent years was less original and read like the same recitation of events we have heard about over and over again. In most cases, attacking speakers and faculty was clearly wrong. But reading the same examples over and over again almost makes the point seem less compelling.By the conclusion of the book they remember they also subscribe to Steven Pinker's view that people are constantly overstating the ways in which the world is getting worse and missing that it is actually getting better, at which point there is a little bit of a tortured attempt to reconcile that view with what they are seeing. More importantly, however, are several tangible ideas of what we can do as students, universities and societies to make it better. These suggestions are important and I, for one, can feel optimistic when I remember that this is what the majority of students want from their educations already--and that it can be combined with something else many of them want from their education, which is an understanding of the tools they can employ to make the world a better place."
215,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22232166-ash-wilson,5,"I work at a high school, & this book was recommended to me by a colleague, close friend, & AMAZING educator at that school. She, too, gave it 5 stars, owns a copy, and has notes written all over the margins of it, annotations, & sticky notes sticking out of many pages. Needless to say, I checked the book out from the library rather than read her personal copy, which I would’ve had to wait in line for because she currently has it lent out anyways, haha! I definitely agree that this is a 5 star effort, & an educational, thought provoking one for our times at that, that I feel we all should be reading & thinking about - ESPECIALLY in education & in parenting today! I wouldn’t say that I agreed with everything Greg & Jon touched on, but I did agree with the vast majority of it, & they clearly spent time researching, reading, & interviewing as much as they possibly could for their subject matter to bring it from the popular article they once wrote several years ago, to the book we need to read & understand here in the United States, (& even, as they point out, around the world), today.They’re VERY big believers in CBT, (cognitive behavioral therapy), which everyone can do on their own. (They even include a how-to guide at the back of the book). I had heard of, but knew very little about CBT prior to reading this book, but as a millennial who has struggled with anxiety & depression in the past myself, I think it sounds interesting & am willing to give it a try for sure. On a side note, I was more than halfway through the book when I got to the part where both Greg & Jon admitted that they, themselves, associate with the liberal side of the democratic party & have never once voted for a republican for congress or president. - I note this because as I said, I was more than halfway through the book by that point, & honestly was unsure of their political leanings prior to their admitting it. This is both fascinating & amazingly awesome to me in 2019! We are so incredibly divided politically right now in this country, (which they talk about in the book), that it seems I can’t read even a scientific or educational book these days without knowing for certain what the authors’ political leanings are. Greg & Jon showed the way it SHOULD be. I thought they were perfectly fair in being equally critical of both sides of the political scale adding to the problems right now, & their science, research, interviews, etc in how to fix things were down the middle & fair in that way as well. I found that to be SO incredibly refreshing, & was greatly impressed with it!I also enjoyed the structure of the section & chapter setups of this book, particularly the relevant quotes that begin each chapter, as well as the “in sum” section at the end of every chapter, where they would re-highlight the biggest, most important points made within that chapter. That helped me understand & process the book as a whole better. I will definitely be checking out any & all future updates on thecoddling.com, & I am now a big believer in “the 3 great untruths”, & our need to recognize & correct them as we go forward raising & educating this & future generations & sending them off to college / universities, & to be contributing members of society as they venture out into the real world as young adults."
216,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22679197-nathan,5,"Jonathan Haidt is one of my favorite writers. He is, on all accounts, one of the most empathetic, clear and organized thinkers I have read. (And - I do recognize the book was co-written also by Greg Lukianoff, who I hadn't read before.)The Coddling of the American Mind is about seeking wisdom in how we educate the next generation. They are, like many others, observing drastic changes occurring around the country, diagnosing the problem and offering suggestions. In a world of increasing polarization, they are attempting to speak from the middle, which is a radical (and dangerous) place to stand.Here's their outline:Part 1 - Three Bad IdeasChapter 1 - The Untruth of Fragility: What doesn't kill you makes you weaker.Chapter 2 - The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: Always trust your feelings.Chapter 3 - The Untruth of Us Verses Them: Life is a battle between good people and evil peoplePart 2 - Bad Ideas in ActionChapter 4 - Intimidation and violenceChapter 5 - Witch HuntsPart 3 - How did we get here?Chapter 6 - The Polarization CycleChapter 7 - Anxiety and DepressionChapter 8 - Paranoid ParentingChapter 9 - The Decline of PlayChapter 10 - The Bureaucracy of SafetyismChapter 11 - The Quest for JusticePart 4 - Wising UpChapter 12 - Wiser KidsChapter 13 - Wiser UniversitiesConclusion - Wiser SocietiesIn part one, their goal is to observe the shift that has occurred on college campuses, particularly around the new culture of ""safety,"" explaining the three great untruths stated above, which undergird the movement. Part two describes these great untruths in action, looking at the ""shoutdowns,"" intimidation, and occasional violence experienced on college campuses, which is making university's core missions of educaion and research more difficult. Behind it all, in part three they lay out 6 factors and trends that explain how we got here. And in part four, they give some advice on how we are to go forward as parents and educators. Each chapter provides a bullet-pointed summary of the content (which I always appreciate). Overall, I felt their arguments were compelling. And the situation on college campuses is worse than I realized. The level of civil discourse seems (to me) to be spiraling, and I hope the trends will reverse. This book is actively working to do just that. As I mentioned, they are working to speak from the middle, so to speak, and find wisdom for moving forward. And because we are becoming more and more polarized, being shoveled to the right and left, some of what they say may bother or frustrate you. Yet, there is too much wisdom to ignore it or write them off. Name-calling is not only unhelpful, it merely perpetuates the problem. Simply put, this book ought to be required reading for educators, parents, and people concerned about social justice.To counter their ""great untruths,"" they repeatedly reference these three quotes:Prepare the child for the road, not the road for the child. -Folk WisdomYour worst enemy cannot harm you as much as your own thoughts, unguarded. But once mastered, no one can help you as much, not even your father or your mother. -BuddhaThe line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn"
217,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3149695-julie,5,"This is a book I think everyone should read. I read this book, page by page, with a pen in hand. I plan to buy the audio version and invite my twenty-somethings to listen to it. I have kids in college right now. I can see where maybe I have contributed to some of this culture, as well as mistakes I made in parenting. When I was a girl, maybe around 10, I remember riding my bike all over our little community. Miles I would travel. We played in this little tunnel that went under the freeway. We actually never went in very far because we were afraid there would be snakes or druggies, but still, we played there. We also found an abandoned shack. I also had a little babysitting job and would ride my bike to and from, probably 2.5 miles each way down a busy 4 lane road. At 10 years old. Now fast forward to my days of raising children. I walked my elementary aged kids to and from school which was 2 blocks from home. But, to be fair, there were other factors than just being an over-protective parent. I have a friend whose 4 year old son slipped out of the house while she was nursing her newborn. A neighbor lady saw him heading to the park. My friend caught up to him just as this neighbor saw him. The neighbor lady scolded my friend for “allowing” this precocious boy to to go to the park alone (not true, he escaped). To which my friend corrected the lady and said she went out to find him as soon as she could unlatch her newborn and chase after the boy. The lady did not like the way my friend responded so she called CPS on her. My friend had months of social worker visits, had to install locks that were too tall for the 4 year old (he used a chair the next time), and had all sorts of issues to deal with to prove she was a good mom. Mind you, this friend is a great mother, a woman with an advanced degree who chose to stay at home with her kids. So parents of my age had to deal with seeing news reports of stories like Elizabeth Smart, and then do-gooders who would turn people in if a child under 12 was ever left alone. It’s no wonder we have issues. I remember saying to friends I was more afraid of do-gooders than actual bad guys. I had a police officer stop me when my four year old raced down the street without me. He took down my name like I was a criminal. I am grateful that now some states are getting smart and passing “free-range children” laws. And there is attention being brought to the fact that our children need to learn some independence. We tried to teach our children independence, but in that climate it was tricky. The authors cover topics other than just that. I worry about the social media aspect of children growing up now. The iGen kids, according to this book, have much higher depression, anxiety and suicide rates than previous generations. Even as a middle aged adult, I sometimes find myself feeling a little left out or comparing myself when I am on Facebook. I have cut back on social media a great deal and pretty much only use it as a bulletin board for my families and communities in group pages.I could go on and on, but needless to say, there is much to be gained from this book. I didn’t always agree with everything. There are some stories they mentioned from the news that to me seemed a bit skewed. But overall i felt they tried to be fair to both political sides, maybe just not entirely succeeding but considering today’s political climate they did a very good job. I think this is a must read for everyone."
218,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82690055-damian-leverett,5,"could not recommend this book more adamantly. It is primarily a book about colleges and universities and the shift in ideas and thinking that has occurred there over the past five years or so. But it shows how those issues aren’t contained to the campus-they have crept out into our everyday worlds and workplaces and industries. It may interest anyone who graduated recently, is in college now, works with teen or college aged kids, parents kids of any age. I think it really really matters for anyone working in the arts or who cares about politics. It is SO important and brilliantly illuminated the essence and causes of really bad ideas with terrible outcomes that stem from good intentions and real issues. I arrived on a college campus in 2013 and left in 2017 and it really helped explain the disorienting and troubling shifts I witnessed in school but couldn’t quite account for or put my finger on while immersed in the environment. Multiple times reading this book I wanted to go out on the street corner and hand out free copies to anyone and everyone. That’s how passionately I feel about it. It gets to the heart of not just college issues, but much broader cultural problems. The authors call them the Three Great Untruths, which students and now institutions and the world at large have begun accepting: 1) what doesn’t kill you maker you weaker...the myth of fragility and the resulting rise in overprotection and stifling academic inquiry and debate 2) always trust your feelings: the idea that our feelings are always right and so when we feel a certain a way about something or someone we just act on it, rather than examine the issue more objectively, listen to the other side, etc. 3) us versus them: the false idea that life is a struggle between good people and bad people. Every major religious and philosophical system and thinker has been able to see the error and danger in this way of thinking. Most people I’ve talked to over the age of 40 actually seem to intuitively reject this based on life experience. But how widely does this still plague our society? Does it actually help us solve any issue? Or does it just contribute to more polarization which exacerbated the very problems we were trying to fix!? “If only it were so simple! If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being.” “Prepare the child for the road, not the road for the child.” “Your worst enemy cannot harm you as much as your own thoughts, unguarded.”So there’s my recommendation. 10/5 stars. Let me know if you read it and we can discuss!"
219,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/998266-kate-schwarz,5,"Very good book about the trends of students--the parts about college students and the trends on social campuses was less relevent to me as the parent of a middle school student and two elementary students, but I paid more attention when the authors traced those trends back to middle school and even back to homes/parenting decisions. And the majority of the book does focus on parenting, especially the ""safetyism""--the desire to keep our kids safe no and therefore prevent them from engaging in anything that might be risky, and therefore prevent opportunities for confidence- and character-building--that the authors and others have pointed out in our society.One of the most interesting takeaways for me from this book was the discussion of Cognitive Behavior Therapy, and how conversations with children about ""cognitive distortions,"" or thought patterns that negatively impact how people process information. Educating children on these distortions, the authors argue, can help them become more adept at being truth-seekers and become a little wiser a little earlier in their lives. Here's a list proffered by the authors of common cognitive distortions: - emotional reasoning. letting your feelings guide your interpretation of reality. - catastrophizing. focusing on the worst possible outcome and being sure it'll happen. - over-generalizing. perceiving a global pattern of negatives based on a single incident. - black and white/all or nothing thinking. viewing events or people in all or nothing terms. - mind reading. assuming you know what people think without having sufficient evidence. - labeling. assigning global negative traits to yourself or others. - negative filtering. focusing almost exclusively on negatives. - discounting positives. claiming positive things are trivial so you can maintain a negative judgement. - blaming. focusing on the other person as the source of negative feelings, you refuse to take responsibility for changing yourself.I also really liked this excerpt from a middle school graduation speech:""From time to time I hope you are treated unfairly, so that you will come to know the value of justice. I hope that you will suffer betrayal because that will teach you the importance of loyalty. Sorry to say, but I hope you will be lonely from time to time, so that you don't take friends for granted. I wish you bad luck, again from time to time, so that you will be conscious of the role of chance in life and understand that your success is not completely deserved and that the failure of others is not completely deserved either. And when you lose, as you will from time to time, I hope every now and then, that your opponent will gloat over you. It's a way of understanding the importance of sportsmanship. I hope you'll be ignored so you'll understand the importance of listening to others and I hope you will have just enough pain to learn compassion. Whether I wish these things or not, they are going to happen. And whether you benefit from them or not, will depend on the ability to see the message in your misfortunes."""
220,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/802795-kris,3,"Okay. Here goes.I feel like I am going to be the only three-star review for this book. It is a polarizing, love it or hate it sort of book. But I found some of it valuable, and the rest of it well worthy of critique. I am wholly onboard with the concept that education should not be comfortable. I am fully supportive of the right of people to say whatever the hell stupid thing they want to say, unless you are endangering others. And I agree that that danger should mean actual, physical danger, not just hurting someone’s feelings. Unexamined ideas are not strong. Real learning is squirmy and awkward and sometimes downright painful. It should be. We should be able to pick apart every idea we have and ask ourselves WHY. Why do I believe this? And a college campus should actively encourage that. It should make you hear things you don’t agree with. We have come to the incorrect conclusion lately that listening somehow implies support. It doesn’t. I listen to all sorts of shit that I disagree with. My main issue with this book is its “evidence” claims. Anecdotes do not equal evidence. One of the main concepts of this book is that is something goes against “ancient wisdom” is is inherently untrue.NO. NO. NO. Am I being clear enough here? NO. Just because an idea is old, it does not mean it is true. That, my friends, is bullshit. There are a bunch of old ideas that are terrible and horrible and dangerous. I do not agree with some of the other things put forth in this book. I do think microaggressions and rape culture are real. I do think impact matters, even if the intent is not bad. I think that the whole impact mattering MORE than intent is crap, but impact does matter. If you break someone’s toe, even if you didn’t mean it, their toe is still broken. You need to take responsibility and be more careful in the future. But screaming at them, “I DON’T CARE IF YOU MEANT IT OR NOT YOU ARE A TERRIBLE PERSON WHO IS JUST AS BAD AS SOMEONE WHO MEANT TO BREAK MY TOE” is not helpful for anyone. Y’all. This all comes down to critical thinking. The left has a point. The protection and coddling comes from the place of understanding that, as horrible and elitist as this sounds, most people don’t think critically. It is why I would hesitate to recommend this book to most people. They will not be able to read it in a nuanced way. But whether or not people think critically, WE HAVE TO LET THEM TRY. And really, that is what this comes down to. We have to let people think and hear and see all sides of something, even if that means they are going to come to conclusions we don’t agree with. "
221,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4977333-doug-mcnair,4,"This is a useful book that helped me understand why some younger Americans' concepts of morality, fairness, justice, respect, liberty, personal ethics, and proper interpersonal conduct are so different from my own. My moral foundations come from the Enlightenment, the Constitution of the United States, liberal democracy, and the Stoic Christian tradition. So my moral touchstones growing up were maxims like ""I disagree with what you say, but will defend to the death your right to say it,"" ""He who gives up a little freedom in return for safety will get neither freedom nor safety,"" ""He who is without sin, let him cast the first stone,"" and ""Sticks and stones may break my bones, but names will never harm me."" And my childhood heroes were stoics like Mr. Spock and Kwai Chang Caine: men whose virtues were compassion rooted in personal strength, intelligence, and toughness; who defended the weak with rationality and kindness, and who used violence only as a last resort; who would counter offensive speech by calmly arguing or demonstrating the opposite, and who would never violate the freedoms of others to make themselves feel safer.But a younger generation of Americans has seemingly rejected these Stoic virtues and has adopted a culture of Safetyism, which rests on what the authors call the Three Great Untruths: What doesn't kill you makes you weaker, Always trust your feelings, and Life is a struggle between good people and bad people. As a result, they feel that respect for the free speech rights of others is a mark of privilege rooted in willful ignorance of the harm that they say offensive speech causes to vulnerable groups, that countering hateful speech with compassion and constructive engagement is naive or dangerous because evil people are unredeemable and will use your efforts at reconciliation against you, and that violating the free speech rights of others is necessary to protect victimized groups from further harm. The authors explain the complex process by which the culture of Safetyism came to be in society at large and on elite college campuses in particular, and they show the harm that Safetyism does to students themselves and the university's mission of seeking truth through inquiry and respectful debate. They then offer some solutions rooted in the traditions I grew up with, and I can only hope society at large re-embraces the old liberal values, because Safetyism -- which encourages people to fear and hate anyone with whom they disagree -- will only exacerbate the tribalism and polarization that are tearing this nation apart."
222,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2487388-peter-w,5,"The authors discuss a trend of safetyism in America, or the tendency to remove threats to protect a group. This safetyism is evidenced by schools’ extreme measures to protect kids from peanut products, the expectation that children should always be supervised, and the increased use of trigger warnings. The problem with safetyism, the authors say, is that people — and especially children — are antifragile, meaning they grow and become stronger when some level of risk is involved. For example, when exposure to peanut products is completed removed, peanut allergies actually increase because our immune systems are antifragile systems. The authors also link safetyism with ""witch hunt"" incidents at American universities, where university professors are demanded to be fired due to voicing unpopular opinions.To this backdrop, the authors advocate a style of parenting that involves some giving children some “free play” — where kids choose and monitor their own activities. They also advocate universities to develop stronger commitments to viewpoint diversity and free speech. One idea I found interesting in this book was that encouraging people to interpret certain actions as “microaggressions” might be counterproductive to good mental health. Microaggressions are based on a victim’s perception and include instances when offense was entirely unintentional. As such, teaching people to see microaggressions contradicts the conventional wisdom of “giving people the benefit of the doubt.” To quote the book, those who look for microaggressions will tend to “see more aggression in ambiguous interactions, take more offense, feel more negative emotions, and avoid questioning their initial interpretation” (42). This, the authors say, contradicts “good psychotherapy,” which teaches people to avoid mind reading, negative filtering, or emotional reasoning.When I told a coworker about reading this book, he recommended listening to Jonathan Haidt’s debate on the Ezra Klein show to get a different perspective on the group. I recommend listening to it; you can find the link here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgt34.... It was a pleasure to listen to two smart people debate important interesting ideas in a civil manner (they both say, “I agree with you on that,” or similar statements a lot). In response to Haidt’s ideas about microaggresions, Klein suggests that what might be best for one’s mental health might not necessarily be best for society as a whole, and asks a lot of other interesting questions."
223,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31243946-mckell,4,"I saw this book as a call to recognize the common humanity we all share! So many important points, backed up by studies and psychology, and thoroughly discussed. Very current, they draw on current events, political happenings, and news that seems like it happened just yesterday. Some of the current trends are disturbing, but it is empowering to understand how these trends got started and what we might do about them. I recommend this book! Points to remember:* Children are anti-fragile- Prepare the child for the road, not the road for the child.-Viewpoint diversity is essential to education!- Trend: Students on college campus' shut down speakers with opposing viewpoints. Speech seen as ""violent"" is matched by physical violence. Violence justified as “self-defense”.- Invites us not to see ourselves and our children as “fragile candles but as fires, welcoming the wind by seeking out ideologically different speakers and ideas”!- Two responses to others with differing views: Stoic response (cultivating non-reactivity); Anti-fragility response (put on some boots & learn how to deal with adversity).*We are all prone to emotional reasoning and the confirmation bias (can't always trust your own feelings)-CBT, cognitive distortions -A look at iGen... increasing levels of anxiety and depression * We are all prone to dichotomous thinking (life's a battle between good and evil people) and tribalism.- One of the most interesting studies I’ve read is the ‘minimal group paradigm’ organized by Polish psychologist Henri Tajfel. He “wanted to understand the conditions under which people would discriminate against people of an outgroup”. What he found, across numerous studies, is that when people are divided into groups, regardless of how trivial or arbitrary the criteria (such as flipping a coin, estimating the amount of dots on a page, etc), people favored the people of their in-group. And when examining the brains of people as they watched people of other groups be pricked by a needle, “the area of the participants brain that handles pain showed a larger spike” when the hand being pricked was labeled as belonging to the same group as the participant. He concluded, “We just don’t feel as much empathy for those we see as “other”.” (Dehumanizing)The danger we face is not differing opinions, there is no violence in “hate speech”. The true danger is in categorizing people (us vs. them/ in-group vs. out-group/ oppressed vs. oppressors) and missing our common humanity.*Safetyism and overprotective/paranoid parenting vs. free range kids -“When we overprotect children, we harm them. Children are naturally anti fragile, so overprotection makes them weaker and less resilient later on.” -“When children are repeatedly led to believe that the world is dangerous and that they cannot face it alone, we should not be surprised if many of them believe it”."

Takeaways:- “Prepare the child for the road, not the road for the child.”- The Hygiene Hypothesis and why allergy rates generally go up as countries become cleaner and wealthier. - Safety-ism: A culture that allows the concept of “safety” to creep so far that it equates emotional discomfort with physical danger is a culture that encourages people to systematically protect one another from the very experienced embedded in daily life that they need in order to become strong and healthy. - “Nothing is miserable unless you think it so, and, on the other hand, nothing bring happiness unless you are content with it.” - Boethius’ Consolation of Philosophy- People are now taking away the importance of intent is the actions and things said by others and saying only the impact of these things matter, as evidenced with this quote published on everydayfeminism.com: “In the end, what does the intent of our action really matter if our actions have the impact of furthering the marginalization or oppression of those around us. - Hannah Holborn Gray, former president of the University of Chicago (1978-1993), on education: “Education should not be intended to make people comfortable, it is meant to make them think.”- An alleged 51% of college students claim to have anxiety, according to a study in 2017. - How old is old enough for a child to wait in a car alone? A mother of an 11-year was arrested for it.- A part from Chief Justice Roberts’ middle school commencement speech: “From time to time in the years to come, I hope you will be treated unfairly, so that you will come to know the value of justice. I hope that you will suffer betrayal because that will teach you the importance of loyalty. Sorry to say, but I hope you will be lonely from time to time so that you don’t take friends for granted. I wish you bad luck, again, from time to time so that you will be conscious of the role of chance in life and understand that your success is not completely deserved and that the failure of others is not completely deserved either. And when you lose, as you will from time to time, I hope every now and then, your opponent will gloat over your failure. It is a way for you to understand the importance of sportsmanship. I hope you’ll be ignored so you know the importance of listening to others, and I hope you will have just enough pain to learn compassion. Whether I wish these things or not, they’re going to happen. And whether you benefit from them or not will depend upon your ability to see the message in your misfortunes.”- Some of the most creative people came from homes full of arguments, yet few parents today teach their children to argue productively.

There is a similar message, and like his online persona - he is the nicer, more smiley version of  Jordan Peterson.Now Jordan Peterson is kind of nice in his own way - in my opinion at least, but Haidt brings the smiles up a bit. If Peterson is the stern uncle who cares about you - Haidt is the fun uncle who also cares about you.The first message of the book takes second look at how we are not preparing our children for life It holds all the critiques against outrage culture that this genre normally has - but it's Haidt, so it has a more positive approach. I like his veneration of Martin Luther King and Pauli Murray as a way to protest more effectively by taking the burden upon yourself.This inclusive, common-humanity approach was also explicit in the words of Pauli Murray, a black and queer Episcopal priest and civil rights activist who, in 1965, at the age of fifty-five, earned a degree from Yale Law School. Today a residential college at Yale is named after her.42 In 1945, she wrote: I intend to destroy segregation by positive and embracing methods. . . . When my brothers try to draw a circle to exclude me, I shall draw a larger circle to include them. Where they speak out for the privileges of a puny group, I shall shout for the rights of all mankind.Ie Haidt doesn't say don't protest - he says protest more effectively by taking the burden upon yourself to include your alleged enemies in your plans.And Haidt gives it to both sides - before noting that sides is an artificial conceptHaidt gives plenty examples of left-leaning protests out of control, but shows how the right-wing media stokes those protests, and shows how right-leaning counter protestors can also bring bad things.And then he gives example after example of how taking sides is in our nature, but is also an artificial concept that does not be there at all.And he ends with one note on how we are making things harder for children Social Media is not good for kids, particularly girls. We have done them a disservice by giving them social media, and Haidt all but proves this again and again.In short - great book It doesn't really take a side other than the truth and hoping for a better world - and it's great. You can get his general message by looking at a few of his interviews, but this book has all his messages. I recommend it!"
226,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92319245-mona,5,"Warning : this review can ""make you feel uncomfortable"" Pros:1. This is an excellent book. It's very informative, interesting, well written and researched, politically balanced (even though authors do not hide their left sided sympathies), and if there is some disbalance at few occasions, it's backed up with data justifying that. 2. Authors very well describe many factors contributing to the fact that today's collage kids are not ready for ""real life"" . They did not blame collage only, but looked also into the parenting practices and current social and political climate in the US. 3. I feel that the emphasis on CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) was a little overdone, probably due to author's personal experience with it. 4. I particularly agreed with bringing up topic of entitlement, glorification of comfort, emotional and ideological safety in our society. Also, I agree with the statement that ""we moved from dignity culture to victimhood culture, with high sensitivity to slight, tendency to handle conflict through complains to third party and cultivate an image of being victims who deserve assurance."" Kids are barometer of the society, we have no one else to blame but ourselves for status quo. It's not collage faculty job to ""fix"" this victimhood in our kids. Cons: 1. On multiple occasions, authors use political lineage interchangeably to racism. All events described in part II were purely race driven, not politically connected. Some things are simple, no need to attach political drama to them. 2. This book focuses on kids starting college in 2013. I would like to see some information about remaining 60-70% of US kids who did NOT attend college. Is there any data comparing depression/suicide rates, social skills etc. among those two groups? That would be the most reliable information on influence of colleges ""per se"" on iGen generation. 3. Authors failed to acknowledge that depression and suicide rates rise in the USA in ALL age groups, not only in collage kids and teenagers. USA is the country with the highest depression rates in the world. Let's pause here for a moment... 4. I admire author's optimism which shines from the last chapter, but unfortunately I don't share it (see point 4 above). We don't need totalitarian government to revoke our First Amendment anymore. We are doing a pretty good job ourselves. And all in a name of protection of our feelings, emotions and not to make ourselves feel uncomfortable."
227,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7095591-anna,4,"I wanted to read The Coddling of the American Mind to learn what I can do as a parent to (hopefully) prevent setting my kids up for failure in adulthood. In addition to troubling parenting strategies, the book reveals a broader picture that encompasses cultural and political trends. I graduated from college 15 years ago and I was unaware of the culture shift that has been happening at universities. The stories and statistics are starling.Research shows that paranoid parenting and the culture of ""safetyism"" combined with the decline of unsupervised free play are the main contributors to the emotionally fragile young adults entering academia and adulthood. As the title suggests, parents have good intentions! We think we're doing what's best for our children. But as Lukianoff and Haidt explain, the ""time-intensive, labor-intensive strategy"" of concerted cultivation parenting ""involves over-protecting, over-scheduling, and over-parenting children in hopes of giving them an edge in a competitive society that has forgotten the importance of play and the value of unsupervised experience"" (chapter 9). Thankfully, the authors provide practical advice for ""raising children who are wiser, stronger, and antifragile"" (chapter 12). ""Prepare the child for the road, not the road for the child"" is the first general principle presented, and in my mind, it's the single most important piece of advice. I've heard this advice before, but suggestions in the book make it even more practical for application.It's hard to admit, but I recognize that I am guilty of some of the parenting mistakes presented in the book. Hopefully it isn't too late to retrain myself and correct some of my misguided strategies.The most enlightening part of this book for me was the list of the nine most common cognitive distortions presented in chapter two. Since she learned to talk, my youngest has had a negative predisposition. As a natural optimist, I have struggled to argue against her stubborn negativity. As I read the list of cognitive distortions and examples it was like I was hearing conversations I have with my daughter every day. ""Someone who habitually thinks in such ways develops schemas that revolve around maladaptive core beliefs which interfere with realistic and adaptive interpretations of social situations"" (chapter 2). There is a remedy for these cognitive distortions: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). I can no longer deny the truth that my daughter needs CBT. I feel empowered knowing that there is hope."

In one sense, this was an excellent book explaining why the new generation of young people (iGen, or generation z, or anyone born after 1994) seem to be at such odds with other generations. But in another sense, this book is basically a defense of the pursuit of truth, the value of grit, and the need for humility. It is a book about raising children, adolescents, and adults who will strive to heal the tears in our country, not widen them. This book diagnoses what has happened on college campuses across the country since 2013. If you want to know where trigger warnings, micro-aggresions, safe spaces, and social justice fervor came from, look no further. Why was there a sudden spike in campus protests, violence, shouting down speakers, and publicly shaming people over political disagreements? This book explains. But this book is no boiler plate conservative screed against “snowflakes.” It is a sincere, compassionate, and unbiased explanation of problems with a new culture that has swept across young teenage and college students—conservative and liberal alike. There are three great “untruths” that young people believe today:1. What doesn’t kill you makes you weaker. 2. Always follow and trust your feelings. 3. There are good people and evil people. The author’s remedy these with three counter truths:1. Young people are not fragile. Being exposed to difficulties, challenges, and ideas you disagree with is good for you. Prepare the child for the road, not the the road for the child. 2. Your emotions are unreliable guides for truth—learn to identify faulty emotional reasoning that depend on cognitive distortions (catastrophizing, mind reading, fortune telling, etc.). 3. The line that divides between good and evil cuts through the heart of every man. Be wary of tribalism, us vs them. Learn from people you disagree with.The only reason I gave this 4 instead of 5 is because of the title. I fear that more liberal readers will see the title and write this off as another conservative book making fun of whining Democrats. That isn’t at all what this is (the authors are both Democrats themselves). I wish they would have chosen something that wouldn’t have had such a derogatory slant to it. "
229,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93951124-palmer-kennedy,5,"In ""The Coddling of the American Mind: How Good Intentions and Bad Ideas are Setting Up A Generation For Failure,"" Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt argue that something has gone terribly wrong in American education institutions, from college campuses all the way down to primary school playgrounds. The presenting symptoms are legion. In the very institutions designed to promote open discussion and civil debate, violence and intimidation (from both the Right and the Left) are used to silence the free exchange of ideas. Opposing viewpoints, rather than potentially reasonable positions to contend with, are demonized along with their adherents. Speech (that you disagreed with) now qualifies as violence and a just cause for firing, defamation, and/or physical aggression. Free-speech and diversity of thought, two of the greatest gifts of our national heritage and the only means towards genuine academic development, are stifled in the name of “student safety” and “tolerance” (hence, “Coddling”). The result… stagnant echo-chambers, bitter polarization, and - worst of all - students without intellectual humility, empathy, or resilience. As noted by Lukianoff and Haidt, just a few YouTube clips depicting the riots at UC Berkeley and Middlebury, the mayhem at Evergreen, and the tragedy of the “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville should prove enough to quiet down would-be accusers of alarmism. Examples abound. So, how’d we get here? According to Lukianoff and Haidt, our present predicament can largely be traced back to our education system’s embrace of three particularly bad ideas, all of which contradict ancient wisdom, run counter to modern psychological research on well-being, and harm the individuals and communities that embrace them: (1) The Untruth of Fragility: What Doesn’t Kill You Makes You Weaker, (2) The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: Always Trust Your Feelings, and (3) The Untruth of Us Versus Them: Life Is a Battle Between Good People and Evil People. First, rather than prepare students for the inevitable tough road, the Untruth of Fragility prompts educators to prepare the road for the student, straightening every crooked path and laying flat every mountain and valley. Like an immune system without exposure, students with such over-protection are highly vulnerable and bound to interpret opposing viewpoints and cognitive dissonance as legitimate threats to their well-being rather than opportunities for dialogue and growth. The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning encourages students to supplant facts with feelings and rationality with emotivism. Psychologically speaking (let alone academically and intellectually), this is a bad, bad idea. Not only will such reasoning increase students’ anxiety and depression (emotional reasoning is one of the most common of all cognitive distortions), it will also tend towards further isolation and distrust as an individual’s personal emotional response becomes the supreme interpreter of events rather than another party’s actual intentions. Third, the Untruth of Us Versus Them breads ignorant tribalism. You and your tribe get to be the mighty heroes while they play the wicked villains (quite convenient). When your “good” tribe has all the answers, dialogue with others is unnecessary at best and a concession to their evil ideologies at worst. Such rearing leaves students ignorant of the potential goodness in those who differ from them as well as the potential evil in those with whom they agree. In the words of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, “The line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being.” Where then are we to go from here? Lukianoff and Haidt dedicate the entirety of Part IV of their book to addressing that question. If their advice is sound, we ought to “prepare the child for the road, not the road for the child” and oppose the three “great untruths.” We should let our students know that “your worst enemy cannot harm you as much as your own thoughts, unguarded” and that good and evil lie within the heart of every human being (including our own). We should promote freedom of inquiry and speech as well as diversity and civil disagreement. That, at least according to the authors, is a good place to start."
230,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8507655-mindy,3,"I was so ambivalent about this book, even though I did enjoy it overall (rating closer to 3.5 starts.) As a college professor, I enjoyed hearing Haidt and Lukianoff's explanation of what I see everyday on my campus: students who were not raised to see failure as an essential part of human growth and are not adequately prepared to take responsibility for their own learning and academic work. For me, coddling means having to answer the same question over and over again when it's also in writing in many different places, or having to assure students that it's okay to try something even if they won't do it perfectly. But that's not quite the same kind of coddling the authors referred to in this book. Maybe because I don't teach in one of the elite colleges in the U.S., I don't see students challenging free speech as dangerous speech in the ways described in this book. Maybe because I do teach in a community college, I'm more likely to see students who are victims of discriminatory speech, hate speech, socioeconomic exclusion, and more. Because of this, I took great exception to the authors' easy dismissal of micro-aggressions as being real and problematic. Haidt could hardly hide his disdain every time he said the word ""micro-aggression"" in the audio version I listened to. While the authors did have several chapters that traced the very real origins of the recent protests on college campuses, it's almost like they did no research into fields of scholarship that examine these things, like critical race theory or sociology. Is it only the responsibility of those who experience racism and racist speech to not take it so seriously, or is it the responsibility of all of us, educators especially, to teach students what qualifies as racist, sexist, ableist, homophobic, transphobic, etc. speech? It's one thing to assume best intentions, but it's quite another to not recognize the very real impact that something like racist speech can have on people. Impact does matter and calling out impact over intention can be a very productive way to reframe students' thinking, especially for students in historical positions of power and privilege who likely are not used to having their worldviews challenged. Isn't this what prompts growth and learning?"

The first third and last third of the book were really good. The middle third got pretty political and got old quick. It was relevant to today's gay rights June pride month (thank Beep its over on Monday). I was surprised to learn that both these writers are Democrats. This book did not feel like a Left book at all compared to all the ones I've read. Finally someone decent on that side that can be level headed.I loved the fine example they started the book with that showed how the rise in this so called peanut allergy is directly related to parents coddling their kids. So retarded. And now the rest of us have to suffer and not get our peanuts on flights anymore. Weak parents created this epidemic. Speaking of weak, the saying ""we're only as strong as our weakest link"" rings true for society since we can only progress as a nation as far as our weakest people will allow us. Quit holding us back, Coddlers!! Go do a Hurricane Heat and rethink your life.This new culture of ""safety-ism"" is frustrating and annoying AF.

""Prepare the child for the road, not the road for the child.""iGen (the generation after Millennials) is growing up more slowly. I think it really started at Generation X but is obviously apparent with iGens. It is imperative to develop an immune response rather than an allergic response to every day provocations. They gave a great suggestion for colleges giving preferences to students who have taken time off for Personal Growth and Independence, for example, military service, missionary work or traveling abroad and seeing what the other side of the world is like. I did that with my cross country biking trip back in 2008. To quote Robert Frost, ""and it has made all the difference.""

232,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88539973-spencer-case,3,"This book is a worthwhile read, but my view is that it softballs the criticism of the left, and understates the degree of the problem. The optimism at the end of the book seems completely unwarranted. As if we're already basically on a course correction and we just need more university presidents to expand ""diversity"" to include ideological diversity, have parents adopt ""free range parenting"" and a few more things like this. They mention the rise of campus bureaucracy but have very little to offer in terms of rolling it back. Nor do they mention entire departments devoted to promoting the ideas that they think are so destructive. So they only give a partial analysis of the problems and don't really justify their optimism.They also presume that all the bad behavior they identify is the product of ""good intentions and bad ideas"" (""there are no villains in this story"") ignoring the fact that many of the worst actors seem to be motivated in large part by a desire to exert control over others. For example, the students at Evergreen shouting down university president George Bridges and telling him not to move his hands when he spoke. It's quite clear that they enjoyed the power they exerted over him. It's quite a stretch to say that this is because the students were too sensitive. But Haidt and Lukianoff pound the square peg into the round hole in this and many other cases. Finally, they don't discuss very much the campus culture wars in the 1980s and 1990s. That's significant because they seem to think that the recent wave of wokeness emerged from more recent trends that affect iGen (the generation after the millennials). But I think if you read books like Professing Feminism and Free Speech for Me but Not for Thee, it's pretty clear that this trend was on the rise already. We don't actually know that no-platforming now is significantly higher than it was then because FIRE only started tracking incidents in 2000. This lines up with some of the trends they identify, e.g., the growth of college bureaucracy, but not others (the rise of social media and smartphones). "

I found this book interesting, the case well-developed and articulated, with well-thought out suggestions on what to do with this information. The basic premise encourages 1)seeking out challenges, rather than eliminating or avoiding difficult things; 2) freeing yourself from cognitive distortions, rather than always trusting your initial feelings; and 3)taking a generous view of other people, rather than assuming the worst about people within an ""us vs them"" morality. In a world of increasing polarization and a ""call out culture,"" the authors encourage seeking a common humanity over a common enemy approach. They also speak on the importance of political/viewpont diversity and why we need to interact with people who see things differently than ourselves in order to find truth. I also really appreciated their discussion on perceived impact vs intent, which brings to mind aspects of charity (giving people the benefit of the doubt and not judging).

I'm just laughing because the person who recommended this to me is one of THE MOST constantly triggered and anxious people I've ever met, but he also un-self-awarely uses this book as his bible of why the social justice politics of the American progressive liberal movement is the bane of all existence. I'm actually now not certain he's read this all the way through, else he'd know that Haidt points out that the American regressive right (largely extant outside universities) has their own version of ""cancel culture"" which happens to involve murdering people or threatening to murder and rape them, not just shouting at them or getting them fired like the left does.

Otherwise very good and I think the extreme and rare examples of students demanding a totally safe environment are a troubling portent of where the future could take us. Coddled students today are the inexperienced and panic-stricken leaders and doctors and journalists of tomorrow. However, I also agree with the point made (obliquely) in this book that if you're going to be fleeced of $30,000 a year to get a worthless education in the humanities you can probably demand whatever you want."

This book did not disappoint. I love Haidt’s uniquely balanced and logical mind, as well as his compassion. I think he displays both of those things in this book, but I think he also unintentionally comes off as a little insensitive at times. It’s not a huge problem, just a persistent niggling flick at points throughout the book. It just seems a little ironic to me that Haidt is ostensibly writing this book to help iGen (an increasingly anxious and low-resilience group, according to the authors), but I feel that many of them will be driven away by some of his rhetoric. Although, the Atlantic article summarizing this book’s main points was apparently received much better than the authors expected it to be, so who knows. Maybe there’s just no nice way to dish the home truths these guys are serving, and maybe it’s for our own good :pGenerally, the book is highly topical, important, and well executed. I love that Haidt bases many of his arguments in CBT. I found that really added a nice scientific framework for the book. These guys are basically here to say the following: there’s been a MAJOR movement in the last few years, especially on college campuses that these guys think is harmful to both our mental health, as well as free speech. They identify 3 “great untruths” that represent the movement:1.	What Doesn’t Kill You Makes You Weaker2.	Always Trust Your Feelings3.	Life Is a Battle Between Good People and Evil PeopleThey elaborate with a litany of detailed examples, and suggest a range of specific and actionable solutions, including changing parenting strategies, as well as cognitive techniques individuals can employ. Honestly I feel like half the battle is clearly getting down what the problem is, which these guys have done really well. Very interesting read, I would recommend this book. "

The book is an expansion of this Atlantic article published in 2015: https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/09/the-coddling-of-the-american-mind/399356/ The authors start by saying that a lot happened on university campuses across the country between 2015 (when the article was published) and 2018 (when the book was published), so even if you've read the article, perhaps consider reading the book as well.The gist, if I can attempt to summarize, is this: We've focused SO intensely on childhood safety over the decades (e.g. helmets, seatbelts) that childhood is physically safer than it has ever been, but our continued focus on safety has evolved into the idea that children and adolescents need to be safe from any discomfort centered around emotions, feelings, and ideas. The ""concept creep"" of ""safetyism"" is so far-reaching that young people now consider ideas and opinions that are different from their own as dangerous, and they pressure administrations across the country to protect them by disinviting speakers with whom they don't agree, for example. As a result, the academic culture at the undergraduate level over the past 5-10 years has changed such that students are not learning skills they need to thrive in the real world such as articulating an argument, considering others' viewpoints, interacting and working with people with whom you disagree, etc. There is a lot more here, and the authors dig into how they believe we have gotten here, and how we can try to reverse course.If you're interested in academia, university culture, first amendment rights, philosophy (political, parenting, and other varieties), developmental psychology, and mental health - just to name a few - then you may be interested in this book. Read it and let me know what you think."

Seek out challenges rather than avoiding everything that feels unsafe.2. Free yourself from cognitive distortions, rather than always trusting your feelings.3. Take a generous view of other people and look for nuance rather than assuming the worst and taking and us vs. them mentality.The second section of the book gives a history of poor choices that we've made as a society which got us to this point (of embracing these untruths). Some of them include paranoid parenting, the decline of free-play, and safetyism. The final section is the authors applying their advice to three areas: parenting, universities, and society.The biggest takeaway for me was a realization that I've been affected by safetyism which has made me over-parent. I'm working to overcome this. In addition to the great values they promote, I loved the fact that they argued against equality of outcome in social justice. The book wasn't without drawbacks, but they were few in number. The most damning was a positive view of abortion and encouraging parents to have a low amount of kids. Other negatives were assuming a Darwinist history of the world and promoting the Buddhist practice of mindfulness."

This trend is detrimental to both the members of this new generation and society at large.The authors approach the problem from multiple perspectives, including the lack of unstructured play for modern children, the over-scheduling of our youth, the pedagogical mistakes of the school system, and helicopter parenting.The result is a generation of youth who lack grit, resilience and openness to perspectives that differ from their own. This has led to a campus culture at colleges and even grade school where there is conformity of thought and aggressive opposition to perspectives and people who are considered right of center.Universities are hence increasingly becoming unfriendly to free speech and both teachers and students actively self-sensor to avoid being called out by those of the dominant, left of center perspective. It is considered better to shut down opposing views rather than to confront them with reason and counter-arguments.The book serves as both an observation and a warning about these trends. There are three untruths that this book tries to counteract:1. What doesn't kill you makes you weaker2. Always trust your feelings3. Life is a battle between good people and evil peopleWhile the book does a great job of summarizing how we got here, identifying what the problems seem to be and suggesting solutions, it seems to end somewhat abruptly. Its suggestions are reasonable, but they seem improbable and thus somehow incomplete.Those who are concerned about the current trend towards intolerance and polarized factionalization will likely find this book interesting. The audio book, read by Haidt, is highly recommended."

There’s a great deal of wisdom in this book.My favorite parts are the explanation and takedown of “safetyism” and the 3 great untruths that are controlling the conversation in crucial parts of this country. They are 1: “what doesn’t kill you makes you weaker” 2: “Always trust your feelings.” 3: “Life is a battle between good people and evil people.” These ideas are countered by what the authors consider the “way of wisdom” which directly refute these bad ideas. In many ways, people are resilient and actually become stronger through stressful situations. We must fight our own tendency to give into our emotional explanations for things, which often are not the truth of the matter. We have to realize that we all have the ingredients to do good things and incredibly evil things - the line between good and evil runs through our own souls, as Solzhenitsyn put it. The authors document the spread of safetyism from parenting techniques into elite public institutions, and I found this narrative very helpful. The consumer-orientation of universities and the explosion of administrative staffs does seem to have realigned universities with safety rather than truth. The documentation of teen anxiety, depression, and suicide rates is equally compelling. In a certain way, the way we use our smartphones and tech is killing people. I think I have much more to say about this book, but at this moment it motivates me to be as gracious as I possibly can be when speaking with those I disagree with, and it encourages me to do difficult things, because they make me better for it. I highly recommend this book. "
240,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30131453-lauren-bitzer,4,"The Coddling of the American Mind has really altered my thinking and views on teaching. For one, I use to constantly concern myself with the care in my language. For instance, being politically correct was a huge deal for me. This book shows that these previous thoughts are productive concerns, but if taken too far, they can have many negative outcomes and create serious cognitive distortions. By holding back what we need to say or demonizing people for saying certain things, we are blocking potential learning and opportunity for growth/debate. Secondly, it explains how we are actually doing kids a disservice when we try to overprotect them. My favorite quote from the book is “prepare the kid for the road, not the road for the kid.” When we don’t let kids learn or fail on their own, they will develop a constant need for help. Finally, it reaffirmed my thoughts on the importance of difference. We live in a polarized and divided nation. Something that is only getting worse and worse. In order to fix this, we must learn to listen to each other with intentionality and respect, especially those we disagree with. When we do this, we are not only opening up new parts of our brains, but also making our arguments stronger.Overall, this book took me a long time to read because I started it at the end of the busy school year and it was dense at times. Nonetheless, one of the most important books I have read and I recommend to any parent, teacher, or student interested in these topics. "
241,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/929592-jon,4,"Several Goodreads reviewers who didn't like this book criticized it for being a good magazine article stretched beyond its worth into a 270 page book, and they also called attention to the members of the iGen who are not coddled in the way the authors suggest. Both objections are well taken. I also questioned the authors' good-hearted assumption that all those apparently questing for truth at the university level are arguing in good faith. Some guest speakers on campuses are not, but rather are carrying out agendas of obfuscation and delay--as tobacco companies once did and fossil fuel promoters and deniers of climate change are doing now. Nevertheless, Lukianoff and Haidt really helped me clarify my own thinking about microaggression, trigger warnings, safe places, and shutting down free speech on college campuses. Some readers complained about their constant refrain of ""safetyism"" (ie, in order to prevent one person from being hurt we have to deny freedom of activity to all people--the cardinal example being a school in the UK that has ruled that students not be allowed to touch snow, on the grounds that touching might lead to snowballs, then to snowball fights, then to the possibility that a pebble in a snowball might hurt a student.) But repetitious as the authors were, they provided me with a memorable name for, and many memorable examples of, a tendency that has been bothering me for years. I note that even those readers who didn't like the book didn't really disagree with its main points."

Well, maybe not ""written"" per se, but the premises of the book are part of my own personal core values. What Lukianoff and Haidt write resonates so well with my own upbringing and how I, as an adult, have decided to live. The Untruth of Fragility: What doesn't kill you makes you weaker. Failure and pain are the greatest teachers of life lessons. It sucks to go through these times but it's also empowering to learn from them, especially compared to an alternative of wallowing in the temporary (or even long-gone) agony. The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: Always trust your feelings. Feelings are fleeting, unreliable, and fickle. To base any decision on feelings is being careless and short-sighted.The Untruth of Us versus Them: Life is a battle between good and evil people. For myself, it's so much easier to believe in the goodness of other people, even if at times I'm dead wrong. The thought of being cynical all the time is exhausting and feels like it would lead to sadness and anger on a chronic level. But herein lies the problem. Reading this book is not challenging any part of my worldview. I didn't learn anything that forced me to look in the mirror. I only noted that when it comes to the heckler's veto, the Right has no moral superiority. But that didn't change my fundamental notion that public forum's should be free to host all manners of despicable ideas for the protection of our First Amendment and the challenging of all minds. It just broadened the numbers of people to which I have disdain. I did enjoy a read of a critique in this article and will seek more debate on the subject in the future.This is why this is a 4-star book and not a 5-star. It was well written and highly researched with lots of citations. Moreover, the tone of the book was not one dismissive of the iGen group. Instead, it was even-handed and honest portrayal of a problem, its source, and potential solutions. I would recommend this book to all parents."
243,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71935584-ben-zimmerman,4,"This is the third book by Jonathan Haidt that I’ve read that just seems so important for our time. Haidt is so good at identifying difficult and complex problems that are extremely divisive, approaching them with loads of empathy and understanding, and proposing solutions and an understanding that have the potential to make a huge impact. The Coddling of the American Mind outlines “three great untruths” that have begun to pervade our culture, especially in the generation of young adults:1.	What doesn’t kill you makes you weaker2.	Always trust your feelings3.	Life is a battle between good people and evil peopleThey elaborate how these untruths are affecting policy, particularly in education. I found one section particularly interesting, about how divisive, insensitive, or offending speech is being more and more equated with violence. Thus there is a greater tendency to condone physical violence in order to prevent offensive speakers from speaking (because the offensive speaker was violent first). The authors then offer solutions that span societal/ cultural norms and techniques for individuals to practice becoming more resilient (e.g. cognitive-behavioral techniques). I hope that the book is effective at changing the way that some of these untruths have begun to shift our culture, but even if it does not, I feel like I understand the mindset and perspective that leads to common behaviors or ways of speaking in younger generations that I found confusing before reading this book."

Authors Lukianoff and Haidt explore how an overemphasis on safety and political correctness - while driven by good intentions - has inadvertently created a generation that is incapable of handling the stresses of the real world.I know this probably sounds like something your Grandpa would get fired up about after a couple of hours of watching Fox News, but Coddling is written by two liberal scholars, and the authors take a clear and balanced approach to this extremely delicate topic.While I can see how some people can unfortunately take some of Haidt and Lukianoff's observation as evidence of ""liberals destroying America,"" the authors are actually doing something much more nuanced and practical. Tackling everything from the child-rearing habits of modern Americans to the over-corporization of the University system, Haidt and Lukianoff explore the different areas in which an overprotective posture toward the world has led to cycles of perpetual outrage from the Left and the Right.If you lean liberal (as I do), I strongly recommend you read this book. Some of the stories and examples Haidt and Lukianoff use are flat-out shocking and embarrassing. It's important to be self-critical of your beliefs and tribal identities, and Coddling provides ample evidence that logical fallacies and emotional reasoning exists on both sides of the political spectrum in equal measure. Most helpful, Haidt and Lukianoff provide bulleted summaries at the end of each chapter and conclude with recommendations on how to better prepare your child and yourself for the intellectual and emotional rigors of the real world.

It is the first book I have read that discusses the issues rising from helicopter parenting, increased social media and other social changes on the COLLEGE campus. The authors discuss campus issues of free speech, 'safe spaces', trigger warnings, the use of the words safety/unsafe. They layout out what they believe to be behavior, policies & practices by university administrators and students that are antithetical to goal of higher education (which they define as a quest for truth). The book discusses in detail the causes, manifestations and make recommendations to parents, students and educators to build resilience and tolerance for different points of view. It was eye-opening for me to understand the rationale students feel when they are shouting down speakers with who they disagree or consider racist or why some students use phrases like 'this discussion makes me feel unsafe' or 'your comment invalidates my feelings'. While I may not agree with their rationale, at least I understand their emotional state a bit better.I plan on giving this to my 22 year-old University of Michigan graduate and am curious to get her reaction to it.

The most valuable part of the book looks at Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and common cognitive distortions (Also see: https://positivepsychologyprogram.com...). They don’t blame universities (though they point out how some administrations are contributing to the problem) but rather write that children are entering university with issues that are becoming obvious in university. Some of the causes they give are:News media and fear mongering, especially in the wake of 9/11; Social media/using devices, decrease in face-to-face communication; Paranoid parenting; Decline of free play, pressure in kindy;Social justice issues related to racial and gender discrimination and inequality.The book ends with practical childrearing advice which can be found on their website: https://www.thecoddling.com/wiser-kids.One topic I liked and agreed with was on microaggressions: define as small intentional or unintentional interactions that show discrimination against someone. These interactions are also misinterpreted by the receiver as discriminatory. The authors state that if someone says or does something unintentionally, it can’t be considered aggression. They give the example of accidently bumping into someone. That is not aggression. People have become too sensitive and make assumptions that are not necessarily true. "

Favorite quote:""It is crucial to teach incoming students to be thoughtful in their interactions with one another. A portion of what is derided as ""political correctness"" is just an effort to promote polite and respectful interactions by discouraging the use of terms that are reasonably taken to be demeaning. But if you teach students that intention doesn't matter, and you also encourage students to find more things offensive (leading them to experience more negative impacts), and you also tell them that whoever says or does the things they find offensive are ""aggressors"" who have committed acts of bigotry against them, then you are probably fostering feelings of victimization, anger, and hopelessness in your students.

The book began as an article and it could have been a really great podcast or shorter story; I do think it is needlessly long and sometimes oversimplified and unfocused. Yet I keep thinking about the book and how it relates to events that are occurring in our country today. The author tells about how a person's views are formed based on events that transpire primarily between ages 14 to 24, and he specifically mentions things that have happened in the past that are escalating right now in our society. It makes me wonder how the current events of 2020 will influence the rising generation--Racial tensions. Police reform. Government shutting down free enterprise through ""nonessential"" business closures. School closures. Economic decline. Unemployment spikes. Quarantine of the healthy in addition to the sick. These events will influence the views and political climate of the next generation and I'm curious about how the author feels about these--in addition to the positive effects of increased family time, less regulated free time, additional play time for kids, cancellation of organized activities, outdoor exercise, and a simplified schedule."

The authors aptly describe the troubling trends on college campuses today, but this isn't a mindless screed or angry polemic. Rather, Haidt and Lukianoff draw on a wide range of research to paint a nuanced picture of what is happening in the culture around us that has laid a foundation for these results today. There is no 'silver bullet' or simplistic explanation, they argue, but rather a complicated intersection of forces that are catalyzing into what we are seeing in protest movements, and the focus on things like 'safe spaces' and 'microaggresions.' Thankfully, the authors are not interested in angry, ""culture wars"" arguments, as they understand why these movements started in the first place (and in many cases, with good reasons). Interestingly, they also draw on some ancient wisdom and current psychological research to buttress the argument. The product is a sharply written, balanced and intelligent call to actionOverall, I found it compelling and persuasive, and this is also informed by my personal experience working on college campuses for just over 10 years. The authors are sharp in their critique, but not without hope, and they chart a way forward. An absolute must-read."

One criticism I have of Lukianoff and Haidt is that they underreport the progress already made that pushes back against ""safetyism"". Unlike their Atlantic article from 2015, this more comprehensive effort comes a year or so too late to catch the issues at their zenith. But, they could only write so fast and the underlying issues are still with us. Importantly, Lukianoff and Haidt have not written a ""kids-these-days-don't-get-it"" polemic. Not at all. It's the adults and institutions surrounding the kids that don't get it. Overprotective parents, overreactive institutions (mainly schools and colleges at all levels), and the degradation of our political processes are producing young people with greater anxiety and fewer coping mechanisms than any previous generation. Interestingly, Lukianoff and Haidt's solutions tend to rely on changing the very institutions that created to problems in the first place. It's an understandable approach, but one that will take too much time to help the older and middle-aged members of the infected generation, iGen folks currently 25 years old and younger. In the meantime, those of us near young people should start treating them like the antifragile and capable human beings they actually are so they become the empowered generation we'll need in years to come.

Lukianoff and Haidt do a fantastic job of simplifying the main reasons on why our colleges and universities are struggling to equip students today. They explore three great ""untruths"" that we teach kids, dive down into each of them, provide backstory as to why we've changed our parenting and teaching and then begin to provide solutions.The authors are very transparent in their personal political beliefs and at some points they do lose some objectivity, but at the end of each sub-topic, they still end with a solid conclusion. Only once does one of the authors talk about their current parenting practices (a 2-year old). I did try to see if either of these authors had more children and could not find anything. When discussing on how to raise children to be able to avoid the ""untruths"", the advice and practices felt cold. They treated the parent-child relationship more like a project. Without their personal experience woven into their practical applications it almost felt like a college freshman telling a tenured professor on how to teach their subject. There was a hint of naivety. In summary, if you do want to gain some insight as to why iGen seems to struggle in college, The Coddling of the American Mind provides clear findings and reasons."
252,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78159791-zack-rusk,3,"The best description of this book is that it is an academic ideas distilled into a public format. John and Greg attempt to take big ideas and then present their arguments in a reader friendly way. As a result, in my opinion, I found there were some over-generalizations made and arguments that never fully developed/explored because the authors decided to jump to the next idea. Every single chapter holds an idea/argument that is worth exploring in a book on its own and every chapter I found myself thinking 'well what about X? and I wish they would talk more about Y?' But the foundation of theories both Greg and John apply to make sense. They clearly link psychological tendencies to their 'great untruths' and provide an argument for how students, schools, and parents should conduct themselves moving forward. If their goal was to get people to start discussing ideas such as academic freedom, parenting approaches, and institutional responsibilities, then I would say the have succeeded.This book is not the end all be all, it is a (relatively small) piece of the intellectual conversation. While there are no insights that will come to dominate our way of thinking any time soon. It should be part of a healthy social academic diet that we as a community should consider as we filter through a variety of belief and human experiences."

Most notably Antifragile by Nassim Nicholas Taleb having to do with the idea that some things gain from being exposed to stress (like human beings - in this case college students) and Jon Ronson's So You've Been Publicly Shamed having to do with outrage culture and social media.This book pretty accurately describes and hypothesizes the cause of college outrage culture. It is an interesting problem - even very liberal professors are being publicly shamed and being called nazis for espousing beliefs that hurt peoples feelings. It is clear that the culture has gone too far, but I think it's going to be very complicated to fix and that even the solutions presented here will be very difficult to implement. The book gets very repetitive in the final third and you can guess what will be said. This might be a testament to how well the book is structured and the strength of the first few chapters but it is still pretty boring to go through. I'm excited to see how this book ages and recommend you read it - especially if you don't think there is a problem with outrage culture. "

However the recent conversations I have had with people in my workplace and the ongoing debates have changed this feeling. This is almost a form of cost effective therapy for me to write what seems never to be mentioned in mainstream media pundit panels, stuffed with Washington insiders who have 0 credibility or understanding of the political landscape. I base this upon their ideas and their failed predictions particularly of 2016. This book reminds me of types of pundits. There are some interesting discussion going on in this book, like parents cultivating experiences for their children by allowing them more freedom and subjected to doses of independence. There is a great discussion on the mental illnesses social media fosters around younger generations who spend 4-6 hours a day looking at their social status, how this is affecting their emotional health and hindering them from face to face contact. These are important discussions which need to be had, I think some of the examples of college students being quick to yell ""racist or sexist"" are eye opening, you could say these are situations in which they do not occur frequently enough to demand the attention they commanded in this book but I do feel their is a revolting level of intellectual insecurity where college students try to fight other ideas by banning them instead of debating them and this happens on both sides. I should stress their is no equivalence between the topics being discussed, it is fairly evident how the factions of the right are being weaponized and mobilized to give hateful rhetoric, this is magnified by the president who often shares the same talking points as these groups. His ""very fine people on both sides"" comment in reference to the infamous Neo-Nazi hate rally does exactly that. When you try to ban speakers or ban topics being discussed you only make them more infamous, you make them even more known and you become the mouthpiece for their ideas to spread. In a society which values you free speech, you should allow all ideas to be said openly and hope the good ideas out weigh the bad ideas. Banning speakers makes minds more curious as to what they're saying, this makes these speakers able to paint themselves as if they're oppressed. When they're looked as a victim people will flock to defend them. Also ANTFIA is a gift to the right, they already keep using antfia an example of the left even though it is such a staggeringly low percentage, they paint antfia as the entire left. I hate everything antfia does, they misrepresent the left and allow for arguments that are laughably stupid to be brought into the discussion all because these idiots think violence is the answer, they are idiots plain and simple. I do not care about their values, using violence to make your point, not only hurts you but hurts the movement you pretend to represent. I expect the right to be abhorrent and disgusting but I expect the left to calmly address these concerns in a civilized discourse. Today right wingers misrepresent the left when they say ""The left wants to take all your guns!"", no politician on the left has said this except for Beto, who said ""hell yeah we're going to take away your AR-15's."" A stupid comment built around trying to change the fact he is polling at 1%. They use his idiotic comment which is used to fear monger about the left to misrepresent the entire left. This has been an effective strategy, they have painted the left as violent because of antifa while they're themselves already violent, it just gives them even more reason to be violent. These are some aspects I agree with.The one disagreement I have on this subject is books like these keep preaching that we need to come together in the center and find common ground. The center is Neo-liberalism, Clinton and Obama were both centrists who tried to represent their voters while taking donations from the very people they were supposedly fighting against. The destruction of the middle class and the economic policies which created the atmosphere for a Trump to be created was caused by this myth of the center. The authors in this book fell for this illusion and I can't take you seriously as a political commentator when you keep preaching the center is the key. The democrats ran a centrist candidate and lost every level of government in political blood bath. Trump's election is a message to the establishment and status quo, that is the center. The only way to win back our democracy is through policies that represent working class people, you will not win if you do not fight for these ideals, right wing politicians and right wing media outlets keep calling liberal states the ""coastal elite"" but many of these right wing politicians and media figures all have luxury house on these coasts, they went to the same ivy league schools and many revolve around the same circles of the liberal elite. The republican elite and the liberal elite both hang around each other and they're laughing at the middle class and the poor for thinking in terms of party and not economic status. The right and the left agree on a number of policy issues like medicare for all, the green new deal, putting caps on interest rates at 15%. These are all policies 50% of both parties agree with. When we make what we agree known and try to build from there you can win back the same Trump votes who voted for Obama. You have to fight for working class people, this notion of right versus left when it should be poor versus economic elite. Rich people do not really give a shit if you're republican or liberal. Many rich liberals hang around with Rupert Murdoch who is the owner of one of the most destructive forces in our democracy, next time you turn on mainstream media, pay attention to the arguments they make who those arguments they side on benefit and then think about who're the economic benefactors of those arguments and you will realize the economic elite is not on your side. I gave this 3 stars because I thought parts were insightful."

I mostly agreed with this, sometimes wholeheartedly, but at the same time there was a niggling discomfort, which I think shows the extent to which I've been intimidated by the prevailing vocabulary tyranny on the left (if you don't say the right things the right way you're Part of the Problem and Need to Do Better through Educating Yourself and Doing the Work, which means simultaneously Having the Difficult Conversations and Sitting Down and Shutting Up). The authors are somewhat at pains to emphasize that their sympathies mostly lie with the goals of the left, if not with the current popular methods of a certain part of the left; but the fact that they're both middle-aged white males is not going to win them any credibility points with anyone not already inclined to agree with them. And as one of the dust-jacket quotes pointed out, it's a shame they chose a title guaranteed to put up the back of anyone who already feels like the target of ""snowflake shaming"".In sum, I totally agree with their ""three great untruths"" thesis, but I fear this book is ultimately just going to preach to the choir while turning off the people who might benefit from giving their ideas consideration."

These Great Untruths are (i) what doesn't kill you makes you weaker; (ii) always trust your feelings; and (iii) there is a battle of good vs evil (and you and your beliefs are, of course, on the side of good). The book posits these Great Untruths, demonstrates with data how these untruths have spread throughout society, and documents the harm these Great Untruths cause. (Among those harms is a higher incidence of depression and anxiety.)The authors further propose solutions to combat these Great Untruths, the groupthink that accompanies them, and the institutions that cave into them.I found this book especially interesting because the direction K-12 schools as well as college and universities have gone is in the direction of the Great Untruths, all from the best of intentions. And I especially think it is important for educational institutions to teach its children that reasonable minds can disagree and disagree with respect and civility. As the authors state, ""Having people around us who are willing to disagree with us is a gift.""Four stars and highly recommended."

Have we developed a culture that is obsessed with emotional safety..not just safety from car accidents or assault, but safety on college campuses from lectures who are too conservative or too liberal, safety from winning or losing (lets just do participation trophies), safety from Victories (does calling someone a Valedictorian make others feel bad). These kids are just too fragile.Peanut allergies were rare in the 1990's. Everyone ate peanut butter and jelly- right? Jump ahead, and it seems every child has a peanut allergy. Why-- precisely because parents were instructed to avoid exposure to peanuts and peanut products. A new study shows that only 3% of kids who are exposed to peanuts at a young age will develop allergies, but a whopping 17% will develop peanut allergies who avoid all exposure. Same thing goes for kids who avoid outdoor play and never get exposed to the microbes in the dirt. Doesn't it seem like the helicopter parents and the snowblower parent's kids have more allergies?? 2 stars. Prepare the child for the path, not the path for the child...as the saying goes. "
258,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69405631-steve,4,"Haidt writes so reasonably that I find it hard to disagree with him. It’s been a long time since I was in college so I do wonder whether he puts too much emphasis on extreme examples. And whether he is too quick to frame the debate in a binary way. Is speech never violence? My wife pointed out that the current college generation grew up online where speech is routinely used to torment others around the clock. It makes sense that many students desire a safe space away from the online world where they spend so much of their lives. However, I strongly agree with Haidt that in our current political and social media climate we are too quick to frame discussion as a battle between people who are good and people who are evil, reducing discussion to weaponized soundbites. Watching online clips of students shouting down faculty, it often looks less like a social justice movement and more a blind grab for power and revenge. Reading other reviews of this book led me to look into the (stupidly-named) Intellectual Dark Web movement and to think more about Classical Liberalism and the possible limits of Post-Modernism. More reading to do . . . "

The authors did a good job identifying three faulty beliefs that cause the behavior we are seeing in schools and college campuses today. 1. What doesn't kill you makes you weaker.2. Always trust your feelings.3. Life is a battle between good people and evil people.Their reasons for how we arrived at this point and how to correct it seemed simplistic. They made an effort to be politically and ideologically neutral but I didn't read far before I was stumbling over examples and explanations where my worldview did not align with theirs. For example, they felt that more states should pass laws ""allowing"" parents to make decisions about what age their children can be out in the neighborhood without adult supervision. From my perspective, that the state would find it necessary to pass a law addressing this issue is alarming! But apparently, several states have.The authors have a fairly comprehensive summary at the end of most chapters which are worth reading first before deciding if you want to delve into the whole chapter. The book was interesting in that it gave me some insight into people who think and draw conclusions differently than I do."

On the one hand, the authors make a convincing argument to the so-called “coddling” of the title, based on a lot of research. Yet, in my 20 years of teaching college (a stone’s throw from UC Berkeley, no less) and interacting with high school kids via 826 Valencia, I’ve never experienced a whiff of what the authors speak of. Just dumb luck? Or is it because I teach at an art school? Or is my liberal bubble more impermeable and monochrome than I suspect? Certainly I’ve been privy to increasingly anxious kids—though it’s understandable these days with the increased competition and amplification of everything by social media. Hell, I’M pretty nervous these days. But they’re also more socially engaged than I ever was at their age. Yes, they didn’t have my free range childhood, and, yes, maybe they should go out a bit more on the weekends. But they seem far from the isolated reactionaries described in this book. So while I agree with the majority of what is being said here, I have some doubts to if this is as widespread an iGen issue as the book perpetuates. "

I enjoyed the information presented within as it was clear, easy to understand, and straightforward. I also enjoyed the (mostly) non-partisan political take on the situations which were presented inside of the text. There was only one section which I disagreed with and it was when the author presented the idea of children being able to take recess without adult supervision. My initial thought was to consider children who might face bullying as a result. Then the issue of bullying was addressed but in generalities. Although the theory was proposed, there weren't any detailed plans on how to deal with the potential issues said theory might present.Other than that, I do believe the three untruths presented:1. Always trust your feelings2. That which doesn't kill me makes me weaker3. Us vs. Themwere all clearly refuted and shown to be very prevalent in today's youth. I echo and applaud the premise that children aren't nearly as fragile as we have been taught to believe."

Take Peterson's main point and erase his reactionary mumbo-jumbo (e.g. like Jordan's thoughts that Disney's Frozen is feminist propaganda or that women wearing make-up to work invite sexual harassment) and what you have left is this very timely book on the current state of thought in which words can really hurt me. Framed around three great untruths and their classic counterparts from thinkers like Buddha and Alexander Solzhenitsyn the authors show what really seems to be going on in our culture of ""safetyism"" where opposing viewpoints are considered dangerous. Untruth 1: What doesn't kill you makes you weaker. It's counterpoint is ""Prepare the child for the road, not the road for the child."" Untruth 2: Always trust your feelings. Countepont 2: Your own worst enemy cannot harm you as much as your own thoughts, unguarded (Buddha) . Untruth 3: The world is divided into good and evil people. Choose a side. Counterpoint to 3: The line dividing good and evil cutes through the heart of every human being (Solzhenitsyn). This is part sociological text, part self-help, part political text, and it stays scholarly and even-handed throughout. And it even made me see how I have done some things wrong and gave me ways to improve myself (making one doubt oneself is a sign of a fine book). I don't think it's a book that will be totally relevant in 20 years, but it's perfect for right now.

Anyone with eyes to see and a brain to think could have written this book.However, it’s really nice to see someone calling bullshit, especially in the midst of today’s “call-out culture”. And right now the world, especially humanities academia, is truly loaded chock full of insidious, dangerous, quasi-totalitarian politically correct bullshit.

Unfortunately, this ridiculous rot is spreading from universities to everyday life, and it won’t be long before even normal people won’t know what truth is, and the ability to sustain critical inquiry will be lost forever.

The coddling of kids combined with an obsession with safety, has led to a generation of young adults in college that have a psychotic level of groupthink. The group is like a cult, and inclusion is their dogma. Anyone who dares speak out or question it is immediately shot down and intimidated into silence. I have witnessed this first hand when I saw Ben Shapiro speak on the USC campus. How is this to the benefit of universities and their students? Universities are supposed to value free thought, speech, and diversity of ideas. Now it is one idea that dominates, and anything that goes against that idea is destroyed by the group. We need stronger leadership in universities. Less parenting, more unsupervised play, and less time on social media.Do society a favor and raise your kids to be self reliant and resilient, and to favor a culture of dignity rather than a culture of victim hood.

The book really helped me understand what underpins much of our current way of thinking, and particularly that of the generation after mine (which the book terms the ""iGen"", for those who grew up with smartphones).If you find yourself wondering why we're seeing more demands on college campuses for controversial speakers to be disinvited, or why you may feel more hesitant today to question cultural wisdom lest you end up demonised, this book may be informative. It was also a robust defense of the importance of academic freedom, freedom of speech, and even the importance of raising children in such a way that they are prepared for the road ahead (rather than ""preparing the road for the child"").The book also took a more gracious tone than I expected, which was very good."

What was best about it, in my opinion, was its very even handed, broad social criticism. It was not particularly kind to liberal progressives and those who practice today's very toxic type of identity politics. It was also not particularly kind to conservative reactionaries, and those on the right whe practice their own type of identity politics.This was a very grounded, scientifically referenced evaluation of ""where we went wrong"" along the way, and why kids that are going through college right now have been set up for failure. Not of their own doing. Not their own fault. But failed by us as we raised them through a series of mistakes that were all born of a desire to protect, and do good by our children.There's a lot to think about here, and it is presented in a very digestible way.

Rather, it is reinforcing three great untruths in a comfortable and unchallenging environment, focused on encouraging intellectual laziness...intellectual drift is occurring. The three great untruths are 1)What doesn’t kill you makes you weaker, 2)always trust your feelings and 3) life is a battle between good people and evil people.If left unchecked, buying into these untruths can lead to poor mental hygiene/habits. Interestingly enough, these poor mental habits are catastrophizing, emotional reasoning, dichotomous thinking, over generalizing, labeling, blaming and negative filtering...all of which are what many therapeutic interventions try to mitigate. In a sense, by perpetuating these poor mental habits, we are creating a public mental health epidemic.Haidt pitches that there are three virtues that can be easily used as guiding principles in mitigating this epidemic. 1) intellectual courage, 2) humility and 3) emotional resilience.In the final part of the book and in the appendix, he provides resources and a framework on how to implement these virtues for both young adults and children. Solid observations, presented from a psychological framework with easily implementable ways forward."

These are not conservative pundits railing against social justice warriors-they are self described as liberal/left leaning, yet they can see trends on and off college campuses that come from well intentioned ideas but are detrimental to building resilience, critical thinking, open mindedness, civic discourse, and even good mental health. The context with cognitive behavioral therapy is quite interesting and was new to me.

I found myself wondering about the political leanings of the authors, because so much of the book deals with political issues, and was a bit surprised to find that they both supposedly lean left. (Incidentally I think this disclosure should have appeared at the beginning of the book; it was a bit odd to find it in the middle.) I find this book to suffer from false equivalency at times. For example:""With the rise of the alt-right and white nationalism since 2016, more scholars are writing about the ways in which emphasizing racial identity leads to bad outcomes in a multiracial society. It has become increasingly clear that identitarian extremists on both sides rely on the most outrageous acts of the other side to unite their group around its common enemy.""ON BOTH SIDES. I probably don't have to tell you that this reminds me of a certain president's response to a white nationalist rally in which a woman was murdered by a car-wielding ""identitarian extremist."" To my knowledge, no radical leftists have terrorized entire groups of people through violence and hate speech. To talk about both sides as being essentially equivalent here is simply incorrect.I read the parts about college campuses (most of the book) with great interest. I was shocked to learn of the extreme reactions by students to seemingly innocuous statements by faculty members, and it is good to know that there are people out there (like the authors of this book) looking out for their legal rights and supporting free speech. As a professor on the cusp of being a Millennial, with an arts doctorate, who has worked as a staff member at a college, and is a mom, I sympathize just about equally with the faculty, administration, students and parents. I don't enjoy the ""get off my lawn"" or ""kids these days"" mentality about this generation because really... we've been here before, with previous generations and TV and video games, and kids for the most part keep growing up into competent adults. But the statistics about depression, anxiety and suicide are alarming and it is these statistics that provide the book with its strongest argument that something new is happening, and it's probably mostly due to the effects of smartphones and current parenting trends.So I didn't enjoy the libertarian bent of ""both sides-ism,"" and I also felt the book suffered from a truly bad introduction and was unnecessarily repetitive. Do I really need a summary after a 20-page chapter telling me what you just told me? No, I'm not 12 and I can glean the important points myself."

(And anyone who is a beloved Harry Potter fan would never have fallen for the third untruth, especially.) The percentage of the national population that actually attends (and graduates) the ivy league schools that Greg and Jonathan focus on is so small and it's hardly a description of the ""American"" mind.

A small criticism I have is their presentation of cognitive behavioral therapy as a tool against personal frailty. CBT is certainly an effective tool, but in the book I felt it was presented a little too prominently and a bit beside the point (to analyze the problem and present societal or organizational-level solutions, rather than advocate for one or other tool in the psychotherapists' tool bag).That being said - all Americans need to read this book.

I have been trying to figure out what happened since my children graduated high school, this gives an interesting opinion to that question. Everyone needs to read this book, especially if you have children! So many issues, when broken down, with examples and data, are explained. I was saddened by many of the examples of higher ed colleagues loosing their position or worse being physically attacked for doing what they were hired to do. We need to let our children explore the world, all of it, good and bad, to give them the tools to function as adults. I will add that I listened to this as an audio book, which I do believe made it easier to digest. "

I am walking away both encouraged that someone is tackling the problems of thinking on the college campus in such an insightful and well-researched way and discouraged at the present state of the college campus and the trends we are seeing there and among the iGen generation in particular. It was scary, gripping and hopeful all at the same time. I would recommend this for anyone working with college students or youth. More surprisingly, I would recommend this for any parent as well. My tendency as a parent to overreact and overprotect was challenged in some very needed ways. "

Three quotes that enlighten the reader and summarize the wisdoms of this book are listed here: “Prepare the child for the road, not the road for the child”, “Your worst enemy cannot harm you as much as your own thoughts, unguarded. But once mastered, no one can help you as much, not even your father or your mother”, and “The line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being.” As an educator, I highly recommend this book, as an edifice of truth, to anyone responsible for helping shape this next generation.

Rather than condemning the oversensitivity on college campus on ideological grounds, Lukianoff and Haidt provide evidence as to why this type of mentality is not conducive to our well-being. Haidt and Lukianoff defend this position by honestly representing the opposition and digging deep in attempting to diagnose the genesis of this new phenomenon. It's a must-read for anyone who is about to step foot on campus for the next few years of their lives as it presents a challenging argument as to why they should reevaluate the claims that has been spewed consistently by the oversensitive brigade who think they are acting in the best interest of society.

The cult of ""safety-ism"" is stunting the minds of American children in insidious ways. While the right loves to lambast leftist ""snowflakes"" on college campuses, the authors here are actually left-leaning themselves and they show how these dangerous trends are truly a bipartisan issue. I thought this was a well-argued and politically balanced book. I highly recommend it."

The authors’ hypothesis makes sense, but I feel there's more to that. Downsides: Very focused on American campuses, while it seems that the problem is widespread (and not only in the US), so I would have liked to hear why. A lot of the evidence (and there’s a lot) is anecdotal, but then again I'm not sure how else you'd argue your case (surveys are used often, but hard to know samples and methodology)."

The issue addressed of coddling of students from kindergarten on up to college is well laid out with evidence and examples throughout. 2. I wasn’t sure where the authors fell politically through most of this book until they came out and stated their political ideas and beliefs. It was very well balanced citing examples from the left and the right which was very refreshing. 3 I think parents should read this book. You may or may not agree with all of it, but there are probably a few ideas here and there which will help you raise your children to be strong, well informed and antifragile adults. Highly recommend "
291,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69494865-miri-niedrauer,5,"I'll admit that based on the title, I began this book bracing to force my way through an extremist right-wing rant about snowflakes.I was happily wrong in my initial impressions. I find that the authors take the moderate, middle-ground approach that our extremely divided nation needs, to a number of taboo topics such as identity politics and the catastrophizing that we often see in the current cultural climate. The concept that opposing ideas are dangerous, even ""violent"", is the truly dangerous idea and we as a society must take strides to eliminate the war on the 1st amendment before its too late. I strongly recommend this book to anyone and everyone who is willing to read it with an open mind. "
292,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15963617-angela,4,"This book is definitely worth every second I spend reading it.I love the reasoning behind the book itself, the points it made and the audio-book gives a whole different feel in and of itself.Sometimes I found the the examples a bit gruesome but I found them necessary in order to bring the point across. I had a slight issue with the number of examples though (the point was already clear by example #2 and the authors were still going), it took away from the experience as a whole.I would be listening to the book while commuting to and from work and at times I would reach my house or workplace and I would realized that no new point had been made in almost over an hour thus I had to subtract a star even though I thoroughly enjoyed the book.I recommend the audio book to get the full experience."
293,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21719305-sarah-ford,2,"I loved the three untruths and the cognitive advice, but felt that the book was weakened by its narrow focus. As I read, I noted many places where the same critiques the authors make of lefty college kids could be rightly leveled at lots of other groups as well. For example, the examples of irrational fear, the division of the world into good and evil, etc, applies to anyone in a cult, anyone in an echo chamber, conspiracy theorists, even some mainstream religions. Yet the book never uses any of these as examples, but applies the 3 lies framework ONLY to college students. To me, it felt like this book really wanted to critique a certain group of people (“leftist” college students) and so it laid out an admittedly unhealthy set of behaviors that applies to multiple groups of people but then ONLY discussed examples of it at colleges among young people and ignored the fact that older people fall into the same mental traps."
294,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1088367-anna,4,"This book definitely provoked me to think about now common-place ideas in liberal ideology and how they are affecting the young minds of today. I'm not sure I would agree with their thoughts on microaggressions and the culture of safetyism, but I do think it is interesting to reevaluate how these ideas have caused certain patterns of extreme behavior on college campuses. The authors do use a few extreme cases to generalize to a pattern as a whole, so as a reader I think you have to be careful to take their claims with a grain of salt and be wary of over-generalization. Overall, I would say this is a super interesting read and I'm glad that the ideas they're wrestling are written from a liberal/moderate perspective because I think that prevents the reader from thinking about these issues strictly as liberal vs. conservative."
295,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60654108-george-cook,5,"Flew through this audio book. I think it has an extremely interesting premise of how young people are being raised to believe ""untrues"" and how these are the opposite of what you are taught in congntive behavioural therapy. Haidt goes on to explain how these untrues have led to extreme political polarisation and to the current cancel and call out culture and how these new cultures damage the mental health of us all, especially the youth. I don't agree with everything he says but as he says in the book that is extremely useful. We are scared to read or discuss or even think about views that differ to our own or the norm. The book also wraps up with points about how over protective parenting and lack of unstructured play is damaging the youth and what we can do about it."
296,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63719582-kenny-williams,5,"Really enjoyed this book. I think it addresses several issues that Generation Z or the iGen are experiencing as they grow up and go to college. It takes into account how growing up has changed with the arrival of the smart phone and with social media, and how these changes along with others has shaped a generation. It also has several clear critiques of that generation and gives clear solutions for shaping a society that is resilient, reasons well, and listens to and respects differing opinions."
297,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1633138-jake-watts,4,"Solid book. Worth reading as a parent, leader or anyone that interacts with young adults (and frankly adults) who suffer/believe/live/promote the three great untruths this book elucidates. Untruth of Fragility: What doesn’t kill you makes you weaker (retreat from hardship and difference)Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: Always trust your feelings (emotional intuition trumps reason and truth)Untruth of Us vs. Them: Life is a battle between good people and bad people (I am good; they are bad)The ideas and approaches in this book will most definitely inform my parenting, community and corporate leadership and involvement and my engagement online. Very much worth the read. "
298,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48357187-katherine-congleton,5,"Really compelling take on the various factors contributing to the current climate on college campuses today. But, I find it difficult to swallow the authors’ argument that words are not inherently unsafe, or that safety should only be applied to physical, not emotional, spaces. Two white, male, relatively privileged authors can easily say that college students today shouldn’t take microaggressions so offensively. I would like to hear from those who experience offensive language more often before fully submitting to the authors’ take. "
299,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52157730-kristi-elker,5,"My husband and I read this aloud and discussed it together. This is a book about what it looks like for us to be good neighbors, good citizens, and good humans who are charitable in their interactions. It also helps to outline some of the ideas that have driven a culture of fear, which has led to the polarization of our country. The authors give recommendations of how individuals can start to turn the tide. We think that this is an important book for all humans to read. We’re all in this together."
