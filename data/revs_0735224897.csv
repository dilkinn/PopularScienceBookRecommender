0,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1045774-mehrsa,2,"This is a very narrow and small-minded book parading as a big thoughtful one. It says it is about the American Mind, but the data and the theory only support ""the coddling"" of a very narrow subset of the American mind: upper middle class college kids born after 1995 that got to college in 2013. As far as that group is concerned, this is really good advice. I totally agree with his three untruths--your feelings are not necessarily true, the world is not good and evil, and adversity does not make you weak. I also agree that children need lots of free play and that social media is bad for kids and they are over-protected. There is nothing to disagree with here (even though I sometimes chafe at ""when we were kids..."" arguments)HOWEVER, using this group's specific problems, the authors make vast over-generalizations. The few anecdotes highlighted are meant to be examples of a deeper problem, but to me, they are the sum total of the problem. Left leaning students are behaving very badly toward conservative speakers. At most, there are 10 or so highly publicized events that seem to play on a loop among conservatives and intellectual dark web types. And there are no defenses to these behaviors, but it hardly represents our nation. And they provide no data whatsoever that it does. It's too soon to even tell that the next generation will be like this one.And for people who seem to care a lot about both sides arguments, they seem to leave out a lot of counter-examples. Here are a few: 1. They talk about the metoo movement once in the beginning. Is that not a product of this ""call out"" generation? None of us ""old"" women had the ""balls"" to speak truth to power like these young women do. Good for them.2. And the Parkland teens and all the ways in which this generation is more compassionate and engaged than we were. My generation (I'm 40) thought it was cool not to care about anything. My middle school kid stays up after school making protest signs and watching political debates. Is that not progress?3. The authors also focuses on one particular subset of an entire generation (left-leaning, and mostly women and LGBT or Trans students asking for safe spaces). They leave out that Gamergate and the trolls and the alt right are also made up of this generation. Why not talk about them at all? Seriously. They are literally the same age and except for one aside in the entire book that ""the right does it too"" there are no examples at all of the right doing the thing they are decrying. It seemed like a half-assed ""both sides"" argument without support.4. Do you know how many books I've read written by old people decrying the hippie generation of the 60s (Alan Bloome's Closing of the American Mind is an example)? Bloome was talking about Haidt and Luianoff. Boy do they grow up fast. 5. It makes me sad that more people will read this book than will read books highlighting actual big problems like inequality. The authors give a nod to the fact that inequality should definitely be remedied, but they would rather you do it the right way and not call it ""social justice."" Again, I agree with all the parenting advice and the cognitive behavior advice, but this is not a self-help book. It's meant as a polemic and it strikes at the wrong target."
1,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24035606-ryan-boissonneault,5,"Imagine that you want to start a fitness program to increase your strength and endurance and sign up at the local gym. Upon arrival, you notice that management has removed all of the weights, concerned that heavy weights can cause stress and injury. Instead, you are instructed to perform light body-weight exercises that you can already safely handle. As you go through the motions of exercise, progress is nonexistent and you’ll be entirely unprepared for any activities that might require greater strength and endurance. Welcome to (some) modern universities, which engage in the intellectual equivalent of removing the weights from the gym by creating safe spaces, disinviting speakers, removing offensive material, and inhibiting free speech and inquiry that should be the staple of a college education. Attending a university with these policies to prepare for the challenges of the outside world is like training for a marathon in our weightless gym. The analogy is apt because the human mind, like the musculoskeletal system, is antifragile. Whereas fragile systems break under pressure and resilient systems can withstand pressure without change, antifragile systems become stronger under pressure. If you want to enhance your physical strength, you have to lift progressively heavier weight; if you want to enhance your intellectual fortitude, you have to expose yourself to different and sometimes controversial or offensive ideas. This is the topic Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt tackle in The Coddling of the American Mind. They frame the issue around the “three great untruths” that are promoted on some campuses across the US, which are creating an environment that not only blocks open inquiry and learning but that leads to polarization, emotional immaturity, fragility, violence, and mental illness. The three untruths are 1) what doesn’t kill you makes you weaker, 2) always trust your feelings, and 3) life is a battle between good people and evil people. These three untruths, taken together, create a student body that is unreceptive to other viewpoints, dogmatic, easily offended, and self-righteous, eager to earn points within the group by calling out and ostracizing those with different views. The great untruths are damaging both socially and psychologically, and run counter to both the principles of cognitive behavioral therapy (used to treat anxiety and depression) and ancient wisdom regarding well-being and happiness. The great untruths therefore lead to the types of mental habits that our best therapy aims to eradicate, such as catastrophizing, emotional reasoning, overgeneralizing, dichotomous thinking, labeling, blaming, and negative filtering. Universities are encouraging, in other words, the very habits that lead to anxiety and depression and emotional stunting. The authors dive deeply into these issues in the first two parts of the book and then describe the historical, social, psychological, and political reasons why we find ourselves in this situation. The fourth and final part of the book offers solutions, which I would summarize as follows. The problems on campus can ultimately be solved by focusing on developing the virtues of intellectual courage, humility, and emotional resilience in our children and students. First, intellectual humility forces one to recognize that humans are fallible and prone to bias and error, both individually and collectively. Since we are often blind to our own errors, the only possibility of correcting our misjudgments is through exposure to competing ideas. As the authors put it, exposure to someone that disagrees with you is a gift. They can either change your mind, thus correcting your errors and biases, or else strengthen your own beliefs in the process of defending them. The second virtue, intellectual courage, is the habit of pursuing the truth wherever it may lead and embracing the values of free speech and open inquiry. It’s the recognition that you may be wrong, that you may not have all of the answers, and that the development of your intellect depends on defending your ideas against competing views rather than shutting them down through force or violence. The third virtue, emotional resilience, is the habit of handling adversity appropriately and taking control of your own emotions and reactions. Words are not violence, and being offended does not count as a point or an argument. This reminds me of three quotes by Christopher Hitchens that captures the spirit:— “If someone tells me that I've hurt their feelings, I say, 'I'm still waiting to hear what your point is.’”— “In this country, I've been told, 'That's offensive' as if those two words constitute an argument or a comment.”— “Those who are determined to be ‘offended’ will discover a provocation somewhere. We cannot possibly adjust enough to please the fanatics, and it is degrading to make the attempt.”The best defense against false or immoral ideas is rigorous intellectual debate and criticism, and the censorship of ideas only makes those ideas more appealing to your opponents and to those who are never exposed to the proper criticisms. Shouting down a speaker is immature and intellectually and emotionally cowardly and has no place within a university. If you want to call yourself a liberal, you should have no problem winning the war of words with religious fundamentalists or racists without having to suppress their speech. Sticking with the Christopher Hitchens theme, can you imagine if, instead of engaging in dozens of debates with religious conservatives, he instead called for their speech to be suppressed? How much weaker and ineffective would his position have been? As the authors point out, this is not happening at every university, and there is some debate as to whether or not this is as big of problem as it appears. In fact, it might not be; but it’s important to get out in front of the issue before it becomes a bigger problem. The authors cite some fairly egregious examples from a handful of universities, but also note that there are many exceptions. In particular, the University of Chicago remains a leader in free speech and inquiry and published the Chicago Statement on Principles of Free Expression, which every college student and parent should read. Over 40 institutions have adopted this policy, and hopefully more will follow suit."
2,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4622890-emily-may,2,"I saw Jonathan Haidt speak on Real Time and he seemed like an intelligent guy with a lot of interesting ideas, so I patiently waited for this book to become available at my library. I'm also curious about this notion of kids being overprotected or ""coddled"". It's looking more and more like the developed world's need to protect its kids, wrap them in bubble wrap, and disinfect everything might be the cause of a variety of unsavoury things, from Berkeley banning speakers to the rise in childhood leukemia. I don't necessarily agree with all the authors' ideas - such as their thinly-veiled disdain for feminists who talk about rape culture - but I do think they make some important points.The truth is, though, this essay-turned-book should really have just stayed an essay. The authors' three Great Untruths make a thoughtful opinion piece, but there's not a full-length book hidden in the idea. The result of them trying to extend their commentary to a modest 269 pages is a lot of repetition, weak graphs that demonstrate a very small number of people doing a very small number of things, and odd tangents. An example of this latter is the lengthy instruction in how to do Cognitive Behavioural Therapy.A lot of the ""evidence"" is anecdotal, and focuses on a few extreme cases. Perhaps these are indicative of a larger trend, but I don't see anything in this book to convince me of that. I guess I should have just read the article this book grew out of.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube"
3,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"This is a fascinating but very disturbing book about how college students have recently been caught in the three great untruths. The first untruth is that one's feelings are the best guide to correctness. The second is that one should avoid pain or discomfort; what doesn't kill you makes you weaker. And the third untruth is that one should find fault in others, and not in one's self.This book is not about helicopter parents, although they certainly contribute. It is about a new culture of safety-ism. In this culture, one should always seek safety, even emotional safety. If someone says something to you that makes you uncomfortable, then what he says is unsettling, harmful, and the person who said it is evil. Each person is either good or evil, and there is no middle ground. And, if someone says anything that makes you feel uncomfortable or stressed, then that person is evil.From time to time, we hear about college students who protest speakers who have been invited to give talks on unsettling subjects, or who have unpopular viewpoints. The college administration is then pressured to retract the invitation, even though the speech is bound to be a learning experience for all. Sometimes a faculty member tries to help a student, is sincere and respectful, but a student takes the attempt the wrong way. The student raises a big stink, characterizes the instructor as harmful and therefore evil. Other faculty members secretly agree with the instructor, but are scared of voicing their dissenting opinions. The college administration is cowed into placating the students, and is not true to the mission of a college.What is the purpose of a college? While some would argue that a college's purpose is to teach skills, an equally important purpose is to prepare students for their post-college life. After college, people are exposed to all sorts of viewpoints, including both good and obnoxious points of view. An important purpose of a college is to inoculate its students, to make them stronger for the future. The best way to do that is to expose students to differing points of view, even unsettling ideas, so that students can become more critical thinkers and not over-stressed by people of other persuasions.Many years ago I went to a public university, and heard invited speakers give talks that were very controversial. Students who didn't want to hear these speakers always had the option not to attend. They did not protest against the speakers, depriving others of a learning opportunity. It was that simple.This book takes the reader on a journey through recent events on college campuses. These events are extremely disturbing, and made me sick that today's students, teachers, parents, and college administrators are often so weak-minded. They have lost their way, and forgotten that while physical safety is absolutely important, emotional safety is not necessarily bad for one's health. But now I have a better understanding of what is happening in college campuses today.I didn't read this book--I listened to the audiobook, which is narrated by one of the authors, Jonathan Haidt. He is an exception to the rule--Haidt is an amazingly good reader, and I truly enjoyed listening to his narration."
4,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3536004-jenna,4,"Education should not be intended to make people comfortable; it is meant to make them think."" ~Hanna GrayI'm not sure how to begin this review other than to say it was both interesting and disturbing. Having read iGen: Why Today’s Super-Connected Kids Are Growing Up Less Rebellious, More Tolerant, Less Happy--and Completely Unprepared for Adulthood--and What That Means for the Rest of Us, I was somewhat aware of what is taking place in universities across the US. The authors of ""The Coddling of American Minds write a similar book but giving many more examples of the erosion of free speech on campuses. I'm flabbergasted! How can universities, the very places where freedom of speech was most protected, now be censoring both professors and students in order to not offend anyone? In order to not ""harm"" students with ideas? Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt explain why this is taking place, how we have turned into a culture of fragility and over-protection. It is one thing to not allow hate speech, hateful and truly harmful ideas, as the authors are quick to point out, but quite another to suppress any view that might go against what students believe, in order to not ""harm"" them by exposing them to alternate points of view. Why are universities firing professors for bringing up ""hot"" issues? Why are they banning controversial speakers? Why are they limiting what even the students can say? It all starts with over-parenting and treating children as fragile things that cannot withstand anything. Of course, this comes from a good place -- a good parent does not want their child to be hurt and wants to protect them from all harm. I'm not a parent but I can understand that. We don't want those we love to be hurt or suffer. However, we as society have gone too far, from ""protecting"" our children from peanuts and thus greatly increasing the number of children with deadly allergies to them, to protecting them from alternate views and conflicting ideas. We don't allow children to grow if we keep them from being exposed to things that challenge them. The authors say that children are not fragile, but anti-fragile. We need to protect them from serious harm of course, but by coddling them and treating even teens as young children, we are hurting their future prospects and making it more difficult for them to succeed in the adult world. The authors cite numerous examples of this overprotection, both of young children and extending onto college campuses. They list 3 Untruths that now often govern how children are raised and are causing them to be more anxious and depressed than previous generations:•The Untruth of Fragility: ""What doesn't kill you makes you weaker.""•The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: ""Always trust your feelings.""•The Untruth of Us Versus Them: ""Life is a battle between good people and evil people.""  The 3 criteria for an idea to be classified as an Untruth are:•""It contradicts ancient wisdom.""•""It contradicts modern psychological research on well-being.""•It harms the individuals and communities who embrace it.""I will not expand on these in my review but highly recommend the book for any who is interested. I would like to say though, that I do not wholly agree with the first criteria, that of something being untrue in part because it contradicts ancient wisdom. I would argue that just because something has always been held ""true"" doesn't mean it is. In fact, just because something has always been held true is reason in itself to challenge the assumption. Society would make no progress if ""truths' were never questioned, and each generation merely accepted what the prior ones said. We would still be burning people at the stake, still be stoning people to death for adultery, still be cutting off hands for the theft of bread, still be enslaving people (well, we are in a way, if you look at the prison industry in the US, but that's for another discussion), still be locking up gay people. Sometimes we NEED to contradict ancient wisdom. That said, I mostly agree with this book and the assertions put forth by the authors. I think there is a fine line at times between hate speech and free speech and I'm still not sure where the line needs to be drawn. Drawn it must be; people must be protected from those who would harm them and incite violence against them. However, people do not need to be protected from merely hearing differing points of view, ie a young person who is taught creationism at home is not emotionally harmed by learning about evolution in a school setting (where facts are supposed to be taught).As was pointed out to me by a reader of my original (flawed and perhaps somewhat racist or at least racially insensitive) review, ""There is a very important distinction between thinking differently and holding a position that is objectively wrong"". This is true and this is where the line needs to be drawn. And it needs to be drawn by those at whom hateful and false ideologies are directed and who are thus affected by, not by those who are not. The majority cannot dictate what is allowed to be taken as harmful to the minority.Objectively false ideas do not need to be entertained, nor should they be. When it comes to mere differences of opinion though, I love the following advice from the book:
""Argue as if you're right, but listen as if you're wrong (and be willing to change your mind). Make the most respectful interpretation of the other person's perspective. Acknowledge where you agree with your critics and what you've learned from them.""

5,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23195904-radiantflux,2,"97th book for 2018.This again seems like a good article that got bloated unnecessarily into a book. There are some good points about the necessity to develop resilience in children, but with little strong substance to back things up. The arguments seem one-sided and cherry-picked. Reading this book you'd think that snowflake liberal children are rioting on every campus in America. Also the focus of the book is a bit unclear to me: is it a critique of the commercialization of the university system in America, where students have become consumers, or is it a critique of current child rearing practices in the USA? Mostly it seems to be a criticism of a few selectively picked incidents that have occurred over the last year in the America, without giving any credence or context to the aggressive culture wars occurring throughout the USA at this moment. Two-stars."

In case the rating and tags aren’t abundantly clear, this is a *negative* review.	If you slither in here with partisan kvetches about “triggered ““lefties” heaping criticism on poor, picked on bigotry apologists, you will be eviscerated, deleted and blocked. No exceptions.	I’m under no obligation to be polite when I heave assholes out of my house and I’ve no inclination to do so here.	If you’d like to make a case for/extoll the virtues of bigots, kindly pen your own review or hold a political rally in a friend’s review space. 	I’m not here for your counter argumentative analyses or your pitiful, presumptuous attempts to change my opinion on this dreck.	 so, do yourself a favor and find other, more receptive audiences for your “opposing views”; expressing them here is nothing short of boorish and creepy.	Finally, if you are unable to distinguish polite disagreement with a review(hint: this is always welcome here) from trollery (eliminated on sight), it might behoove you to figure out the distinction before commenting.  I'll also refer you to the following; were I to engage you, these would be the responses.https://whatever.scalzi.com/2015/03/0...*************	Holocaust denial, lynching/rape /domestic violence apologia, fundamentalist arguments for misogyny/ the execution of the LGBTQIA population and other flavors of bigotry ought not to be admitted to the clubhouse for ideas worth considering.	More often than not, the folks fighting for such a thing are privileged snowflakes who are themselves triggered by the presence of people from marginalized groups at their university.	They hold repugnant views about some of their classmates and want to regain control of a terrifying reality (Oh nos, teh women’s, teh gays, and teh brown people are invading academia, calling us out and threatening our place atop the sociocultural hierarchy!), one in which their deeply entrenched ideas aren't accepted as universal truths.	The authors and their acolytes are being disingenuous when they claim that the exposure of young people to simple disagreement is the goal.	Ostensibly, they aim to inoculate current and future generations against the deleterious effects of echo-chambers	What they really want is to be back in control of discourse communities and to be treated with the deference they think their ethnicity, faith, and socioeconomic status affords them.My takeaway? Waaaah!!!; we don't get to be publicly racist, sexist, homophobic or transphobic with impunity anymore! Waaaaah, students are exercising their first amendment rights to speak out against antifeminist, pro- lynching, social Darwinist religious fundamentalists who want ""safe spaces"" at their institutions of higher learning! Waaaaaa; groups I hate and with whom I disagree are being heard and taken seriously!Waaaa!!; fewer and fewer people are buying into the socially constructed idea that one permutation of subjectivity is inherently superior to all others.Waaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!; students and teachers (and of course, the lurkers support them in email and in department meetings. LOL!) with toxic and ignorant opinions about entire groups of people continue to conflate free speech with consequence free speech and are shocked and “confused” when they get dragged by the public and made to face professional consequences!	Are some children overprotected? Yes. I agree that this may be a huge problem. In fact, one of the things I appreciate is that my parents never prohibited me from watching horror films or reading violent or ""controversial"" books; E C comics were my favorite.	I especially loved the Judy Bloom books, as she neither sugar coated life’s tribulations nor talked down to her readers.	I also got to run around outside and fight, fall and skin my elbows and knees and wear shorts; no one forced me to sit in the house like “a little lady” and play with plastic emblems of upper-class Western beauty.There were clear rules for play, rules designed to keep my name out of the hat stuffed with those who weren't so lucky. If the chance of a child ending up like Elizabeth Smart, Polly Klaas, Jaycee Dugard or Gina DeJesus is more than zero, why take the risk, particularly if you are in an economically disadvantaged neighborhood and belong to an ethnic group whose children often get ignored by the media when they are victims of crime. Those outside the bubble of privilege know all too well how cops and media regard little brown skinned children who go missing.To continue, should we allow our feelings to take the lead, absolutely not. This is why I abhor those who apply their “feelings” about entire groups of people when making decisions about who deserves to be hired, protected, respected and regarded as human.	And yes, there are ideas and social, political, economic and academic phenomena that are flat out evil. Full stop. The architects and benificiaries of said ideas and phenomena need to wear the shoes they made, no matter how uncomfortable the fit. This is equally true of those who support and facilitate them. 	And I’d like to know how being pummeled with ableist, racist, xenophobic, transphobic, homophobic, religiously intolerant or misogynist vitriol in a classroom setting is supposed to prepare already marginalized people for the real world. Being othered and ostracized *is* their real world, and unlike the more fortunate subjectivities, they didn’t get a preparation period.But maybe the concern isn't so much for *those* groups as it is for straight, white, able-bodied CIS gendered students who might learn to question notions of their inherent superiority. Perhaps that's where the moral panic that underlies this book comes from.	All in all, this is a terrified,defensive and embarrasingly reductive argument for a return to the days when harmful behaviors and the repugnant, taken for granted attitudes from which they sprang were “just the way it was.”"
7,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42147710-michael-shore,2,"The central tenets of this book are good but incredibly repetitive and fluffed up. Towards the end of the book, I wanted to shoot myself everytime I read the word ""saftyism."" The book started out as an article, which explains a lot. It should've stayed an article.Also, the Authors fail to provide compelling evidence in support of their hypothesis that we are facing a generational crisis. They largely backup their sweeping generalizations about ""I-Gen"" with extreme anecdotal cases. The section on mental health included a lot of good data, but that was the exception.Lastly, this book (like many others) seems to be confused about whether it's descriptive or prescriptive in nature. Sure, it can both, but there was a confusing blend of the two that made it feel awkward. For example, there are sections with highly detailed instructions on how to practice CBT which seemed completely out of place given the general thrust of the book."

Its insights into the various developments over the past couple generations(parenting, social media, identity politics) weave a fascinating (if often dispiriting) and comprehensive picture of how we got to the current political climate, particularly on campus. The book is challenging in many respects, while remaining accessible and engaging. I’ll be thinking about it for a long time to come, and hope others will, too."
9,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14526744-robert-miller,5,"There can be little doubt that students entering our colleges and universities for the past several years are traveling to the beat of a different drum. For the most part, many of these young men and women are developmentally challenged in several ways. Their stunted growth is the result of their parent’s upbringing; the students have been coddled by their parents, trained to fear anyone outside of their immediate circles, prohibited from engaging in creative thinking, stopped from normal play activities, subjected to increased study activities following a typical school day (even at the kindergarten level), denied opportunities to explore their neighborhoods without adult supervision (lest they are kidnapped), and the list goes on. The authors explore the negative impact of obsessive “screen time” (I-phones, computers, etc.) use and the pitfalls of social media where (especially girls) are instantly judged and scored. All of these factors have to lead to record increases in reported cases of high anxiety, depression, impatience, intolerance, fragility, and a willingness to harshly judge others who they unreasonably deem to be threatening. These so-called “I-gen” teenagers formulate a culture where it is a “us against them” mentality—there is no middle ground. Speakers at their colleges who express ideologies different from these students are attacked and forced off of college campuses. Members of their group are “called out” and shunned if they deviate from the perspectives of the group. Even liberal professors who write or say something that even slightly hints at a philosophy different from the group are attacked. Administrators often take the coddled students to side out of fear—indeed, some college officials regard students as customers and design cushy and exotic surroundings for students—colleges are in the money business—officials also live in constant fear of lawsuits. Authors Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt write a book that defines the issues and problems of the I-gen and offer possible solutions. Great book."

Against going with your knee-jerk reactions. Against Safetyism.A culture of safety is NOT the same thing as providing a safe physical environment. It should be obvious, but often is not, that having seatbelts in cars is not the same thing as students shouting down speakers on campus, issuing rape and death threats for people speaking of ANYTHING that they don't agree with, or equating social justice with REAL justice.Stopping the KKK and lynchings is Justice. Making a school administrator fear for their lives because they misused a pronoun, or turning the misuse of a specific pronoun into something as nasty as actual physical molestation IS NOT JUSTICE.And yet, people everywhere (and I mean, EVERYWHERE) are getting more and more scared of doxing, public shaming, and anonymous trolling campaigns. It has become an accepted practice to turn anyone of a different ideology into targets of ridicule and slander until both sides have no idea what the hell is going on.What is truth? What happened to the search for truth ANYWHERE? They sum up the book in three main points. 1. We've forgotten the adage of ""What doesn't kill you will make you stronger."" If someone insults you, you ought to ADAPT. If someone betrays you, ADAPT. And yet, increasingly, we're all climbing into our safe ideological niches, surrounding ourselves with ONLY those things we think we can cope with, until nothing else remains except a narrow, narrow worldview. Open up your minds. Broaden your horizons. You don't have to agree with everyone or even anyone, but the experience WILL enrich you.2. Following your feelings is often really, really stupid. We have minds and we must always combat our own biases every single day. Remember when you fussed about a food when you were a kid and then you realized, later, that you loved it? If we always did what our feelings said, (especially for those of us who suffer from depression,) then our suicide rates might jump higher than the death rates of cancer. Oh, and let's not forget... following our feelings when surrounded by a bunch of other fearful and angry people has another term associated with it:MOBS. And we all know that no one is as stupid as all of us together.3. Oh, and we must always look for fault in others. We're never wrong. It's always someone else that has done this to us. This way of thinking could NEVER backfire, of course. Unfortunately, the first two points described above are exacerbating everyone's mental health issues. And let's face it... we have TONS. Rates of murder and violence and abductions are as low as they were in the 60's and yet everyone is growing up coddled and fearful and crazy. We've lost natural socialization, not only in the physical sense (scheduled playdates versus running around and getting into and out of trouble), but also in the amount of screentime we're ALL getting. Children are maturing much, much slower than at any other time and they're unable to cope with the real world. Hell, most of us are.We all need to open up our minds to listen as if we're wrong even while we argue passionately as if we're right.The point is... TRUTH is getting lost in mob mentality. We all need to wake up and get courageous and stand up for our beliefs while simultaneously RETAINING AN OPEN MIND.Otherwise, unofficially, our vaunted love of free speech is now DEAD."

The Untruth of Fragility: What doesn't kill you makes you weaker.2. The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: Always trust your feelings.3. The Untruth of Us Versus Them: Life is a battle between good people and evil people.Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt contend that these three bad ideas constitute a well-intentioned but toxic basis for a campus culture of ""safetyism."" They argue that these ideas contradict ancient wisdom, psychological research on well-being, and are harmful to the individuals and communities who embrace this mindset. Lukianoff, the president of FIRE (Foundation for Individual Rights in Education) and Haidt, a social psychologist perhaps best known for his recent work, The Righteous Mind, began to notice, from 2013 on, an increasing trend of concern on university campuses about ""triggering material,"" efforts to disinvite, or obstruct controversial speakers by heckling or even violence, coupled with reports of increasing levels of anxiety and fears about safety.There seemed to be an increasing perception by university administrators that students were ""fragile"" and needed protection and ""safe spaces."" They noted the priority given to feelings, and that the response to anything that evokes negative emotions is not to consider how one ought think about the external cause, but to simply remove whatever offends or causes stress--be it course material or offensive speakers, or perceived ""microaggressions."" They also noted the framing of the world in terms of a toxic form of identity politics, focused on common enemies rather than common humanity--us versus them, good versus evil.After delineating the contours and problems with these ""three great untruths,"" the authors chronicle a number of incidents in the last five years that they believe result from these often well-intentioned but bad ideas. They chronicle violent outcomes to this thinking at Berkeley after Milo Yiannopoulos was invited to speak with no disciplinary action by the university, and at Middlebury College when controversial scholar Charles Murray attempted to speak and a hosting faculty member suffered a concussion and whiplash requiring six months of physical therapy, in attempts to disrupt the event. Perhaps not as well publicized were the ""witch hunts,"" often against liberal faculty like Erika Christakis at Yale, who objected to an administration's paternalistic instructions about offensive Halloween costumes, suggesting that students might be mature enough to set their own norms. Students called her out as a racist, for creating an unsafe space, and sought her firing. She ultimately resigned. On many campuses, faculty feel they are walking on egg shells, often choosing to avoid anything controversial for fear that it may evoke complaints, or a witch hunt.The authors identify six contributing factors to this culture of safetyism, devoting a chapter to each:1. Rising political polarization, with campuses shifting leftward and increasingly distrusted by those on the right.2. An increase in adolescent anxiety and depression beginning in 2011, significantly correlating to smartphone usage. This group began arriving on campus in 2013.3. Paranoid parenting resulting in far less unsupervised play and greater fears of abduction (even though crime rates for this crime have dropped).4. The decline of free play and the rise of emphasis on test preparation.5. The growth of a bureaucracy of safetyism at universities, driven by federal mandates, risks of lawsuits, and a consumerist mentality, in which students are the consumers.6. The quest for justice, evoked by events between 2012 and 2018 that sometimes focuses on ""equal outcomes social justice"" in which any demographic disparity is assumed to be the result of discrimination, and alternative explanations are themselves considered discriminatory.The authors observe that many of these factors arise from good intentions taken to extremes and are careful to distinguish between legitimate forms of concern (like protecting physical safety) and more extreme forms of safetyism.They conclude with three chapters on wising up, with applications to children, to universities, and to the wider society.  They argue for preparing kids for the road rather than the road for the kids. They propose that our worst enemies cannot harm us as much as our emotional reasoning. And they encourage the recognition that ""the line dividing good and evil goes through the heart of every human being,"" and that we ought be watchful for any institution that promotes a common enemy rather than common humanity narrative. They commend the Chicago Statement (including a version of it in an appendix) that promotes free speech, academic freedom and free inquiry and sanctioning efforts to suppress speech.The authors, particularly Greg Lukianoff, who benefited personally from this approach, advocate for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) that improves mental health and coping skills through recognizing cognitive distortions and maladaptive behaviors, and challenging and changing these. Essentially, they would contend that their ""three bad ideas"" are both cognitive distortions and lead to maladaptive behaviors good neither for the person, nor the university, nor society. Hence, it should be understood that CBT is integral to their critique and recommendations.Working in a collegiate setting, I've seen many of the conditions the authors describe. Most faculty I know readily resonate with the feeling that they walk on egg shells, even while being deeply committed to academic freedom and challenging students thinking. I've seen the growing sensitivity to microaggressions. I've witnessed the surprise when I've suggested that being offended is a choice--that no one can offend us unless we let them, and that there are other options. I have been concerned that universities often seem to be echo chambers for the progressive end of our political discourse, blind to the very practices they excoriate on the right.Given the character of our wider society, it seems the last thing universities should be doing is engaging in the kinds of ""coddling"" Lukianoff and Haidt describe. If we are to have any hope, it will take resilient, anti-fragile people who will engage and keep engaging differing and even off-putting ideas. Most of all, in a climate of us versus them, we need people able to follow the Pauli Murray's principle: ""When my brothers try to draw a circle to exclude me, I shall draw a larger circle to include them."" Here's to drawing larger circles!"

All three untruths can be easily heard and observed in various fields of teaching and higher education environments especially. I have observed them to an increased extent even within my Roman Catholic university employer environments. The last untruth about worldview or ideas being either good/evil is becoming so endemic and evident, not only in education, but in the media language of nearly all bents that I myself, I've become discouraged to the true vitality of proper debate or discussion any longer. What role models too? Only role modeling for closed minded and grim / self-satisfied superiority to judgments of ""evil"" seem to have become predominant and visible. Like anything physical, any muscle or system- if it is not used and tested it goes from weak to weaker. Human endurance and strength toward wide avenues of ideas are no different. This book illuminates the 3 tenets of ""safety"" practices. And what has been the results measured and oftentimes observable.Protection and safety are not harbors for growth. This book will illuminate why that is and what can be measured since safety places and identity politics self-identity mantras have dominated environments of ""learning"". This book defines what has happened and what is observable. And what we see in ""reactions"" to attacks on free speech in the last decade. I could not believe the reaction of DePaul University when Ben Shapiro came to do a speech and question/ answer session in Chicago. (They caved to the mob anger reactions and didn't let him or any of his aides set foot on campus with VISIBLE police/ campus security presence to keep him off. He ended up doing the session at an off campus last minute space rental. I saw the Dean tell him that he would be ""arrested"" if he set a foot on the campus. IN AMERICA!!) And how that administration then censored and allowed the terrible behaviors against free speech to continue, even afterwards in physical and property damage tirades- like babies having a tantrum. In the USA, this lack of regard for the 1st Amendment is disgusting. And it hurts the ""protected"" the most. These tantrums are becoming multiple, multiple. Some of them with anarchy destruction and vile garbage affronts as in the Berkeley repeats. Always negating the 1st amendment base American Constitution premise beyond the human ""failure"" of their violent property or assault crimes. Yes, failure will be the result of swallowing those 3 listed untruths. Especially the last one which composites inherently that every one with different ""eyes"" or avenues to address a solution differently than the ""approved"" line is not opposed or different but just ""evil"" on the good/bad scales of ""group think allowances"".Three ideas (fallacies that are also being role modeled as well) that have been woven into our ""protecting"" American minds:1. What doesn't kill you, makes you WEAKER.2. Always trust your feelings.3. Life is a battle between good people and evil people.Safetyism is pitiable, IMHO. Political correctness ""group think"" judgments a major component and a symptom. This book will detail all the social trends in establishing safetyism throughout youth, childhood etc. in various social and community environments, beyond just the bureaucracies of schooling."

Standing comfortably aside modern intellectual heavyweights such as Jordan Peterson who have critiqued our cultural milieu, I was not the least bit surprised with the message within. However, I was particularly surprised to discover that A: the authors are neither Republicans nor Right-Wing in any fashion (as stated in the book, they’ve voted Democrat their whole lives) and B: That Political Correctness is just one gear in the machine of the world before us.Compounded with Safetyism (which is mind-bogglingly out of place in the safest era in recorded history), For-Profit-Colleges (that want to rope in customers for as long as possible), and a newly mutated ladder in life in which most every aspect of maturity has been delayed, Haidt and Co. have presented a well-rounded picture that is deservingly multi-faceted and complex yet eminently readable and accessible for anyone with an IQ over 90. Given all the source material used, I was pleasantly surprised to read such an enjoyably well written tome that is as pertinent as it is convincing.While I certainly don’t agree with all their politics, conclusions (and even some of the research itself), having found myself working with Millennial peers over the past few years, this book has made me all the more aware of the immense shifts in culture and attitudes that have forged this generation and their values. For the most part, there really is, “nothing new under the sun,” but, for this generation, and the next, a whole host of changes have occurred and will certainly continue to occur and I hope we can have excellent researchers and educators as Haidt and Co. to help us make sense of the complexity before us.Thanks for listening.

A perennial since Plato. The book is deeper much more interesting than that. It is more a call to get over our desire to overprotect the next generation or smother them. Human beings need some sling and arrows in developing to build some resilience. It also is a call to drop some assumptions that have crept into the culture that any frustration, slight, or adversity makes one weaker. This cultivating of hypersensitivity can make later adulting very hard. the second bad idea is to trust your feelings, It may help with destroying death stars in sci-fi movies but can make it really hard to navigate a complicated social world and make dealing with people and life nearly impossible. People often have to check their feelings in real life or they can become wrecks. The third bad idea is that the world is good guys vs. bad guys. This is a prescription for extreme tribalism. These three bad ideas are driving a lot of the craziness of late. I am much farther to the left than the author who I am guessing is a centrist but there is a lot of wisdom in this book."
16,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6689871-justin-norman,5,"When I read Haidt's book, ""The Righteous Mind"", I found it to be the most important book I'd read in years, because it so accurately seemed to capture the central issues liberals and conservatives in America were having communicating with one another. This book zooms in to highlight these issues in even more accurate detail, in great part due to the fact that it was very recently written and published. Some examples: the blocking of political opponents from speaking publicly, the trending lie that if one feels unsafe one *is* unsafe, and the practice of ""common enemy identity politics"" as opposed to ""common humanity identity politics"". While the authors focus their attention on these issues as they appear on college campuses, I see very similar problems in many areas outside of colleges and outside the usual college age range. If I could recommend one political book for my friends to read this year, it would be this one, regardless of where they sit on the political spectrum. It skewers poor, distorted forms of communication using very recent examples, and offers productive suggestions for how to achieve social justice goals in healthier ways."
17,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1500718-ryan,4,"Much as I've come to admire Haidt, I'll admit that I was worried to see this title, which seems like a typical ""culture wars"" click bait. How did the book hold up upon reading it?This is a reasonably argued book about extreme incidents on American college campuses and how they relate to the larger culture. The title is bad, however, because it makes the text at first glance combative in a way that I don't associate with Haidt. (I generally view him as persuading from a pretty easily established common ground, such as when he discusses his use of prozac in The Happiness Hypothesis or how he explains in Righteous Mind that he was motivated by Al Gore's defeat in the 2000 American presidential election to study moral psychology.) In my humble opinion, it is easy to see where Haidt is coming from and why he finds his conclusions convincing. That is true here, even if the title is awful.Briefly, the book worries about a culture of ""safetyism."" There are three ""great untruths"" in safetyism, which are: 1) Fragility: what doesn't kill you makes you weaker 2) Emotional reasoning: always trust your feelings and 3) Us vs. Them: life is a battle between good and evil. They also highlight 10 distorted automatic thoughts, which are: mind reading, fortune telling (negatively predicting the future), catastrophic thinking, labelling, discounting the positive, negative filtering, overgeneralizing, dichotomous thinking, shoulds (""I should do well; if I don't, then I'm a failure""), and personalizing blame. The culture of safetyism does not challenge these distorted automatic thoughts, perhaps because it fears that it will make people feel bad about themselves, which sets off the untruths. As much as I distrust ""great"" anythings in social commentary about the present, I don't think it's hard to understand what they're talking about.For anyone who's reluctant to engage with a book that gives off even a whiff of ""culture wars"" discourse, I'll note that there are other interesting ideas here, such ""concept creep."" Haidt and Lukianoff explain that ""trauma"" originally described physical injury. It was then expanded to psychological trauma, but with the caution that psychological trauma happens in response to extreme situations. The unexpected death of one's spouse from a sudden illness would not qualify as traumatic under the second generation definition. However, the third generation definition now is determined by how the person characterizes the emotion. So if the unexpected death of one's spouse feels awful and the bereaved labels it traumatic, by this definition it is traumatic.As much as I'd like to promote Coddling as more than a book about culture wars questions, it does explore how they play out in Gen Z on college campuses. I was familiar with some of the violent protests the book explored, but not all of them. They really are awful, sometimes obnoxious, to read about. Are they typical of the larger culture or does it just feel like it?I was also surprised by Haidt and Lukianoff's history of how right-wing media outlets respond to anything that even vaguely threatens their worldview. At one point, they discuss a professor's theory about ancient statues--that they were not alabaster white originally but only later aged to those colors. In other words, the ancient world has become whiter in historical accounts. Fascinating! What happened when this theory was reported on right-wing news outlets? Threats of rape and death from people near and far. Let's imagine that we might include Coddling as part of a stack. What else might one read? I'd include Haidt's previous book, Righteous Mind, Ronson's So You've Been Publicly Shamed, and Nagle's Kill All Normies. What about Storr's Unpersuadables, a book that explores things that seem ridiculous and twists them until they seem convincing, or at least not ridiculous. (Russell is also quite good at this in his History of Western Philosophy, perhaps because he feels one should understand why people feel they are right before figuring out why they are wrong.) I've since read Saslow's Rising Out of Hatred, which may be one very effective demonstration of how campuses are not inherently dysfunctional. In it, the college population ostracizes a white nationalist, but some students also reach out to him to try to reverse his views. Maybe Haidt is focusing on atypical scenarios.We are not as good at empathy as we think we are, and it's difficult but worthwhile to charitably study views we are skeptical of. It's perhaps worth noting that I only picked up this book, with its click baity title, because I had a reading relationship with Haidt from his previous work. We live within bubbles that we are hardly aware of.*P.S. Since reading this book, I've heard Ezra Klein talk about these issues on his podcast (It's the Ask Ezra episode, somewhere around 3/4s in.) He is also going to have Haidt on the show--update again: it was interesting."
18,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18181298-tristram-shandy,4,"Never Judge a Book by Its TitleAdmittedly, a title like The Coddling of the American Mind might make you expect of cultural pessimist’s rant on how things in this word, or, preferably, country, are going to pot because people are just no longer what they used to be. And they never will be, any more, so that if you want to keep up with things, there is no alternative but mental potty-training. However, the authors, lawyer and First Amendment expert Greg Lukianoff and psychologist Jonathan Haidt, explain in their introduction how it came about that this rather provocative title was chosen, and if you care to read further than the first few words before indulging in the emotional pleasure of feeling offended, you will find that there is a second title, How Good Intentions and Bad Ideas Are Setting Up a Generation for Failure, which at least gives the other side the benefit of the doubt, by assuming they are being motivated by good intentions.The authors are concerned about the change of the intellectual climate on university campuses with the advent of the iGen students, a development which is marked by calls for safe spaces, trigger warnings, demands to disinvite speakers who voice ideas that may challenge certain students‘ beliefs, thereby making them feel uncomfortable, the establishment of a call-out culture and the spread of the ideology of safetyism. The latter is characterized by the creep-down of the word safety, which is no longer restricted to meaning physical safety but also the more vague concept of safety from unsettling feelings, mental discomfort and doubts, or simply from having to face thoughts, ideas and beliefs which one actually opposes. In short, the climate at universities, but also in society as a whole, has become more and more hostile to the free expression of thoughts that are incompatible with mainstream beliefs.Lukianoff and Haidt make out three ideas or modes of thinking which they hold responsible for this change in attitudes and intellectual climate and which, they say, not only endanger free speech and productive academic discussion but also, in the long run, harm those who embrace them in their daily lives. These bad ideas are1)	What doesn’t kill you makes you weaker. (The Untruth of Fragility),2)	Always trust your feelings. (The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning),3)	Life is a battle between good people and evil people. (The Untruth of Us vs. Them).I don’t want to explain these three detrimental ways of thinking in this short book review, mainly because you might want to read about them yourself in the book discussed here, but also because anyone who has noticed how indignation and public shaming competetions are run in social but also mainstream media knows in a way how these untruths work and how we are heading more and more towards a . Before I go on talking about this book, using these seemingly bad, bad words, it may be well to say that Lukianoff and Haidt are anything but polemical. Instead, they work upon the academic principle of presenting the arguments of the other side in the best light possible, trying to understand the motivations and intentions that lead to ideas and measures they themselves strongly disagree with. There is sound intellectual honesty and fairness at the bottom of this book, which is, by the way, a good example of how to avoid the third of the above-listed untruths, and which is also a prerequisite for starting a real discussion instead of shouting at and vilifying each other.The authors show how the three untruths work in university life where they start to hamper scientific progress and the exchange of ideas and viewpoints but also make it hard, or even impossible, to really prepare students for life. Then they present the sources from which the three faulty ideas sprang, namely the change of the political and social climate as such (e.g. through the rise of a provocation culture and apodictic thinking on both sides of the political spectrum), the rise of depression and anxiety among adolescents and children, the rise of overprotective parenting and the decline of free, unsupervised play due to a culture of safetyism, a „Cover Your Ass“ bureaucracy in schools and universities, and erroneous assumptions about the concept of social justice in modern-day political discussions and governmental acts.At the end of the book, the two authors dedicate a lot of time to showing how some of the fateful developments that lead to the spread of the three untruths can be remedied, one of them being the approach of preparing the child for the road rather than the road for the child, thus making children and adolescents actually stronger. All in all, their criticism and analysis of the three untruths is highly convincing, all the more so as they avoid simplistic finger-pointing and instead treat their subject-matter with an impressive degree of intellectual honesty. This book may be a bit repetitive at times, but on the whole, it really helped me get a better understanding of a trend I have also noticed in my own country, Germany, and which I think is something to worry about."

If you've ever wondered and worried about the worrying trend of people being publically shamed and harassed to the point that they've lost their reputations, careers and sometimes even physical safety just for expressing an unpopular opinion, this book is an absolute must read. It's actually bipartisan and takes a long scathing look at worrying trends from the left as well as the right and really delves deep into how and why these problems exist, why they're getting so much worse and how we can try to fix them.I can't recommend this one enough.

20,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5717792-scott-rhee,5,"I haven’t been on a college campus in about 25 years. Things have changed: I get it. I wasn’t aware, however, until reading Greg Lukianoff and Jonathon Haidt’s book “The Coddling of the American Mind: How Good Intentions and Bad Ideas are Setting Up a Generation for Failure”, how things have changed so terribly.If you’ve followed the news at all in the past couple years, you’ll get a sense of how fucked up things are, but the media doesn’t always capture the whole story, and in today’s politically divisive atmosphere, the media is going to skew facts depending on where one stands, politically: those on the left see its significance overblown and exaggerated by the right, while those on the right see it as a sign of the apocalypse. The truth is, as always, somewhere in the middle.But things are really bad, and Lukianoff/Haidt have spent nearly a decade rigorously studying the whys and wherefores and hows of the whole mess. Their conclusion? Well-intentioned but nevertheless bad parenting, coupled with the rise of social media and roughly three extremely awful ideas that seemed to have permeated our culture as a whole, have created the perfect storm of an overprotected, anxious, depressed, and fragile generation of kids who can’t do anything.Lukianoff/Haidt can pretty much pinpoint exactly when things started going to shit. The year 2013; which is the year when kids born in 1995 started going to college. These kids, known as the iGen (anyone born in 1995 and beyond, during the years in which the Internet basically exploded in popularity), were a generation of kids who have, for the most part, been coddled and protected by smothering, overprotective “helicopter” parents. These are kids who, for the most part, spent most of their childhood indoors in front of a computer screen rather than socializing with other kids the old-fashioned way: outdoors and completely unsupervised, like those of us who grew up in the ‘60s, ‘70s, and ‘80s.For some reason, parents of the iGen instilled in their kids the sense that they were fragile creatures who could be easily hurt, maimed, or killed by anything that made them uncomfortable or frightened. Whether it was walking home from school, going to the mall with friends, watching zombie movies, or listening to speakers who espoused ideas that threatened to jostle their set religious and political beliefs, these kids learned that taking risks and being challenged was a bad thing. Herein lies the first of the three Great Untruths that Lukianoff/Haidt refer to as one of the underlying reasons that kids are the way they are:
The Untruth of Fragility: What doesn’t kill you makes you weaker.
Clearly, this is a reworking of Friedrich Nietzche’s famous aphorism, “What doesn’t kill you, makes you stronger”, which is basically a common theme in most classic literature and philosophy. It is the idea that in suffering and adversity one gain’s an appreciation for life and true consciousness. Seriously, everyone from Fyodor Dostoyevsky to Sigmund Freud has alluded to this idea.Yet, somewhere, somehow, in the late-20th century and early-21st century, this idea got flipped on its head.Lukianoff/Haidt believe that it started out with the best intentions. Parents want their kids to be safe. There’s nothing wrong with that, but when parents started going overboard and sheltering kids from everything out of a misguided belief that keeping kids away from things that could potentially cause injury (physical as well as mental), they were unknowingly creating paranoia and crippling anxiety in their kids.Protecting kids from dangerous objects is one thing. Protecting them from dangerous ideas goes against everything most psychologists and scientists would deem a healthy upbringing: “A culture that allows the concept of “safety” to creep so far that it equates emotional discomfort with physical danger is a culture that encourages people to systematically protect one another from the very experiences embedded in daily life that they need in order to become strong and healthy. (p. 29)” This culture of “Safetyism” that has evolved as a result is what has contributed to college campuses in which students have protested professors, speakers, and other students for saying things that they not only deem “offensive” but also “damaging” to their worldview and belief systems. Conservatives have cruelly dubbed these kids “snowflakes”, but it is simply a natural byproduct of what Lukianoff/Haidt refer to as the second Great Untruth.
The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: Always Trust Your Feelings.
We’re probably all guilty of spreading this one. Some of the blame can be handed to our collective national reactions to 9/11, in which it became an acceptable knee-jerk reaction to report anything suspicious, regardless of how trivial. “See Something, Say Something” was a popular ad campaign in the years immediately subsequent to September 11, 2001.There is something to be said for listening to one’s inner voice sometimes. If you get a bad vibe from your weird uncle or that older kid down the street that’s always trying to lure kids into his house with candy, maybe you should listen to those feelings.Unfortunately, some kids have taken this approach way too far, to the point that anyone who says anything that is deemed “offensive” (a rather subjective label), intentionally or not, is an awful bigoted person who has committed a crime against their person. Needless to say, this does not cultivate a healthy learning environment.This is why the incidents of “disinviting” guest speakers to college campuses has risen in the past few years. It’s why the UC Berkley campus---a college once known as a bastion of free speech---recently erupted in violence by protestors who refused to let guest speakers speak.It goes against everything that a free speech advocate believes in, and the irony is that these students believed that they were protesting in the name of “tolerance”.It also goes against the very idea of education, as expressed by Hanna Holborn Gray: “Education should not be intended to make people comfortable; it is meant to make people think. (p. 51)”Unfortunately, in this toxic atmosphere of political divisions and bitterness, the third Great Untruth rears its head.
The Untruth of Us Versus Them: Life is a Battle Between Good People and Evil People. 
Life isn’t simple, or black and white. There’s a lot of grey areas that can be confusing and uncomfortable to deal with.One of the toughest grey areas to grasp is the idea that no one is completely good or evil, that we are all split down the middle. Unfortunately, an entire generation has apparently grown up to believe the opposite: that there are good people (us) who must constantly, vigilantly, stand up to the forces of evil people (them). In the nineteenth-century, Karl Marx simplified the dichotomy of man by separating people into the bourgeoisie (the capitalists, or rich people) vs. the proletariat (the workers). Today, the split has morphed into liberals versus conservatives, or the Left vs. the Right. There used to be a time when the Left and the Right simply disagreed on issues but managed to remain civil, knowing that neither side was necessarily right or wrong, good or evil, just different. This has changed, especially in the minds of young people. Today, most college students (a vast majority of which tend to lean left) view those on the Right as an enemy; a particularly evil one, too. College campuses, which are predominantly liberal, have made it very difficult for conservatives. Conservative professors have seen a rise in administrations chastising or firing them for seemingly innocuous slights, more often than not interpreted as offenses against a student or students.This has resulted in a stressful “walking on eggshells” by conservatives in an attempt to not garner the wrath of liberal students. It has become so bad that many conservative professors simply remove parts of their curricula that they think students will find “offensive” or simply quit. Neither option is conducive to a healthy learning environment. 
A Simple Fix
Lukianoff/Haidt don’t just examine the problem. They even offer solutions, some of which are so common sense that it is frightening that most parents, teachers, and college administrators haven’t already enacted them. Unfortunately, therein lies part of the problem.While it’s easy to make fun of or even feel pity for these college kids, it’s not always easy to assess blame, especially when the blame rests on all of us: parents, teachers, college administrators, politicians, scientists. Everyone has helped to perpetuate the untruths mentioned here, so it is up to us to recognize what we’ve done wrong and correct it.One way to do that is read this book. Seriously, this book should be required reading for every parent today."

Without struggles and hardship, which, whether we try to avoid them or not، at some point are inevitable in life, we will be unable to become well-rounded people.As the authors contend, a younger generation is now coming of age which, reared in certain institutions, has been raised on an unhealthy expectation of insulation from discomfort. They are likely to become the new elites of society and have an attitude unfamiliar to older generations, as well as people from lower classes (the majority of people). The habits of mind being inculcated to them are ones of catastrophic thinking, emotional reasoning and Manichean moral frameworks. Rather than as a political disagreement, even a fierce disagreement, the presence of unwelcome ideas is being medicalized and described as a threat to people's physical safety and mental well-being. Even wrong words, regardless of intent, are considered as somehow ""violent"" in and of themselves. To put it another way people are being encouraged by certain institutions to be as psychologically weak as possible. The authors identify three ""Great Untruths"" being taught to many young people: that bad experiences make you weaker, that life can be described simply as a battle between oppressor and oppressed classes and that emotional reasoning is something positive. This is bad advice and something like teaching millions of people to do the opposite of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy on themselves. It is inculcating ideas of intense victimhood even in materially privileged people and teaching them at this is a normal way to feel, while also make them hyper-sensitive to perceived signs of disrespect. These attitudes are now slowly trickling down through elite cultural production and also undergoing ""concept creep"" in which old definitional categories of negative social phenomena are slowly and steadily expanding to a wider range of behaviors without anyone knowing where the boundaries are really located. Needless to say this is not a recipe for creating a happy and well-adjusted society.There are certain expressions of language and sociological behaviors among the generation that came just after millennials that are difficult for me to comprehend. This book helped me understand them a bit better. There is also a fascinating (and somewhat disturbing) intellectual lineage going back to the critical theory scholar Herbert Marcuse and an essay he wrote titled ""Repressive Tolerance"" in the 1960s that seems to inform much cultural left-wing discourse today and that also receives some attention here. Some of the sections about ""campus culture"" left me wondering whether previous generations of university students were not also similarly culturally alien to those older than them, but simply aged into more sensible views later in life. This had long been my assumption, though I'm admittedly unsure of the mechanics. In any case, this book helped me understand several things like that which were culturally unfamiliar to me. It is soberly written, reasonable and non-polemic despite its provocative title."

The authors are directing their exposition to the parents of the generation that followed, what they call iGen (internet generation), sometimes referred to as Generation Z. I agree that what they call Three Bad Ideas are bad. Our approach was the opposite. As soon as our kids were old enough, we explained that life was a process of overcoming their fears.I was already familiar with their examples of overreaction on both the Right and the Left from following the news. And have already read many books on the impact of social media on the psyche and social life of users. I agree with the authors that the release of the iPhone in 2007 is a major milestone in all of this.----------Some firsthand reportage from a former dean of students at Stanford....https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/e..."

27,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4781516-eric-morse,5,"This book addresses issues that are defining our age. That is nothing remarkable in itself, unless you realize that these issues and the perspectives shared in this book have become taboo in our identity-saturated culture. What the authors have done is spoken the unspeakable. In so doing, they have nobly spotted the dangers of political correctness, 'vindictive protectiveness', and 'safetyism', and provided a stark warning to educators and laymen alike.Lukianoff and Haidt do not provide the most robust explanation of how we got here, preferring to remain local and focus on the psychological rather than sociological, political, economic, or philosophical. This is to their credit as non-partisan observers. But it does leave the reader hoping for more depth. It is telling that the authors do not mention Allan Bloom's masterpiece precursor to this work, which takes a broader philosophical view and more adequately explains the origins of our problems.So too do the solutions provided leave much to be desired. Most are commonsensical and some are not practical. The intention is good, and they follow the argument, but they leave the reader wondering if there is something more.Still, The Coddling provides a number of valuable insights. The open-eyed reader will be astonished at the richness of the psychological concepts that Lukianoff and Haidt infuse into their narrative: Concept Creep, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Institutionalized Disconfirmation, and Problems of Progress to name a few of the more fascinating ones. Combining these with the plentiful on-campus examples of coddling gone amok, the authors offer perhaps the best summary of our modern university problems to date.Altogether, this book will serve well anyone who is bold enough to face the uncomfortable truth that we are setting up our future generations for depression and failure, and hopeful enough to do something about it."

29,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2574606-edward-sullivan,5,"This urgent, important book should be read by everyone, especially parents and educators. The authors examine the root of divisiveness plaguing American society, the increasing inability of individuals of all political persuasions to engage in rational, intelligent, thoughtfully reasoned debate and dialogue. Complicit in this alarming decline are institutions of higher learning embracing emotionalism over critical and analytical thinking, dialectics, and abandoning their sacred obligation to defend academic and intellectual freedom. Equally complicit are parents who smother their children with overprotection to the point that they are emotionally and intellectually infantilized. The consequences of having a generation unable and/or unwilling to engage intellectually and thoughtfully with ideas that make them uncomfortable are profoundly dire for society, opening the door to forms of authoritarianism across the political spectrum."
30,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81386854-nehrlisa-behrmann,5,The Coddling of the American Mind is a very insightful and fair book. It tackles issues within both the political left and the political right. The book mainly focuses in on college campuses which have become increasingly left-wing but the authors also zoom out and look at the poor reactions from right-wing fringe groups and even mainstream conservatism. The two authors have presented a strong case for free speech and a renewed sense of trust in the American people to be able to sift through different ideas and make smart choices about which ones reign true and which ones prove false. Highly recommend!

32,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28777221-sharad-pandian,3,"If you've been following the fracas on and surrounding American universities, there's nothing new in this book for you.As the title suggests, Jonathan Haidt and Greg Lukianoff argue that American children from the iGen generation (born 1995 or beyond) are raised in situations and using methods unique in ways that make them interpret discomfort as danger. This makes them unable to cope, and harms them and their causes.I. Why this book is a waste of spaceTo understand why this book goes wrong, its important to appreciate a central tension in the way we think about ideas. On one hand, clearly people have been wrong about so much in the past and therefore as Mill suggests we should keep avenues for debate and change always open. On the other hand, the content of ideas currently held actually matter because they shape the world we live in both symbolically and materially. Therefore, if a certain idea is deemed wrong, it is important to resist it and its spread. It's the inability of creatures like ourselves, condemned to live in time, to resolve this tension in any general way that leads to so much chatter about free speech and its limits.The problem with the authors of this book is that they model debates as though ideas don't matter except for debate, as though fermenting debate itself were the point of ideas. The notion that there power differentials that are deeply entrenched and might not be removed by polite argumentation doesn't even come up.For example, a convenient manner to think about oppression is through ""structural analysis"" which helps make sense of the institutions and experiences that are frequent and persistent. To live in this miasma isn't merely about encountering scary ideas but actually being harmed in a variety of ways, and it really is unclear what the best way to resist and liberate. But the authors are convinced that they know best, since obviously more speech and more ideas is how victory will be won. They make much use of how the recent victories for same-sex marriage included campaigning that stressed similarity and shared community, but conveniently leave out how Stonewall was a riot.When they come close to discussing the obviously relevant idea of power, they just manage feebly to say:In calling for the dismantling of power structures, the author was using a set of terms and concepts that are common in some academic departments; the main line of argumentation fell squarely within the large family of Marxist approaches to social and political analysis. It’s a set of approaches in which things are analyzed primarily in terms of power. Groups struggle for power. Within this paradigm, when power is perceived to be held by one group over others, there is a moral polarity: the groups seen as powerful are bad, while the groups seen as oppressed are good. It’s a variant of the pathological dualism that Rabbi Sacks described in the quotation at the start of this chapter.All structural analysis are first reduced to ""groups struggle for power"" and then into instances of ""pathological dualism"" between the ""unimpeachably good and the irredeemably bad"".There are a lot of serious critiques possible about the relevance and fruitfulness of thinking about oppression as ""structural"", but this glib dismissal is intellectually embarrassing.Their unwillingness to take power seriously makes this entire book a slog through shallow liberal moralizing. Instead of responding to Down Girl: The Logic of Misogyny's point about how it is better to concentrate on the incident and impact instead of intent, because it makes it much, much harder to call out harmful behaviour, they just assume intent is what matters, and so anyone thinks otherwise is labouring under a ""cognitive distortion""The most evident is catastrophizing: If Milo Yiannopoulos is allowed to speak, there will be “broken bodies” on our side. I might lose my “right to exist.” Therefore, violence is justified, because it is self-defense. The author also engages in dichotomous thinking: If you condemn my side’s violence, that means you condone Yiannopoulos’s ideas. You must “pick a side.” You’re either with us or against us. Life is a battle between good people and evil people, and if you disagree with us, you’re one of the evil people…But if asking for peaceful dialogue is violent, then it seems that the word “violence” is taking on new meanings for some students.The point here isn't even that the Milo protests were the obvious way to go (although Milo's inability to get funding since suggests so), but that it's quite impossible to know antecedently or even in the short-term which strategies will be successful. Does treating every small incident as though it's important work better or does taking a more judicious strategy? Despite this lack of clarity about the truth, the authors frame the debate as young college students with good hearts making foolish choices instead of considering that they might possibly be engaging in successful resistance to entrenched evils.II. Why this book is still importantDespite this, there are three reasons this still remains a decent book.First, a significant chunk of the book concerns trends that converge in the iGen generation, including the lack of opportunity for free play, more bureaucracy, etc. It's really fun to read in one place, even if the information isn't new Second, it really is true that a lot of incidents of campus have been horrific, indicating that thinking you're on the right side of history allows for sadism and heedlessness. If you're on social media and have a functioning brain, you know the Left can go overboard in its mob mentality. As from above, I don't think we can say with certainty that these methods as a whole won't be successful, but they clearly do go against strong moral sensibilities at times. The Heckler's veto against anyone conservative, violence, cruelty all seem unacceptable, however much we tell ourselves it might ultimately be for the best.Third, the book is a lot more compelling if we don't think of it as a political project at all, but about psychologists simply talking about trends in the progressive movement that might be affecting mental health, fostering unhealthy ideas, and leading to irrational behaviour. At higher levels of explanation, trends might emerge that might be difficult to account for on a case-by-case basis, and I think the authors present a plausible case that taken as a whole, a lot of practices might be making the situation worse for students.Overall, a book better read as a summary of recent events on American campuses than as any kind of original contribution."
33,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2473528-roseanna-white,5,"Everyone with kids college-aged or younger needs to read this book! It addresses the trend of ""safetyism"" and student fragility--that the ideas of ""dangerous"" have crept from physical harm to emotional discomfort, which is proven not to make our kids STRONGER, but rather emotionally WEAKER. In it the authors not only discuss the problems that have come rather suddenly to college campuses, but the reasons behind them, and how we as parents and educators can correct it . The main theme is that there are Three Great Untruths that a generation has been taught to embrace, but which are what the psychology field knows are ""cognitive distortions."" Harmful ways of thinking that encourage us to see catastrophe, bias, and enemies where there are none. These are things we can universally recognize as untrue...but which are so easy to fall into.I'm not a big non-fiction reader these days, but I loved this book and have already made some changes to the rules for my kids based on the very sound evidence presented in it, as well as the wonderful advice.What I loved most about this book though is that it's quite possibly the only UNBIASED view I've encountered in recent years. Near the end of the book the authors do tell us their political views but up until they came out and said it, I had no idea whether they were liberal or conservative, D or R, even though they were discussing issues that dealt with the widening gap between them. They instead got at exactly what they encourage their readers to get at in our own lives: the wider circle of humanity to which we all belong."

35,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12766685-alison,3,"First - I agree with their argument on free-play time for children. As a mom, I see this as an essential part of growing up and their discussion really helped me to figure out some of the reasons why it has felt important but I was struggling to articulate that. I also appreciated the points they made about safetyism. It is something I have seen and I now have a label for it and can hopefully better communicate the risks.But, I also struggled often with this book. I think that saying someone shouldn't be offended by a comment that you didn't know would be offensive removes the responsibility from the speaker to learn anything that could stop them from saying hurtful/offensive things in the future - most of the examples they use are of ways in which people say things that perpetuate systems of oppression (racism, sexism, etc) and by shrugging things off, the system doesn't get fixed. If the speaker were able to listen and change, then getting offended wouldn't be useful, but too often that's not the outcome. This is a topic I have been working though - I don't always understand why someone got offended, but when I listen or read, I can usually get it. But it comes back on me to learn, not them to get thick skin (I'm not always the speaker, but usually a somewhat confused bystander in these cases).It will raise my hackles when a book uses the version of MLK Jr that only encompasses his Dream speech and not also his other letter, sermons, and speeches. I think they simplified things too much on this respect.The sections laying out how various professors and others in academia have been mistreated was good at pointing out the failings of those areas, but I think that if you are looking for it you could easily find bad behavior in religion, in business, in government, etc. Every aspect of our culture contains humans and within that subset, they may *misbehave* in different ways, but every area has people who misuse power or are unqualified. I also have a few gripes with the way they discuss campus protests. I think we would agree about a lot of this, but I want to point that people like Heather McDonald and Charles Murray have writt books, the people protesting them are almost certainly aware of their views (either by reading the book or discussing parts of it) and they are choosing to say that this person has bad ideas. It is not that HM or CM don't get any chance to speak or promote their ideas - they still have free speech. It is more that students wish the wouldn't be given platforms for these ideas. I agree with Coddling in that violence is abhorrent and counterproductive, but they way they frame the rest of the conversation is in error.Overall - it was a book that made me think, but had some very problematic portions."
36,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1655983-katie,1,"The flaws of this book cloud the conclusion. Some of the flaws:-Anecdotes about campus events are used despite authors demand that everyone be more focused on facts and data. Some of the incidents described are indeed examples of extreme sensitivity and intolerance. Worrisome trend, but not convincing that campuses have abandoned free speech.-Serious lack of time spent on investigating and confirming the issues college students care about. The Trump administration is a frightening turn, threatening institutions and norms - shouldn't we expect young people to protest?-CBT as a treatment for anxiety I get, but as a treatment for real threats and oppression? So insulting! We have an administration threatening to take away healthcare, women's health care, rights of immigrants, gay people, minorities. What happens when a lesbian girl is told a speaker believes she is deviant who needs to go to conversion camp? She should practice CBT and remember the speaker has good intentions? When Richard Spencer coming to campus to spout off about peaceful ethnic cleansing, should students practice CBT? Just because the book does justice to some topics - like IGen social issues, helicopter parenting and safteyism, - does not mean the book works. I also happen to agree this generation does not conceive of the First Amendment like my generation does. College kids raised with awareness of inequality in American, we were raised to worry about authoritarianism and the Cold War. I think the topic deserves scrutiny, but these authors failed in my opinion. "
37,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5862443-joseph-stieb,4,"Full disclosure: I am a Haidt fanboy, so I'm predisposed to like this book. Unlike the Righteous Mind, it is not outstanding. Books that are elaborations of long-form articles rarely are. If you follow Haidt and Lukianoff's work closely, this is mainly a summary of what they have been doing the last 4 years of so (see Haidt's excellent Wriston Lecture for a distillation). Still, this is a strong, well-sourced, and fair-minded argument about where higher ed has turned wrong and how it can be rectified.Haidt and Lukianoff argue for an older understanding of the purpose of higher education: the pursuit of truth rather than the furthering of a political agenda. They convincingly show how higher ed has become more partisan and less ideologically diverse, although they don't do much to show how this stultifies and biases research and teaching (for more on this, see Shields and Dunn's outstanding Passing on the Right). Their focus is on why things like trigger warnings, disinvitations, interruptions of speakers, micro-aggressions, etc have surged on campus in the last 5 years or so. The core of their argument is less about ideology than generational shifts. Despite the somewhat inflammatory title, they put forth a complex, nuanced argument that the I-Gen (born in mid 1990s, came of age with cellphones and social media as normal things, in contrast to millennial, who were teens when the iPhone and facebook came out) is a far more anxious and dependent generation that doesn't know how to handle conflict on its own and has been coached to go to the authorities instead. Take a far more polarized, bureaucratized university system, and you get more kids calling for ""coddling"" and more administrators giving it to them to prevent their school from becoming the next Yale or Missouri. The leftist intellectual framework that these students embrace (redefinition of safety and violence, identitarian common enemy politics, a radical interpretation intersectionality, the dismissal of anything written by a dead white guy as not worth reading because he must have been a racist/sexist) isn't the deeper cause of this surge in left-wing activism on campus. Rather, changes in the climate of US politics and the way kids are raised primes them to take in this ideological system. This can be changed on both ends, although I am more interested in how to change to college atmosphere and how to make these ideas (each of which has some value) more realistic and less polarizing and politically ""weaponized.""The intellectual cases put forth against all of these concepts that have crept into academia are excellent, as usual. They explain how each of these things encourages mentally and intellectually unhealthy thinking, feeds tribalism, and makes open, trusting conversation impossible on campus. Still, I thought they were getting a little loose from their moorings in their criticism of modern parenting. It is hard to tell parents to not be a little over-protective of their kids. There are ways to do this (like more unstructured time built into a kid's day, at school and at home, plus less screen time) but overall I think most parents do a pretty good job. I think they are both part of pretty elite social circles in which tiger parenting was very common. My middle class upbringing seemed to have plenty of free time, and my parents let me and my brothers roam the neighborhood pretty freely. I wouldn't dismiss all of their argument about parenting, but it was probably the weak link in the book.I'd recommend this book to anyone concerned about changes on campus or anyone who has heard about Haidt and is curious. It is concise, and very qualified. As usual, Haidt's critics have misrepresented his argument left and right, so make sure you go to the source."
38,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25032671-kris,4,"I first read Bloom's original The Closing of the American Mind just so that I could read this book. While it's useful to have the earlier background on past decades in academia, Bloom's original is not required reading before enjoying Haidt's great contribution here.These authors lead the reader through some great analyses -- they show how a drastic shift in the mentality of arguments/debate on college campuses happened in 2013, along with a seemingly drastic shift in mindset surrounding the purpose of education. I'll list some of their principles here: Prepare the child for the road, not the road for the child. We are all prone to emotional reasoning and confirmation bias. Your worst enemy cannot harm you as much as your own unguarded thoughts. People are prone to catastroph-izing about the future. We are all prone to tribalism. Many psychological principles on college campuses encourage students to embrace foolishness, rather than wisdom. Young people are innately anti-fragile, but they learn helplessness in correlation with rising rates of adolescent depression and anxiety, a shift to more protective parenting, and widespread play deprivation and risk deprivation. We are seeing rising political polarization and expanded bureaucracy. We also see a rising passion for justice combined with a growing commitment to attaining equal outcomes in all areas. The rise in passion for justice is admirable on its own, but when combined with a demand to see equity, not equality, it becomes misguided.Some falsehoods: What doesn't kill you, makes you weaker.

This monograph explores how 'fragility' is being developed in children, adolescence and students on university campuses. While much of the attention is on the left and social justice politics, there is some focus on the polarization of politics from the alt-right.The problems with this book are clear. The authors confuse a diversity of facts and interpretations with emotions rather than rigour. EH Carr stated in 1961 that ""history means interpretation."" Only particular facts have survived to our present. Therefore assuming that the source material - the material culture - that remains in our present is accurate, true and convincing while alternative interpretations are emotional or intuitive perpetuates a mis-understanding of history, media and politics.Are students fragile? Perhaps. The greater question is why students are fragile. That is the question not asked or answered in this book. Unemployment, under-employment, exhorbitant fees for education, ridiculous payments for privatized utilities, and ill-information public policies are only part of our corrosive present.Protests exist because there is no space to be different, to be defiant, and - in the case of George Floyd - to breathe. This is not emotion or intent. This is verified and an outcome of claustropolitan structures. A provocative book. It lacks a deep engagement of the political economy. Therefore - and ironically - it is part of the identity politics superficiality it wishes to critique."
41,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7258380-dan-graser,5,"This collaboration between Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt is fantastic on many levels and addresses a thorny issue with precision, honesty, and language that is free of the usual superficial pejoratives found in such discussions. They begin with three fundamental Untruths that they have distilled from their own experiences working in academia and social psychology:1) What doesn't kill you makes you weaker.2) Always trust your feelings.3) Life is a battle between good people and evil people.These ideas are discussed in the context of current political divides, campus culture, parenting, and general discourse on social media. Throughout, they use 6 ""explanatory threads"" to understand how we have gotten where we are, sociologically and politically:1) There has been a steady increase in affective polarization since the 1980's, such that people don't feel a stronger kinship with their party but bond more over hatred of the opposition.2) There has been a nation-wide rise in adolescent anxiety and depression since 2011, mainly affecting those who belong to the ""iGen"" or Generation Z.3) There has been a shift, starting in the 80's and reaching a peak in the 90's among more educated families especially, to fearful and needlessly overprotective ""paranoid parenting.""4) The steady decline of unsupervised free play among children due to the above trend. 5) The growth of campus bureaucracy and the expansion of over-protection of students who themselves, don't wish it or need it, resulting in the transmission of the very type of psychological issues the campus is trying to prevent. 6) The rise of social justice activism, rightfully, in response to turbulent and emotionally powerful political events between 2012 and 2018.As someone who works in academia and is genuinely concerned about students' well-being, I always enjoy reading works that provide data, facts, and arguments based in psychology to suggest how we can improve that mission while dealing with the issues present in the larger social-political context, with which our students are dealing. This book contains the finest discussion of this I have seen in addition to great, level-headed discussions of modern parenting, social justice activism, and identity politics. Well worth your time!"

Still, more people should be talking about some silly viewpoints that are popular at the moment. "
43,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2319320-melissa,5,"Wonder why the young generation seems so bad at thinking? This book sheds light on what ""we"" collectively as a society have done to cause it. We've taught three falsehoods as truth: That individuals are fragile, that we can trust our feelings, that life is a battle between good and bad people. Do you feel, like me, that there is no way you're going to write down your thoughts on a particular topic esp. publicly, because no matter how well reasoned or how good your intentions, if you use one wrong word, you're deemed evil for life by one side or the other? (You're ""cancelled."") We've hearkened back to the time of witch hunts, and I found that chapter of the history of what leads to the eras of witch hunts (which we're in a time of those right now) enlightening about why the heck one word in a well meant email can cause a person's complete ruin. We need to get back to a time where we give people the benefit of the doubt! The information on Cognitive Behavior Therapy was also enlightening. As a society, we are essentially going against good psychological practice and teaching bad ways of thinking. One of my sons is a doomsday thinker and I'm happy to have some of these CBT tools to see if I can help him stop the negative thinking habits of thinking the worst about everything and everybody. We see this reflected in society right now, everyone jumps to conclusions on a story that's not an hour old with nothing but a headline and decide they have the ability to be judge, jury, and executioner on that alone and then move on as if ruining that person's life was not a weighty matter. I don't want my son growing up to be like that and it's been frustrating to try to talk him out of his thought processes because I want him to grown up sound of mind unlike many people I've encountered lately, and I've wondered why it is they can be such bad thinkers, and this book enlightens on that some of the reasons.The practical application section is worth the price of the read on what we can do to turn the boat around. Thankfully, I've been already doing a lot of the suggestions for my kids in my determination to have them grow up sound of mind, but this was nice to have the facts and stats to help solidify what I'm doing to help. This is another book that shows our overly scheduled, screen-heavy existence is doing nothing good for our youth. The authors of this book reveal toward the end of the book what their political leanings are and they're nearly the opposite of mine, but I'd say there is no slant, because I agreed with nearly all of it, it was logical, reasoned, well laid out--we're facing a problem that affects both sides of the political spectrum. It is a bit of a slog at the beginning with all the research and the fact that they are very academic writers with the ""I'll tell you this, I'm telling you, and now I'll summarize what I just told you"" which probably is all right if you're one to read at leisure instead of read books from cover to cover like me, that would help you remember what you read if you put it down for any amount of time, but be forewarned that it isn't a fast paced read. But it's an excellent read."
44,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2007216-peter-derk,4,"What an interesting book.I think what would prevent most people from reading this is probably some version of a sentiment that can be summed up as ""Okay Boomer."" But if that's how you're feeling, I would encourage you to give it a shot.Although there are lots of examples from college campuses, they're pretty balanced between things that overly-sensitive people are doing and things that crazy people are doing (usually white power weirdos). And while there is some condemnation of behavior, I felt like the author was very empathetic towards people and wasn't saying anything remotely like, ""These snowflakes need to shape up!"" or ""These iGen kids are ruining everything!"" If you read it that way, that's probably your preconceived notion and sensitivity lenses at work, not the real content of the book. The most interesting portions to me were related to parenting and how much it's changed in just a few decades. There was a section that listed a checklist for parents for school readiness for young kids. 30 or 40 years ago, the list was a lot of things like, ""You child can ride a two-wheel bicycle, Your child can walk alone to a store or home 2 or 3 blocks away..."" where now it looks more like, ""Your child can spell phonetically, Your child can understand basic mathematical concepts..."" So where once it was ""Is your child capable of managing their physical safety?"" now it's more ""Can your child fill out a worksheet?"" Which seems profoundly stupid to me. This is my Okay Boomer moment, so buckle up.When I was a kid we used to roam around the town in small groups of 2-4 kids. Sometimes on bikes, sometimes just walking. And it wasn't like we had to check in every hour with our parents. I rode the bus to the mall. I would go to the grocery store alone or with a friend. In the summer, this was basically all we did, screw around during unstructured time. You learn a lot without realizing it. You learn to avoid true danger, like weirdos and creeps. You learn how to do simple shit like walk into a grocery store, pick something out and pay for it. You learn how to take a bus. You learn the geography of where you live. I had a coworker who lived in a very safe neighborhood and wouldn't allow her son to walk to the bus alone. It was like a block. Eventually, she did let him do it, but he had to be on a walkie talkie and talk to her the whole time until he got on the bus. I've had a number of people tell me that when their kids are learning to drive, they have no idea where they are inside of their own towns. They don't know how to get from home to school. Every day, the school I work next to, parents line up their cars to drive up to the door of the school, at which point their child is released, gets in the car, and then the parents drive them home. Like they're goddamn diplomats in need of a secure escort. This line of cars extends several blocks, and parents will wait up to an hour in a line of cars to pick up their kids. The kids can walk or bike or whatever, but very few, if any, do this, and if they do want to do it this way the parents have to sign a waiver. I can already hear the parents: You don't have a kid, so you don't understand. If you don't have kids, you'll hear this all the time. And I totally agree, I don't have the emotional understanding of a parent. However, I would proffer this: I probably have a more realistic assessment of danger to children because I'm NOT a parent. I'm not emotionally invested, which means when I'm looking at the realistic dangers, my thinking isn't tainted by my personal stakes. There are some parents who agree with me, that kids should have a little more freedom. There was the mom profiled in the book, the sort of mother of the Free Range Kids movement, who let her young son ride the subway home by himself at one point, which turned out great.I do think kids probably need a little more room, a little more agency, and a little less structure. One of the more profound insights in the book had to do with the level of discourse we're experiencing today. In short, people suck at discussing things because they never had un-referee'ed disagreements as kids. When you're a kid, if you're playing a game with 4 other kids, you have to learn how to argue or disagree without the other kid getting up and leaving, at which point the game is unplayable. Newer parents tend to referee everything, jumping in if things get intense. But letting kids work these things out themselves might be a way to help them learn the skills of discussing things without getting to the point that everyone takes their ball and goes home.The best part of the book, however, is that it offers a lot of potential solutions. I've found that I'm a solutions-based thinking, so solutions speak to me. Even when I disagree with the solutions, I think solutions-oriented thinking speaks to me and gets me thinking along the lines of productive movement. Way too many books that I might put in the sociology category seem very focused on talking about the problem. I usually hear what the author is saying and think, ""Okay, I buy that this is a problem, but what now?"" To borrow an analogy from another book, a problem that's well-explained is great, but if you went to the doctor with a pain, and if that doctor could explain why you're feeling this pain, does knowing the pain's origin solve the problem? No. You go to the doctor not for an explanation of the history of the pain, but for the cure. It's how I feel when a cold is being passed around the office, and everyone wants to trace back to patient zero. As if it's really that person's fault. Sidebar: it's my pet peeve that people come in when they're sick. Don't do that. But once you're sick, figuring out who ""got you sick"" is a complete waste of time and energy. Once you know, does that help your symptoms? Does it speed your recovery? Absolutely not. Yes, I think the history of some things can be valuable in understanding them. But the history and origin of a problem without solution is not terribly useful. I think a lot of people don't have the guts to offer a solution. Because that's the easiest thing to attack. You can nitpick someone's solution, which will be seen as an effective way of discrediting their entire argument. Which is stupid. I deeply appreciate the solutions offered in this book, especially because they're solutions based mostly in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (which totally works) and because they're solutions that any individual can choose to apply. It's not a set of solutions that goes ""You motherfuckers need to stop doing X."" It's a set of solutions oriented towards, ""If you want to be a better person and have a better life, here are some realistic options.""Great read, and I'd definitely call it a must-read for parents of young kids who haven't given a lot of thought to giving their kid some rope. And parents who feel pressured by other parents, who are afraid of being seen as bad parents."
45,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31910342-josh,3,"I previously read Lukianoff's ""Unlearning Liberty"" earlier this year. While I thoroughly enjoyed that work, I was somewhat disappointed by this joint venture with social psychologist Jonathan Haidt. This is partly because while ""Unlearning Liberty"" was a searching examination of how higher education in recent years has failed in its central purpose to discover ""truth"" by prohibiting many forms of offensive speech on campus, this book tries to further that inquiry in some ways by putting together a composite of factors for why ""iGen"" (those who were born c. 1996) have embraced ""safetyism"" on college campuses. ""Safetyism"" is essentially the conflation of being offended with being in physical danger. The book is divided into three parts. The first unpacks what the authors call the ""three great untruths"" that iGen embraces: the world is divided between distinctly ""good"" people and wholly ""bad"" people; trust your feelings (i.e. emotional reasoning over logic); and ""safetyism"" which the authors describe as ""what doesn't hurt you, makes you weaker."" The second narrates a series of recent episodes of censorship and both far left/far right violence on college campuses, such as Berkeley Antifa protests against Milo Yiannopolis, the Alt-Right protests at UVA; and the Charles Murray episode at Middlebury. The final part explains what the authors believe are the six contributing factors that are the ""bad ideas [that] are setting up a generation for failure."" The last two chapters in this section deal with a) how parents should ideally raise children to be thick-skinned and critically thinking adults and b) how primary and secondary education can offer adolescents and teenagers the mental toolset to confront offensive ideas and grow intellectually from such debates. There is a lot of ground to cover in any review of this book (and much of what follows in this paragraph I explain in more detail in my review of Unlearning Liberty). But, the gist is that colleges and universities should be wholly focused on discerning ""truth."" Various public intellectuals, such as Van Jones, have argued that colleges provide people with a rare opportunity to grapple with offensive ideas and speech by using reasoning and argument. College should be a ""gym,"" to borrow from Van Jones, that trains people to debate and compromise within our democratic system. Since the early 2010s, though, many colleges (and almost exclusively the most liberal ones) have become distracted from the goal of seeking ""truth"" by protecting students from potentially offensive speech. There's an appropriate discussion within this section of how the left has stretched the definition of ""violence"" to include intuitively nonviolent actions, such as speech. By construing offensive speech as ""violent,"" college administrators, faculty, and students have effectively nullified the free speech privileges of a wide swathe of conservative intellectuals (and alt-right wackos) by appealing to the need to keep students ""safe"" on campus. The six factors that have contributed to the current climate of ""Safetyism,"" censorship, and unrest are best summed up as follows:1) American politics have become increasingly polarized (entering a ""polarization cycle"") where very little compromise is ever reached between left and right.2) The advent of social media and the internet has made ""iGen"" far more depressed and anxious than previous generations. 3) Parents since the 1980s have increasingly become ""helicopter"" parents, not allowing their children to experience any discomfort and sheltering them from the real world, so to speak. 4) What the authors term the ""decline of [free] play."" In other words, children have far less time relative to previous generations to socialize, initiate play, and be creative. This is caused by the fact that elite colleges and universities select from those with an abundance of extracurriculars (etc.) and parents respond by over-structuring their children's time with various activities. 5) Primary and secondary education have become obsessed with keeping students ""safe"" from offensive ideas and taboo subjects. 6) ""Social justice"" and its quest for equal outcomes has created a ""common enemy identity politics"" focused on subdividing people into various ""intersectional"" identities. The authors compare this to Martin Luther King, Jr.'s ""common humanity"" identity politics that sought to authentically include all Americans in the civil rights movement by appealing to the American civic religion. These six factors (covered in six chapters) are unevenly persuasive, although I generally agree with the authors that the cult of ""safe spaces"" and ""free speech zones"" on campuses is extremely problematic. I think I agree with some of the other reviews on Goodreads that some of their solutions contain assumptions grounded in a middle-class ethos. Specifically, their idea that children should be given more rein to explore their neighborhoods, talk to strangers, and even use public transportation at young ages (i.e. nine years old). The authors argue that our perception of danger is massively inflated by the 24 hour news cycle and John Walsh's crusade to catch ""America's Most Wanted."" I agree in part, but would argue that many parents (and single parents) living in certain rural or urban areas with high crime rates have legitimate concerns about allowing their children to be ""free range children."" Being a parent myself, I generally found their Dr. Spock parental advice annoying, at best, and naive at worst. Overall, an informative book that resonated well with my experience on campus the past seven years. Excepting the final two concluding chapters, I completely recommend this book to anyone seriously interested in learning more about what is happening on America's college campuses. But you should first read ""Unlearning Liberty."" "

The stories can definitely get your blood pumping and outrage you at points and I think that's the point. 10/10 would recommend this to most people.One of the best parts of the book is the way the authors write in such a humble and transparent way. The consistently mention how the issues are more complex than they make them out to be and never claim to have the only answer.

49,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3730838-maggie-boyd,2,"I'm always interested in books critiquing our current educational system and sat down to read this one with enthusiasm. However, this book is less about what is wrong with our system and more about criticizing liberals for the horrors they have wrought upon our society. It begins with vilifying our current crop of college students: kids born after 1995 who began going to college in 2013. These children are having three great untruths fed to them by liberal universities: 1. The Untruth of Fragility: What doesn't kill you makes you weaker. 2. The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: Always trust your feelings. 3. The Untruth of Us versus Them: Life is a battle between good people and evil people. They go on to say that by creating safe spaces, colleges teach students to believe the above. The evidence? Students are preventing speakers from holding lectures they disagree with at their universities. As others have pointed out, this in no way keeps the speaker from disseminating their ideas. Milo, the target of one of these riots, was still making television appearances and publishing books. The students were asking that he not be allowed to speak in spaces their tuition paid for, a very different thing than asking that he never be allowed to speak anywhere. Moreover, this wasn't a question of not giving the speaker a chance to present his point but a reaction to the point the speaker had already made. Finally, the United States has over 3,000 4 yr. universities and the author's ""evidence"" centers around approximately 1% of those institutions having students make demands they felt were unreasonable. This is nowhere near epidemic. Then the authors get to what I felt was the primary point: Viewpoint diversity reduces a community’s susceptibility to witch hunts. One of the most important kinds of viewpoint diversity, diversity of political thought, has declined substantially among both professors and students at American universities since the 1990s. To sum up the first portion of the book has two major points: Anything that prevents someone from making a point, even if that point is offensive, is ""coddling"" and colleges are too liberal. We need more balance. (They didn't speak to the 600 Christian colleges where the staff is predominantly conservative.) After spending several chapters ""building a case"" on how the great untruths listed in the first paragraph are destroying young collegiate minds, the author's come to a startling conclusion: You can see why it was hard for us to make a strong case that universities were causing students to become anxious and depressed by teaching them disordered ways of thinking. Anxiety and depression rates were already rising for all teenagers before they arrived at college, and for those who never attended college as well. Clearly universities were not causing a national mental health crisis; they were responding to one. With liberal universities out as a scapegoat, bring in liberal parenting policies. Safteyism, where parents go to purportedly unreasonable limits to protect their kids might be a factor in kids being more fearful, which might be a factor in them being depressed. No direct evidence of this is available but they offer up some random events and show how those few events point to liberals running amok and creating too much fear in our kids. They have to admit, grudgingly, that many of the safety measures have worked. Putting it all together, from 1960 to 1990, there was a 48% reduction in deaths from unintended injuries and accidents among kids between five and fourteen years of age, and a 57% drop in deaths of younger kids (ages one to four).Lukianoff, Greg. The Coddling of the American Mind (p. 169). Penguin Publishing Group. Kindle Edition. In summary, the authors offer anecdotes and a handful of studies to showcase their points but the math in no way supports what they are saying. If you are someone who feels PC culture is at the heart of what is wrong with our country, you'll love this book and may believe it supports your view point. If you know how to do elementary school level math and have an understanding of the basic principle of percentages, you will quickly realize this tome is meant to speak into a very specific echo chamber and provides no substantial evidence to support the view that liberals will be the death of America."

He previously wrote The Righteous Mind, which was a powerful and thought-provoking read. Haidt, along with Greg Lukianoff, provide another powerful analysis and thought-provoking read with this book. I would recommend it to any and everyone. While there are specific recommendations that some may have differing personal preferences/opinions on, there is no lack of research in their presentation and arguments (and it’s safe to say they would welcome the discourse of another perspective). I especially appreciated their inclusion of CBT and how that could be a beneficial practice for many to adopt, as well as parents and institutions to encourage and teach. Looking forward to anything else Haidt writes. "

Over the 3 months since I finished The Coddling of the American Mind I cannot believe how many times I have shared the ideas of these authors with others. This book is just so pertinent, so timely, and so important that it comes up again and again. I generally read books and move on to the next so quickly, but this one has found a permanence in my worldview. I think that makes it worthy of 5 stars.Nov 21, 2018Why are so many college students struggling with anxiety and depression? Why are so many university campuses coming up against student demands to disinvite ""dangerous"" guest speakers, to penalize professors who propone unpopular opinions, and to dismiss any who threaten their conception of safety? This very insightful book discusses 3 great untruths of the ""IGen"" (the generation born after 1994, coinciding with the ubiquity of the iPhone): The Untruth of Fragility: What doesn’t kill you makes you weaker. The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: Always trust your feelings. The Untruth of Us Versus Them: Life is a battle between good people and evil people.It shows have parents and institutions have unwittingly taught youth these untruths, and have - with the best of intentions - coddled them to the point of handicapping their ability to handle the adult world. Within this framework, I gained some new insights into the reasons for our increasingly partisan political world.One thing I really like about The Coddling of the American Mind is that, unlike many books of this genre, it doesn't just rip down the system, telling us everything that's wrong with society, then leave us hopeless. Lukianoff and Haidt give pages of good, solid suggestions for how to correct the problems we have created. I would absolutely recommend this book to parents today, as well as to anyone in education or educational administration. It is quite bipartisan, but not afraid to point out problems on both side of the political spectrum. I already put the audiobook on hold for my husband!4.5 stars."

Some problems I’d wholeheartedly agree with include, treating children & young adults as if they are fragile, assuming the worst about people who disagree with you, elevating “safetyism” as a top goal in life, tolerating a “call-out” culture that represses legitimate criticism and intimidates/shames people, and embracing identity politics.

Coddling of the American Mind did this. In brief, it is about three great Untruths that are affecting US universities and making them weaker: that we are protecting them from things that they see as dangerous, because – although there are good people, there are also evil ones. The great Untruths are:1. The Untruth of Fragility: What doesn’t kill you makes you weaker. 2. The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: Always trust your feelings. 3. The Untruth of Us Versus Them: Life is a battle between good people and evil people. (p. 4) Lukianoff and Haidt are provocative, but also good at bringing together diverse kinds of information together to help us recognize, as the subtitle goes, ""how good intentions and bad ideas are setting up a generation for failure.""For a book about the dichotomous and extreme thinking characterizing parenting, students, and the university system in the 21st century, Lukianoff and Haidt slip into dichotomous thinking. As do we all from time to time.We are in an age of helicopter parenting – even bulldozer parenting – where parents attempt to intervene with their college-aged children in a way that my daughters, frustratingly, would not allow me to do when they were in grade school. Rather than helping them, except in the short-term, this sort of parenting (and overscheduling, failing to allow or encourage free play, etc.) leaves students to becoming fragile, anxious, and easily hurt. Lukianoff and Haidt argue compellingly that college students should and must be exposed to viewpoint diversity, which will help them think more critically, understand diverse perspectives, and withstand events that would otherwise make them depressed and anxious. As the authors conclude, this means that we should beseeking out challenges (rather than eliminating or avoiding everything that “feels unsafe”), freeing yourself from cognitive distortions (rather than always trusting your initial feelings), and taking a generous view of other people, and looking for nuance (rather than assuming the worst about people within a simplistic us-versus-them morality). (p. 14)I appreciated Coddling of the American Mind, but I was often annoyed and irritated by it – which are not good outcomes for this time of year. Lukianoff and Haidt gathered interesting and often compelling threads, but I wasn't convinced by all of their evidence. Clearly, there is more anxiety and depression on campus than when I was in school, but that isn't necessarily a function of ""coddling,"" but of greater access on college campuses. Students who would not have been able to attend college 20 years ago can.While Lukianoff and Haidt criticize students' complaints about controversial and noncontroversial speakers (e.g., George Will, Bill Maher, Eric Holder, Madeleine Albright), I am less dismayed. I like that students are more likely to set limits about things that my generation accepted (e.g., #metoo).Current parenting practices, among many other things, have both strengths and weaknesses. Lukianoff and Haidt primarily focus on the downside here, but maybe we can look for some nuance and attempt to create a stronger model for the next generation of parents – and universities."
58,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3052770-teri,4,"This is an important read in today's society. This book is a look at the iGen generation that seems to be obsessed with technology and social media. The authors look at how ready access to news and social media affects attitudes and higher education. iGen students seem to be obsessed with protecting themselves against any other opinion than their own. They are less open to expanding their worldview and listening to opposing views to gain a broader understanding of today's society. This has led to students feeling ""unsafe"" when dealing with someone who does not share their views. Are they truly physically unsafe or are they just unable to process opposing views? Instead of engaging in open, civil debate or listening to gain understanding, students are sheltered and professors and administrators kowtow to students, offering special ""safe spaces,"" firing faculty who simply exercise their first amendment right, or even canceling guest speakers whose views are not shared with the majority of students. In essence, the authors suggest that we are coddling America's youth and young adults, sheltering them to the point that they are unable to process opinions and ideas that they do not identify with. The authors spend a lot of time discussing how technology and social media have affected current attitudes and lifestyles. Where once young kids would go out and play in the neighborhood, without constant adult supervision, they are today being watched by helicopter parents, suggesting that kids are being overprotected. Are we coddling the younger generations to the point that they are unable to psychologically handle uncomfortable positions? It is certainly worth thinking about and this book will open that discussion to consider if we are doing a disservice to our youth.I think this is a must-read for parents, teachers, and faculty of higher education.

62,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28777221-sharad-pandian,3,"If you've been following the fracas on and surrounding American universities, there's nothing new in this book for you.As the title suggests, Jonathan Haidt and Greg Lukianoff argue that American children from the iGen generation (born 1995 or beyond) are raised in situations and using methods unique in ways that make them interpret discomfort as danger. This makes them unable to cope, and harms them and their causes.I. Why this book is a waste of spaceTo understand why this book goes wrong, its important to appreciate a central tension in the way we think about ideas. On one hand, clearly people have been wrong about so much in the past and therefore as Mill suggests we should keep avenues for debate and change always open. On the other hand, the content of ideas currently held actually matter because they shape the world we live in both symbolically and materially. Therefore, if a certain idea is deemed wrong, it is important to resist it and its spread. It's the inability of creatures like ourselves, condemned to live in time, to resolve this tension in any general way that leads to so much chatter about free speech and its limits.The problem with the authors of this book is that they model debates as though ideas don't matter except for debate, as though fermenting debate itself were the point of ideas. The notion that there power differentials that are deeply entrenched and might not be removed by polite argumentation doesn't even come up.For example, a convenient manner to think about oppression is through ""structural analysis"" which helps make sense of the institutions and experiences that are frequent and persistent. To live in this miasma isn't merely about encountering scary ideas but actually being harmed in a variety of ways, and it really is unclear what the best way to resist and liberate. But the authors are convinced that they know best, since obviously more speech and more ideas is how victory will be won. They make much use of how the recent victories for same-sex marriage included campaigning that stressed similarity and shared community, but conveniently leave out how Stonewall was a riot.When they come close to discussing the obviously relevant idea of power, they just manage feebly to say:In calling for the dismantling of power structures, the author was using a set of terms and concepts that are common in some academic departments; the main line of argumentation fell squarely within the large family of Marxist approaches to social and political analysis. It’s a set of approaches in which things are analyzed primarily in terms of power. Groups struggle for power. Within this paradigm, when power is perceived to be held by one group over others, there is a moral polarity: the groups seen as powerful are bad, while the groups seen as oppressed are good. It’s a variant of the pathological dualism that Rabbi Sacks described in the quotation at the start of this chapter.All structural analysis are first reduced to ""groups struggle for power"" and then into instances of ""pathological dualism"" between the ""unimpeachably good and the irredeemably bad"".There are a lot of serious critiques possible about the relevance and fruitfulness of thinking about oppression as ""structural"", but this glib dismissal is intellectually embarrassing.Their unwillingness to take power seriously makes this entire book a slog through shallow liberal moralizing. Instead of responding to Down Girl: The Logic of Misogyny's point about how it is better to concentrate on the incident and impact instead of intent, because it makes it much, much harder to call out harmful behaviour, they just assume intent is what matters, and so anyone thinks otherwise is labouring under a ""cognitive distortion""The most evident is catastrophizing: If Milo Yiannopoulos is allowed to speak, there will be “broken bodies” on our side. I might lose my “right to exist.” Therefore, violence is justified, because it is self-defense. The author also engages in dichotomous thinking: If you condemn my side’s violence, that means you condone Yiannopoulos’s ideas. You must “pick a side.” You’re either with us or against us. Life is a battle between good people and evil people, and if you disagree with us, you’re one of the evil people…But if asking for peaceful dialogue is violent, then it seems that the word “violence” is taking on new meanings for some students.The point here isn't even that the Milo protests were the obvious way to go (although Milo's inability to get funding since suggests so), but that it's quite impossible to know antecedently or even in the short-term which strategies will be successful. Does treating every small incident as though it's important work better or does taking a more judicious strategy? Despite this lack of clarity about the truth, the authors frame the debate as young college students with good hearts making foolish choices instead of considering that they might possibly be engaging in successful resistance to entrenched evils.II. Why this book is still importantDespite this, there are three reasons this still remains a decent book.First, a significant chunk of the book concerns trends that converge in the iGen generation, including the lack of opportunity for free play, more bureaucracy, etc. It's really fun to read in one place, even if the information isn't new Second, it really is true that a lot of incidents of campus have been horrific, indicating that thinking you're on the right side of history allows for sadism and heedlessness. If you're on social media and have a functioning brain, you know the Left can go overboard in its mob mentality. As from above, I don't think we can say with certainty that these methods as a whole won't be successful, but they clearly do go against strong moral sensibilities at times. The Heckler's veto against anyone conservative, violence, cruelty all seem unacceptable, however much we tell ourselves it might ultimately be for the best.Third, the book is a lot more compelling if we don't think of it as a political project at all, but about psychologists simply talking about trends in the progressive movement that might be affecting mental health, fostering unhealthy ideas, and leading to irrational behaviour. At higher levels of explanation, trends might emerge that might be difficult to account for on a case-by-case basis, and I think the authors present a plausible case that taken as a whole, a lot of practices might be making the situation worse for students.Overall, a book better read as a summary of recent events on American campuses than as any kind of original contribution."
63,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2473528-roseanna-white,5,"Everyone with kids college-aged or younger needs to read this book! It addresses the trend of ""safetyism"" and student fragility--that the ideas of ""dangerous"" have crept from physical harm to emotional discomfort, which is proven not to make our kids STRONGER, but rather emotionally WEAKER. In it the authors not only discuss the problems that have come rather suddenly to college campuses, but the reasons behind them, and how we as parents and educators can correct it . The main theme is that there are Three Great Untruths that a generation has been taught to embrace, but which are what the psychology field knows are ""cognitive distortions."" Harmful ways of thinking that encourage us to see catastrophe, bias, and enemies where there are none. These are things we can universally recognize as untrue...but which are so easy to fall into.I'm not a big non-fiction reader these days, but I loved this book and have already made some changes to the rules for my kids based on the very sound evidence presented in it, as well as the wonderful advice.What I loved most about this book though is that it's quite possibly the only UNBIASED view I've encountered in recent years. Near the end of the book the authors do tell us their political views but up until they came out and said it, I had no idea whether they were liberal or conservative, D or R, even though they were discussing issues that dealt with the widening gap between them. They instead got at exactly what they encourage their readers to get at in our own lives: the wider circle of humanity to which we all belong."

65,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12766685-alison,3,"First - I agree with their argument on free-play time for children. As a mom, I see this as an essential part of growing up and their discussion really helped me to figure out some of the reasons why it has felt important but I was struggling to articulate that. I also appreciated the points they made about safetyism. It is something I have seen and I now have a label for it and can hopefully better communicate the risks.But, I also struggled often with this book. I think that saying someone shouldn't be offended by a comment that you didn't know would be offensive removes the responsibility from the speaker to learn anything that could stop them from saying hurtful/offensive things in the future - most of the examples they use are of ways in which people say things that perpetuate systems of oppression (racism, sexism, etc) and by shrugging things off, the system doesn't get fixed. If the speaker were able to listen and change, then getting offended wouldn't be useful, but too often that's not the outcome. This is a topic I have been working though - I don't always understand why someone got offended, but when I listen or read, I can usually get it. But it comes back on me to learn, not them to get thick skin (I'm not always the speaker, but usually a somewhat confused bystander in these cases).It will raise my hackles when a book uses the version of MLK Jr that only encompasses his Dream speech and not also his other letter, sermons, and speeches. I think they simplified things too much on this respect.The sections laying out how various professors and others in academia have been mistreated was good at pointing out the failings of those areas, but I think that if you are looking for it you could easily find bad behavior in religion, in business, in government, etc. Every aspect of our culture contains humans and within that subset, they may *misbehave* in different ways, but every area has people who misuse power or are unqualified. I also have a few gripes with the way they discuss campus protests. I think we would agree about a lot of this, but I want to point that people like Heather McDonald and Charles Murray have writt books, the people protesting them are almost certainly aware of their views (either by reading the book or discussing parts of it) and they are choosing to say that this person has bad ideas. It is not that HM or CM don't get any chance to speak or promote their ideas - they still have free speech. It is more that students wish the wouldn't be given platforms for these ideas. I agree with Coddling in that violence is abhorrent and counterproductive, but they way they frame the rest of the conversation is in error.Overall - it was a book that made me think, but had some very problematic portions."
66,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1655983-katie,1,"The flaws of this book cloud the conclusion. Some of the flaws:-Anecdotes about campus events are used despite authors demand that everyone be more focused on facts and data. Some of the incidents described are indeed examples of extreme sensitivity and intolerance. Worrisome trend, but not convincing that campuses have abandoned free speech.-Serious lack of time spent on investigating and confirming the issues college students care about. The Trump administration is a frightening turn, threatening institutions and norms - shouldn't we expect young people to protest?-CBT as a treatment for anxiety I get, but as a treatment for real threats and oppression? So insulting! We have an administration threatening to take away healthcare, women's health care, rights of immigrants, gay people, minorities. What happens when a lesbian girl is told a speaker believes she is deviant who needs to go to conversion camp? She should practice CBT and remember the speaker has good intentions? When Richard Spencer coming to campus to spout off about peaceful ethnic cleansing, should students practice CBT? Just because the book does justice to some topics - like IGen social issues, helicopter parenting and safteyism, - does not mean the book works. I also happen to agree this generation does not conceive of the First Amendment like my generation does. College kids raised with awareness of inequality in American, we were raised to worry about authoritarianism and the Cold War. I think the topic deserves scrutiny, but these authors failed in my opinion. "
67,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5862443-joseph-stieb,4,"Full disclosure: I am a Haidt fanboy, so I'm predisposed to like this book. Unlike the Righteous Mind, it is not outstanding. Books that are elaborations of long-form articles rarely are. If you follow Haidt and Lukianoff's work closely, this is mainly a summary of what they have been doing the last 4 years of so (see Haidt's excellent Wriston Lecture for a distillation). Still, this is a strong, well-sourced, and fair-minded argument about where higher ed has turned wrong and how it can be rectified.Haidt and Lukianoff argue for an older understanding of the purpose of higher education: the pursuit of truth rather than the furthering of a political agenda. They convincingly show how higher ed has become more partisan and less ideologically diverse, although they don't do much to show how this stultifies and biases research and teaching (for more on this, see Shields and Dunn's outstanding Passing on the Right). Their focus is on why things like trigger warnings, disinvitations, interruptions of speakers, micro-aggressions, etc have surged on campus in the last 5 years or so. The core of their argument is less about ideology than generational shifts. Despite the somewhat inflammatory title, they put forth a complex, nuanced argument that the I-Gen (born in mid 1990s, came of age with cellphones and social media as normal things, in contrast to millennial, who were teens when the iPhone and facebook came out) is a far more anxious and dependent generation that doesn't know how to handle conflict on its own and has been coached to go to the authorities instead. Take a far more polarized, bureaucratized university system, and you get more kids calling for ""coddling"" and more administrators giving it to them to prevent their school from becoming the next Yale or Missouri. The leftist intellectual framework that these students embrace (redefinition of safety and violence, identitarian common enemy politics, a radical interpretation intersectionality, the dismissal of anything written by a dead white guy as not worth reading because he must have been a racist/sexist) isn't the deeper cause of this surge in left-wing activism on campus. Rather, changes in the climate of US politics and the way kids are raised primes them to take in this ideological system. This can be changed on both ends, although I am more interested in how to change to college atmosphere and how to make these ideas (each of which has some value) more realistic and less polarizing and politically ""weaponized.""The intellectual cases put forth against all of these concepts that have crept into academia are excellent, as usual. They explain how each of these things encourages mentally and intellectually unhealthy thinking, feeds tribalism, and makes open, trusting conversation impossible on campus. Still, I thought they were getting a little loose from their moorings in their criticism of modern parenting. It is hard to tell parents to not be a little over-protective of their kids. There are ways to do this (like more unstructured time built into a kid's day, at school and at home, plus less screen time) but overall I think most parents do a pretty good job. I think they are both part of pretty elite social circles in which tiger parenting was very common. My middle class upbringing seemed to have plenty of free time, and my parents let me and my brothers roam the neighborhood pretty freely. I wouldn't dismiss all of their argument about parenting, but it was probably the weak link in the book.I'd recommend this book to anyone concerned about changes on campus or anyone who has heard about Haidt and is curious. It is concise, and very qualified. As usual, Haidt's critics have misrepresented his argument left and right, so make sure you go to the source."
68,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25032671-kris,4,"I first read Bloom's original The Closing of the American Mind just so that I could read this book. While it's useful to have the earlier background on past decades in academia, Bloom's original is not required reading before enjoying Haidt's great contribution here.These authors lead the reader through some great analyses -- they show how a drastic shift in the mentality of arguments/debate on college campuses happened in 2013, along with a seemingly drastic shift in mindset surrounding the purpose of education. I'll list some of their principles here: Prepare the child for the road, not the road for the child. We are all prone to emotional reasoning and confirmation bias. Your worst enemy cannot harm you as much as your own unguarded thoughts. People are prone to catastroph-izing about the future. We are all prone to tribalism. Many psychological principles on college campuses encourage students to embrace foolishness, rather than wisdom. Young people are innately anti-fragile, but they learn helplessness in correlation with rising rates of adolescent depression and anxiety, a shift to more protective parenting, and widespread play deprivation and risk deprivation. We are seeing rising political polarization and expanded bureaucracy. We also see a rising passion for justice combined with a growing commitment to attaining equal outcomes in all areas. The rise in passion for justice is admirable on its own, but when combined with a demand to see equity, not equality, it becomes misguided.Some falsehoods: What doesn't kill you, makes you weaker.

70,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4859940-tara-brabazon,3,"An important book to read - and disagree with. This monograph explores how 'fragility' is being developed in children, adolescence and students on university campuses. While much of the attention is on the left and social justice politics, there is some focus on the polarization of politics from the alt-right.The problems with this book are clear. The authors confuse a diversity of facts and interpretations with emotions rather than rigour. EH Carr stated in 1961 that ""history means interpretation."" Only particular facts have survived to our present. Therefore assuming that the source material - the material culture - that remains in our present is accurate, true and convincing while alternative interpretations are emotional or intuitive perpetuates a mis-understanding of history, media and politics.Are students fragile? Perhaps. The greater question is why students are fragile. That is the question not asked or answered in this book. Unemployment, under-employment, exhorbitant fees for education, ridiculous payments for privatized utilities, and ill-information public policies are only part of our corrosive present.Protests exist because there is no space to be different, to be defiant, and - in the case of George Floyd - to breathe. This is not emotion or intent. This is verified and an outcome of claustropolitan structures. A provocative book. It lacks a deep engagement of the political economy. Therefore - and ironically - it is part of the identity politics superficiality it wishes to critique."
71,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7258380-dan-graser,5,"This collaboration between Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt is fantastic on many levels and addresses a thorny issue with precision, honesty, and language that is free of the usual superficial pejoratives found in such discussions. They begin with three fundamental Untruths that they have distilled from their own experiences working in academia and social psychology:1) What doesn't kill you makes you weaker.2) Always trust your feelings.3) Life is a battle between good people and evil people.These ideas are discussed in the context of current political divides, campus culture, parenting, and general discourse on social media. Throughout, they use 6 ""explanatory threads"" to understand how we have gotten where we are, sociologically and politically:1) There has been a steady increase in affective polarization since the 1980's, such that people don't feel a stronger kinship with their party but bond more over hatred of the opposition.2) There has been a nation-wide rise in adolescent anxiety and depression since 2011, mainly affecting those who belong to the ""iGen"" or Generation Z.3) There has been a shift, starting in the 80's and reaching a peak in the 90's among more educated families especially, to fearful and needlessly overprotective ""paranoid parenting.""4) The steady decline of unsupervised free play among children due to the above trend. 5) The growth of campus bureaucracy and the expansion of over-protection of students who themselves, don't wish it or need it, resulting in the transmission of the very type of psychological issues the campus is trying to prevent. 6) The rise of social justice activism, rightfully, in response to turbulent and emotionally powerful political events between 2012 and 2018.As someone who works in academia and is genuinely concerned about students' well-being, I always enjoy reading works that provide data, facts, and arguments based in psychology to suggest how we can improve that mission while dealing with the issues present in the larger social-political context, with which our students are dealing. This book contains the finest discussion of this I have seen in addition to great, level-headed discussions of modern parenting, social justice activism, and identity politics. Well worth your time!"

Still, more people should be talking about some silly viewpoints that are popular at the moment. "
73,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2319320-melissa,5,"Wonder why the young generation seems so bad at thinking? This book sheds light on what ""we"" collectively as a society have done to cause it. We've taught three falsehoods as truth: That individuals are fragile, that we can trust our feelings, that life is a battle between good and bad people. Do you feel, like me, that there is no way you're going to write down your thoughts on a particular topic esp. publicly, because no matter how well reasoned or how good your intentions, if you use one wrong word, you're deemed evil for life by one side or the other? (You're ""cancelled."") We've hearkened back to the time of witch hunts, and I found that chapter of the history of what leads to the eras of witch hunts (which we're in a time of those right now) enlightening about why the heck one word in a well meant email can cause a person's complete ruin. We need to get back to a time where we give people the benefit of the doubt! The information on Cognitive Behavior Therapy was also enlightening. As a society, we are essentially going against good psychological practice and teaching bad ways of thinking. One of my sons is a doomsday thinker and I'm happy to have some of these CBT tools to see if I can help him stop the negative thinking habits of thinking the worst about everything and everybody. We see this reflected in society right now, everyone jumps to conclusions on a story that's not an hour old with nothing but a headline and decide they have the ability to be judge, jury, and executioner on that alone and then move on as if ruining that person's life was not a weighty matter. I don't want my son growing up to be like that and it's been frustrating to try to talk him out of his thought processes because I want him to grown up sound of mind unlike many people I've encountered lately, and I've wondered why it is they can be such bad thinkers, and this book enlightens on that some of the reasons.The practical application section is worth the price of the read on what we can do to turn the boat around. Thankfully, I've been already doing a lot of the suggestions for my kids in my determination to have them grow up sound of mind, but this was nice to have the facts and stats to help solidify what I'm doing to help. This is another book that shows our overly scheduled, screen-heavy existence is doing nothing good for our youth. The authors of this book reveal toward the end of the book what their political leanings are and they're nearly the opposite of mine, but I'd say there is no slant, because I agreed with nearly all of it, it was logical, reasoned, well laid out--we're facing a problem that affects both sides of the political spectrum. It is a bit of a slog at the beginning with all the research and the fact that they are very academic writers with the ""I'll tell you this, I'm telling you, and now I'll summarize what I just told you"" which probably is all right if you're one to read at leisure instead of read books from cover to cover like me, that would help you remember what you read if you put it down for any amount of time, but be forewarned that it isn't a fast paced read. But it's an excellent read."
74,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2007216-peter-derk,4,"What an interesting book.I think what would prevent most people from reading this is probably some version of a sentiment that can be summed up as ""Okay Boomer."" But if that's how you're feeling, I would encourage you to give it a shot.Although there are lots of examples from college campuses, they're pretty balanced between things that overly-sensitive people are doing and things that crazy people are doing (usually white power weirdos). And while there is some condemnation of behavior, I felt like the author was very empathetic towards people and wasn't saying anything remotely like, ""These snowflakes need to shape up!"" or ""These iGen kids are ruining everything!"" If you read it that way, that's probably your preconceived notion and sensitivity lenses at work, not the real content of the book. The most interesting portions to me were related to parenting and how much it's changed in just a few decades. There was a section that listed a checklist for parents for school readiness for young kids. 30 or 40 years ago, the list was a lot of things like, ""You child can ride a two-wheel bicycle, Your child can walk alone to a store or home 2 or 3 blocks away..."" where now it looks more like, ""Your child can spell phonetically, Your child can understand basic mathematical concepts..."" So where once it was ""Is your child capable of managing their physical safety?"" now it's more ""Can your child fill out a worksheet?"" Which seems profoundly stupid to me. This is my Okay Boomer moment, so buckle up.When I was a kid we used to roam around the town in small groups of 2-4 kids. Sometimes on bikes, sometimes just walking. And it wasn't like we had to check in every hour with our parents. I rode the bus to the mall. I would go to the grocery store alone or with a friend. In the summer, this was basically all we did, screw around during unstructured time. You learn a lot without realizing it. You learn to avoid true danger, like weirdos and creeps. You learn how to do simple shit like walk into a grocery store, pick something out and pay for it. You learn how to take a bus. You learn the geography of where you live. I had a coworker who lived in a very safe neighborhood and wouldn't allow her son to walk to the bus alone. It was like a block. Eventually, she did let him do it, but he had to be on a walkie talkie and talk to her the whole time until he got on the bus. I've had a number of people tell me that when their kids are learning to drive, they have no idea where they are inside of their own towns. They don't know how to get from home to school. Every day, the school I work next to, parents line up their cars to drive up to the door of the school, at which point their child is released, gets in the car, and then the parents drive them home. Like they're goddamn diplomats in need of a secure escort. This line of cars extends several blocks, and parents will wait up to an hour in a line of cars to pick up their kids. The kids can walk or bike or whatever, but very few, if any, do this, and if they do want to do it this way the parents have to sign a waiver. I can already hear the parents: You don't have a kid, so you don't understand. If you don't have kids, you'll hear this all the time. And I totally agree, I don't have the emotional understanding of a parent. However, I would proffer this: I probably have a more realistic assessment of danger to children because I'm NOT a parent. I'm not emotionally invested, which means when I'm looking at the realistic dangers, my thinking isn't tainted by my personal stakes. There are some parents who agree with me, that kids should have a little more freedom. There was the mom profiled in the book, the sort of mother of the Free Range Kids movement, who let her young son ride the subway home by himself at one point, which turned out great.I do think kids probably need a little more room, a little more agency, and a little less structure. One of the more profound insights in the book had to do with the level of discourse we're experiencing today. In short, people suck at discussing things because they never had un-referee'ed disagreements as kids. When you're a kid, if you're playing a game with 4 other kids, you have to learn how to argue or disagree without the other kid getting up and leaving, at which point the game is unplayable. Newer parents tend to referee everything, jumping in if things get intense. But letting kids work these things out themselves might be a way to help them learn the skills of discussing things without getting to the point that everyone takes their ball and goes home.The best part of the book, however, is that it offers a lot of potential solutions. I've found that I'm a solutions-based thinking, so solutions speak to me. Even when I disagree with the solutions, I think solutions-oriented thinking speaks to me and gets me thinking along the lines of productive movement. Way too many books that I might put in the sociology category seem very focused on talking about the problem. I usually hear what the author is saying and think, ""Okay, I buy that this is a problem, but what now?"" To borrow an analogy from another book, a problem that's well-explained is great, but if you went to the doctor with a pain, and if that doctor could explain why you're feeling this pain, does knowing the pain's origin solve the problem? No. You go to the doctor not for an explanation of the history of the pain, but for the cure. It's how I feel when a cold is being passed around the office, and everyone wants to trace back to patient zero. As if it's really that person's fault. Sidebar: it's my pet peeve that people come in when they're sick. Don't do that. But once you're sick, figuring out who ""got you sick"" is a complete waste of time and energy. Once you know, does that help your symptoms? Does it speed your recovery? Absolutely not. Yes, I think the history of some things can be valuable in understanding them. But the history and origin of a problem without solution is not terribly useful. I think a lot of people don't have the guts to offer a solution. Because that's the easiest thing to attack. You can nitpick someone's solution, which will be seen as an effective way of discrediting their entire argument. Which is stupid. I deeply appreciate the solutions offered in this book, especially because they're solutions based mostly in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (which totally works) and because they're solutions that any individual can choose to apply. It's not a set of solutions that goes ""You motherfuckers need to stop doing X."" It's a set of solutions oriented towards, ""If you want to be a better person and have a better life, here are some realistic options.""Great read, and I'd definitely call it a must-read for parents of young kids who haven't given a lot of thought to giving their kid some rope. And parents who feel pressured by other parents, who are afraid of being seen as bad parents."
75,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31910342-josh,3,"I previously read Lukianoff's ""Unlearning Liberty"" earlier this year. While I thoroughly enjoyed that work, I was somewhat disappointed by this joint venture with social psychologist Jonathan Haidt. This is partly because while ""Unlearning Liberty"" was a searching examination of how higher education in recent years has failed in its central purpose to discover ""truth"" by prohibiting many forms of offensive speech on campus, this book tries to further that inquiry in some ways by putting together a composite of factors for why ""iGen"" (those who were born c. 1996) have embraced ""safetyism"" on college campuses. ""Safetyism"" is essentially the conflation of being offended with being in physical danger. The book is divided into three parts. The first unpacks what the authors call the ""three great untruths"" that iGen embraces: the world is divided between distinctly ""good"" people and wholly ""bad"" people; trust your feelings (i.e. emotional reasoning over logic); and ""safetyism"" which the authors describe as ""what doesn't hurt you, makes you weaker."" The second narrates a series of recent episodes of censorship and both far left/far right violence on college campuses, such as Berkeley Antifa protests against Milo Yiannopolis, the Alt-Right protests at UVA; and the Charles Murray episode at Middlebury. The final part explains what the authors believe are the six contributing factors that are the ""bad ideas [that] are setting up a generation for failure."" The last two chapters in this section deal with a) how parents should ideally raise children to be thick-skinned and critically thinking adults and b) how primary and secondary education can offer adolescents and teenagers the mental toolset to confront offensive ideas and grow intellectually from such debates. There is a lot of ground to cover in any review of this book (and much of what follows in this paragraph I explain in more detail in my review of Unlearning Liberty). But, the gist is that colleges and universities should be wholly focused on discerning ""truth."" Various public intellectuals, such as Van Jones, have argued that colleges provide people with a rare opportunity to grapple with offensive ideas and speech by using reasoning and argument. College should be a ""gym,"" to borrow from Van Jones, that trains people to debate and compromise within our democratic system. Since the early 2010s, though, many colleges (and almost exclusively the most liberal ones) have become distracted from the goal of seeking ""truth"" by protecting students from potentially offensive speech. There's an appropriate discussion within this section of how the left has stretched the definition of ""violence"" to include intuitively nonviolent actions, such as speech. By construing offensive speech as ""violent,"" college administrators, faculty, and students have effectively nullified the free speech privileges of a wide swathe of conservative intellectuals (and alt-right wackos) by appealing to the need to keep students ""safe"" on campus. The six factors that have contributed to the current climate of ""Safetyism,"" censorship, and unrest are best summed up as follows:1) American politics have become increasingly polarized (entering a ""polarization cycle"") where very little compromise is ever reached between left and right.2) The advent of social media and the internet has made ""iGen"" far more depressed and anxious than previous generations. 3) Parents since the 1980s have increasingly become ""helicopter"" parents, not allowing their children to experience any discomfort and sheltering them from the real world, so to speak. 4) What the authors term the ""decline of [free] play."" In other words, children have far less time relative to previous generations to socialize, initiate play, and be creative. This is caused by the fact that elite colleges and universities select from those with an abundance of extracurriculars (etc.) and parents respond by over-structuring their children's time with various activities. 5) Primary and secondary education have become obsessed with keeping students ""safe"" from offensive ideas and taboo subjects. 6) ""Social justice"" and its quest for equal outcomes has created a ""common enemy identity politics"" focused on subdividing people into various ""intersectional"" identities. The authors compare this to Martin Luther King, Jr.'s ""common humanity"" identity politics that sought to authentically include all Americans in the civil rights movement by appealing to the American civic religion. These six factors (covered in six chapters) are unevenly persuasive, although I generally agree with the authors that the cult of ""safe spaces"" and ""free speech zones"" on campuses is extremely problematic. I think I agree with some of the other reviews on Goodreads that some of their solutions contain assumptions grounded in a middle-class ethos. Specifically, their idea that children should be given more rein to explore their neighborhoods, talk to strangers, and even use public transportation at young ages (i.e. nine years old). The authors argue that our perception of danger is massively inflated by the 24 hour news cycle and John Walsh's crusade to catch ""America's Most Wanted."" I agree in part, but would argue that many parents (and single parents) living in certain rural or urban areas with high crime rates have legitimate concerns about allowing their children to be ""free range children."" Being a parent myself, I generally found their Dr. Spock parental advice annoying, at best, and naive at worst. Overall, an informative book that resonated well with my experience on campus the past seven years. Excepting the final two concluding chapters, I completely recommend this book to anyone seriously interested in learning more about what is happening on America's college campuses. But you should first read ""Unlearning Liberty."" "

This book was a real eye-opener on many levels for me, all of which will help me have a better understanding of ways in which my political peeps can swing too far to the left and to be a better parent. The book also helped me to reexamine the educational choices that I have made for my 10 year old. I highly recommend this book, even though I didn't agree with everything that the authors had stated.

It is extremely well organized around key points. Every idea in the book is well substantiated. There are a wealth of references and data the authors used to make their points about the current problems of fragility, anti-free speech movements, depression and anxiety among university students. Although, it primarily focuses on US universities, it can easily be extrapolated to other major universities in the western world."

Kidding.This book is so relevant to the culture that we live in and the future that we are entering into. With its many different antidotes and research, the author does a fantastic job of bringing to the surface different lies (or 'Untruths' as he calls it) that have good intentions but can lead to detrimental effects overall. The stories can definitely get your blood pumping and outrage you at points and I think that's the point. 10/10 would recommend this to most people.One of the best parts of the book is the way the authors write in such a humble and transparent way. The consistently mention how the issues are more complex than they make them out to be and never claim to have the only answer. They also very openly share their political views and how they could influence their own writing when writing about political polarization. So good!"
79,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3730838-maggie-boyd,2,"I'm always interested in books critiquing our current educational system and sat down to read this one with enthusiasm. However, this book is less about what is wrong with our system and more about criticizing liberals for the horrors they have wrought upon our society. It begins with vilifying our current crop of college students: kids born after 1995 who began going to college in 2013. These children are having three great untruths fed to them by liberal universities: 1. The Untruth of Fragility: What doesn't kill you makes you weaker. 2. The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: Always trust your feelings. 3. The Untruth of Us versus Them: Life is a battle between good people and evil people. They go on to say that by creating safe spaces, colleges teach students to believe the above. The evidence? Students are preventing speakers from holding lectures they disagree with at their universities. As others have pointed out, this in no way keeps the speaker from disseminating their ideas. Milo, the target of one of these riots, was still making television appearances and publishing books. The students were asking that he not be allowed to speak in spaces their tuition paid for, a very different thing than asking that he never be allowed to speak anywhere. Moreover, this wasn't a question of not giving the speaker a chance to present his point but a reaction to the point the speaker had already made. Finally, the United States has over 3,000 4 yr. universities and the author's ""evidence"" centers around approximately 1% of those institutions having students make demands they felt were unreasonable. This is nowhere near epidemic. Then the authors get to what I felt was the primary point: Viewpoint diversity reduces a community’s susceptibility to witch hunts. One of the most important kinds of viewpoint diversity, diversity of political thought, has declined substantially among both professors and students at American universities since the 1990s. To sum up the first portion of the book has two major points: Anything that prevents someone from making a point, even if that point is offensive, is ""coddling"" and colleges are too liberal. We need more balance. (They didn't speak to the 600 Christian colleges where the staff is predominantly conservative.) After spending several chapters ""building a case"" on how the great untruths listed in the first paragraph are destroying young collegiate minds, the author's come to a startling conclusion: You can see why it was hard for us to make a strong case that universities were causing students to become anxious and depressed by teaching them disordered ways of thinking. Anxiety and depression rates were already rising for all teenagers before they arrived at college, and for those who never attended college as well. Clearly universities were not causing a national mental health crisis; they were responding to one. With liberal universities out as a scapegoat, bring in liberal parenting policies. Safteyism, where parents go to purportedly unreasonable limits to protect their kids might be a factor in kids being more fearful, which might be a factor in them being depressed. No direct evidence of this is available but they offer up some random events and show how those few events point to liberals running amok and creating too much fear in our kids. They have to admit, grudgingly, that many of the safety measures have worked. Putting it all together, from 1960 to 1990, there was a 48% reduction in deaths from unintended injuries and accidents among kids between five and fourteen years of age, and a 57% drop in deaths of younger kids (ages one to four).Lukianoff, Greg. The Coddling of the American Mind (p. 169). Penguin Publishing Group. Kindle Edition. In summary, the authors offer anecdotes and a handful of studies to showcase their points but the math in no way supports what they are saying. If you are someone who feels PC culture is at the heart of what is wrong with our country, you'll love this book and may believe it supports your view point. If you know how to do elementary school level math and have an understanding of the basic principle of percentages, you will quickly realize this tome is meant to speak into a very specific echo chamber and provides no substantial evidence to support the view that liberals will be the death of America."

He previously wrote The Righteous Mind, which was a powerful and thought-provoking read. Haidt, along with Greg Lukianoff, provide another powerful analysis and thought-provoking read with this book. I would recommend it to any and everyone. While there are specific recommendations that some may have differing personal preferences/opinions on, there is no lack of research in their presentation and arguments (and it’s safe to say they would welcome the discourse of another perspective). I especially appreciated their inclusion of CBT and how that could be a beneficial practice for many to adopt, as well as parents and institutions to encourage and teach. Looking forward to anything else Haidt writes. "

Over the 3 months since I finished The Coddling of the American Mind I cannot believe how many times I have shared the ideas of these authors with others. This book is just so pertinent, so timely, and so important that it comes up again and again. I generally read books and move on to the next so quickly, but this one has found a permanence in my worldview. I think that makes it worthy of 5 stars.Nov 21, 2018Why are so many college students struggling with anxiety and depression? Why are so many university campuses coming up against student demands to disinvite ""dangerous"" guest speakers, to penalize professors who propone unpopular opinions, and to dismiss any who threaten their conception of safety? This very insightful book discusses 3 great untruths of the ""IGen"" (the generation born after 1994, coinciding with the ubiquity of the iPhone): The Untruth of Fragility: What doesn’t kill you makes you weaker. The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: Always trust your feelings. The Untruth of Us Versus Them: Life is a battle between good people and evil people.It shows have parents and institutions have unwittingly taught youth these untruths, and have - with the best of intentions - coddled them to the point of handicapping their ability to handle the adult world. Within this framework, I gained some new insights into the reasons for our increasingly partisan political world.One thing I really like about The Coddling of the American Mind is that, unlike many books of this genre, it doesn't just rip down the system, telling us everything that's wrong with society, then leave us hopeless. Lukianoff and Haidt give pages of good, solid suggestions for how to correct the problems we have created. I would absolutely recommend this book to parents today, as well as to anyone in education or educational administration. It is quite bipartisan, but not afraid to point out problems on both side of the political spectrum. I already put the audiobook on hold for my husband!4.5 stars."

It was validating to read from a secular source of a different political affiliation than me the same identification of major problems I see in our culture/universities/media. Some problems I’d wholeheartedly agree with include, treating children & young adults as if they are fragile, assuming the worst about people who disagree with you, elevating “safetyism” as a top goal in life, tolerating a “call-out” culture that represses legitimate criticism and intimidates/shames people, and embracing identity politics. It was refreshing to read. The authors are sometimes too optimistic about what can bring about the turning of the ship, and sometimes they are too repetitive. Overall, I’d highly recommend the book to anyone working with iGen, any school and university administrators, and parents."

87,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7743315-jeanne,4,"Education should not be intended to make people comfortable; it is meant to make them think. – Hanna Holborn GrayI look for books that are going to make me think, make me see things differently. Coddling of the American Mind did this. In brief, it is about three great Untruths that are affecting US universities and making them weaker: that we are protecting them from things that they see as dangerous, because – although there are good people, there are also evil ones. The great Untruths are:1. The Untruth of Fragility: What doesn’t kill you makes you weaker. 2. The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: Always trust your feelings. 3. The Untruth of Us Versus Them: Life is a battle between good people and evil people. (p. 4) Lukianoff and Haidt are provocative, but also good at bringing together diverse kinds of information together to help us recognize, as the subtitle goes, ""how good intentions and bad ideas are setting up a generation for failure.""For a book about the dichotomous and extreme thinking characterizing parenting, students, and the university system in the 21st century, Lukianoff and Haidt slip into dichotomous thinking. As do we all from time to time.We are in an age of helicopter parenting – even bulldozer parenting – where parents attempt to intervene with their college-aged children in a way that my daughters, frustratingly, would not allow me to do when they were in grade school. Rather than helping them, except in the short-term, this sort of parenting (and overscheduling, failing to allow or encourage free play, etc.) leaves students to becoming fragile, anxious, and easily hurt. Lukianoff and Haidt argue compellingly that college students should and must be exposed to viewpoint diversity, which will help them think more critically, understand diverse perspectives, and withstand events that would otherwise make them depressed and anxious. As the authors conclude, this means that we should beseeking out challenges (rather than eliminating or avoiding everything that “feels unsafe”), freeing yourself from cognitive distortions (rather than always trusting your initial feelings), and taking a generous view of other people, and looking for nuance (rather than assuming the worst about people within a simplistic us-versus-them morality). (p. 14)I appreciated Coddling of the American Mind, but I was often annoyed and irritated by it – which are not good outcomes for this time of year. Lukianoff and Haidt gathered interesting and often compelling threads, but I wasn't convinced by all of their evidence. Clearly, there is more anxiety and depression on campus than when I was in school, but that isn't necessarily a function of ""coddling,"" but of greater access on college campuses. Students who would not have been able to attend college 20 years ago can.While Lukianoff and Haidt criticize students' complaints about controversial and noncontroversial speakers (e.g., George Will, Bill Maher, Eric Holder, Madeleine Albright), I am less dismayed. I like that students are more likely to set limits about things that my generation accepted (e.g., #metoo).Current parenting practices, among many other things, have both strengths and weaknesses. Lukianoff and Haidt primarily focus on the downside here, but maybe we can look for some nuance and attempt to create a stronger model for the next generation of parents – and universities."
88,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3052770-teri,4,"This is an important read in today's society. This book is a look at the iGen generation that seems to be obsessed with technology and social media. The authors look at how ready access to news and social media affects attitudes and higher education. iGen students seem to be obsessed with protecting themselves against any other opinion than their own. They are less open to expanding their worldview and listening to opposing views to gain a broader understanding of today's society. This has led to students feeling ""unsafe"" when dealing with someone who does not share their views. Are they truly physically unsafe or are they just unable to process opposing views? Instead of engaging in open, civil debate or listening to gain understanding, students are sheltered and professors and administrators kowtow to students, offering special ""safe spaces,"" firing faculty who simply exercise their first amendment right, or even canceling guest speakers whose views are not shared with the majority of students. In essence, the authors suggest that we are coddling America's youth and young adults, sheltering them to the point that they are unable to process opinions and ideas that they do not identify with. The authors spend a lot of time discussing how technology and social media have affected current attitudes and lifestyles. Where once young kids would go out and play in the neighborhood, without constant adult supervision, they are today being watched by helicopter parents, suggesting that kids are being overprotected. Are we coddling the younger generations to the point that they are unable to psychologically handle uncomfortable positions? It is certainly worth thinking about and this book will open that discussion to consider if we are doing a disservice to our youth.I think this is a must-read for parents, teachers, and faculty of higher education. These are the children that will one day rule our nation. How will they handle our future?"

From the way, this generation of college students was raised to how schools handled shaping these young people. All of this has led to creating overprotected young adults who are taking longer to mature. The authors' intentions are to help future generations not need overprotection from society as they enter the real world and leave their family home. While kids are young they need the freedom to make mistakes and have those times used as a learning experience. Basically to sum it up let kids take risks while they're growing up. “Prepare your child for the road, not the road for your child.” "

It tackles issues within both the political left and the political right. The book mainly focuses in on college campuses which have become increasingly left-wing but the authors also zoom out and look at the poor reactions from right-wing fringe groups and even mainstream conservatism. The two authors have presented a strong case for free speech and a renewed sense of trust in the American people to be able to sift through different ideas and make smart choices about which ones reign true and which ones prove false. Highly recommend!

92,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28777221-sharad-pandian,3,"If you've been following the fracas on and surrounding American universities, there's nothing new in this book for you.As the title suggests, Jonathan Haidt and Greg Lukianoff argue that American children from the iGen generation (born 1995 or beyond) are raised in situations and using methods unique in ways that make them interpret discomfort as danger. This makes them unable to cope, and harms them and their causes.I. Why this book is a waste of spaceTo understand why this book goes wrong, its important to appreciate a central tension in the way we think about ideas. On one hand, clearly people have been wrong about so much in the past and therefore as Mill suggests we should keep avenues for debate and change always open. On the other hand, the content of ideas currently held actually matter because they shape the world we live in both symbolically and materially. Therefore, if a certain idea is deemed wrong, it is important to resist it and its spread. It's the inability of creatures like ourselves, condemned to live in time, to resolve this tension in any general way that leads to so much chatter about free speech and its limits.The problem with the authors of this book is that they model debates as though ideas don't matter except for debate, as though fermenting debate itself were the point of ideas. The notion that there power differentials that are deeply entrenched and might not be removed by polite argumentation doesn't even come up.For example, a convenient manner to think about oppression is through ""structural analysis"" which helps make sense of the institutions and experiences that are frequent and persistent. To live in this miasma isn't merely about encountering scary ideas but actually being harmed in a variety of ways, and it really is unclear what the best way to resist and liberate. But the authors are convinced that they know best, since obviously more speech and more ideas is how victory will be won. They make much use of how the recent victories for same-sex marriage included campaigning that stressed similarity and shared community, but conveniently leave out how Stonewall was a riot.When they come close to discussing the obviously relevant idea of power, they just manage feebly to say:In calling for the dismantling of power structures, the author was using a set of terms and concepts that are common in some academic departments; the main line of argumentation fell squarely within the large family of Marxist approaches to social and political analysis. It’s a set of approaches in which things are analyzed primarily in terms of power. Groups struggle for power. Within this paradigm, when power is perceived to be held by one group over others, there is a moral polarity: the groups seen as powerful are bad, while the groups seen as oppressed are good. It’s a variant of the pathological dualism that Rabbi Sacks described in the quotation at the start of this chapter.All structural analysis are first reduced to ""groups struggle for power"" and then into instances of ""pathological dualism"" between the ""unimpeachably good and the irredeemably bad"".There are a lot of serious critiques possible about the relevance and fruitfulness of thinking about oppression as ""structural"", but this glib dismissal is intellectually embarrassing.Their unwillingness to take power seriously makes this entire book a slog through shallow liberal moralizing. Instead of responding to Down Girl: The Logic of Misogyny's point about how it is better to concentrate on the incident and impact instead of intent, because it makes it much, much harder to call out harmful behaviour, they just assume intent is what matters, and so anyone thinks otherwise is labouring under a ""cognitive distortion""The most evident is catastrophizing: If Milo Yiannopoulos is allowed to speak, there will be “broken bodies” on our side. I might lose my “right to exist.” Therefore, violence is justified, because it is self-defense. The author also engages in dichotomous thinking: If you condemn my side’s violence, that means you condone Yiannopoulos’s ideas. You must “pick a side.” You’re either with us or against us. Life is a battle between good people and evil people, and if you disagree with us, you’re one of the evil people…But if asking for peaceful dialogue is violent, then it seems that the word “violence” is taking on new meanings for some students.The point here isn't even that the Milo protests were the obvious way to go (although Milo's inability to get funding since suggests so), but that it's quite impossible to know antecedently or even in the short-term which strategies will be successful. Does treating every small incident as though it's important work better or does taking a more judicious strategy? Despite this lack of clarity about the truth, the authors frame the debate as young college students with good hearts making foolish choices instead of considering that they might possibly be engaging in successful resistance to entrenched evils.II. Why this book is still importantDespite this, there are three reasons this still remains a decent book.First, a significant chunk of the book concerns trends that converge in the iGen generation, including the lack of opportunity for free play, more bureaucracy, etc. It's really fun to read in one place, even if the information isn't new Second, it really is true that a lot of incidents of campus have been horrific, indicating that thinking you're on the right side of history allows for sadism and heedlessness. If you're on social media and have a functioning brain, you know the Left can go overboard in its mob mentality. As from above, I don't think we can say with certainty that these methods as a whole won't be successful, but they clearly do go against strong moral sensibilities at times. The Heckler's veto against anyone conservative, violence, cruelty all seem unacceptable, however much we tell ourselves it might ultimately be for the best.Third, the book is a lot more compelling if we don't think of it as a political project at all, but about psychologists simply talking about trends in the progressive movement that might be affecting mental health, fostering unhealthy ideas, and leading to irrational behaviour. At higher levels of explanation, trends might emerge that might be difficult to account for on a case-by-case basis, and I think the authors present a plausible case that taken as a whole, a lot of practices might be making the situation worse for students.Overall, a book better read as a summary of recent events on American campuses than as any kind of original contribution."
93,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2473528-roseanna-white,5,"Everyone with kids college-aged or younger needs to read this book! It addresses the trend of ""safetyism"" and student fragility--that the ideas of ""dangerous"" have crept from physical harm to emotional discomfort, which is proven not to make our kids STRONGER, but rather emotionally WEAKER. In it the authors not only discuss the problems that have come rather suddenly to college campuses, but the reasons behind them, and how we as parents and educators can correct it . The main theme is that there are Three Great Untruths that a generation has been taught to embrace, but which are what the psychology field knows are ""cognitive distortions."" Harmful ways of thinking that encourage us to see catastrophe, bias, and enemies where there are none. These are things we can universally recognize as untrue...but which are so easy to fall into.I'm not a big non-fiction reader these days, but I loved this book and have already made some changes to the rules for my kids based on the very sound evidence presented in it, as well as the wonderful advice.What I loved most about this book though is that it's quite possibly the only UNBIASED view I've encountered in recent years. Near the end of the book the authors do tell us their political views but up until they came out and said it, I had no idea whether they were liberal or conservative, D or R, even though they were discussing issues that dealt with the widening gap between them. They instead got at exactly what they encourage their readers to get at in our own lives: the wider circle of humanity to which we all belong."

95,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12766685-alison,3,"First - I agree with their argument on free-play time for children. As a mom, I see this as an essential part of growing up and their discussion really helped me to figure out some of the reasons why it has felt important but I was struggling to articulate that. I also appreciated the points they made about safetyism. It is something I have seen and I now have a label for it and can hopefully better communicate the risks.But, I also struggled often with this book. I think that saying someone shouldn't be offended by a comment that you didn't know would be offensive removes the responsibility from the speaker to learn anything that could stop them from saying hurtful/offensive things in the future - most of the examples they use are of ways in which people say things that perpetuate systems of oppression (racism, sexism, etc) and by shrugging things off, the system doesn't get fixed. If the speaker were able to listen and change, then getting offended wouldn't be useful, but too often that's not the outcome. This is a topic I have been working though - I don't always understand why someone got offended, but when I listen or read, I can usually get it. But it comes back on me to learn, not them to get thick skin (I'm not always the speaker, but usually a somewhat confused bystander in these cases).It will raise my hackles when a book uses the version of MLK Jr that only encompasses his Dream speech and not also his other letter, sermons, and speeches. I think they simplified things too much on this respect.The sections laying out how various professors and others in academia have been mistreated was good at pointing out the failings of those areas, but I think that if you are looking for it you could easily find bad behavior in religion, in business, in government, etc. Every aspect of our culture contains humans and within that subset, they may *misbehave* in different ways, but every area has people who misuse power or are unqualified. I also have a few gripes with the way they discuss campus protests. I think we would agree about a lot of this, but I want to point that people like Heather McDonald and Charles Murray have writt books, the people protesting them are almost certainly aware of their views (either by reading the book or discussing parts of it) and they are choosing to say that this person has bad ideas. It is not that HM or CM don't get any chance to speak or promote their ideas - they still have free speech. It is more that students wish the wouldn't be given platforms for these ideas. I agree with Coddling in that violence is abhorrent and counterproductive, but they way they frame the rest of the conversation is in error.Overall - it was a book that made me think, but had some very problematic portions."
96,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1655983-katie,1,"The flaws of this book cloud the conclusion. Some of the flaws:-Anecdotes about campus events are used despite authors demand that everyone be more focused on facts and data. Some of the incidents described are indeed examples of extreme sensitivity and intolerance. Worrisome trend, but not convincing that campuses have abandoned free speech.-Serious lack of time spent on investigating and confirming the issues college students care about. The Trump administration is a frightening turn, threatening institutions and norms - shouldn't we expect young people to protest?-CBT as a treatment for anxiety I get, but as a treatment for real threats and oppression? So insulting! We have an administration threatening to take away healthcare, women's health care, rights of immigrants, gay people, minorities. What happens when a lesbian girl is told a speaker believes she is deviant who needs to go to conversion camp? She should practice CBT and remember the speaker has good intentions? When Richard Spencer coming to campus to spout off about peaceful ethnic cleansing, should students practice CBT? Just because the book does justice to some topics - like IGen social issues, helicopter parenting and safteyism, - does not mean the book works. I also happen to agree this generation does not conceive of the First Amendment like my generation does. College kids raised with awareness of inequality in American, we were raised to worry about authoritarianism and the Cold War. I think the topic deserves scrutiny, but these authors failed in my opinion. "
97,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5862443-joseph-stieb,4,"Full disclosure: I am a Haidt fanboy, so I'm predisposed to like this book. Unlike the Righteous Mind, it is not outstanding. Books that are elaborations of long-form articles rarely are. If you follow Haidt and Lukianoff's work closely, this is mainly a summary of what they have been doing the last 4 years of so (see Haidt's excellent Wriston Lecture for a distillation). Still, this is a strong, well-sourced, and fair-minded argument about where higher ed has turned wrong and how it can be rectified.Haidt and Lukianoff argue for an older understanding of the purpose of higher education: the pursuit of truth rather than the furthering of a political agenda. They convincingly show how higher ed has become more partisan and less ideologically diverse, although they don't do much to show how this stultifies and biases research and teaching (for more on this, see Shields and Dunn's outstanding Passing on the Right). Their focus is on why things like trigger warnings, disinvitations, interruptions of speakers, micro-aggressions, etc have surged on campus in the last 5 years or so. The core of their argument is less about ideology than generational shifts. Despite the somewhat inflammatory title, they put forth a complex, nuanced argument that the I-Gen (born in mid 1990s, came of age with cellphones and social media as normal things, in contrast to millennial, who were teens when the iPhone and facebook came out) is a far more anxious and dependent generation that doesn't know how to handle conflict on its own and has been coached to go to the authorities instead. Take a far more polarized, bureaucratized university system, and you get more kids calling for ""coddling"" and more administrators giving it to them to prevent their school from becoming the next Yale or Missouri. The leftist intellectual framework that these students embrace (redefinition of safety and violence, identitarian common enemy politics, a radical interpretation intersectionality, the dismissal of anything written by a dead white guy as not worth reading because he must have been a racist/sexist) isn't the deeper cause of this surge in left-wing activism on campus. Rather, changes in the climate of US politics and the way kids are raised primes them to take in this ideological system. This can be changed on both ends, although I am more interested in how to change to college atmosphere and how to make these ideas (each of which has some value) more realistic and less polarizing and politically ""weaponized.""The intellectual cases put forth against all of these concepts that have crept into academia are excellent, as usual. They explain how each of these things encourages mentally and intellectually unhealthy thinking, feeds tribalism, and makes open, trusting conversation impossible on campus. Still, I thought they were getting a little loose from their moorings in their criticism of modern parenting. It is hard to tell parents to not be a little over-protective of their kids. There are ways to do this (like more unstructured time built into a kid's day, at school and at home, plus less screen time) but overall I think most parents do a pretty good job. I think they are both part of pretty elite social circles in which tiger parenting was very common. My middle class upbringing seemed to have plenty of free time, and my parents let me and my brothers roam the neighborhood pretty freely. I wouldn't dismiss all of their argument about parenting, but it was probably the weak link in the book.I'd recommend this book to anyone concerned about changes on campus or anyone who has heard about Haidt and is curious. It is concise, and very qualified. As usual, Haidt's critics have misrepresented his argument left and right, so make sure you go to the source."

While it's useful to have the earlier background on past decades in academia, Bloom's original is not required reading before enjoying Haidt's great contribution here.These authors lead the reader through some great analyses -- they show how a drastic shift in the mentality of arguments/debate on college campuses happened in 2013, along with a seemingly drastic shift in mindset surrounding the purpose of education. I'll list some of their principles here: Prepare the child for the road, not the road for the child. We are all prone to emotional reasoning and confirmation bias. Your worst enemy cannot harm you as much as your own unguarded thoughts. People are prone to catastroph-izing about the future. We are all prone to tribalism. Many psychological principles on college campuses encourage students to embrace foolishness, rather than wisdom. Young people are innately anti-fragile, but they learn helplessness in correlation with rising rates of adolescent depression and anxiety, a shift to more protective parenting, and widespread play deprivation and risk deprivation. We are seeing rising political polarization and expanded bureaucracy. We also see a rising passion for justice combined with a growing commitment to attaining equal outcomes in all areas. The rise in passion for justice is admirable on its own, but when combined with a demand to see equity, not equality, it becomes misguided.Some falsehoods: What doesn't kill you, makes you weaker.

100,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4859940-tara-brabazon,3,"An important book to read - and disagree with. This monograph explores how 'fragility' is being developed in children, adolescence and students on university campuses. While much of the attention is on the left and social justice politics, there is some focus on the polarization of politics from the alt-right.The problems with this book are clear. The authors confuse a diversity of facts and interpretations with emotions rather than rigour. EH Carr stated in 1961 that ""history means interpretation."" Only particular facts have survived to our present. Therefore assuming that the source material - the material culture - that remains in our present is accurate, true and convincing while alternative interpretations are emotional or intuitive perpetuates a mis-understanding of history, media and politics.Are students fragile? Perhaps. The greater question is why students are fragile. That is the question not asked or answered in this book. Unemployment, under-employment, exhorbitant fees for education, ridiculous payments for privatized utilities, and ill-information public policies are only part of our corrosive present.Protests exist because there is no space to be different, to be defiant, and - in the case of George Floyd - to breathe. This is not emotion or intent. This is verified and an outcome of claustropolitan structures. A provocative book. It lacks a deep engagement of the political economy. Therefore - and ironically - it is part of the identity politics superficiality it wishes to critique."
101,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7258380-dan-graser,5,"This collaboration between Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt is fantastic on many levels and addresses a thorny issue with precision, honesty, and language that is free of the usual superficial pejoratives found in such discussions. They begin with three fundamental Untruths that they have distilled from their own experiences working in academia and social psychology:1) What doesn't kill you makes you weaker.2) Always trust your feelings.3) Life is a battle between good people and evil people.These ideas are discussed in the context of current political divides, campus culture, parenting, and general discourse on social media. Throughout, they use 6 ""explanatory threads"" to understand how we have gotten where we are, sociologically and politically:1) There has been a steady increase in affective polarization since the 1980's, such that people don't feel a stronger kinship with their party but bond more over hatred of the opposition.2) There has been a nation-wide rise in adolescent anxiety and depression since 2011, mainly affecting those who belong to the ""iGen"" or Generation Z.3) There has been a shift, starting in the 80's and reaching a peak in the 90's among more educated families especially, to fearful and needlessly overprotective ""paranoid parenting.""4) The steady decline of unsupervised free play among children due to the above trend. 5) The growth of campus bureaucracy and the expansion of over-protection of students who themselves, don't wish it or need it, resulting in the transmission of the very type of psychological issues the campus is trying to prevent. 6) The rise of social justice activism, rightfully, in response to turbulent and emotionally powerful political events between 2012 and 2018.As someone who works in academia and is genuinely concerned about students' well-being, I always enjoy reading works that provide data, facts, and arguments based in psychology to suggest how we can improve that mission while dealing with the issues present in the larger social-political context, with which our students are dealing. This book contains the finest discussion of this I have seen in addition to great, level-headed discussions of modern parenting, social justice activism, and identity politics. Well worth your time!"

Still, more people should be talking about some silly viewpoints that are popular at the moment. "
103,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2319320-melissa,5,"Wonder why the young generation seems so bad at thinking? This book sheds light on what ""we"" collectively as a society have done to cause it. We've taught three falsehoods as truth: That individuals are fragile, that we can trust our feelings, that life is a battle between good and bad people. Do you feel, like me, that there is no way you're going to write down your thoughts on a particular topic esp. publicly, because no matter how well reasoned or how good your intentions, if you use one wrong word, you're deemed evil for life by one side or the other? (You're ""cancelled."") We've hearkened back to the time of witch hunts, and I found that chapter of the history of what leads to the eras of witch hunts (which we're in a time of those right now) enlightening about why the heck one word in a well meant email can cause a person's complete ruin. We need to get back to a time where we give people the benefit of the doubt! The information on Cognitive Behavior Therapy was also enlightening. As a society, we are essentially going against good psychological practice and teaching bad ways of thinking. One of my sons is a doomsday thinker and I'm happy to have some of these CBT tools to see if I can help him stop the negative thinking habits of thinking the worst about everything and everybody. We see this reflected in society right now, everyone jumps to conclusions on a story that's not an hour old with nothing but a headline and decide they have the ability to be judge, jury, and executioner on that alone and then move on as if ruining that person's life was not a weighty matter. I don't want my son growing up to be like that and it's been frustrating to try to talk him out of his thought processes because I want him to grown up sound of mind unlike many people I've encountered lately, and I've wondered why it is they can be such bad thinkers, and this book enlightens on that some of the reasons.The practical application section is worth the price of the read on what we can do to turn the boat around. Thankfully, I've been already doing a lot of the suggestions for my kids in my determination to have them grow up sound of mind, but this was nice to have the facts and stats to help solidify what I'm doing to help. This is another book that shows our overly scheduled, screen-heavy existence is doing nothing good for our youth. The authors of this book reveal toward the end of the book what their political leanings are and they're nearly the opposite of mine, but I'd say there is no slant, because I agreed with nearly all of it, it was logical, reasoned, well laid out--we're facing a problem that affects both sides of the political spectrum. It is a bit of a slog at the beginning with all the research and the fact that they are very academic writers with the ""I'll tell you this, I'm telling you, and now I'll summarize what I just told you"" which probably is all right if you're one to read at leisure instead of read books from cover to cover like me, that would help you remember what you read if you put it down for any amount of time, but be forewarned that it isn't a fast paced read. But it's an excellent read."
104,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2007216-peter-derk,4,"What an interesting book.I think what would prevent most people from reading this is probably some version of a sentiment that can be summed up as ""Okay Boomer."" But if that's how you're feeling, I would encourage you to give it a shot.Although there are lots of examples from college campuses, they're pretty balanced between things that overly-sensitive people are doing and things that crazy people are doing (usually white power weirdos). And while there is some condemnation of behavior, I felt like the author was very empathetic towards people and wasn't saying anything remotely like, ""These snowflakes need to shape up!"" or ""These iGen kids are ruining everything!"" If you read it that way, that's probably your preconceived notion and sensitivity lenses at work, not the real content of the book. The most interesting portions to me were related to parenting and how much it's changed in just a few decades. There was a section that listed a checklist for parents for school readiness for young kids. 30 or 40 years ago, the list was a lot of things like, ""You child can ride a two-wheel bicycle, Your child can walk alone to a store or home 2 or 3 blocks away..."" where now it looks more like, ""Your child can spell phonetically, Your child can understand basic mathematical concepts..."" So where once it was ""Is your child capable of managing their physical safety?"" now it's more ""Can your child fill out a worksheet?"" Which seems profoundly stupid to me. This is my Okay Boomer moment, so buckle up.When I was a kid we used to roam around the town in small groups of 2-4 kids. Sometimes on bikes, sometimes just walking. And it wasn't like we had to check in every hour with our parents. I rode the bus to the mall. I would go to the grocery store alone or with a friend. In the summer, this was basically all we did, screw around during unstructured time. You learn a lot without realizing it. You learn to avoid true danger, like weirdos and creeps. You learn how to do simple shit like walk into a grocery store, pick something out and pay for it. You learn how to take a bus. You learn the geography of where you live. I had a coworker who lived in a very safe neighborhood and wouldn't allow her son to walk to the bus alone. It was like a block. Eventually, she did let him do it, but he had to be on a walkie talkie and talk to her the whole time until he got on the bus. I've had a number of people tell me that when their kids are learning to drive, they have no idea where they are inside of their own towns. They don't know how to get from home to school. Every day, the school I work next to, parents line up their cars to drive up to the door of the school, at which point their child is released, gets in the car, and then the parents drive them home. Like they're goddamn diplomats in need of a secure escort. This line of cars extends several blocks, and parents will wait up to an hour in a line of cars to pick up their kids. The kids can walk or bike or whatever, but very few, if any, do this, and if they do want to do it this way the parents have to sign a waiver. I can already hear the parents: You don't have a kid, so you don't understand. If you don't have kids, you'll hear this all the time. And I totally agree, I don't have the emotional understanding of a parent. However, I would proffer this: I probably have a more realistic assessment of danger to children because I'm NOT a parent. I'm not emotionally invested, which means when I'm looking at the realistic dangers, my thinking isn't tainted by my personal stakes. There are some parents who agree with me, that kids should have a little more freedom. There was the mom profiled in the book, the sort of mother of the Free Range Kids movement, who let her young son ride the subway home by himself at one point, which turned out great.I do think kids probably need a little more room, a little more agency, and a little less structure. One of the more profound insights in the book had to do with the level of discourse we're experiencing today. In short, people suck at discussing things because they never had un-referee'ed disagreements as kids. When you're a kid, if you're playing a game with 4 other kids, you have to learn how to argue or disagree without the other kid getting up and leaving, at which point the game is unplayable. Newer parents tend to referee everything, jumping in if things get intense. But letting kids work these things out themselves might be a way to help them learn the skills of discussing things without getting to the point that everyone takes their ball and goes home.The best part of the book, however, is that it offers a lot of potential solutions. I've found that I'm a solutions-based thinking, so solutions speak to me. Even when I disagree with the solutions, I think solutions-oriented thinking speaks to me and gets me thinking along the lines of productive movement. Way too many books that I might put in the sociology category seem very focused on talking about the problem. I usually hear what the author is saying and think, ""Okay, I buy that this is a problem, but what now?"" To borrow an analogy from another book, a problem that's well-explained is great, but if you went to the doctor with a pain, and if that doctor could explain why you're feeling this pain, does knowing the pain's origin solve the problem? No. You go to the doctor not for an explanation of the history of the pain, but for the cure. It's how I feel when a cold is being passed around the office, and everyone wants to trace back to patient zero. As if it's really that person's fault. Sidebar: it's my pet peeve that people come in when they're sick. Don't do that. But once you're sick, figuring out who ""got you sick"" is a complete waste of time and energy. Once you know, does that help your symptoms? Does it speed your recovery? Absolutely not. Yes, I think the history of some things can be valuable in understanding them. But the history and origin of a problem without solution is not terribly useful. I think a lot of people don't have the guts to offer a solution. Because that's the easiest thing to attack. You can nitpick someone's solution, which will be seen as an effective way of discrediting their entire argument. Which is stupid. I deeply appreciate the solutions offered in this book, especially because they're solutions based mostly in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (which totally works) and because they're solutions that any individual can choose to apply. It's not a set of solutions that goes ""You motherfuckers need to stop doing X."" It's a set of solutions oriented towards, ""If you want to be a better person and have a better life, here are some realistic options.""Great read, and I'd definitely call it a must-read for parents of young kids who haven't given a lot of thought to giving their kid some rope. And parents who feel pressured by other parents, who are afraid of being seen as bad parents."
105,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31910342-josh,3,"I previously read Lukianoff's ""Unlearning Liberty"" earlier this year. While I thoroughly enjoyed that work, I was somewhat disappointed by this joint venture with social psychologist Jonathan Haidt. This is partly because while ""Unlearning Liberty"" was a searching examination of how higher education in recent years has failed in its central purpose to discover ""truth"" by prohibiting many forms of offensive speech on campus, this book tries to further that inquiry in some ways by putting together a composite of factors for why ""iGen"" (those who were born c. 1996) have embraced ""safetyism"" on college campuses. ""Safetyism"" is essentially the conflation of being offended with being in physical danger. The book is divided into three parts. The first unpacks what the authors call the ""three great untruths"" that iGen embraces: the world is divided between distinctly ""good"" people and wholly ""bad"" people; trust your feelings (i.e. emotional reasoning over logic); and ""safetyism"" which the authors describe as ""what doesn't hurt you, makes you weaker."" The second narrates a series of recent episodes of censorship and both far left/far right violence on college campuses, such as Berkeley Antifa protests against Milo Yiannopolis, the Alt-Right protests at UVA; and the Charles Murray episode at Middlebury. The final part explains what the authors believe are the six contributing factors that are the ""bad ideas [that] are setting up a generation for failure."" The last two chapters in this section deal with a) how parents should ideally raise children to be thick-skinned and critically thinking adults and b) how primary and secondary education can offer adolescents and teenagers the mental toolset to confront offensive ideas and grow intellectually from such debates. There is a lot of ground to cover in any review of this book (and much of what follows in this paragraph I explain in more detail in my review of Unlearning Liberty). But, the gist is that colleges and universities should be wholly focused on discerning ""truth."" Various public intellectuals, such as Van Jones, have argued that colleges provide people with a rare opportunity to grapple with offensive ideas and speech by using reasoning and argument. College should be a ""gym,"" to borrow from Van Jones, that trains people to debate and compromise within our democratic system. Since the early 2010s, though, many colleges (and almost exclusively the most liberal ones) have become distracted from the goal of seeking ""truth"" by protecting students from potentially offensive speech. There's an appropriate discussion within this section of how the left has stretched the definition of ""violence"" to include intuitively nonviolent actions, such as speech. By construing offensive speech as ""violent,"" college administrators, faculty, and students have effectively nullified the free speech privileges of a wide swathe of conservative intellectuals (and alt-right wackos) by appealing to the need to keep students ""safe"" on campus. The six factors that have contributed to the current climate of ""Safetyism,"" censorship, and unrest are best summed up as follows:1) American politics have become increasingly polarized (entering a ""polarization cycle"") where very little compromise is ever reached between left and right.2) The advent of social media and the internet has made ""iGen"" far more depressed and anxious than previous generations. 3) Parents since the 1980s have increasingly become ""helicopter"" parents, not allowing their children to experience any discomfort and sheltering them from the real world, so to speak. 4) What the authors term the ""decline of [free] play."" In other words, children have far less time relative to previous generations to socialize, initiate play, and be creative. This is caused by the fact that elite colleges and universities select from those with an abundance of extracurriculars (etc.) and parents respond by over-structuring their children's time with various activities. 5) Primary and secondary education have become obsessed with keeping students ""safe"" from offensive ideas and taboo subjects. 6) ""Social justice"" and its quest for equal outcomes has created a ""common enemy identity politics"" focused on subdividing people into various ""intersectional"" identities. The authors compare this to Martin Luther King, Jr.'s ""common humanity"" identity politics that sought to authentically include all Americans in the civil rights movement by appealing to the American civic religion. These six factors (covered in six chapters) are unevenly persuasive, although I generally agree with the authors that the cult of ""safe spaces"" and ""free speech zones"" on campuses is extremely problematic. I think I agree with some of the other reviews on Goodreads that some of their solutions contain assumptions grounded in a middle-class ethos. Specifically, their idea that children should be given more rein to explore their neighborhoods, talk to strangers, and even use public transportation at young ages (i.e. nine years old). The authors argue that our perception of danger is massively inflated by the 24 hour news cycle and John Walsh's crusade to catch ""America's Most Wanted."" I agree in part, but would argue that many parents (and single parents) living in certain rural or urban areas with high crime rates have legitimate concerns about allowing their children to be ""free range children."" Being a parent myself, I generally found their Dr. Spock parental advice annoying, at best, and naive at worst. Overall, an informative book that resonated well with my experience on campus the past seven years. Excepting the final two concluding chapters, I completely recommend this book to anyone seriously interested in learning more about what is happening on America's college campuses. But you should first read ""Unlearning Liberty."" "

This book was a real eye-opener on many levels for me, all of which will help me have a better understanding of ways in which my political peeps can swing too far to the left and to be a better parent. The book also helped me to reexamine the educational choices that I have made for my 10 year old. I highly recommend this book, even though I didn't agree with everything that the authors had stated.

Kidding.This book is so relevant to the culture that we live in and the future that we are entering into. With its many different antidotes and research, the author does a fantastic job of bringing to the surface different lies (or 'Untruths' as he calls it) that have good intentions but can lead to detrimental effects overall. The stories can definitely get your blood pumping and outrage you at points and I think that's the point. 10/10 would recommend this to most people.One of the best parts of the book is the way the authors write in such a humble and transparent way. The consistently mention how the issues are more complex than they make them out to be and never claim to have the only answer. They also very openly share their political views and how they could influence their own writing when writing about political polarization. So good!"
109,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3730838-maggie-boyd,2,"I'm always interested in books critiquing our current educational system and sat down to read this one with enthusiasm. However, this book is less about what is wrong with our system and more about criticizing liberals for the horrors they have wrought upon our society. It begins with vilifying our current crop of college students: kids born after 1995 who began going to college in 2013. These children are having three great untruths fed to them by liberal universities: 1. The Untruth of Fragility: What doesn't kill you makes you weaker. 2. The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: Always trust your feelings. 3. The Untruth of Us versus Them: Life is a battle between good people and evil people. They go on to say that by creating safe spaces, colleges teach students to believe the above. The evidence? Students are preventing speakers from holding lectures they disagree with at their universities. As others have pointed out, this in no way keeps the speaker from disseminating their ideas. Milo, the target of one of these riots, was still making television appearances and publishing books. The students were asking that he not be allowed to speak in spaces their tuition paid for, a very different thing than asking that he never be allowed to speak anywhere. Moreover, this wasn't a question of not giving the speaker a chance to present his point but a reaction to the point the speaker had already made. Finally, the United States has over 3,000 4 yr. universities and the author's ""evidence"" centers around approximately 1% of those institutions having students make demands they felt were unreasonable. This is nowhere near epidemic. Then the authors get to what I felt was the primary point: Viewpoint diversity reduces a community’s susceptibility to witch hunts. One of the most important kinds of viewpoint diversity, diversity of political thought, has declined substantially among both professors and students at American universities since the 1990s. To sum up the first portion of the book has two major points: Anything that prevents someone from making a point, even if that point is offensive, is ""coddling"" and colleges are too liberal. We need more balance. (They didn't speak to the 600 Christian colleges where the staff is predominantly conservative.) After spending several chapters ""building a case"" on how the great untruths listed in the first paragraph are destroying young collegiate minds, the author's come to a startling conclusion: You can see why it was hard for us to make a strong case that universities were causing students to become anxious and depressed by teaching them disordered ways of thinking. Anxiety and depression rates were already rising for all teenagers before they arrived at college, and for those who never attended college as well. Clearly universities were not causing a national mental health crisis; they were responding to one. With liberal universities out as a scapegoat, bring in liberal parenting policies. Safteyism, where parents go to purportedly unreasonable limits to protect their kids might be a factor in kids being more fearful, which might be a factor in them being depressed. No direct evidence of this is available but they offer up some random events and show how those few events point to liberals running amok and creating too much fear in our kids. They have to admit, grudgingly, that many of the safety measures have worked. Putting it all together, from 1960 to 1990, there was a 48% reduction in deaths from unintended injuries and accidents among kids between five and fourteen years of age, and a 57% drop in deaths of younger kids (ages one to four).Lukianoff, Greg. The Coddling of the American Mind (p. 169). Penguin Publishing Group. Kindle Edition. In summary, the authors offer anecdotes and a handful of studies to showcase their points but the math in no way supports what they are saying. If you are someone who feels PC culture is at the heart of what is wrong with our country, you'll love this book and may believe it supports your view point. If you know how to do elementary school level math and have an understanding of the basic principle of percentages, you will quickly realize this tome is meant to speak into a very specific echo chamber and provides no substantial evidence to support the view that liberals will be the death of America."

He previously wrote The Righteous Mind, which was a powerful and thought-provoking read. Haidt, along with Greg Lukianoff, provide another powerful analysis and thought-provoking read with this book. I would recommend it to any and everyone. While there are specific recommendations that some may have differing personal preferences/opinions on, there is no lack of research in their presentation and arguments (and it’s safe to say they would welcome the discourse of another perspective). I especially appreciated their inclusion of CBT and how that could be a beneficial practice for many to adopt, as well as parents and institutions to encourage and teach. Looking forward to anything else Haidt writes. "

Over the 3 months since I finished The Coddling of the American Mind I cannot believe how many times I have shared the ideas of these authors with others. This book is just so pertinent, so timely, and so important that it comes up again and again. I generally read books and move on to the next so quickly, but this one has found a permanence in my worldview. I think that makes it worthy of 5 stars.Nov 21, 2018Why are so many college students struggling with anxiety and depression? Why are so many university campuses coming up against student demands to disinvite ""dangerous"" guest speakers, to penalize professors who propone unpopular opinions, and to dismiss any who threaten their conception of safety? This very insightful book discusses 3 great untruths of the ""IGen"" (the generation born after 1994, coinciding with the ubiquity of the iPhone): The Untruth of Fragility: What doesn’t kill you makes you weaker. The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: Always trust your feelings. The Untruth of Us Versus Them: Life is a battle between good people and evil people.It shows have parents and institutions have unwittingly taught youth these untruths, and have - with the best of intentions - coddled them to the point of handicapping their ability to handle the adult world. Within this framework, I gained some new insights into the reasons for our increasingly partisan political world.One thing I really like about The Coddling of the American Mind is that, unlike many books of this genre, it doesn't just rip down the system, telling us everything that's wrong with society, then leave us hopeless. Lukianoff and Haidt give pages of good, solid suggestions for how to correct the problems we have created. I would absolutely recommend this book to parents today, as well as to anyone in education or educational administration. It is quite bipartisan, but not afraid to point out problems on both side of the political spectrum. I already put the audiobook on hold for my husband!4.5 stars."

It was validating to read from a secular source of a different political affiliation than me the same identification of major problems I see in our culture/universities/media. Some problems I’d wholeheartedly agree with include, treating children & young adults as if they are fragile, assuming the worst about people who disagree with you, elevating “safetyism” as a top goal in life, tolerating a “call-out” culture that represses legitimate criticism and intimidates/shames people, and embracing identity politics. It was refreshing to read. The authors are sometimes too optimistic about what can bring about the turning of the ship, and sometimes they are too repetitive.

117,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7743315-jeanne,4,"Education should not be intended to make people comfortable; it is meant to make them think. – Hanna Holborn GrayI look for books that are going to make me think, make me see things differently. Coddling of the American Mind did this. In brief, it is about three great Untruths that are affecting US universities and making them weaker: that we are protecting them from things that they see as dangerous, because – although there are good people, there are also evil ones. The great Untruths are:1. The Untruth of Fragility: What doesn’t kill you makes you weaker. 2. The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: Always trust your feelings. 3. The Untruth of Us Versus Them: Life is a battle between good people and evil people. (p. 4) Lukianoff and Haidt are provocative, but also good at bringing together diverse kinds of information together to help us recognize, as the subtitle goes, ""how good intentions and bad ideas are setting up a generation for failure.""For a book about the dichotomous and extreme thinking characterizing parenting, students, and the university system in the 21st century, Lukianoff and Haidt slip into dichotomous thinking. As do we all from time to time.We are in an age of helicopter parenting – even bulldozer parenting – where parents attempt to intervene with their college-aged children in a way that my daughters, frustratingly, would not allow me to do when they were in grade school. Rather than helping them, except in the short-term, this sort of parenting (and overscheduling, failing to allow or encourage free play, etc.) leaves students to becoming fragile, anxious, and easily hurt. Lukianoff and Haidt argue compellingly that college students should and must be exposed to viewpoint diversity, which will help them think more critically, understand diverse perspectives, and withstand events that would otherwise make them depressed and anxious. As the authors conclude, this means that we should beseeking out challenges (rather than eliminating or avoiding everything that “feels unsafe”), freeing yourself from cognitive distortions (rather than always trusting your initial feelings), and taking a generous view of other people, and looking for nuance (rather than assuming the worst about people within a simplistic us-versus-them morality). (p. 14)I appreciated Coddling of the American Mind, but I was often annoyed and irritated by it – which are not good outcomes for this time of year. Lukianoff and Haidt gathered interesting and often compelling threads, but I wasn't convinced by all of their evidence. Clearly, there is more anxiety and depression on campus than when I was in school, but that isn't necessarily a function of ""coddling,"" but of greater access on college campuses. Students who would not have been able to attend college 20 years ago can.While Lukianoff and Haidt criticize students' complaints about controversial and noncontroversial speakers (e.g., George Will, Bill Maher, Eric Holder, Madeleine Albright), I am less dismayed. I like that students are more likely to set limits about things that my generation accepted (e.g., #metoo).Current parenting practices, among many other things, have both strengths and weaknesses. Lukianoff and Haidt primarily focus on the downside here, but maybe we can look for some nuance and attempt to create a stronger model for the next generation of parents – and universities."
118,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3052770-teri,4,"This is an important read in today's society. This book is a look at the iGen generation that seems to be obsessed with technology and social media. The authors look at how ready access to news and social media affects attitudes and higher education. iGen students seem to be obsessed with protecting themselves against any other opinion than their own. They are less open to expanding their worldview and listening to opposing views to gain a broader understanding of today's society. This has led to students feeling ""unsafe"" when dealing with someone who does not share their views. Are they truly physically unsafe or are they just unable to process opposing views? Instead of engaging in open, civil debate or listening to gain understanding, students are sheltered and professors and administrators kowtow to students, offering special ""safe spaces,"" firing faculty who simply exercise their first amendment right, or even canceling guest speakers whose views are not shared with the majority of students. In essence, the authors suggest that we are coddling America's youth and young adults, sheltering them to the point that they are unable to process opinions and ideas that they do not identify with. The authors spend a lot of time discussing how technology and social media have affected current attitudes and lifestyles. Where once young kids would go out and play in the neighborhood, without constant adult supervision, they are today being watched by helicopter parents, suggesting that kids are being overprotected. Are we coddling the younger generations to the point that they are unable to psychologically handle uncomfortable positions? It is certainly worth thinking about and this book will open that discussion to consider if we are doing a disservice to our youth.I think this is a must-read for parents, teachers, and faculty of higher education. These are the children that will one day rule our nation. How will they handle our future?"

From the way, this generation of college students was raised to how schools handled shaping these young people. All of this has led to creating overprotected young adults who are taking longer to mature. The authors' intentions are to help future generations not need overprotection from society as they enter the real world and leave their family home. While kids are young they need the freedom to make mistakes and have those times used as a learning experience. Basically to sum it up let kids take risks while they're growing up. “Prepare your child for the road, not the road for your child.” "

It tackles issues within both the political left and the political right. The book mainly focuses in on college campuses which have become increasingly left-wing but the authors also zoom out and look at the poor reactions from right-wing fringe groups and even mainstream conservatism. The two authors have presented a strong case for free speech and a renewed sense of trust in the American people to be able to sift through different ideas and make smart choices about which ones reign true and which ones prove false. Highly recommend!

122,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28777221-sharad-pandian,3,"If you've been following the fracas on and surrounding American universities, there's nothing new in this book for you.As the title suggests, Jonathan Haidt and Greg Lukianoff argue that American children from the iGen generation (born 1995 or beyond) are raised in situations and using methods unique in ways that make them interpret discomfort as danger. This makes them unable to cope, and harms them and their causes.I. Why this book is a waste of spaceTo understand why this book goes wrong, its important to appreciate a central tension in the way we think about ideas. On one hand, clearly people have been wrong about so much in the past and therefore as Mill suggests we should keep avenues for debate and change always open. On the other hand, the content of ideas currently held actually matter because they shape the world we live in both symbolically and materially. Therefore, if a certain idea is deemed wrong, it is important to resist it and its spread. It's the inability of creatures like ourselves, condemned to live in time, to resolve this tension in any general way that leads to so much chatter about free speech and its limits.The problem with the authors of this book is that they model debates as though ideas don't matter except for debate, as though fermenting debate itself were the point of ideas. The notion that there power differentials that are deeply entrenched and might not be removed by polite argumentation doesn't even come up.For example, a convenient manner to think about oppression is through ""structural analysis"" which helps make sense of the institutions and experiences that are frequent and persistent. To live in this miasma isn't merely about encountering scary ideas but actually being harmed in a variety of ways, and it really is unclear what the best way to resist and liberate. But the authors are convinced that they know best, since obviously more speech and more ideas is how victory will be won. They make much use of how the recent victories for same-sex marriage included campaigning that stressed similarity and shared community, but conveniently leave out how Stonewall was a riot.When they come close to discussing the obviously relevant idea of power, they just manage feebly to say:In calling for the dismantling of power structures, the author was using a set of terms and concepts that are common in some academic departments; the main line of argumentation fell squarely within the large family of Marxist approaches to social and political analysis. It’s a set of approaches in which things are analyzed primarily in terms of power. Groups struggle for power. Within this paradigm, when power is perceived to be held by one group over others, there is a moral polarity: the groups seen as powerful are bad, while the groups seen as oppressed are good. It’s a variant of the pathological dualism that Rabbi Sacks described in the quotation at the start of this chapter.All structural analysis are first reduced to ""groups struggle for power"" and then into instances of ""pathological dualism"" between the ""unimpeachably good and the irredeemably bad"".There are a lot of serious critiques possible about the relevance and fruitfulness of thinking about oppression as ""structural"", but this glib dismissal is intellectually embarrassing.Their unwillingness to take power seriously makes this entire book a slog through shallow liberal moralizing. Instead of responding to Down Girl: The Logic of Misogyny's point about how it is better to concentrate on the incident and impact instead of intent, because it makes it much, much harder to call out harmful behaviour, they just assume intent is what matters, and so anyone thinks otherwise is labouring under a ""cognitive distortion""The most evident is catastrophizing: If Milo Yiannopoulos is allowed to speak, there will be “broken bodies” on our side. I might lose my “right to exist.” Therefore, violence is justified, because it is self-defense. The author also engages in dichotomous thinking: If you condemn my side’s violence, that means you condone Yiannopoulos’s ideas. You must “pick a side.” You’re either with us or against us. Life is a battle between good people and evil people, and if you disagree with us, you’re one of the evil people…But if asking for peaceful dialogue is violent, then it seems that the word “violence” is taking on new meanings for some students.The point here isn't even that the Milo protests were the obvious way to go (although Milo's inability to get funding since suggests so), but that it's quite impossible to know antecedently or even in the short-term which strategies will be successful. Does treating every small incident as though it's important work better or does taking a more judicious strategy? Despite this lack of clarity about the truth, the authors frame the debate as young college students with good hearts making foolish choices instead of considering that they might possibly be engaging in successful resistance to entrenched evils.II. Why this book is still importantDespite this, there are three reasons this still remains a decent book.First, a significant chunk of the book concerns trends that converge in the iGen generation, including the lack of opportunity for free play, more bureaucracy, etc. It's really fun to read in one place, even if the information isn't new Second, it really is true that a lot of incidents of campus have been horrific, indicating that thinking you're on the right side of history allows for sadism and heedlessness. If you're on social media and have a functioning brain, you know the Left can go overboard in its mob mentality. As from above, I don't think we can say with certainty that these methods as a whole won't be successful, but they clearly do go against strong moral sensibilities at times. The Heckler's veto against anyone conservative, violence, cruelty all seem unacceptable, however much we tell ourselves it might ultimately be for the best.Third, the book is a lot more compelling if we don't think of it as a political project at all, but about psychologists simply talking about trends in the progressive movement that might be affecting mental health, fostering unhealthy ideas, and leading to irrational behaviour. At higher levels of explanation, trends might emerge that might be difficult to account for on a case-by-case basis, and I think the authors present a plausible case that taken as a whole, a lot of practices might be making the situation worse for students.Overall, a book better read as a summary of recent events on American campuses than as any kind of original contribution."
123,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2473528-roseanna-white,5,"Everyone with kids college-aged or younger needs to read this book! It addresses the trend of ""safetyism"" and student fragility--that the ideas of ""dangerous"" have crept from physical harm to emotional discomfort, which is proven not to make our kids STRONGER, but rather emotionally WEAKER. In it the authors not only discuss the problems that have come rather suddenly to college campuses, but the reasons behind them, and how we as parents and educators can correct it . The main theme is that there are Three Great Untruths that a generation has been taught to embrace, but which are what the psychology field knows are ""cognitive distortions."" Harmful ways of thinking that encourage us to see catastrophe, bias, and enemies where there are none. These are things we can universally recognize as untrue...but which are so easy to fall into.I'm not a big non-fiction reader these days, but I loved this book and have already made some changes to the rules for my kids based on the very sound evidence presented in it, as well as the wonderful advice.What I loved most about this book though is that it's quite possibly the only UNBIASED view I've encountered in recent years. Near the end of the book the authors do tell us their political views but up until they came out and said it, I had no idea whether they were liberal or conservative, D or R, even though they were discussing issues that dealt with the widening gap between them. They instead got at exactly what they encourage their readers to get at in our own lives: the wider circle of humanity to which we all belong."

125,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12766685-alison,3,"First - I agree with their argument on free-play time for children. As a mom, I see this as an essential part of growing up and their discussion really helped me to figure out some of the reasons why it has felt important but I was struggling to articulate that. I also appreciated the points they made about safetyism. It is something I have seen and I now have a label for it and can hopefully better communicate the risks.But, I also struggled often with this book. I think that saying someone shouldn't be offended by a comment that you didn't know would be offensive removes the responsibility from the speaker to learn anything that could stop them from saying hurtful/offensive things in the future - most of the examples they use are of ways in which people say things that perpetuate systems of oppression (racism, sexism, etc) and by shrugging things off, the system doesn't get fixed. If the speaker were able to listen and change, then getting offended wouldn't be useful, but too often that's not the outcome. This is a topic I have been working though - I don't always understand why someone got offended, but when I listen or read, I can usually get it. But it comes back on me to learn, not them to get thick skin (I'm not always the speaker, but usually a somewhat confused bystander in these cases).It will raise my hackles when a book uses the version of MLK Jr that only encompasses his Dream speech and not also his other letter, sermons, and speeches. I think they simplified things too much on this respect.The sections laying out how various professors and others in academia have been mistreated was good at pointing out the failings of those areas, but I think that if you are looking for it you could easily find bad behavior in religion, in business, in government, etc. Every aspect of our culture contains humans and within that subset, they may *misbehave* in different ways, but every area has people who misuse power or are unqualified. I also have a few gripes with the way they discuss campus protests. I think we would agree about a lot of this, but I want to point that people like Heather McDonald and Charles Murray have writt books, the people protesting them are almost certainly aware of their views (either by reading the book or discussing parts of it) and they are choosing to say that this person has bad ideas. It is not that HM or CM don't get any chance to speak or promote their ideas - they still have free speech. It is more that students wish the wouldn't be given platforms for these ideas. I agree with Coddling in that violence is abhorrent and counterproductive, but they way they frame the rest of the conversation is in error.Overall - it was a book that made me think, but had some very problematic portions."
126,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1655983-katie,1,"The flaws of this book cloud the conclusion. Some of the flaws:-Anecdotes about campus events are used despite authors demand that everyone be more focused on facts and data. Some of the incidents described are indeed examples of extreme sensitivity and intolerance. Worrisome trend, but not convincing that campuses have abandoned free speech.-Serious lack of time spent on investigating and confirming the issues college students care about. The Trump administration is a frightening turn, threatening institutions and norms - shouldn't we expect young people to protest?-CBT as a treatment for anxiety I get, but as a treatment for real threats and oppression? So insulting! We have an administration threatening to take away healthcare, women's health care, rights of immigrants, gay people, minorities. What happens when a lesbian girl is told a speaker believes she is deviant who needs to go to conversion camp? She should practice CBT and remember the speaker has good intentions? When Richard Spencer coming to campus to spout off about peaceful ethnic cleansing, should students practice CBT? Just because the book does justice to some topics - like IGen social issues, helicopter parenting and safteyism, - does not mean the book works. I also happen to agree this generation does not conceive of the First Amendment like my generation does. College kids raised with awareness of inequality in American, we were raised to worry about authoritarianism and the Cold War. I think the topic deserves scrutiny, but these authors failed in my opinion. "
127,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5862443-joseph-stieb,4,"Full disclosure: I am a Haidt fanboy, so I'm predisposed to like this book. Unlike the Righteous Mind, it is not outstanding. Books that are elaborations of long-form articles rarely are. If you follow Haidt and Lukianoff's work closely, this is mainly a summary of what they have been doing the last 4 years of so (see Haidt's excellent Wriston Lecture for a distillation). Still, this is a strong, well-sourced, and fair-minded argument about where higher ed has turned wrong and how it can be rectified.Haidt and Lukianoff argue for an older understanding of the purpose of higher education: the pursuit of truth rather than the furthering of a political agenda. They convincingly show how higher ed has become more partisan and less ideologically diverse, although they don't do much to show how this stultifies and biases research and teaching (for more on this, see Shields and Dunn's outstanding Passing on the Right). Their focus is on why things like trigger warnings, disinvitations, interruptions of speakers, micro-aggressions, etc have surged on campus in the last 5 years or so. The core of their argument is less about ideology than generational shifts. Despite the somewhat inflammatory title, they put forth a complex, nuanced argument that the I-Gen (born in mid 1990s, came of age with cellphones and social media as normal things, in contrast to millennial, who were teens when the iPhone and facebook came out) is a far more anxious and dependent generation that doesn't know how to handle conflict on its own and has been coached to go to the authorities instead. Take a far more polarized, bureaucratized university system, and you get more kids calling for ""coddling"" and more administrators giving it to them to prevent their school from becoming the next Yale or Missouri. The leftist intellectual framework that these students embrace (redefinition of safety and violence, identitarian common enemy politics, a radical interpretation intersectionality, the dismissal of anything written by a dead white guy as not worth reading because he must have been a racist/sexist) isn't the deeper cause of this surge in left-wing activism on campus. Rather, changes in the climate of US politics and the way kids are raised primes them to take in this ideological system. This can be changed on both ends, although I am more interested in how to change to college atmosphere and how to make these ideas (each of which has some value) more realistic and less polarizing and politically ""weaponized.""The intellectual cases put forth against all of these concepts that have crept into academia are excellent, as usual. They explain how each of these things encourages mentally and intellectually unhealthy thinking, feeds tribalism, and makes open, trusting conversation impossible on campus. Still, I thought they were getting a little loose from their moorings in their criticism of modern parenting. It is hard to tell parents to not be a little over-protective of their kids. There are ways to do this (like more unstructured time built into a kid's day, at school and at home, plus less screen time) but overall I think most parents do a pretty good job. I think they are both part of pretty elite social circles in which tiger parenting was very common. My middle class upbringing seemed to have plenty of free time, and my parents let me and my brothers roam the neighborhood pretty freely. I wouldn't dismiss all of their argument about parenting, but it was probably the weak link in the book.I'd recommend this book to anyone concerned about changes on campus or anyone who has heard about Haidt and is curious. It is concise, and very qualified. As usual, Haidt's critics have misrepresented his argument left and right, so make sure you go to the source."
128,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25032671-kris,4,"I first read Bloom's original The Closing of the American Mind just so that I could read this book. While it's useful to have the earlier background on past decades in academia, Bloom's original is not required reading before enjoying Haidt's great contribution here.These authors lead the reader through some great analyses -- they show how a drastic shift in the mentality of arguments/debate on college campuses happened in 2013, along with a seemingly drastic shift in mindset surrounding the purpose of education. I'll list some of their principles here: Prepare the child for the road, not the road for the child. We are all prone to emotional reasoning and confirmation bias. Your worst enemy cannot harm you as much as your own unguarded thoughts. People are prone to catastroph-izing about the future. We are all prone to tribalism. Many psychological principles on college campuses encourage students to embrace foolishness, rather than wisdom. Young people are innately anti-fragile, but they learn helplessness in correlation with rising rates of adolescent depression and anxiety, a shift to more protective parenting, and widespread play deprivation and risk deprivation. We are seeing rising political polarization and expanded bureaucracy. We also see a rising passion for justice combined with a growing commitment to attaining equal outcomes in all areas. The rise in passion for justice is admirable on its own, but when combined with a demand to see equity, not equality, it becomes misguided.Some falsehoods: What doesn't kill you, makes you weaker.

This monograph explores how 'fragility' is being developed in children, adolescence and students on university campuses. While much of the attention is on the left and social justice politics, there is some focus on the polarization of politics from the alt-right.The problems with this book are clear. The authors confuse a diversity of facts and interpretations with emotions rather than rigour. EH Carr stated in 1961 that ""history means interpretation."" Only particular facts have survived to our present. Therefore assuming that the source material - the material culture - that remains in our present is accurate, true and convincing while alternative interpretations are emotional or intuitive perpetuates a mis-understanding of history, media and politics.Are students fragile? Perhaps. The greater question is why students are fragile. That is the question not asked or answered in this book. Unemployment, under-employment, exhorbitant fees for education, ridiculous payments for privatized utilities, and ill-information public policies are only part of our corrosive present.Protests exist because there is no space to be different, to be defiant, and - in the case of George Floyd - to breathe. This is not emotion or intent. This is verified and an outcome of claustropolitan structures. A provocative book. It lacks a deep engagement of the political economy. Therefore - and ironically - it is part of the identity politics superficiality it wishes to critique."
131,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7258380-dan-graser,5,"This collaboration between Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt is fantastic on many levels and addresses a thorny issue with precision, honesty, and language that is free of the usual superficial pejoratives found in such discussions. They begin with three fundamental Untruths that they have distilled from their own experiences working in academia and social psychology:1) What doesn't kill you makes you weaker.2) Always trust your feelings.3) Life is a battle between good people and evil people.These ideas are discussed in the context of current political divides, campus culture, parenting, and general discourse on social media. Throughout, they use 6 ""explanatory threads"" to understand how we have gotten where we are, sociologically and politically:1) There has been a steady increase in affective polarization since the 1980's, such that people don't feel a stronger kinship with their party but bond more over hatred of the opposition.2) There has been a nation-wide rise in adolescent anxiety and depression since 2011, mainly affecting those who belong to the ""iGen"" or Generation Z.3) There has been a shift, starting in the 80's and reaching a peak in the 90's among more educated families especially, to fearful and needlessly overprotective ""paranoid parenting.""4) The steady decline of unsupervised free play among children due to the above trend. 5) The growth of campus bureaucracy and the expansion of over-protection of students who themselves, don't wish it or need it, resulting in the transmission of the very type of psychological issues the campus is trying to prevent. 6) The rise of social justice activism, rightfully, in response to turbulent and emotionally powerful political events between 2012 and 2018.As someone who works in academia and is genuinely concerned about students' well-being, I always enjoy reading works that provide data, facts, and arguments based in psychology to suggest how we can improve that mission while dealing with the issues present in the larger social-political context, with which our students are dealing. This book contains the finest discussion of this I have seen in addition to great, level-headed discussions of modern parenting, social justice activism, and identity politics. Well worth your time!"

Still, more people should be talking about some silly viewpoints that are popular at the moment. "
133,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2319320-melissa,5,"Wonder why the young generation seems so bad at thinking? This book sheds light on what ""we"" collectively as a society have done to cause it. We've taught three falsehoods as truth: That individuals are fragile, that we can trust our feelings, that life is a battle between good and bad people. Do you feel, like me, that there is no way you're going to write down your thoughts on a particular topic esp. publicly, because no matter how well reasoned or how good your intentions, if you use one wrong word, you're deemed evil for life by one side or the other? (You're ""cancelled."") We've hearkened back to the time of witch hunts, and I found that chapter of the history of what leads to the eras of witch hunts (which we're in a time of those right now) enlightening about why the heck one word in a well meant email can cause a person's complete ruin. We need to get back to a time where we give people the benefit of the doubt! The information on Cognitive Behavior Therapy was also enlightening. As a society, we are essentially going against good psychological practice and teaching bad ways of thinking. One of my sons is a doomsday thinker and I'm happy to have some of these CBT tools to see if I can help him stop the negative thinking habits of thinking the worst about everything and everybody. We see this reflected in society right now, everyone jumps to conclusions on a story that's not an hour old with nothing but a headline and decide they have the ability to be judge, jury, and executioner on that alone and then move on as if ruining that person's life was not a weighty matter. I don't want my son growing up to be like that and it's been frustrating to try to talk him out of his thought processes because I want him to grown up sound of mind unlike many people I've encountered lately, and I've wondered why it is they can be such bad thinkers, and this book enlightens on that some of the reasons.The practical application section is worth the price of the read on what we can do to turn the boat around. Thankfully, I've been already doing a lot of the suggestions for my kids in my determination to have them grow up sound of mind, but this was nice to have the facts and stats to help solidify what I'm doing to help. This is another book that shows our overly scheduled, screen-heavy existence is doing nothing good for our youth. The authors of this book reveal toward the end of the book what their political leanings are and they're nearly the opposite of mine, but I'd say there is no slant, because I agreed with nearly all of it, it was logical, reasoned, well laid out--we're facing a problem that affects both sides of the political spectrum. It is a bit of a slog at the beginning with all the research and the fact that they are very academic writers with the ""I'll tell you this, I'm telling you, and now I'll summarize what I just told you"" which probably is all right if you're one to read at leisure instead of read books from cover to cover like me, that would help you remember what you read if you put it down for any amount of time, but be forewarned that it isn't a fast paced read. But it's an excellent read."
134,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2007216-peter-derk,4,"What an interesting book.I think what would prevent most people from reading this is probably some version of a sentiment that can be summed up as ""Okay Boomer."" But if that's how you're feeling, I would encourage you to give it a shot.Although there are lots of examples from college campuses, they're pretty balanced between things that overly-sensitive people are doing and things that crazy people are doing (usually white power weirdos). And while there is some condemnation of behavior, I felt like the author was very empathetic towards people and wasn't saying anything remotely like, ""These snowflakes need to shape up!"" or ""These iGen kids are ruining everything!"" If you read it that way, that's probably your preconceived notion and sensitivity lenses at work, not the real content of the book. The most interesting portions to me were related to parenting and how much it's changed in just a few decades. There was a section that listed a checklist for parents for school readiness for young kids. 30 or 40 years ago, the list was a lot of things like, ""You child can ride a two-wheel bicycle, Your child can walk alone to a store or home 2 or 3 blocks away..."" where now it looks more like, ""Your child can spell phonetically, Your child can understand basic mathematical concepts..."" So where once it was ""Is your child capable of managing their physical safety?"" now it's more ""Can your child fill out a worksheet?"" Which seems profoundly stupid to me. This is my Okay Boomer moment, so buckle up.When I was a kid we used to roam around the town in small groups of 2-4 kids. Sometimes on bikes, sometimes just walking. And it wasn't like we had to check in every hour with our parents. I rode the bus to the mall. I would go to the grocery store alone or with a friend. In the summer, this was basically all we did, screw around during unstructured time. You learn a lot without realizing it. You learn to avoid true danger, like weirdos and creeps. You learn how to do simple shit like walk into a grocery store, pick something out and pay for it. You learn how to take a bus. You learn the geography of where you live. I had a coworker who lived in a very safe neighborhood and wouldn't allow her son to walk to the bus alone. It was like a block. Eventually, she did let him do it, but he had to be on a walkie talkie and talk to her the whole time until he got on the bus. I've had a number of people tell me that when their kids are learning to drive, they have no idea where they are inside of their own towns. They don't know how to get from home to school. Every day, the school I work next to, parents line up their cars to drive up to the door of the school, at which point their child is released, gets in the car, and then the parents drive them home. Like they're goddamn diplomats in need of a secure escort. This line of cars extends several blocks, and parents will wait up to an hour in a line of cars to pick up their kids. The kids can walk or bike or whatever, but very few, if any, do this, and if they do want to do it this way the parents have to sign a waiver. I can already hear the parents: You don't have a kid, so you don't understand. If you don't have kids, you'll hear this all the time. And I totally agree, I don't have the emotional understanding of a parent. However, I would proffer this: I probably have a more realistic assessment of danger to children because I'm NOT a parent. I'm not emotionally invested, which means when I'm looking at the realistic dangers, my thinking isn't tainted by my personal stakes. There are some parents who agree with me, that kids should have a little more freedom. There was the mom profiled in the book, the sort of mother of the Free Range Kids movement, who let her young son ride the subway home by himself at one point, which turned out great.I do think kids probably need a little more room, a little more agency, and a little less structure. One of the more profound insights in the book had to do with the level of discourse we're experiencing today. In short, people suck at discussing things because they never had un-referee'ed disagreements as kids. When you're a kid, if you're playing a game with 4 other kids, you have to learn how to argue or disagree without the other kid getting up and leaving, at which point the game is unplayable. Newer parents tend to referee everything, jumping in if things get intense. But letting kids work these things out themselves might be a way to help them learn the skills of discussing things without getting to the point that everyone takes their ball and goes home.The best part of the book, however, is that it offers a lot of potential solutions. I've found that I'm a solutions-based thinking, so solutions speak to me. Even when I disagree with the solutions, I think solutions-oriented thinking speaks to me and gets me thinking along the lines of productive movement. Way too many books that I might put in the sociology category seem very focused on talking about the problem. I usually hear what the author is saying and think, ""Okay, I buy that this is a problem, but what now?"" To borrow an analogy from another book, a problem that's well-explained is great, but if you went to the doctor with a pain, and if that doctor could explain why you're feeling this pain, does knowing the pain's origin solve the problem? No. You go to the doctor not for an explanation of the history of the pain, but for the cure. It's how I feel when a cold is being passed around the office, and everyone wants to trace back to patient zero. As if it's really that person's fault. Sidebar: it's my pet peeve that people come in when they're sick. Don't do that. But once you're sick, figuring out who ""got you sick"" is a complete waste of time and energy. Once you know, does that help your symptoms? Does it speed your recovery? Absolutely not. Yes, I think the history of some things can be valuable in understanding them. But the history and origin of a problem without solution is not terribly useful. I think a lot of people don't have the guts to offer a solution. Because that's the easiest thing to attack. You can nitpick someone's solution, which will be seen as an effective way of discrediting their entire argument. Which is stupid. I deeply appreciate the solutions offered in this book, especially because they're solutions based mostly in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (which totally works) and because they're solutions that any individual can choose to apply. It's not a set of solutions that goes ""You motherfuckers need to stop doing X."" It's a set of solutions oriented towards, ""If you want to be a better person and have a better life, here are some realistic options.""Great read, and I'd definitely call it a must-read for parents of young kids who haven't given a lot of thought to giving their kid some rope. And parents who feel pressured by other parents, who are afraid of being seen as bad parents."
135,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31910342-josh,3,"I previously read Lukianoff's ""Unlearning Liberty"" earlier this year. While I thoroughly enjoyed that work, I was somewhat disappointed by this joint venture with social psychologist Jonathan Haidt. This is partly because while ""Unlearning Liberty"" was a searching examination of how higher education in recent years has failed in its central purpose to discover ""truth"" by prohibiting many forms of offensive speech on campus, this book tries to further that inquiry in some ways by putting together a composite of factors for why ""iGen"" (those who were born c. 1996) have embraced ""safetyism"" on college campuses. ""Safetyism"" is essentially the conflation of being offended with being in physical danger. The book is divided into three parts. The first unpacks what the authors call the ""three great untruths"" that iGen embraces: the world is divided between distinctly ""good"" people and wholly ""bad"" people; trust your feelings (i.e. emotional reasoning over logic); and ""safetyism"" which the authors describe as ""what doesn't hurt you, makes you weaker."" The second narrates a series of recent episodes of censorship and both far left/far right violence on college campuses, such as Berkeley Antifa protests against Milo Yiannopolis, the Alt-Right protests at UVA; and the Charles Murray episode at Middlebury. The final part explains what the authors believe are the six contributing factors that are the ""bad ideas [that] are setting up a generation for failure."" The last two chapters in this section deal with a) how parents should ideally raise children to be thick-skinned and critically thinking adults and b) how primary and secondary education can offer adolescents and teenagers the mental toolset to confront offensive ideas and grow intellectually from such debates. There is a lot of ground to cover in any review of this book (and much of what follows in this paragraph I explain in more detail in my review of Unlearning Liberty). But, the gist is that colleges and universities should be wholly focused on discerning ""truth."" Various public intellectuals, such as Van Jones, have argued that colleges provide people with a rare opportunity to grapple with offensive ideas and speech by using reasoning and argument. College should be a ""gym,"" to borrow from Van Jones, that trains people to debate and compromise within our democratic system. Since the early 2010s, though, many colleges (and almost exclusively the most liberal ones) have become distracted from the goal of seeking ""truth"" by protecting students from potentially offensive speech. There's an appropriate discussion within this section of how the left has stretched the definition of ""violence"" to include intuitively nonviolent actions, such as speech. By construing offensive speech as ""violent,"" college administrators, faculty, and students have effectively nullified the free speech privileges of a wide swathe of conservative intellectuals (and alt-right wackos) by appealing to the need to keep students ""safe"" on campus. The six factors that have contributed to the current climate of ""Safetyism,"" censorship, and unrest are best summed up as follows:1) American politics have become increasingly polarized (entering a ""polarization cycle"") where very little compromise is ever reached between left and right.2) The advent of social media and the internet has made ""iGen"" far more depressed and anxious than previous generations. 3) Parents since the 1980s have increasingly become ""helicopter"" parents, not allowing their children to experience any discomfort and sheltering them from the real world, so to speak. 4) What the authors term the ""decline of [free] play."" In other words, children have far less time relative to previous generations to socialize, initiate play, and be creative. This is caused by the fact that elite colleges and universities select from those with an abundance of extracurriculars (etc.) and parents respond by over-structuring their children's time with various activities. 5) Primary and secondary education have become obsessed with keeping students ""safe"" from offensive ideas and taboo subjects. 6) ""Social justice"" and its quest for equal outcomes has created a ""common enemy identity politics"" focused on subdividing people into various ""intersectional"" identities. The authors compare this to Martin Luther King, Jr.'s ""common humanity"" identity politics that sought to authentically include all Americans in the civil rights movement by appealing to the American civic religion. These six factors (covered in six chapters) are unevenly persuasive, although I generally agree with the authors that the cult of ""safe spaces"" and ""free speech zones"" on campuses is extremely problematic. I think I agree with some of the other reviews on Goodreads that some of their solutions contain assumptions grounded in a middle-class ethos. Specifically, their idea that children should be given more rein to explore their neighborhoods, talk to strangers, and even use public transportation at young ages (i.e. nine years old). The authors argue that our perception of danger is massively inflated by the 24 hour news cycle and John Walsh's crusade to catch ""America's Most Wanted."" I agree in part, but would argue that many parents (and single parents) living in certain rural or urban areas with high crime rates have legitimate concerns about allowing their children to be ""free range children."" Being a parent myself, I generally found their Dr. Spock parental advice annoying, at best, and naive at worst. Overall, an informative book that resonated well with my experience on campus the past seven years. Excepting the final two concluding chapters, I completely recommend this book to anyone seriously interested in learning more about what is happening on America's college campuses. But you should first read ""Unlearning Liberty."" "

The stories can definitely get your blood pumping and outrage you at points and I think that's the point. 10/10 would recommend this to most people.One of the best parts of the book is the way the authors write in such a humble and transparent way. The consistently mention how the issues are more complex than they make them out to be and never claim to have the only answer. They also very openly share their political views and how they could influence their own writing when writing about political polarization. So good!"
139,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3730838-maggie-boyd,2,"I'm always interested in books critiquing our current educational system and sat down to read this one with enthusiasm. However, this book is less about what is wrong with our system and more about criticizing liberals for the horrors they have wrought upon our society. It begins with vilifying our current crop of college students: kids born after 1995 who began going to college in 2013. These children are having three great untruths fed to them by liberal universities: 1. The Untruth of Fragility: What doesn't kill you makes you weaker. 2. The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: Always trust your feelings. 3. The Untruth of Us versus Them: Life is a battle between good people and evil people. They go on to say that by creating safe spaces, colleges teach students to believe the above. The evidence? Students are preventing speakers from holding lectures they disagree with at their universities. As others have pointed out, this in no way keeps the speaker from disseminating their ideas. Milo, the target of one of these riots, was still making television appearances and publishing books. The students were asking that he not be allowed to speak in spaces their tuition paid for, a very different thing than asking that he never be allowed to speak anywhere. Moreover, this wasn't a question of not giving the speaker a chance to present his point but a reaction to the point the speaker had already made. Finally, the United States has over 3,000 4 yr. universities and the author's ""evidence"" centers around approximately 1% of those institutions having students make demands they felt were unreasonable. This is nowhere near epidemic. Then the authors get to what I felt was the primary point: Viewpoint diversity reduces a community’s susceptibility to witch hunts. One of the most important kinds of viewpoint diversity, diversity of political thought, has declined substantially among both professors and students at American universities since the 1990s. To sum up the first portion of the book has two major points: Anything that prevents someone from making a point, even if that point is offensive, is ""coddling"" and colleges are too liberal. We need more balance. (They didn't speak to the 600 Christian colleges where the staff is predominantly conservative.) After spending several chapters ""building a case"" on how the great untruths listed in the first paragraph are destroying young collegiate minds, the author's come to a startling conclusion: You can see why it was hard for us to make a strong case that universities were causing students to become anxious and depressed by teaching them disordered ways of thinking. Anxiety and depression rates were already rising for all teenagers before they arrived at college, and for those who never attended college as well. Clearly universities were not causing a national mental health crisis; they were responding to one. With liberal universities out as a scapegoat, bring in liberal parenting policies. Safteyism, where parents go to purportedly unreasonable limits to protect their kids might be a factor in kids being more fearful, which might be a factor in them being depressed. No direct evidence of this is available but they offer up some random events and show how those few events point to liberals running amok and creating too much fear in our kids. They have to admit, grudgingly, that many of the safety measures have worked. Putting it all together, from 1960 to 1990, there was a 48% reduction in deaths from unintended injuries and accidents among kids between five and fourteen years of age, and a 57% drop in deaths of younger kids (ages one to four).Lukianoff, Greg. The Coddling of the American Mind (p. 169). Penguin Publishing Group. Kindle Edition. In summary, the authors offer anecdotes and a handful of studies to showcase their points but the math in no way supports what they are saying. If you are someone who feels PC culture is at the heart of what is wrong with our country, you'll love this book and may believe it supports your view point. If you know how to do elementary school level math and have an understanding of the basic principle of percentages, you will quickly realize this tome is meant to speak into a very specific echo chamber and provides no substantial evidence to support the view that liberals will be the death of America."

He previously wrote The Righteous Mind, which was a powerful and thought-provoking read. Haidt, along with Greg Lukianoff, provide another powerful analysis and thought-provoking read with this book. I would recommend it to any and everyone. While there are specific recommendations that some may have differing personal preferences/opinions on, there is no lack of research in their presentation and arguments (and it’s safe to say they would welcome the discourse of another perspective). I especially appreciated their inclusion of CBT and how that could be a beneficial practice for many to adopt, as well as parents and institutions to encourage and teach. Looking forward to anything else Haidt writes. "

Over the 3 months since I finished The Coddling of the American Mind I cannot believe how many times I have shared the ideas of these authors with others. This book is just so pertinent, so timely, and so important that it comes up again and again. I generally read books and move on to the next so quickly, but this one has found a permanence in my worldview. I think that makes it worthy of 5 stars.Nov 21, 2018Why are so many college students struggling with anxiety and depression? Why are so many university campuses coming up against student demands to disinvite ""dangerous"" guest speakers, to penalize professors who propone unpopular opinions, and to dismiss any who threaten their conception of safety? This very insightful book discusses 3 great untruths of the ""IGen"" (the generation born after 1994, coinciding with the ubiquity of the iPhone): The Untruth of Fragility: What doesn’t kill you makes you weaker. The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: Always trust your feelings. The Untruth of Us Versus Them: Life is a battle between good people and evil people.It shows have parents and institutions have unwittingly taught youth these untruths, and have - with the best of intentions - coddled them to the point of handicapping their ability to handle the adult world. Within this framework, I gained some new insights into the reasons for our increasingly partisan political world.One thing I really like about The Coddling of the American Mind is that, unlike many books of this genre, it doesn't just rip down the system, telling us everything that's wrong with society, then leave us hopeless. Lukianoff and Haidt give pages of good, solid suggestions for how to correct the problems we have created. I would absolutely recommend this book to parents today, as well as to anyone in education or educational administration. It is quite bipartisan, but not afraid to point out problems on both side of the political spectrum. I already put the audiobook on hold for my husband!4.5 stars."

Coddling of the American Mind did this. In brief, it is about three great Untruths that are affecting US universities and making them weaker: that we are protecting them from things that they see as dangerous, because – although there are good people, there are also evil ones. The great Untruths are:1. The Untruth of Fragility: What doesn’t kill you makes you weaker. 2. The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: Always trust your feelings. 3. The Untruth of Us Versus Them: Life is a battle between good people and evil people. (p. 4) Lukianoff and Haidt are provocative, but also good at bringing together diverse kinds of information together to help us recognize, as the subtitle goes, ""how good intentions and bad ideas are setting up a generation for failure.""For a book about the dichotomous and extreme thinking characterizing parenting, students, and the university system in the 21st century, Lukianoff and Haidt slip into dichotomous thinking. As do we all from time to time.We are in an age of helicopter parenting – even bulldozer parenting – where parents attempt to intervene with their college-aged children in a way that my daughters, frustratingly, would not allow me to do when they were in grade school. Rather than helping them, except in the short-term, this sort of parenting (and overscheduling, failing to allow or encourage free play, etc.) leaves students to becoming fragile, anxious, and easily hurt. Lukianoff and Haidt argue compellingly that college students should and must be exposed to viewpoint diversity, which will help them think more critically, understand diverse perspectives, and withstand events that would otherwise make them depressed and anxious. As the authors conclude, this means that we should beseeking out challenges (rather than eliminating or avoiding everything that “feels unsafe”), freeing yourself from cognitive distortions (rather than always trusting your initial feelings), and taking a generous view of other people, and looking for nuance (rather than assuming the worst about people within a simplistic us-versus-them morality). (p. 14)I appreciated Coddling of the American Mind, but I was often annoyed and irritated by it – which are not good outcomes for this time of year. Lukianoff and Haidt gathered interesting and often compelling threads, but I wasn't convinced by all of their evidence. Clearly, there is more anxiety and depression on campus than when I was in school, but that isn't necessarily a function of ""coddling,"" but of greater access on college campuses. Students who would not have been able to attend college 20 years ago can.While Lukianoff and Haidt criticize students' complaints about controversial and noncontroversial speakers (e.g., George Will, Bill Maher, Eric Holder, Madeleine Albright), I am less dismayed. I like that students are more likely to set limits about things that my generation accepted (e.g., #metoo).Current parenting practices, among many other things, have both strengths and weaknesses. Lukianoff and Haidt primarily focus on the downside here, but maybe we can look for some nuance and attempt to create a stronger model for the next generation of parents – and universities."
148,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3052770-teri,4,"This is an important read in today's society. This book is a look at the iGen generation that seems to be obsessed with technology and social media. The authors look at how ready access to news and social media affects attitudes and higher education. iGen students seem to be obsessed with protecting themselves against any other opinion than their own. They are less open to expanding their worldview and listening to opposing views to gain a broader understanding of today's society. This has led to students feeling ""unsafe"" when dealing with someone who does not share their views. Are they truly physically unsafe or are they just unable to process opposing views? Instead of engaging in open, civil debate or listening to gain understanding, students are sheltered and professors and administrators kowtow to students, offering special ""safe spaces,"" firing faculty who simply exercise their first amendment right, or even canceling guest speakers whose views are not shared with the majority of students. In essence, the authors suggest that we are coddling America's youth and young adults, sheltering them to the point that they are unable to process opinions and ideas that they do not identify with. The authors spend a lot of time discussing how technology and social media have affected current attitudes and lifestyles. Where once young kids would go out and play in the neighborhood, without constant adult supervision, they are today being watched by helicopter parents, suggesting that kids are being overprotected. Are we coddling the younger generations to the point that they are unable to psychologically handle uncomfortable positions? It is certainly worth thinking about and this book will open that discussion to consider if we are doing a disservice to our youth.I think this is a must-read for parents, teachers, and faculty of higher education.

152,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28777221-sharad-pandian,3,"If you've been following the fracas on and surrounding American universities, there's nothing new in this book for you.As the title suggests, Jonathan Haidt and Greg Lukianoff argue that American children from the iGen generation (born 1995 or beyond) are raised in situations and using methods unique in ways that make them interpret discomfort as danger. This makes them unable to cope, and harms them and their causes.I. Why this book is a waste of spaceTo understand why this book goes wrong, its important to appreciate a central tension in the way we think about ideas. On one hand, clearly people have been wrong about so much in the past and therefore as Mill suggests we should keep avenues for debate and change always open. On the other hand, the content of ideas currently held actually matter because they shape the world we live in both symbolically and materially. Therefore, if a certain idea is deemed wrong, it is important to resist it and its spread. It's the inability of creatures like ourselves, condemned to live in time, to resolve this tension in any general way that leads to so much chatter about free speech and its limits.The problem with the authors of this book is that they model debates as though ideas don't matter except for debate, as though fermenting debate itself were the point of ideas. The notion that there power differentials that are deeply entrenched and might not be removed by polite argumentation doesn't even come up.For example, a convenient manner to think about oppression is through ""structural analysis"" which helps make sense of the institutions and experiences that are frequent and persistent. To live in this miasma isn't merely about encountering scary ideas but actually being harmed in a variety of ways, and it really is unclear what the best way to resist and liberate. But the authors are convinced that they know best, since obviously more speech and more ideas is how victory will be won. They make much use of how the recent victories for same-sex marriage included campaigning that stressed similarity and shared community, but conveniently leave out how Stonewall was a riot.When they come close to discussing the obviously relevant idea of power, they just manage feebly to say:In calling for the dismantling of power structures, the author was using a set of terms and concepts that are common in some academic departments; the main line of argumentation fell squarely within the large family of Marxist approaches to social and political analysis. It’s a set of approaches in which things are analyzed primarily in terms of power. Groups struggle for power. Within this paradigm, when power is perceived to be held by one group over others, there is a moral polarity: the groups seen as powerful are bad, while the groups seen as oppressed are good. It’s a variant of the pathological dualism that Rabbi Sacks described in the quotation at the start of this chapter.All structural analysis are first reduced to ""groups struggle for power"" and then into instances of ""pathological dualism"" between the ""unimpeachably good and the irredeemably bad"".There are a lot of serious critiques possible about the relevance and fruitfulness of thinking about oppression as ""structural"", but this glib dismissal is intellectually embarrassing.Their unwillingness to take power seriously makes this entire book a slog through shallow liberal moralizing. Instead of responding to Down Girl: The Logic of Misogyny's point about how it is better to concentrate on the incident and impact instead of intent, because it makes it much, much harder to call out harmful behaviour, they just assume intent is what matters, and so anyone thinks otherwise is labouring under a ""cognitive distortion""The most evident is catastrophizing: If Milo Yiannopoulos is allowed to speak, there will be “broken bodies” on our side. I might lose my “right to exist.” Therefore, violence is justified, because it is self-defense. The author also engages in dichotomous thinking: If you condemn my side’s violence, that means you condone Yiannopoulos’s ideas. You must “pick a side.” You’re either with us or against us. Life is a battle between good people and evil people, and if you disagree with us, you’re one of the evil people…But if asking for peaceful dialogue is violent, then it seems that the word “violence” is taking on new meanings for some students.The point here isn't even that the Milo protests were the obvious way to go (although Milo's inability to get funding since suggests so), but that it's quite impossible to know antecedently or even in the short-term which strategies will be successful. Does treating every small incident as though it's important work better or does taking a more judicious strategy? Despite this lack of clarity about the truth, the authors frame the debate as young college students with good hearts making foolish choices instead of considering that they might possibly be engaging in successful resistance to entrenched evils.II. Why this book is still importantDespite this, there are three reasons this still remains a decent book.First, a significant chunk of the book concerns trends that converge in the iGen generation, including the lack of opportunity for free play, more bureaucracy, etc. It's really fun to read in one place, even if the information isn't new Second, it really is true that a lot of incidents of campus have been horrific, indicating that thinking you're on the right side of history allows for sadism and heedlessness. If you're on social media and have a functioning brain, you know the Left can go overboard in its mob mentality. As from above, I don't think we can say with certainty that these methods as a whole won't be successful, but they clearly do go against strong moral sensibilities at times. The Heckler's veto against anyone conservative, violence, cruelty all seem unacceptable, however much we tell ourselves it might ultimately be for the best.Third, the book is a lot more compelling if we don't think of it as a political project at all, but about psychologists simply talking about trends in the progressive movement that might be affecting mental health, fostering unhealthy ideas, and leading to irrational behaviour. At higher levels of explanation, trends might emerge that might be difficult to account for on a case-by-case basis, and I think the authors present a plausible case that taken as a whole, a lot of practices might be making the situation worse for students.Overall, a book better read as a summary of recent events on American campuses than as any kind of original contribution."
153,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2473528-roseanna-white,5,"Everyone with kids college-aged or younger needs to read this book! It addresses the trend of ""safetyism"" and student fragility--that the ideas of ""dangerous"" have crept from physical harm to emotional discomfort, which is proven not to make our kids STRONGER, but rather emotionally WEAKER. In it the authors not only discuss the problems that have come rather suddenly to college campuses, but the reasons behind them, and how we as parents and educators can correct it . The main theme is that there are Three Great Untruths that a generation has been taught to embrace, but which are what the psychology field knows are ""cognitive distortions."" Harmful ways of thinking that encourage us to see catastrophe, bias, and enemies where there are none. These are things we can universally recognize as untrue...but which are so easy to fall into.I'm not a big non-fiction reader these days, but I loved this book and have already made some changes to the rules for my kids based on the very sound evidence presented in it, as well as the wonderful advice.What I loved most about this book though is that it's quite possibly the only UNBIASED view I've encountered in recent years. Near the end of the book the authors do tell us their political views but up until they came out and said it, I had no idea whether they were liberal or conservative, D or R, even though they were discussing issues that dealt with the widening gap between them. They instead got at exactly what they encourage their readers to get at in our own lives: the wider circle of humanity to which we all belong."

155,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12766685-alison,3,"First - I agree with their argument on free-play time for children. As a mom, I see this as an essential part of growing up and their discussion really helped me to figure out some of the reasons why it has felt important but I was struggling to articulate that. I also appreciated the points they made about safetyism. It is something I have seen and I now have a label for it and can hopefully better communicate the risks.But, I also struggled often with this book. I think that saying someone shouldn't be offended by a comment that you didn't know would be offensive removes the responsibility from the speaker to learn anything that could stop them from saying hurtful/offensive things in the future - most of the examples they use are of ways in which people say things that perpetuate systems of oppression (racism, sexism, etc) and by shrugging things off, the system doesn't get fixed. If the speaker were able to listen and change, then getting offended wouldn't be useful, but too often that's not the outcome. This is a topic I have been working though - I don't always understand why someone got offended, but when I listen or read, I can usually get it. But it comes back on me to learn, not them to get thick skin (I'm not always the speaker, but usually a somewhat confused bystander in these cases).It will raise my hackles when a book uses the version of MLK Jr that only encompasses his Dream speech and not also his other letter, sermons, and speeches. I think they simplified things too much on this respect.The sections laying out how various professors and others in academia have been mistreated was good at pointing out the failings of those areas, but I think that if you are looking for it you could easily find bad behavior in religion, in business, in government, etc. Every aspect of our culture contains humans and within that subset, they may *misbehave* in different ways, but every area has people who misuse power or are unqualified. I also have a few gripes with the way they discuss campus protests. I think we would agree about a lot of this, but I want to point that people like Heather McDonald and Charles Murray have writt books, the people protesting them are almost certainly aware of their views (either by reading the book or discussing parts of it) and they are choosing to say that this person has bad ideas. It is not that HM or CM don't get any chance to speak or promote their ideas - they still have free speech. It is more that students wish the wouldn't be given platforms for these ideas. I agree with Coddling in that violence is abhorrent and counterproductive, but they way they frame the rest of the conversation is in error.Overall - it was a book that made me think, but had some very problematic portions."
156,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1655983-katie,1,"The flaws of this book cloud the conclusion. Some of the flaws:-Anecdotes about campus events are used despite authors demand that everyone be more focused on facts and data. Some of the incidents described are indeed examples of extreme sensitivity and intolerance. Worrisome trend, but not convincing that campuses have abandoned free speech.-Serious lack of time spent on investigating and confirming the issues college students care about. The Trump administration is a frightening turn, threatening institutions and norms - shouldn't we expect young people to protest?-CBT as a treatment for anxiety I get, but as a treatment for real threats and oppression? So insulting! We have an administration threatening to take away healthcare, women's health care, rights of immigrants, gay people, minorities. What happens when a lesbian girl is told a speaker believes she is deviant who needs to go to conversion camp? She should practice CBT and remember the speaker has good intentions? When Richard Spencer coming to campus to spout off about peaceful ethnic cleansing, should students practice CBT? Just because the book does justice to some topics - like IGen social issues, helicopter parenting and safteyism, - does not mean the book works. I also happen to agree this generation does not conceive of the First Amendment like my generation does. College kids raised with awareness of inequality in American, we were raised to worry about authoritarianism and the Cold War. I think the topic deserves scrutiny, but these authors failed in my opinion. "
157,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5862443-joseph-stieb,4,"Full disclosure: I am a Haidt fanboy, so I'm predisposed to like this book. Unlike the Righteous Mind, it is not outstanding. Books that are elaborations of long-form articles rarely are. If you follow Haidt and Lukianoff's work closely, this is mainly a summary of what they have been doing the last 4 years of so (see Haidt's excellent Wriston Lecture for a distillation). Still, this is a strong, well-sourced, and fair-minded argument about where higher ed has turned wrong and how it can be rectified.Haidt and Lukianoff argue for an older understanding of the purpose of higher education: the pursuit of truth rather than the furthering of a political agenda. They convincingly show how higher ed has become more partisan and less ideologically diverse, although they don't do much to show how this stultifies and biases research and teaching (for more on this, see Shields and Dunn's outstanding Passing on the Right). Their focus is on why things like trigger warnings, disinvitations, interruptions of speakers, micro-aggressions, etc have surged on campus in the last 5 years or so. The core of their argument is less about ideology than generational shifts. Despite the somewhat inflammatory title, they put forth a complex, nuanced argument that the I-Gen (born in mid 1990s, came of age with cellphones and social media as normal things, in contrast to millennial, who were teens when the iPhone and facebook came out) is a far more anxious and dependent generation that doesn't know how to handle conflict on its own and has been coached to go to the authorities instead. Take a far more polarized, bureaucratized university system, and you get more kids calling for ""coddling"" and more administrators giving it to them to prevent their school from becoming the next Yale or Missouri. The leftist intellectual framework that these students embrace (redefinition of safety and violence, identitarian common enemy politics, a radical interpretation intersectionality, the dismissal of anything written by a dead white guy as not worth reading because he must have been a racist/sexist) isn't the deeper cause of this surge in left-wing activism on campus. Rather, changes in the climate of US politics and the way kids are raised primes them to take in this ideological system. This can be changed on both ends, although I am more interested in how to change to college atmosphere and how to make these ideas (each of which has some value) more realistic and less polarizing and politically ""weaponized.""The intellectual cases put forth against all of these concepts that have crept into academia are excellent, as usual. They explain how each of these things encourages mentally and intellectually unhealthy thinking, feeds tribalism, and makes open, trusting conversation impossible on campus. Still, I thought they were getting a little loose from their moorings in their criticism of modern parenting. It is hard to tell parents to not be a little over-protective of their kids. There are ways to do this (like more unstructured time built into a kid's day, at school and at home, plus less screen time) but overall I think most parents do a pretty good job. I think they are both part of pretty elite social circles in which tiger parenting was very common. My middle class upbringing seemed to have plenty of free time, and my parents let me and my brothers roam the neighborhood pretty freely. I wouldn't dismiss all of their argument about parenting, but it was probably the weak link in the book.I'd recommend this book to anyone concerned about changes on campus or anyone who has heard about Haidt and is curious. It is concise, and very qualified. As usual, Haidt's critics have misrepresented his argument left and right, so make sure you go to the source."
158,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25032671-kris,4,"I first read Bloom's original The Closing of the American Mind just so that I could read this book. While it's useful to have the earlier background on past decades in academia, Bloom's original is not required reading before enjoying Haidt's great contribution here.These authors lead the reader through some great analyses -- they show how a drastic shift in the mentality of arguments/debate on college campuses happened in 2013, along with a seemingly drastic shift in mindset surrounding the purpose of education. I'll list some of their principles here: Prepare the child for the road, not the road for the child. We are all prone to emotional reasoning and confirmation bias. Your worst enemy cannot harm you as much as your own unguarded thoughts. People are prone to catastroph-izing about the future. We are all prone to tribalism. Many psychological principles on college campuses encourage students to embrace foolishness, rather than wisdom. Young people are innately anti-fragile, but they learn helplessness in correlation with rising rates of adolescent depression and anxiety, a shift to more protective parenting, and widespread play deprivation and risk deprivation. We are seeing rising political polarization and expanded bureaucracy. We also see a rising passion for justice combined with a growing commitment to attaining equal outcomes in all areas. The rise in passion for justice is admirable on its own, but when combined with a demand to see equity, not equality, it becomes misguided.Some falsehoods: What doesn't kill you, makes you weaker.

160,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4859940-tara-brabazon,3,"An important book to read - and disagree with. This monograph explores how 'fragility' is being developed in children, adolescence and students on university campuses. While much of the attention is on the left and social justice politics, there is some focus on the polarization of politics from the alt-right.The problems with this book are clear. The authors confuse a diversity of facts and interpretations with emotions rather than rigour. EH Carr stated in 1961 that ""history means interpretation."" Only particular facts have survived to our present. Therefore assuming that the source material - the material culture - that remains in our present is accurate, true and convincing while alternative interpretations are emotional or intuitive perpetuates a mis-understanding of history, media and politics.Are students fragile? Perhaps. The greater question is why students are fragile. That is the question not asked or answered in this book. Unemployment, under-employment, exhorbitant fees for education, ridiculous payments for privatized utilities, and ill-information public policies are only part of our corrosive present.Protests exist because there is no space to be different, to be defiant, and - in the case of George Floyd - to breathe. This is not emotion or intent. This is verified and an outcome of claustropolitan structures. A provocative book. It lacks a deep engagement of the political economy. Therefore - and ironically - it is part of the identity politics superficiality it wishes to critique."
161,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7258380-dan-graser,5,"This collaboration between Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt is fantastic on many levels and addresses a thorny issue with precision, honesty, and language that is free of the usual superficial pejoratives found in such discussions. They begin with three fundamental Untruths that they have distilled from their own experiences working in academia and social psychology:1) What doesn't kill you makes you weaker.2) Always trust your feelings.3) Life is a battle between good people and evil people.These ideas are discussed in the context of current political divides, campus culture, parenting, and general discourse on social media. Throughout, they use 6 ""explanatory threads"" to understand how we have gotten where we are, sociologically and politically:1) There has been a steady increase in affective polarization since the 1980's, such that people don't feel a stronger kinship with their party but bond more over hatred of the opposition.2) There has been a nation-wide rise in adolescent anxiety and depression since 2011, mainly affecting those who belong to the ""iGen"" or Generation Z.3) There has been a shift, starting in the 80's and reaching a peak in the 90's among more educated families especially, to fearful and needlessly overprotective ""paranoid parenting.""4) The steady decline of unsupervised free play among children due to the above trend. 5) The growth of campus bureaucracy and the expansion of over-protection of students who themselves, don't wish it or need it, resulting in the transmission of the very type of psychological issues the campus is trying to prevent. 6) The rise of social justice activism, rightfully, in response to turbulent and emotionally powerful political events between 2012 and 2018.As someone who works in academia and is genuinely concerned about students' well-being, I always enjoy reading works that provide data, facts, and arguments based in psychology to suggest how we can improve that mission while dealing with the issues present in the larger social-political context, with which our students are dealing. This book contains the finest discussion of this I have seen in addition to great, level-headed discussions of modern parenting, social justice activism, and identity politics. Well worth your time!"

Still, more people should be talking about some silly viewpoints that are popular at the moment. "
163,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2319320-melissa,5,"Wonder why the young generation seems so bad at thinking? This book sheds light on what ""we"" collectively as a society have done to cause it. We've taught three falsehoods as truth: That individuals are fragile, that we can trust our feelings, that life is a battle between good and bad people. Do you feel, like me, that there is no way you're going to write down your thoughts on a particular topic esp. publicly, because no matter how well reasoned or how good your intentions, if you use one wrong word, you're deemed evil for life by one side or the other? (You're ""cancelled."") We've hearkened back to the time of witch hunts, and I found that chapter of the history of what leads to the eras of witch hunts (which we're in a time of those right now) enlightening about why the heck one word in a well meant email can cause a person's complete ruin. We need to get back to a time where we give people the benefit of the doubt! The information on Cognitive Behavior Therapy was also enlightening. As a society, we are essentially going against good psychological practice and teaching bad ways of thinking. One of my sons is a doomsday thinker and I'm happy to have some of these CBT tools to see if I can help him stop the negative thinking habits of thinking the worst about everything and everybody. We see this reflected in society right now, everyone jumps to conclusions on a story that's not an hour old with nothing but a headline and decide they have the ability to be judge, jury, and executioner on that alone and then move on as if ruining that person's life was not a weighty matter. I don't want my son growing up to be like that and it's been frustrating to try to talk him out of his thought processes because I want him to grown up sound of mind unlike many people I've encountered lately, and I've wondered why it is they can be such bad thinkers, and this book enlightens on that some of the reasons.The practical application section is worth the price of the read on what we can do to turn the boat around. Thankfully, I've been already doing a lot of the suggestions for my kids in my determination to have them grow up sound of mind, but this was nice to have the facts and stats to help solidify what I'm doing to help. This is another book that shows our overly scheduled, screen-heavy existence is doing nothing good for our youth. The authors of this book reveal toward the end of the book what their political leanings are and they're nearly the opposite of mine, but I'd say there is no slant, because I agreed with nearly all of it, it was logical, reasoned, well laid out--we're facing a problem that affects both sides of the political spectrum. It is a bit of a slog at the beginning with all the research and the fact that they are very academic writers with the ""I'll tell you this, I'm telling you, and now I'll summarize what I just told you"" which probably is all right if you're one to read at leisure instead of read books from cover to cover like me, that would help you remember what you read if you put it down for any amount of time, but be forewarned that it isn't a fast paced read. But it's an excellent read."
164,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2007216-peter-derk,4,"What an interesting book.I think what would prevent most people from reading this is probably some version of a sentiment that can be summed up as ""Okay Boomer."" But if that's how you're feeling, I would encourage you to give it a shot.Although there are lots of examples from college campuses, they're pretty balanced between things that overly-sensitive people are doing and things that crazy people are doing (usually white power weirdos). And while there is some condemnation of behavior, I felt like the author was very empathetic towards people and wasn't saying anything remotely like, ""These snowflakes need to shape up!"" or ""These iGen kids are ruining everything!"" If you read it that way, that's probably your preconceived notion and sensitivity lenses at work, not the real content of the book. The most interesting portions to me were related to parenting and how much it's changed in just a few decades. There was a section that listed a checklist for parents for school readiness for young kids. 30 or 40 years ago, the list was a lot of things like, ""You child can ride a two-wheel bicycle, Your child can walk alone to a store or home 2 or 3 blocks away..."" where now it looks more like, ""Your child can spell phonetically, Your child can understand basic mathematical concepts..."" So where once it was ""Is your child capable of managing their physical safety?"" now it's more ""Can your child fill out a worksheet?"" Which seems profoundly stupid to me. This is my Okay Boomer moment, so buckle up.When I was a kid we used to roam around the town in small groups of 2-4 kids. Sometimes on bikes, sometimes just walking. And it wasn't like we had to check in every hour with our parents. I rode the bus to the mall. I would go to the grocery store alone or with a friend. In the summer, this was basically all we did, screw around during unstructured time. You learn a lot without realizing it. You learn to avoid true danger, like weirdos and creeps. You learn how to do simple shit like walk into a grocery store, pick something out and pay for it. You learn how to take a bus. You learn the geography of where you live. I had a coworker who lived in a very safe neighborhood and wouldn't allow her son to walk to the bus alone. It was like a block. Eventually, she did let him do it, but he had to be on a walkie talkie and talk to her the whole time until he got on the bus. I've had a number of people tell me that when their kids are learning to drive, they have no idea where they are inside of their own towns. They don't know how to get from home to school. Every day, the school I work next to, parents line up their cars to drive up to the door of the school, at which point their child is released, gets in the car, and then the parents drive them home. Like they're goddamn diplomats in need of a secure escort. This line of cars extends several blocks, and parents will wait up to an hour in a line of cars to pick up their kids. The kids can walk or bike or whatever, but very few, if any, do this, and if they do want to do it this way the parents have to sign a waiver. I can already hear the parents: You don't have a kid, so you don't understand. If you don't have kids, you'll hear this all the time. And I totally agree, I don't have the emotional understanding of a parent. However, I would proffer this: I probably have a more realistic assessment of danger to children because I'm NOT a parent. I'm not emotionally invested, which means when I'm looking at the realistic dangers, my thinking isn't tainted by my personal stakes. There are some parents who agree with me, that kids should have a little more freedom. There was the mom profiled in the book, the sort of mother of the Free Range Kids movement, who let her young son ride the subway home by himself at one point, which turned out great.I do think kids probably need a little more room, a little more agency, and a little less structure. One of the more profound insights in the book had to do with the level of discourse we're experiencing today. In short, people suck at discussing things because they never had un-referee'ed disagreements as kids. When you're a kid, if you're playing a game with 4 other kids, you have to learn how to argue or disagree without the other kid getting up and leaving, at which point the game is unplayable. Newer parents tend to referee everything, jumping in if things get intense. But letting kids work these things out themselves might be a way to help them learn the skills of discussing things without getting to the point that everyone takes their ball and goes home.The best part of the book, however, is that it offers a lot of potential solutions. I've found that I'm a solutions-based thinking, so solutions speak to me. Even when I disagree with the solutions, I think solutions-oriented thinking speaks to me and gets me thinking along the lines of productive movement. Way too many books that I might put in the sociology category seem very focused on talking about the problem. I usually hear what the author is saying and think, ""Okay, I buy that this is a problem, but what now?"" To borrow an analogy from another book, a problem that's well-explained is great, but if you went to the doctor with a pain, and if that doctor could explain why you're feeling this pain, does knowing the pain's origin solve the problem? No. You go to the doctor not for an explanation of the history of the pain, but for the cure. It's how I feel when a cold is being passed around the office, and everyone wants to trace back to patient zero. As if it's really that person's fault. Sidebar: it's my pet peeve that people come in when they're sick. Don't do that. But once you're sick, figuring out who ""got you sick"" is a complete waste of time and energy. Once you know, does that help your symptoms? Does it speed your recovery? Absolutely not. Yes, I think the history of some things can be valuable in understanding them. But the history and origin of a problem without solution is not terribly useful. I think a lot of people don't have the guts to offer a solution. Because that's the easiest thing to attack. You can nitpick someone's solution, which will be seen as an effective way of discrediting their entire argument. Which is stupid. I deeply appreciate the solutions offered in this book, especially because they're solutions based mostly in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (which totally works) and because they're solutions that any individual can choose to apply. It's not a set of solutions that goes ""You motherfuckers need to stop doing X."" It's a set of solutions oriented towards, ""If you want to be a better person and have a better life, here are some realistic options.""Great read, and I'd definitely call it a must-read for parents of young kids who haven't given a lot of thought to giving their kid some rope. And parents who feel pressured by other parents, who are afraid of being seen as bad parents."
165,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31910342-josh,3,"I previously read Lukianoff's ""Unlearning Liberty"" earlier this year. While I thoroughly enjoyed that work, I was somewhat disappointed by this joint venture with social psychologist Jonathan Haidt. This is partly because while ""Unlearning Liberty"" was a searching examination of how higher education in recent years has failed in its central purpose to discover ""truth"" by prohibiting many forms of offensive speech on campus, this book tries to further that inquiry in some ways by putting together a composite of factors for why ""iGen"" (those who were born c. 1996) have embraced ""safetyism"" on college campuses. ""Safetyism"" is essentially the conflation of being offended with being in physical danger. The book is divided into three parts. The first unpacks what the authors call the ""three great untruths"" that iGen embraces: the world is divided between distinctly ""good"" people and wholly ""bad"" people; trust your feelings (i.e. emotional reasoning over logic); and ""safetyism"" which the authors describe as ""what doesn't hurt you, makes you weaker."" The second narrates a series of recent episodes of censorship and both far left/far right violence on college campuses, such as Berkeley Antifa protests against Milo Yiannopolis, the Alt-Right protests at UVA; and the Charles Murray episode at Middlebury. The final part explains what the authors believe are the six contributing factors that are the ""bad ideas [that] are setting up a generation for failure."" The last two chapters in this section deal with a) how parents should ideally raise children to be thick-skinned and critically thinking adults and b) how primary and secondary education can offer adolescents and teenagers the mental toolset to confront offensive ideas and grow intellectually from such debates. There is a lot of ground to cover in any review of this book (and much of what follows in this paragraph I explain in more detail in my review of Unlearning Liberty). But, the gist is that colleges and universities should be wholly focused on discerning ""truth."" Various public intellectuals, such as Van Jones, have argued that colleges provide people with a rare opportunity to grapple with offensive ideas and speech by using reasoning and argument. College should be a ""gym,"" to borrow from Van Jones, that trains people to debate and compromise within our democratic system. Since the early 2010s, though, many colleges (and almost exclusively the most liberal ones) have become distracted from the goal of seeking ""truth"" by protecting students from potentially offensive speech. There's an appropriate discussion within this section of how the left has stretched the definition of ""violence"" to include intuitively nonviolent actions, such as speech. By construing offensive speech as ""violent,"" college administrators, faculty, and students have effectively nullified the free speech privileges of a wide swathe of conservative intellectuals (and alt-right wackos) by appealing to the need to keep students ""safe"" on campus. The six factors that have contributed to the current climate of ""Safetyism,"" censorship, and unrest are best summed up as follows:1) American politics have become increasingly polarized (entering a ""polarization cycle"") where very little compromise is ever reached between left and right.2) The advent of social media and the internet has made ""iGen"" far more depressed and anxious than previous generations. 3) Parents since the 1980s have increasingly become ""helicopter"" parents, not allowing their children to experience any discomfort and sheltering them from the real world, so to speak. 4) What the authors term the ""decline of [free] play."" In other words, children have far less time relative to previous generations to socialize, initiate play, and be creative. This is caused by the fact that elite colleges and universities select from those with an abundance of extracurriculars (etc.) and parents respond by over-structuring their children's time with various activities. 5) Primary and secondary education have become obsessed with keeping students ""safe"" from offensive ideas and taboo subjects. 6) ""Social justice"" and its quest for equal outcomes has created a ""common enemy identity politics"" focused on subdividing people into various ""intersectional"" identities. The authors compare this to Martin Luther King, Jr.'s ""common humanity"" identity politics that sought to authentically include all Americans in the civil rights movement by appealing to the American civic religion. These six factors (covered in six chapters) are unevenly persuasive, although I generally agree with the authors that the cult of ""safe spaces"" and ""free speech zones"" on campuses is extremely problematic. I think I agree with some of the other reviews on Goodreads that some of their solutions contain assumptions grounded in a middle-class ethos. Specifically, their idea that children should be given more rein to explore their neighborhoods, talk to strangers, and even use public transportation at young ages (i.e. nine years old). The authors argue that our perception of danger is massively inflated by the 24 hour news cycle and John Walsh's crusade to catch ""America's Most Wanted."" I agree in part, but would argue that many parents (and single parents) living in certain rural or urban areas with high crime rates have legitimate concerns about allowing their children to be ""free range children."" Being a parent myself, I generally found their Dr. Spock parental advice annoying, at best, and naive at worst. Overall, an informative book that resonated well with my experience on campus the past seven years. Excepting the final two concluding chapters, I completely recommend this book to anyone seriously interested in learning more about what is happening on America's college campuses. But you should first read ""Unlearning Liberty."" "

The book also helped me to reexamine the educational choices that I have made for my 10 year old. I highly recommend this book, even though I didn't agree with everything that the authors had stated.

It is extremely well organized around key points. Every idea in the book is well substantiated. There are a wealth of references and data the authors used to make their points about the current problems of fragility, anti-free speech movements, depression and anxiety among university students. Although, it primarily focuses on US universities, it can easily be extrapolated to other major universities in the western world."

Kidding.This book is so relevant to the culture that we live in and the future that we are entering into. With its many different antidotes and research, the author does a fantastic job of bringing to the surface different lies (or 'Untruths' as he calls it) that have good intentions but can lead to detrimental effects overall. The stories can definitely get your blood pumping and outrage you at points and I think that's the point. 10/10 would recommend this to most people.One of the best parts of the book is the way the authors write in such a humble and transparent way. The consistently mention how the issues are more complex than they make them out to be and never claim to have the only answer. They also very openly share their political views and how they could influence their own writing when writing about political polarization. So good!"
169,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3730838-maggie-boyd,2,"I'm always interested in books critiquing our current educational system and sat down to read this one with enthusiasm. However, this book is less about what is wrong with our system and more about criticizing liberals for the horrors they have wrought upon our society. It begins with vilifying our current crop of college students: kids born after 1995 who began going to college in 2013. These children are having three great untruths fed to them by liberal universities: 1. The Untruth of Fragility: What doesn't kill you makes you weaker. 2. The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: Always trust your feelings. 3. The Untruth of Us versus Them: Life is a battle between good people and evil people. They go on to say that by creating safe spaces, colleges teach students to believe the above. The evidence? Students are preventing speakers from holding lectures they disagree with at their universities. As others have pointed out, this in no way keeps the speaker from disseminating their ideas. Milo, the target of one of these riots, was still making television appearances and publishing books. The students were asking that he not be allowed to speak in spaces their tuition paid for, a very different thing than asking that he never be allowed to speak anywhere. Moreover, this wasn't a question of not giving the speaker a chance to present his point but a reaction to the point the speaker had already made. Finally, the United States has over 3,000 4 yr. universities and the author's ""evidence"" centers around approximately 1% of those institutions having students make demands they felt were unreasonable. This is nowhere near epidemic. Then the authors get to what I felt was the primary point: Viewpoint diversity reduces a community’s susceptibility to witch hunts. One of the most important kinds of viewpoint diversity, diversity of political thought, has declined substantially among both professors and students at American universities since the 1990s. To sum up the first portion of the book has two major points: Anything that prevents someone from making a point, even if that point is offensive, is ""coddling"" and colleges are too liberal. We need more balance. (They didn't speak to the 600 Christian colleges where the staff is predominantly conservative.) After spending several chapters ""building a case"" on how the great untruths listed in the first paragraph are destroying young collegiate minds, the author's come to a startling conclusion: You can see why it was hard for us to make a strong case that universities were causing students to become anxious and depressed by teaching them disordered ways of thinking. Anxiety and depression rates were already rising for all teenagers before they arrived at college, and for those who never attended college as well. Clearly universities were not causing a national mental health crisis; they were responding to one. With liberal universities out as a scapegoat, bring in liberal parenting policies. Safteyism, where parents go to purportedly unreasonable limits to protect their kids might be a factor in kids being more fearful, which might be a factor in them being depressed. No direct evidence of this is available but they offer up some random events and show how those few events point to liberals running amok and creating too much fear in our kids. They have to admit, grudgingly, that many of the safety measures have worked. Putting it all together, from 1960 to 1990, there was a 48% reduction in deaths from unintended injuries and accidents among kids between five and fourteen years of age, and a 57% drop in deaths of younger kids (ages one to four).Lukianoff, Greg. The Coddling of the American Mind (p. 169). Penguin Publishing Group. Kindle Edition. In summary, the authors offer anecdotes and a handful of studies to showcase their points but the math in no way supports what they are saying. If you are someone who feels PC culture is at the heart of what is wrong with our country, you'll love this book and may believe it supports your view point. If you know how to do elementary school level math and have an understanding of the basic principle of percentages, you will quickly realize this tome is meant to speak into a very specific echo chamber and provides no substantial evidence to support the view that liberals will be the death of America."

He previously wrote The Righteous Mind, which was a powerful and thought-provoking read. Haidt, along with Greg Lukianoff, provide another powerful analysis and thought-provoking read with this book. I would recommend it to any and everyone. While there are specific recommendations that some may have differing personal preferences/opinions on, there is no lack of research in their presentation and arguments (and it’s safe to say they would welcome the discourse of another perspective). I especially appreciated their inclusion of CBT and how that could be a beneficial practice for many to adopt, as well as parents and institutions to encourage and teach. Looking forward to anything else Haidt writes. "

Over the 3 months since I finished The Coddling of the American Mind I cannot believe how many times I have shared the ideas of these authors with others. This book is just so pertinent, so timely, and so important that it comes up again and again. I generally read books and move on to the next so quickly, but this one has found a permanence in my worldview. I think that makes it worthy of 5 stars.Nov 21, 2018Why are so many college students struggling with anxiety and depression? Why are so many university campuses coming up against student demands to disinvite ""dangerous"" guest speakers, to penalize professors who propone unpopular opinions, and to dismiss any who threaten their conception of safety? This very insightful book discusses 3 great untruths of the ""IGen"" (the generation born after 1994, coinciding with the ubiquity of the iPhone): The Untruth of Fragility: What doesn’t kill you makes you weaker. The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: Always trust your feelings. The Untruth of Us Versus Them: Life is a battle between good people and evil people.It shows have parents and institutions have unwittingly taught youth these untruths, and have - with the best of intentions - coddled them to the point of handicapping their ability to handle the adult world. Within this framework, I gained some new insights into the reasons for our increasingly partisan political world.One thing I really like about The Coddling of the American Mind is that, unlike many books of this genre, it doesn't just rip down the system, telling us everything that's wrong with society, then leave us hopeless. Lukianoff and Haidt give pages of good, solid suggestions for how to correct the problems we have created. I would absolutely recommend this book to parents today, as well as to anyone in education or educational administration. It is quite bipartisan, but not afraid to point out problems on both side of the political spectrum. I already put the audiobook on hold for my husband!4.5 stars."

It was validating to read from a secular source of a different political affiliation than me the same identification of major problems I see in our culture/universities/media. Some problems I’d wholeheartedly agree with include, treating children & young adults as if they are fragile, assuming the worst about people who disagree with you, elevating “safetyism” as a top goal in life, tolerating a “call-out” culture that represses legitimate criticism and intimidates/shames people, and embracing identity politics. It was refreshing to read. The authors are sometimes too optimistic about what can bring about the turning of the ship, and sometimes they are too repetitive.

177,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7743315-jeanne,4,"Education should not be intended to make people comfortable; it is meant to make them think. – Hanna Holborn GrayI look for books that are going to make me think, make me see things differently. Coddling of the American Mind did this. In brief, it is about three great Untruths that are affecting US universities and making them weaker: that we are protecting them from things that they see as dangerous, because – although there are good people, there are also evil ones. The great Untruths are:1. The Untruth of Fragility: What doesn’t kill you makes you weaker. 2. The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: Always trust your feelings. 3. The Untruth of Us Versus Them: Life is a battle between good people and evil people. (p. 4) Lukianoff and Haidt are provocative, but also good at bringing together diverse kinds of information together to help us recognize, as the subtitle goes, ""how good intentions and bad ideas are setting up a generation for failure.""For a book about the dichotomous and extreme thinking characterizing parenting, students, and the university system in the 21st century, Lukianoff and Haidt slip into dichotomous thinking. As do we all from time to time.We are in an age of helicopter parenting – even bulldozer parenting – where parents attempt to intervene with their college-aged children in a way that my daughters, frustratingly, would not allow me to do when they were in grade school. Rather than helping them, except in the short-term, this sort of parenting (and overscheduling, failing to allow or encourage free play, etc.) leaves students to becoming fragile, anxious, and easily hurt. Lukianoff and Haidt argue compellingly that college students should and must be exposed to viewpoint diversity, which will help them think more critically, understand diverse perspectives, and withstand events that would otherwise make them depressed and anxious. As the authors conclude, this means that we should beseeking out challenges (rather than eliminating or avoiding everything that “feels unsafe”), freeing yourself from cognitive distortions (rather than always trusting your initial feelings), and taking a generous view of other people, and looking for nuance (rather than assuming the worst about people within a simplistic us-versus-them morality). (p. 14)I appreciated Coddling of the American Mind, but I was often annoyed and irritated by it – which are not good outcomes for this time of year. Lukianoff and Haidt gathered interesting and often compelling threads, but I wasn't convinced by all of their evidence. Clearly, there is more anxiety and depression on campus than when I was in school, but that isn't necessarily a function of ""coddling,"" but of greater access on college campuses. Students who would not have been able to attend college 20 years ago can.While Lukianoff and Haidt criticize students' complaints about controversial and noncontroversial speakers (e.g., George Will, Bill Maher, Eric Holder, Madeleine Albright), I am less dismayed. I like that students are more likely to set limits about things that my generation accepted (e.g., #metoo).Current parenting practices, among many other things, have both strengths and weaknesses. Lukianoff and Haidt primarily focus on the downside here, but maybe we can look for some nuance and attempt to create a stronger model for the next generation of parents – and universities."
178,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3052770-teri,4,"This is an important read in today's society. This book is a look at the iGen generation that seems to be obsessed with technology and social media. The authors look at how ready access to news and social media affects attitudes and higher education. iGen students seem to be obsessed with protecting themselves against any other opinion than their own. They are less open to expanding their worldview and listening to opposing views to gain a broader understanding of today's society. This has led to students feeling ""unsafe"" when dealing with someone who does not share their views. Are they truly physically unsafe or are they just unable to process opposing views? Instead of engaging in open, civil debate or listening to gain understanding, students are sheltered and professors and administrators kowtow to students, offering special ""safe spaces,"" firing faculty who simply exercise their first amendment right, or even canceling guest speakers whose views are not shared with the majority of students. In essence, the authors suggest that we are coddling America's youth and young adults, sheltering them to the point that they are unable to process opinions and ideas that they do not identify with. The authors spend a lot of time discussing how technology and social media have affected current attitudes and lifestyles. Where once young kids would go out and play in the neighborhood, without constant adult supervision, they are today being watched by helicopter parents, suggesting that kids are being overprotected. Are we coddling the younger generations to the point that they are unable to psychologically handle uncomfortable positions? It is certainly worth thinking about and this book will open that discussion to consider if we are doing a disservice to our youth.I think this is a must-read for parents, teachers, and faculty of higher education. These are the children that will one day rule our nation. How will they handle our future?"

From the way, this generation of college students was raised to how schools handled shaping these young people. All of this has led to creating overprotected young adults who are taking longer to mature. The authors' intentions are to help future generations not need overprotection from society as they enter the real world and leave their family home. While kids are young they need the freedom to make mistakes and have those times used as a learning experience. Basically to sum it up let kids take risks while they're growing up. “Prepare your child for the road, not the road for your child.” "

It tackles issues within both the political left and the political right. The book mainly focuses in on college campuses which have become increasingly left-wing but the authors also zoom out and look at the poor reactions from right-wing fringe groups and even mainstream conservatism. The two authors have presented a strong case for free speech and a renewed sense of trust in the American people to be able to sift through different ideas and make smart choices about which ones reign true and which ones prove false.

182,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28777221-sharad-pandian,3,"If you've been following the fracas on and surrounding American universities, there's nothing new in this book for you.As the title suggests, Jonathan Haidt and Greg Lukianoff argue that American children from the iGen generation (born 1995 or beyond) are raised in situations and using methods unique in ways that make them interpret discomfort as danger. This makes them unable to cope, and harms them and their causes.I. Why this book is a waste of spaceTo understand why this book goes wrong, its important to appreciate a central tension in the way we think about ideas. On one hand, clearly people have been wrong about so much in the past and therefore as Mill suggests we should keep avenues for debate and change always open. On the other hand, the content of ideas currently held actually matter because they shape the world we live in both symbolically and materially. Therefore, if a certain idea is deemed wrong, it is important to resist it and its spread. It's the inability of creatures like ourselves, condemned to live in time, to resolve this tension in any general way that leads to so much chatter about free speech and its limits.The problem with the authors of this book is that they model debates as though ideas don't matter except for debate, as though fermenting debate itself were the point of ideas. The notion that there power differentials that are deeply entrenched and might not be removed by polite argumentation doesn't even come up.For example, a convenient manner to think about oppression is through ""structural analysis"" which helps make sense of the institutions and experiences that are frequent and persistent. To live in this miasma isn't merely about encountering scary ideas but actually being harmed in a variety of ways, and it really is unclear what the best way to resist and liberate. But the authors are convinced that they know best, since obviously more speech and more ideas is how victory will be won. They make much use of how the recent victories for same-sex marriage included campaigning that stressed similarity and shared community, but conveniently leave out how Stonewall was a riot.When they come close to discussing the obviously relevant idea of power, they just manage feebly to say:In calling for the dismantling of power structures, the author was using a set of terms and concepts that are common in some academic departments; the main line of argumentation fell squarely within the large family of Marxist approaches to social and political analysis. It’s a set of approaches in which things are analyzed primarily in terms of power. Groups struggle for power. Within this paradigm, when power is perceived to be held by one group over others, there is a moral polarity: the groups seen as powerful are bad, while the groups seen as oppressed are good. It’s a variant of the pathological dualism that Rabbi Sacks described in the quotation at the start of this chapter.All structural analysis are first reduced to ""groups struggle for power"" and then into instances of ""pathological dualism"" between the ""unimpeachably good and the irredeemably bad"".There are a lot of serious critiques possible about the relevance and fruitfulness of thinking about oppression as ""structural"", but this glib dismissal is intellectually embarrassing.Their unwillingness to take power seriously makes this entire book a slog through shallow liberal moralizing. Instead of responding to Down Girl: The Logic of Misogyny's point about how it is better to concentrate on the incident and impact instead of intent, because it makes it much, much harder to call out harmful behaviour, they just assume intent is what matters, and so anyone thinks otherwise is labouring under a ""cognitive distortion""The most evident is catastrophizing: If Milo Yiannopoulos is allowed to speak, there will be “broken bodies” on our side. I might lose my “right to exist.” Therefore, violence is justified, because it is self-defense. The author also engages in dichotomous thinking: If you condemn my side’s violence, that means you condone Yiannopoulos’s ideas. You must “pick a side.” You’re either with us or against us. Life is a battle between good people and evil people, and if you disagree with us, you’re one of the evil people…But if asking for peaceful dialogue is violent, then it seems that the word “violence” is taking on new meanings for some students.The point here isn't even that the Milo protests were the obvious way to go (although Milo's inability to get funding since suggests so), but that it's quite impossible to know antecedently or even in the short-term which strategies will be successful. Does treating every small incident as though it's important work better or does taking a more judicious strategy? Despite this lack of clarity about the truth, the authors frame the debate as young college students with good hearts making foolish choices instead of considering that they might possibly be engaging in successful resistance to entrenched evils.II. Why this book is still importantDespite this, there are three reasons this still remains a decent book.First, a significant chunk of the book concerns trends that converge in the iGen generation, including the lack of opportunity for free play, more bureaucracy, etc. It's really fun to read in one place, even if the information isn't new Second, it really is true that a lot of incidents of campus have been horrific, indicating that thinking you're on the right side of history allows for sadism and heedlessness. If you're on social media and have a functioning brain, you know the Left can go overboard in its mob mentality. As from above, I don't think we can say with certainty that these methods as a whole won't be successful, but they clearly do go against strong moral sensibilities at times. The Heckler's veto against anyone conservative, violence, cruelty all seem unacceptable, however much we tell ourselves it might ultimately be for the best.Third, the book is a lot more compelling if we don't think of it as a political project at all, but about psychologists simply talking about trends in the progressive movement that might be affecting mental health, fostering unhealthy ideas, and leading to irrational behaviour. At higher levels of explanation, trends might emerge that might be difficult to account for on a case-by-case basis, and I think the authors present a plausible case that taken as a whole, a lot of practices might be making the situation worse for students.Overall, a book better read as a summary of recent events on American campuses than as any kind of original contribution."
183,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2473528-roseanna-white,5,"Everyone with kids college-aged or younger needs to read this book! It addresses the trend of ""safetyism"" and student fragility--that the ideas of ""dangerous"" have crept from physical harm to emotional discomfort, which is proven not to make our kids STRONGER, but rather emotionally WEAKER. In it the authors not only discuss the problems that have come rather suddenly to college campuses, but the reasons behind them, and how we as parents and educators can correct it . The main theme is that there are Three Great Untruths that a generation has been taught to embrace, but which are what the psychology field knows are ""cognitive distortions."" Harmful ways of thinking that encourage us to see catastrophe, bias, and enemies where there are none. These are things we can universally recognize as untrue...but which are so easy to fall into.I'm not a big non-fiction reader these days, but I loved this book and have already made some changes to the rules for my kids based on the very sound evidence presented in it, as well as the wonderful advice.What I loved most about this book though is that it's quite possibly the only UNBIASED view I've encountered in recent years. Near the end of the book the authors do tell us their political views but up until they came out and said it, I had no idea whether they were liberal or conservative, D or R, even though they were discussing issues that dealt with the widening gap between them. They instead got at exactly what they encourage their readers to get at in our own lives: the wider circle of humanity to which we all belong."

185,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12766685-alison,3,"First - I agree with their argument on free-play time for children. As a mom, I see this as an essential part of growing up and their discussion really helped me to figure out some of the reasons why it has felt important but I was struggling to articulate that. I also appreciated the points they made about safetyism. It is something I have seen and I now have a label for it and can hopefully better communicate the risks.But, I also struggled often with this book. I think that saying someone shouldn't be offended by a comment that you didn't know would be offensive removes the responsibility from the speaker to learn anything that could stop them from saying hurtful/offensive things in the future - most of the examples they use are of ways in which people say things that perpetuate systems of oppression (racism, sexism, etc) and by shrugging things off, the system doesn't get fixed. If the speaker were able to listen and change, then getting offended wouldn't be useful, but too often that's not the outcome. This is a topic I have been working though - I don't always understand why someone got offended, but when I listen or read, I can usually get it. But it comes back on me to learn, not them to get thick skin (I'm not always the speaker, but usually a somewhat confused bystander in these cases).It will raise my hackles when a book uses the version of MLK Jr that only encompasses his Dream speech and not also his other letter, sermons, and speeches. I think they simplified things too much on this respect.The sections laying out how various professors and others in academia have been mistreated was good at pointing out the failings of those areas, but I think that if you are looking for it you could easily find bad behavior in religion, in business, in government, etc. Every aspect of our culture contains humans and within that subset, they may *misbehave* in different ways, but every area has people who misuse power or are unqualified. I also have a few gripes with the way they discuss campus protests. I think we would agree about a lot of this, but I want to point that people like Heather McDonald and Charles Murray have writt books, the people protesting them are almost certainly aware of their views (either by reading the book or discussing parts of it) and they are choosing to say that this person has bad ideas. It is not that HM or CM don't get any chance to speak or promote their ideas - they still have free speech. It is more that students wish the wouldn't be given platforms for these ideas. I agree with Coddling in that violence is abhorrent and counterproductive, but they way they frame the rest of the conversation is in error.Overall - it was a book that made me think, but had some very problematic portions."
186,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1655983-katie,1,"The flaws of this book cloud the conclusion. Some of the flaws:-Anecdotes about campus events are used despite authors demand that everyone be more focused on facts and data. Some of the incidents described are indeed examples of extreme sensitivity and intolerance. Worrisome trend, but not convincing that campuses have abandoned free speech.-Serious lack of time spent on investigating and confirming the issues college students care about. The Trump administration is a frightening turn, threatening institutions and norms - shouldn't we expect young people to protest?-CBT as a treatment for anxiety I get, but as a treatment for real threats and oppression? So insulting! We have an administration threatening to take away healthcare, women's health care, rights of immigrants, gay people, minorities. What happens when a lesbian girl is told a speaker believes she is deviant who needs to go to conversion camp? She should practice CBT and remember the speaker has good intentions? When Richard Spencer coming to campus to spout off about peaceful ethnic cleansing, should students practice CBT? Just because the book does justice to some topics - like IGen social issues, helicopter parenting and safteyism, - does not mean the book works. I also happen to agree this generation does not conceive of the First Amendment like my generation does. College kids raised with awareness of inequality in American, we were raised to worry about authoritarianism and the Cold War. I think the topic deserves scrutiny, but these authors failed in my opinion. "
187,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5862443-joseph-stieb,4,"Full disclosure: I am a Haidt fanboy, so I'm predisposed to like this book. Unlike the Righteous Mind, it is not outstanding. Books that are elaborations of long-form articles rarely are. If you follow Haidt and Lukianoff's work closely, this is mainly a summary of what they have been doing the last 4 years of so (see Haidt's excellent Wriston Lecture for a distillation). Still, this is a strong, well-sourced, and fair-minded argument about where higher ed has turned wrong and how it can be rectified.Haidt and Lukianoff argue for an older understanding of the purpose of higher education: the pursuit of truth rather than the furthering of a political agenda. They convincingly show how higher ed has become more partisan and less ideologically diverse, although they don't do much to show how this stultifies and biases research and teaching (for more on this, see Shields and Dunn's outstanding Passing on the Right). Their focus is on why things like trigger warnings, disinvitations, interruptions of speakers, micro-aggressions, etc have surged on campus in the last 5 years or so. The core of their argument is less about ideology than generational shifts. Despite the somewhat inflammatory title, they put forth a complex, nuanced argument that the I-Gen (born in mid 1990s, came of age with cellphones and social media as normal things, in contrast to millennial, who were teens when the iPhone and facebook came out) is a far more anxious and dependent generation that doesn't know how to handle conflict on its own and has been coached to go to the authorities instead. Take a far more polarized, bureaucratized university system, and you get more kids calling for ""coddling"" and more administrators giving it to them to prevent their school from becoming the next Yale or Missouri. The leftist intellectual framework that these students embrace (redefinition of safety and violence, identitarian common enemy politics, a radical interpretation intersectionality, the dismissal of anything written by a dead white guy as not worth reading because he must have been a racist/sexist) isn't the deeper cause of this surge in left-wing activism on campus. Rather, changes in the climate of US politics and the way kids are raised primes them to take in this ideological system. This can be changed on both ends, although I am more interested in how to change to college atmosphere and how to make these ideas (each of which has some value) more realistic and less polarizing and politically ""weaponized.""The intellectual cases put forth against all of these concepts that have crept into academia are excellent, as usual. They explain how each of these things encourages mentally and intellectually unhealthy thinking, feeds tribalism, and makes open, trusting conversation impossible on campus. Still, I thought they were getting a little loose from their moorings in their criticism of modern parenting. It is hard to tell parents to not be a little over-protective of their kids. There are ways to do this (like more unstructured time built into a kid's day, at school and at home, plus less screen time) but overall I think most parents do a pretty good job. I think they are both part of pretty elite social circles in which tiger parenting was very common. My middle class upbringing seemed to have plenty of free time, and my parents let me and my brothers roam the neighborhood pretty freely. I wouldn't dismiss all of their argument about parenting, but it was probably the weak link in the book.I'd recommend this book to anyone concerned about changes on campus or anyone who has heard about Haidt and is curious. It is concise, and very qualified. As usual, Haidt's critics have misrepresented his argument left and right, so make sure you go to the source."

While it's useful to have the earlier background on past decades in academia, Bloom's original is not required reading before enjoying Haidt's great contribution here.These authors lead the reader through some great analyses -- they show how a drastic shift in the mentality of arguments/debate on college campuses happened in 2013, along with a seemingly drastic shift in mindset surrounding the purpose of education. I'll list some of their principles here: Prepare the child for the road, not the road for the child. We are all prone to emotional reasoning and confirmation bias. Your worst enemy cannot harm you as much as your own unguarded thoughts. People are prone to catastroph-izing about the future. We are all prone to tribalism. Many psychological principles on college campuses encourage students to embrace foolishness, rather than wisdom. Young people are innately anti-fragile, but they learn helplessness in correlation with rising rates of adolescent depression and anxiety, a shift to more protective parenting, and widespread play deprivation and risk deprivation. We are seeing rising political polarization and expanded bureaucracy. We also see a rising passion for justice combined with a growing commitment to attaining equal outcomes in all areas. The rise in passion for justice is admirable on its own, but when combined with a demand to see equity, not equality, it becomes misguided.Some falsehoods: What doesn't kill you, makes you weaker.

This monograph explores how 'fragility' is being developed in children, adolescence and students on university campuses. While much of the attention is on the left and social justice politics, there is some focus on the polarization of politics from the alt-right.The problems with this book are clear. The authors confuse a diversity of facts and interpretations with emotions rather than rigour. EH Carr stated in 1961 that ""history means interpretation."" Only particular facts have survived to our present. Therefore assuming that the source material - the material culture - that remains in our present is accurate, true and convincing while alternative interpretations are emotional or intuitive perpetuates a mis-understanding of history, media and politics.Are students fragile? Perhaps. The greater question is why students are fragile. That is the question not asked or answered in this book. Unemployment, under-employment, exhorbitant fees for education, ridiculous payments for privatized utilities, and ill-information public policies are only part of our corrosive present.Protests exist because there is no space to be different, to be defiant, and - in the case of George Floyd - to breathe. This is not emotion or intent. This is verified and an outcome of claustropolitan structures. A provocative book. It lacks a deep engagement of the political economy. Therefore - and ironically - it is part of the identity politics superficiality it wishes to critique."
191,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7258380-dan-graser,5,"This collaboration between Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt is fantastic on many levels and addresses a thorny issue with precision, honesty, and language that is free of the usual superficial pejoratives found in such discussions. They begin with three fundamental Untruths that they have distilled from their own experiences working in academia and social psychology:1) What doesn't kill you makes you weaker.2) Always trust your feelings.3) Life is a battle between good people and evil people.These ideas are discussed in the context of current political divides, campus culture, parenting, and general discourse on social media. Throughout, they use 6 ""explanatory threads"" to understand how we have gotten where we are, sociologically and politically:1) There has been a steady increase in affective polarization since the 1980's, such that people don't feel a stronger kinship with their party but bond more over hatred of the opposition.2) There has been a nation-wide rise in adolescent anxiety and depression since 2011, mainly affecting those who belong to the ""iGen"" or Generation Z.3) There has been a shift, starting in the 80's and reaching a peak in the 90's among more educated families especially, to fearful and needlessly overprotective ""paranoid parenting.""4) The steady decline of unsupervised free play among children due to the above trend. 5) The growth of campus bureaucracy and the expansion of over-protection of students who themselves, don't wish it or need it, resulting in the transmission of the very type of psychological issues the campus is trying to prevent. 6) The rise of social justice activism, rightfully, in response to turbulent and emotionally powerful political events between 2012 and 2018.As someone who works in academia and is genuinely concerned about students' well-being, I always enjoy reading works that provide data, facts, and arguments based in psychology to suggest how we can improve that mission while dealing with the issues present in the larger social-political context, with which our students are dealing. This book contains the finest discussion of this I have seen in addition to great, level-headed discussions of modern parenting, social justice activism, and identity politics. Well worth your time!"

Still, more people should be talking about some silly viewpoints that are popular at the moment. "
193,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2319320-melissa,5,"Wonder why the young generation seems so bad at thinking? This book sheds light on what ""we"" collectively as a society have done to cause it. We've taught three falsehoods as truth: That individuals are fragile, that we can trust our feelings, that life is a battle between good and bad people. Do you feel, like me, that there is no way you're going to write down your thoughts on a particular topic esp. publicly, because no matter how well reasoned or how good your intentions, if you use one wrong word, you're deemed evil for life by one side or the other? (You're ""cancelled."") We've hearkened back to the time of witch hunts, and I found that chapter of the history of what leads to the eras of witch hunts (which we're in a time of those right now) enlightening about why the heck one word in a well meant email can cause a person's complete ruin. We need to get back to a time where we give people the benefit of the doubt! The information on Cognitive Behavior Therapy was also enlightening. As a society, we are essentially going against good psychological practice and teaching bad ways of thinking. One of my sons is a doomsday thinker and I'm happy to have some of these CBT tools to see if I can help him stop the negative thinking habits of thinking the worst about everything and everybody. We see this reflected in society right now, everyone jumps to conclusions on a story that's not an hour old with nothing but a headline and decide they have the ability to be judge, jury, and executioner on that alone and then move on as if ruining that person's life was not a weighty matter. I don't want my son growing up to be like that and it's been frustrating to try to talk him out of his thought processes because I want him to grown up sound of mind unlike many people I've encountered lately, and I've wondered why it is they can be such bad thinkers, and this book enlightens on that some of the reasons.The practical application section is worth the price of the read on what we can do to turn the boat around. Thankfully, I've been already doing a lot of the suggestions for my kids in my determination to have them grow up sound of mind, but this was nice to have the facts and stats to help solidify what I'm doing to help. This is another book that shows our overly scheduled, screen-heavy existence is doing nothing good for our youth. The authors of this book reveal toward the end of the book what their political leanings are and they're nearly the opposite of mine, but I'd say there is no slant, because I agreed with nearly all of it, it was logical, reasoned, well laid out--we're facing a problem that affects both sides of the political spectrum. It is a bit of a slog at the beginning with all the research and the fact that they are very academic writers with the ""I'll tell you this, I'm telling you, and now I'll summarize what I just told you"" which probably is all right if you're one to read at leisure instead of read books from cover to cover like me, that would help you remember what you read if you put it down for any amount of time, but be forewarned that it isn't a fast paced read. But it's an excellent read."
194,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2007216-peter-derk,4,"What an interesting book.I think what would prevent most people from reading this is probably some version of a sentiment that can be summed up as ""Okay Boomer."" But if that's how you're feeling, I would encourage you to give it a shot.Although there are lots of examples from college campuses, they're pretty balanced between things that overly-sensitive people are doing and things that crazy people are doing (usually white power weirdos). And while there is some condemnation of behavior, I felt like the author was very empathetic towards people and wasn't saying anything remotely like, ""These snowflakes need to shape up!"" or ""These iGen kids are ruining everything!"" If you read it that way, that's probably your preconceived notion and sensitivity lenses at work, not the real content of the book. The most interesting portions to me were related to parenting and how much it's changed in just a few decades. There was a section that listed a checklist for parents for school readiness for young kids. 30 or 40 years ago, the list was a lot of things like, ""You child can ride a two-wheel bicycle, Your child can walk alone to a store or home 2 or 3 blocks away..."" where now it looks more like, ""Your child can spell phonetically, Your child can understand basic mathematical concepts..."" So where once it was ""Is your child capable of managing their physical safety?"" now it's more ""Can your child fill out a worksheet?"" Which seems profoundly stupid to me. This is my Okay Boomer moment, so buckle up.When I was a kid we used to roam around the town in small groups of 2-4 kids. Sometimes on bikes, sometimes just walking. And it wasn't like we had to check in every hour with our parents. I rode the bus to the mall. I would go to the grocery store alone or with a friend. In the summer, this was basically all we did, screw around during unstructured time. You learn a lot without realizing it. You learn to avoid true danger, like weirdos and creeps. You learn how to do simple shit like walk into a grocery store, pick something out and pay for it. You learn how to take a bus. You learn the geography of where you live. I had a coworker who lived in a very safe neighborhood and wouldn't allow her son to walk to the bus alone. It was like a block. Eventually, she did let him do it, but he had to be on a walkie talkie and talk to her the whole time until he got on the bus. I've had a number of people tell me that when their kids are learning to drive, they have no idea where they are inside of their own towns. They don't know how to get from home to school. Every day, the school I work next to, parents line up their cars to drive up to the door of the school, at which point their child is released, gets in the car, and then the parents drive them home. Like they're goddamn diplomats in need of a secure escort. This line of cars extends several blocks, and parents will wait up to an hour in a line of cars to pick up their kids. The kids can walk or bike or whatever, but very few, if any, do this, and if they do want to do it this way the parents have to sign a waiver. I can already hear the parents: You don't have a kid, so you don't understand. If you don't have kids, you'll hear this all the time. And I totally agree, I don't have the emotional understanding of a parent. However, I would proffer this: I probably have a more realistic assessment of danger to children because I'm NOT a parent. I'm not emotionally invested, which means when I'm looking at the realistic dangers, my thinking isn't tainted by my personal stakes. There are some parents who agree with me, that kids should have a little more freedom. There was the mom profiled in the book, the sort of mother of the Free Range Kids movement, who let her young son ride the subway home by himself at one point, which turned out great.I do think kids probably need a little more room, a little more agency, and a little less structure. One of the more profound insights in the book had to do with the level of discourse we're experiencing today. In short, people suck at discussing things because they never had un-referee'ed disagreements as kids. When you're a kid, if you're playing a game with 4 other kids, you have to learn how to argue or disagree without the other kid getting up and leaving, at which point the game is unplayable. Newer parents tend to referee everything, jumping in if things get intense. But letting kids work these things out themselves might be a way to help them learn the skills of discussing things without getting to the point that everyone takes their ball and goes home.The best part of the book, however, is that it offers a lot of potential solutions. I've found that I'm a solutions-based thinking, so solutions speak to me. Even when I disagree with the solutions, I think solutions-oriented thinking speaks to me and gets me thinking along the lines of productive movement. Way too many books that I might put in the sociology category seem very focused on talking about the problem. I usually hear what the author is saying and think, ""Okay, I buy that this is a problem, but what now?"" To borrow an analogy from another book, a problem that's well-explained is great, but if you went to the doctor with a pain, and if that doctor could explain why you're feeling this pain, does knowing the pain's origin solve the problem? No. You go to the doctor not for an explanation of the history of the pain, but for the cure. It's how I feel when a cold is being passed around the office, and everyone wants to trace back to patient zero. As if it's really that person's fault. Sidebar: it's my pet peeve that people come in when they're sick. Don't do that. But once you're sick, figuring out who ""got you sick"" is a complete waste of time and energy. Once you know, does that help your symptoms? Does it speed your recovery? Absolutely not. Yes, I think the history of some things can be valuable in understanding them. But the history and origin of a problem without solution is not terribly useful. I think a lot of people don't have the guts to offer a solution. Because that's the easiest thing to attack. You can nitpick someone's solution, which will be seen as an effective way of discrediting their entire argument. Which is stupid. I deeply appreciate the solutions offered in this book, especially because they're solutions based mostly in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (which totally works) and because they're solutions that any individual can choose to apply. It's not a set of solutions that goes ""You motherfuckers need to stop doing X."" It's a set of solutions oriented towards, ""If you want to be a better person and have a better life, here are some realistic options.""Great read, and I'd definitely call it a must-read for parents of young kids who haven't given a lot of thought to giving their kid some rope. And parents who feel pressured by other parents, who are afraid of being seen as bad parents."
195,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31910342-josh,3,"I previously read Lukianoff's ""Unlearning Liberty"" earlier this year. While I thoroughly enjoyed that work, I was somewhat disappointed by this joint venture with social psychologist Jonathan Haidt. This is partly because while ""Unlearning Liberty"" was a searching examination of how higher education in recent years has failed in its central purpose to discover ""truth"" by prohibiting many forms of offensive speech on campus, this book tries to further that inquiry in some ways by putting together a composite of factors for why ""iGen"" (those who were born c. 1996) have embraced ""safetyism"" on college campuses. ""Safetyism"" is essentially the conflation of being offended with being in physical danger. The book is divided into three parts. The first unpacks what the authors call the ""three great untruths"" that iGen embraces: the world is divided between distinctly ""good"" people and wholly ""bad"" people; trust your feelings (i.e. emotional reasoning over logic); and ""safetyism"" which the authors describe as ""what doesn't hurt you, makes you weaker."" The second narrates a series of recent episodes of censorship and both far left/far right violence on college campuses, such as Berkeley Antifa protests against Milo Yiannopolis, the Alt-Right protests at UVA; and the Charles Murray episode at Middlebury. The final part explains what the authors believe are the six contributing factors that are the ""bad ideas [that] are setting up a generation for failure."" The last two chapters in this section deal with a) how parents should ideally raise children to be thick-skinned and critically thinking adults and b) how primary and secondary education can offer adolescents and teenagers the mental toolset to confront offensive ideas and grow intellectually from such debates. There is a lot of ground to cover in any review of this book (and much of what follows in this paragraph I explain in more detail in my review of Unlearning Liberty). But, the gist is that colleges and universities should be wholly focused on discerning ""truth."" Various public intellectuals, such as Van Jones, have argued that colleges provide people with a rare opportunity to grapple with offensive ideas and speech by using reasoning and argument. College should be a ""gym,"" to borrow from Van Jones, that trains people to debate and compromise within our democratic system. Since the early 2010s, though, many colleges (and almost exclusively the most liberal ones) have become distracted from the goal of seeking ""truth"" by protecting students from potentially offensive speech. There's an appropriate discussion within this section of how the left has stretched the definition of ""violence"" to include intuitively nonviolent actions, such as speech. By construing offensive speech as ""violent,"" college administrators, faculty, and students have effectively nullified the free speech privileges of a wide swathe of conservative intellectuals (and alt-right wackos) by appealing to the need to keep students ""safe"" on campus. The six factors that have contributed to the current climate of ""Safetyism,"" censorship, and unrest are best summed up as follows:1) American politics have become increasingly polarized (entering a ""polarization cycle"") where very little compromise is ever reached between left and right.2) The advent of social media and the internet has made ""iGen"" far more depressed and anxious than previous generations. 3) Parents since the 1980s have increasingly become ""helicopter"" parents, not allowing their children to experience any discomfort and sheltering them from the real world, so to speak. 4) What the authors term the ""decline of [free] play."" In other words, children have far less time relative to previous generations to socialize, initiate play, and be creative. This is caused by the fact that elite colleges and universities select from those with an abundance of extracurriculars (etc.) and parents respond by over-structuring their children's time with various activities. 5) Primary and secondary education have become obsessed with keeping students ""safe"" from offensive ideas and taboo subjects. 6) ""Social justice"" and its quest for equal outcomes has created a ""common enemy identity politics"" focused on subdividing people into various ""intersectional"" identities. The authors compare this to Martin Luther King, Jr.'s ""common humanity"" identity politics that sought to authentically include all Americans in the civil rights movement by appealing to the American civic religion. These six factors (covered in six chapters) are unevenly persuasive, although I generally agree with the authors that the cult of ""safe spaces"" and ""free speech zones"" on campuses is extremely problematic. I think I agree with some of the other reviews on Goodreads that some of their solutions contain assumptions grounded in a middle-class ethos. Specifically, their idea that children should be given more rein to explore their neighborhoods, talk to strangers, and even use public transportation at young ages (i.e. nine years old). The authors argue that our perception of danger is massively inflated by the 24 hour news cycle and John Walsh's crusade to catch ""America's Most Wanted."" I agree in part, but would argue that many parents (and single parents) living in certain rural or urban areas with high crime rates have legitimate concerns about allowing their children to be ""free range children."" Being a parent myself, I generally found their Dr. Spock parental advice annoying, at best, and naive at worst. Overall, an informative book that resonated well with my experience on campus the past seven years. Excepting the final two concluding chapters, I completely recommend this book to anyone seriously interested in learning more about what is happening on America's college campuses. But you should first read ""Unlearning Liberty."" "

The book also helped me to reexamine the educational choices that I have made for my 10 year old. I highly recommend this book, even though I didn't agree with everything that the authors had stated.

With its many different antidotes and research, the author does a fantastic job of bringing to the surface different lies (or 'Untruths' as he calls it) that have good intentions but can lead to detrimental effects overall. The stories can definitely get your blood pumping and outrage you at points and I think that's the point. 10/10 would recommend this to most people.One of the best parts of the book is the way the authors write in such a humble and transparent way. The consistently mention how the issues are more complex than they make them out to be and never claim to have the only answer.

199,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3730838-maggie-boyd,2,"I'm always interested in books critiquing our current educational system and sat down to read this one with enthusiasm. However, this book is less about what is wrong with our system and more about criticizing liberals for the horrors they have wrought upon our society. It begins with vilifying our current crop of college students: kids born after 1995 who began going to college in 2013. These children are having three great untruths fed to them by liberal universities: 1. The Untruth of Fragility: What doesn't kill you makes you weaker. 2. The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: Always trust your feelings. 3. The Untruth of Us versus Them: Life is a battle between good people and evil people. They go on to say that by creating safe spaces, colleges teach students to believe the above. The evidence? Students are preventing speakers from holding lectures they disagree with at their universities. As others have pointed out, this in no way keeps the speaker from disseminating their ideas. Milo, the target of one of these riots, was still making television appearances and publishing books. The students were asking that he not be allowed to speak in spaces their tuition paid for, a very different thing than asking that he never be allowed to speak anywhere. Moreover, this wasn't a question of not giving the speaker a chance to present his point but a reaction to the point the speaker had already made. Finally, the United States has over 3,000 4 yr. universities and the author's ""evidence"" centers around approximately 1% of those institutions having students make demands they felt were unreasonable. This is nowhere near epidemic. Then the authors get to what I felt was the primary point: Viewpoint diversity reduces a community’s susceptibility to witch hunts. One of the most important kinds of viewpoint diversity, diversity of political thought, has declined substantially among both professors and students at American universities since the 1990s. To sum up the first portion of the book has two major points: Anything that prevents someone from making a point, even if that point is offensive, is ""coddling"" and colleges are too liberal. We need more balance. (They didn't speak to the 600 Christian colleges where the staff is predominantly conservative.) After spending several chapters ""building a case"" on how the great untruths listed in the first paragraph are destroying young collegiate minds, the author's come to a startling conclusion: You can see why it was hard for us to make a strong case that universities were causing students to become anxious and depressed by teaching them disordered ways of thinking. Anxiety and depression rates were already rising for all teenagers before they arrived at college, and for those who never attended college as well. Clearly universities were not causing a national mental health crisis; they were responding to one. With liberal universities out as a scapegoat, bring in liberal parenting policies. Safteyism, where parents go to purportedly unreasonable limits to protect their kids might be a factor in kids being more fearful, which might be a factor in them being depressed. No direct evidence of this is available but they offer up some random events and show how those few events point to liberals running amok and creating too much fear in our kids. They have to admit, grudgingly, that many of the safety measures have worked. Putting it all together, from 1960 to 1990, there was a 48% reduction in deaths from unintended injuries and accidents among kids between five and fourteen years of age, and a 57% drop in deaths of younger kids (ages one to four).Lukianoff, Greg. The Coddling of the American Mind (p. 169). Penguin Publishing Group. Kindle Edition. In summary, the authors offer anecdotes and a handful of studies to showcase their points but the math in no way supports what they are saying. If you are someone who feels PC culture is at the heart of what is wrong with our country, you'll love this book and may believe it supports your view point. If you know how to do elementary school level math and have an understanding of the basic principle of percentages, you will quickly realize this tome is meant to speak into a very specific echo chamber and provides no substantial evidence to support the view that liberals will be the death of America."

He previously wrote The Righteous Mind, which was a powerful and thought-provoking read. Haidt, along with Greg Lukianoff, provide another powerful analysis and thought-provoking read with this book. I would recommend it to any and everyone. While there are specific recommendations that some may have differing personal preferences/opinions on, there is no lack of research in their presentation and arguments (and it’s safe to say they would welcome the discourse of another perspective). I especially appreciated their inclusion of CBT and how that could be a beneficial practice for many to adopt, as well as parents and institutions to encourage and teach. Looking forward to anything else Haidt writes. "

Over the 3 months since I finished The Coddling of the American Mind I cannot believe how many times I have shared the ideas of these authors with others. This book is just so pertinent, so timely, and so important that it comes up again and again. I generally read books and move on to the next so quickly, but this one has found a permanence in my worldview. I think that makes it worthy of 5 stars.Nov 21, 2018Why are so many college students struggling with anxiety and depression? Why are so many university campuses coming up against student demands to disinvite ""dangerous"" guest speakers, to penalize professors who propone unpopular opinions, and to dismiss any who threaten their conception of safety? This very insightful book discusses 3 great untruths of the ""IGen"" (the generation born after 1994, coinciding with the ubiquity of the iPhone): The Untruth of Fragility: What doesn’t kill you makes you weaker. The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: Always trust your feelings. The Untruth of Us Versus Them: Life is a battle between good people and evil people.It shows have parents and institutions have unwittingly taught youth these untruths, and have - with the best of intentions - coddled them to the point of handicapping their ability to handle the adult world. Within this framework, I gained some new insights into the reasons for our increasingly partisan political world.One thing I really like about The Coddling of the American Mind is that, unlike many books of this genre, it doesn't just rip down the system, telling us everything that's wrong with society, then leave us hopeless. Lukianoff and Haidt give pages of good, solid suggestions for how to correct the problems we have created. I would absolutely recommend this book to parents today, as well as to anyone in education or educational administration.

It was validating to read from a secular source of a different political affiliation than me the same identification of major problems I see in our culture/universities/media. Some problems I’d wholeheartedly agree with include, treating children & young adults as if they are fragile, assuming the worst about people who disagree with you, elevating “safetyism” as a top goal in life, tolerating a “call-out” culture that represses legitimate criticism and intimidates/shames people, and embracing identity politics. It was refreshing to read. The authors are sometimes too optimistic about what can bring about the turning of the ship, and sometimes they are too repetitive. Overall, I’d highly recommend the book to anyone working with iGen, any school and university administrators, and parents."

207,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7743315-jeanne,4,"Education should not be intended to make people comfortable; it is meant to make them think. – Hanna Holborn GrayI look for books that are going to make me think, make me see things differently. Coddling of the American Mind did this. In brief, it is about three great Untruths that are affecting US universities and making them weaker: that we are protecting them from things that they see as dangerous, because – although there are good people, there are also evil ones. The great Untruths are:1. The Untruth of Fragility: What doesn’t kill you makes you weaker. 2. The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: Always trust your feelings. 3. The Untruth of Us Versus Them: Life is a battle between good people and evil people. (p. 4) Lukianoff and Haidt are provocative, but also good at bringing together diverse kinds of information together to help us recognize, as the subtitle goes, ""how good intentions and bad ideas are setting up a generation for failure.""For a book about the dichotomous and extreme thinking characterizing parenting, students, and the university system in the 21st century, Lukianoff and Haidt slip into dichotomous thinking. As do we all from time to time.We are in an age of helicopter parenting – even bulldozer parenting – where parents attempt to intervene with their college-aged children in a way that my daughters, frustratingly, would not allow me to do when they were in grade school. Rather than helping them, except in the short-term, this sort of parenting (and overscheduling, failing to allow or encourage free play, etc.) leaves students to becoming fragile, anxious, and easily hurt. Lukianoff and Haidt argue compellingly that college students should and must be exposed to viewpoint diversity, which will help them think more critically, understand diverse perspectives, and withstand events that would otherwise make them depressed and anxious. As the authors conclude, this means that we should beseeking out challenges (rather than eliminating or avoiding everything that “feels unsafe”), freeing yourself from cognitive distortions (rather than always trusting your initial feelings), and taking a generous view of other people, and looking for nuance (rather than assuming the worst about people within a simplistic us-versus-them morality). (p. 14)I appreciated Coddling of the American Mind, but I was often annoyed and irritated by it – which are not good outcomes for this time of year. Lukianoff and Haidt gathered interesting and often compelling threads, but I wasn't convinced by all of their evidence. Clearly, there is more anxiety and depression on campus than when I was in school, but that isn't necessarily a function of ""coddling,"" but of greater access on college campuses. Students who would not have been able to attend college 20 years ago can.While Lukianoff and Haidt criticize students' complaints about controversial and noncontroversial speakers (e.g., George Will, Bill Maher, Eric Holder, Madeleine Albright), I am less dismayed. I like that students are more likely to set limits about things that my generation accepted (e.g., #metoo).Current parenting practices, among many other things, have both strengths and weaknesses. Lukianoff and Haidt primarily focus on the downside here, but maybe we can look for some nuance and attempt to create a stronger model for the next generation of parents – and universities."
208,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3052770-teri,4,"This is an important read in today's society. This book is a look at the iGen generation that seems to be obsessed with technology and social media. The authors look at how ready access to news and social media affects attitudes and higher education. iGen students seem to be obsessed with protecting themselves against any other opinion than their own. They are less open to expanding their worldview and listening to opposing views to gain a broader understanding of today's society. This has led to students feeling ""unsafe"" when dealing with someone who does not share their views. Are they truly physically unsafe or are they just unable to process opposing views? Instead of engaging in open, civil debate or listening to gain understanding, students are sheltered and professors and administrators kowtow to students, offering special ""safe spaces,"" firing faculty who simply exercise their first amendment right, or even canceling guest speakers whose views are not shared with the majority of students. In essence, the authors suggest that we are coddling America's youth and young adults, sheltering them to the point that they are unable to process opinions and ideas that they do not identify with. The authors spend a lot of time discussing how technology and social media have affected current attitudes and lifestyles. Where once young kids would go out and play in the neighborhood, without constant adult supervision, they are today being watched by helicopter parents, suggesting that kids are being overprotected. Are we coddling the younger generations to the point that they are unable to psychologically handle uncomfortable positions? It is certainly worth thinking about and this book will open that discussion to consider if we are doing a disservice to our youth.I think this is a must-read for parents, teachers, and faculty of higher education. These are the children that will one day rule our nation. How will they handle our future?"

From the way, this generation of college students was raised to how schools handled shaping these young people. All of this has led to creating overprotected young adults who are taking longer to mature. The authors' intentions are to help future generations not need overprotection from society as they enter the real world and leave their family home. While kids are young they need the freedom to make mistakes and have those times used as a learning experience. Basically to sum it up let kids take risks while they're growing up. “Prepare your child for the road, not the road for your child.” "

It tackles issues within both the political left and the political right. The book mainly focuses in on college campuses which have become increasingly left-wing but the authors also zoom out and look at the poor reactions from right-wing fringe groups and even mainstream conservatism. The two authors have presented a strong case for free speech and a renewed sense of trust in the American people to be able to sift through different ideas and make smart choices about which ones reign true and which ones prove false.

212,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28777221-sharad-pandian,3,"If you've been following the fracas on and surrounding American universities, there's nothing new in this book for you.As the title suggests, Jonathan Haidt and Greg Lukianoff argue that American children from the iGen generation (born 1995 or beyond) are raised in situations and using methods unique in ways that make them interpret discomfort as danger. This makes them unable to cope, and harms them and their causes.I. Why this book is a waste of spaceTo understand why this book goes wrong, its important to appreciate a central tension in the way we think about ideas. On one hand, clearly people have been wrong about so much in the past and therefore as Mill suggests we should keep avenues for debate and change always open. On the other hand, the content of ideas currently held actually matter because they shape the world we live in both symbolically and materially. Therefore, if a certain idea is deemed wrong, it is important to resist it and its spread. It's the inability of creatures like ourselves, condemned to live in time, to resolve this tension in any general way that leads to so much chatter about free speech and its limits.The problem with the authors of this book is that they model debates as though ideas don't matter except for debate, as though fermenting debate itself were the point of ideas. The notion that there power differentials that are deeply entrenched and might not be removed by polite argumentation doesn't even come up.For example, a convenient manner to think about oppression is through ""structural analysis"" which helps make sense of the institutions and experiences that are frequent and persistent. To live in this miasma isn't merely about encountering scary ideas but actually being harmed in a variety of ways, and it really is unclear what the best way to resist and liberate. But the authors are convinced that they know best, since obviously more speech and more ideas is how victory will be won. They make much use of how the recent victories for same-sex marriage included campaigning that stressed similarity and shared community, but conveniently leave out how Stonewall was a riot.When they come close to discussing the obviously relevant idea of power, they just manage feebly to say:In calling for the dismantling of power structures, the author was using a set of terms and concepts that are common in some academic departments; the main line of argumentation fell squarely within the large family of Marxist approaches to social and political analysis. It’s a set of approaches in which things are analyzed primarily in terms of power. Groups struggle for power. Within this paradigm, when power is perceived to be held by one group over others, there is a moral polarity: the groups seen as powerful are bad, while the groups seen as oppressed are good. It’s a variant of the pathological dualism that Rabbi Sacks described in the quotation at the start of this chapter.All structural analysis are first reduced to ""groups struggle for power"" and then into instances of ""pathological dualism"" between the ""unimpeachably good and the irredeemably bad"".There are a lot of serious critiques possible about the relevance and fruitfulness of thinking about oppression as ""structural"", but this glib dismissal is intellectually embarrassing.Their unwillingness to take power seriously makes this entire book a slog through shallow liberal moralizing. Instead of responding to Down Girl: The Logic of Misogyny's point about how it is better to concentrate on the incident and impact instead of intent, because it makes it much, much harder to call out harmful behaviour, they just assume intent is what matters, and so anyone thinks otherwise is labouring under a ""cognitive distortion""The most evident is catastrophizing: If Milo Yiannopoulos is allowed to speak, there will be “broken bodies” on our side. I might lose my “right to exist.” Therefore, violence is justified, because it is self-defense. The author also engages in dichotomous thinking: If you condemn my side’s violence, that means you condone Yiannopoulos’s ideas. You must “pick a side.” You’re either with us or against us. Life is a battle between good people and evil people, and if you disagree with us, you’re one of the evil people…But if asking for peaceful dialogue is violent, then it seems that the word “violence” is taking on new meanings for some students.The point here isn't even that the Milo protests were the obvious way to go (although Milo's inability to get funding since suggests so), but that it's quite impossible to know antecedently or even in the short-term which strategies will be successful. Does treating every small incident as though it's important work better or does taking a more judicious strategy? Despite this lack of clarity about the truth, the authors frame the debate as young college students with good hearts making foolish choices instead of considering that they might possibly be engaging in successful resistance to entrenched evils.II. Why this book is still importantDespite this, there are three reasons this still remains a decent book.First, a significant chunk of the book concerns trends that converge in the iGen generation, including the lack of opportunity for free play, more bureaucracy, etc. It's really fun to read in one place, even if the information isn't new Second, it really is true that a lot of incidents of campus have been horrific, indicating that thinking you're on the right side of history allows for sadism and heedlessness. If you're on social media and have a functioning brain, you know the Left can go overboard in its mob mentality. As from above, I don't think we can say with certainty that these methods as a whole won't be successful, but they clearly do go against strong moral sensibilities at times. The Heckler's veto against anyone conservative, violence, cruelty all seem unacceptable, however much we tell ourselves it might ultimately be for the best.Third, the book is a lot more compelling if we don't think of it as a political project at all, but about psychologists simply talking about trends in the progressive movement that might be affecting mental health, fostering unhealthy ideas, and leading to irrational behaviour. At higher levels of explanation, trends might emerge that might be difficult to account for on a case-by-case basis, and I think the authors present a plausible case that taken as a whole, a lot of practices might be making the situation worse for students.Overall, a book better read as a summary of recent events on American campuses than as any kind of original contribution."
213,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2473528-roseanna-white,5,"Everyone with kids college-aged or younger needs to read this book! It addresses the trend of ""safetyism"" and student fragility--that the ideas of ""dangerous"" have crept from physical harm to emotional discomfort, which is proven not to make our kids STRONGER, but rather emotionally WEAKER. In it the authors not only discuss the problems that have come rather suddenly to college campuses, but the reasons behind them, and how we as parents and educators can correct it . The main theme is that there are Three Great Untruths that a generation has been taught to embrace, but which are what the psychology field knows are ""cognitive distortions."" Harmful ways of thinking that encourage us to see catastrophe, bias, and enemies where there are none. These are things we can universally recognize as untrue...but which are so easy to fall into.I'm not a big non-fiction reader these days, but I loved this book and have already made some changes to the rules for my kids based on the very sound evidence presented in it, as well as the wonderful advice.What I loved most about this book though is that it's quite possibly the only UNBIASED view I've encountered in recent years. Near the end of the book the authors do tell us their political views but up until they came out and said it, I had no idea whether they were liberal or conservative, D or R, even though they were discussing issues that dealt with the widening gap between them. They instead got at exactly what they encourage their readers to get at in our own lives: the wider circle of humanity to which we all belong."

215,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12766685-alison,3,"First - I agree with their argument on free-play time for children. As a mom, I see this as an essential part of growing up and their discussion really helped me to figure out some of the reasons why it has felt important but I was struggling to articulate that. I also appreciated the points they made about safetyism. It is something I have seen and I now have a label for it and can hopefully better communicate the risks.But, I also struggled often with this book. I think that saying someone shouldn't be offended by a comment that you didn't know would be offensive removes the responsibility from the speaker to learn anything that could stop them from saying hurtful/offensive things in the future - most of the examples they use are of ways in which people say things that perpetuate systems of oppression (racism, sexism, etc) and by shrugging things off, the system doesn't get fixed. If the speaker were able to listen and change, then getting offended wouldn't be useful, but too often that's not the outcome. This is a topic I have been working though - I don't always understand why someone got offended, but when I listen or read, I can usually get it. But it comes back on me to learn, not them to get thick skin (I'm not always the speaker, but usually a somewhat confused bystander in these cases).It will raise my hackles when a book uses the version of MLK Jr that only encompasses his Dream speech and not also his other letter, sermons, and speeches. I think they simplified things too much on this respect.The sections laying out how various professors and others in academia have been mistreated was good at pointing out the failings of those areas, but I think that if you are looking for it you could easily find bad behavior in religion, in business, in government, etc. Every aspect of our culture contains humans and within that subset, they may *misbehave* in different ways, but every area has people who misuse power or are unqualified. I also have a few gripes with the way they discuss campus protests. I think we would agree about a lot of this, but I want to point that people like Heather McDonald and Charles Murray have writt books, the people protesting them are almost certainly aware of their views (either by reading the book or discussing parts of it) and they are choosing to say that this person has bad ideas. It is not that HM or CM don't get any chance to speak or promote their ideas - they still have free speech. It is more that students wish the wouldn't be given platforms for these ideas. I agree with Coddling in that violence is abhorrent and counterproductive, but they way they frame the rest of the conversation is in error.Overall - it was a book that made me think, but had some very problematic portions."
216,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1655983-katie,1,"The flaws of this book cloud the conclusion. Some of the flaws:-Anecdotes about campus events are used despite authors demand that everyone be more focused on facts and data. Some of the incidents described are indeed examples of extreme sensitivity and intolerance. Worrisome trend, but not convincing that campuses have abandoned free speech.-Serious lack of time spent on investigating and confirming the issues college students care about. The Trump administration is a frightening turn, threatening institutions and norms - shouldn't we expect young people to protest?-CBT as a treatment for anxiety I get, but as a treatment for real threats and oppression? So insulting! We have an administration threatening to take away healthcare, women's health care, rights of immigrants, gay people, minorities. What happens when a lesbian girl is told a speaker believes she is deviant who needs to go to conversion camp? She should practice CBT and remember the speaker has good intentions? When Richard Spencer coming to campus to spout off about peaceful ethnic cleansing, should students practice CBT? Just because the book does justice to some topics - like IGen social issues, helicopter parenting and safteyism, - does not mean the book works. I also happen to agree this generation does not conceive of the First Amendment like my generation does. College kids raised with awareness of inequality in American, we were raised to worry about authoritarianism and the Cold War. I think the topic deserves scrutiny, but these authors failed in my opinion. "
217,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5862443-joseph-stieb,4,"Full disclosure: I am a Haidt fanboy, so I'm predisposed to like this book. Unlike the Righteous Mind, it is not outstanding. Books that are elaborations of long-form articles rarely are. If you follow Haidt and Lukianoff's work closely, this is mainly a summary of what they have been doing the last 4 years of so (see Haidt's excellent Wriston Lecture for a distillation). Still, this is a strong, well-sourced, and fair-minded argument about where higher ed has turned wrong and how it can be rectified.Haidt and Lukianoff argue for an older understanding of the purpose of higher education: the pursuit of truth rather than the furthering of a political agenda. They convincingly show how higher ed has become more partisan and less ideologically diverse, although they don't do much to show how this stultifies and biases research and teaching (for more on this, see Shields and Dunn's outstanding Passing on the Right). Their focus is on why things like trigger warnings, disinvitations, interruptions of speakers, micro-aggressions, etc have surged on campus in the last 5 years or so. The core of their argument is less about ideology than generational shifts. Despite the somewhat inflammatory title, they put forth a complex, nuanced argument that the I-Gen (born in mid 1990s, came of age with cellphones and social media as normal things, in contrast to millennial, who were teens when the iPhone and facebook came out) is a far more anxious and dependent generation that doesn't know how to handle conflict on its own and has been coached to go to the authorities instead. Take a far more polarized, bureaucratized university system, and you get more kids calling for ""coddling"" and more administrators giving it to them to prevent their school from becoming the next Yale or Missouri. The leftist intellectual framework that these students embrace (redefinition of safety and violence, identitarian common enemy politics, a radical interpretation intersectionality, the dismissal of anything written by a dead white guy as not worth reading because he must have been a racist/sexist) isn't the deeper cause of this surge in left-wing activism on campus. Rather, changes in the climate of US politics and the way kids are raised primes them to take in this ideological system. This can be changed on both ends, although I am more interested in how to change to college atmosphere and how to make these ideas (each of which has some value) more realistic and less polarizing and politically ""weaponized.""The intellectual cases put forth against all of these concepts that have crept into academia are excellent, as usual. They explain how each of these things encourages mentally and intellectually unhealthy thinking, feeds tribalism, and makes open, trusting conversation impossible on campus. Still, I thought they were getting a little loose from their moorings in their criticism of modern parenting. It is hard to tell parents to not be a little over-protective of their kids. There are ways to do this (like more unstructured time built into a kid's day, at school and at home, plus less screen time) but overall I think most parents do a pretty good job. I think they are both part of pretty elite social circles in which tiger parenting was very common. My middle class upbringing seemed to have plenty of free time, and my parents let me and my brothers roam the neighborhood pretty freely. I wouldn't dismiss all of their argument about parenting, but it was probably the weak link in the book.I'd recommend this book to anyone concerned about changes on campus or anyone who has heard about Haidt and is curious. It is concise, and very qualified. As usual, Haidt's critics have misrepresented his argument left and right, so make sure you go to the source."
218,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25032671-kris,4,"I first read Bloom's original The Closing of the American Mind just so that I could read this book. While it's useful to have the earlier background on past decades in academia, Bloom's original is not required reading before enjoying Haidt's great contribution here.These authors lead the reader through some great analyses -- they show how a drastic shift in the mentality of arguments/debate on college campuses happened in 2013, along with a seemingly drastic shift in mindset surrounding the purpose of education. I'll list some of their principles here: Prepare the child for the road, not the road for the child. We are all prone to emotional reasoning and confirmation bias. Your worst enemy cannot harm you as much as your own unguarded thoughts. People are prone to catastroph-izing about the future. We are all prone to tribalism. Many psychological principles on college campuses encourage students to embrace foolishness, rather than wisdom. Young people are innately anti-fragile, but they learn helplessness in correlation with rising rates of adolescent depression and anxiety, a shift to more protective parenting, and widespread play deprivation and risk deprivation. We are seeing rising political polarization and expanded bureaucracy. We also see a rising passion for justice combined with a growing commitment to attaining equal outcomes in all areas. The rise in passion for justice is admirable on its own, but when combined with a demand to see equity, not equality, it becomes misguided.Some falsehoods: What doesn't kill you, makes you weaker.

This monograph explores how 'fragility' is being developed in children, adolescence and students on university campuses. While much of the attention is on the left and social justice politics, there is some focus on the polarization of politics from the alt-right.The problems with this book are clear. The authors confuse a diversity of facts and interpretations with emotions rather than rigour. EH Carr stated in 1961 that ""history means interpretation."" Only particular facts have survived to our present. Therefore assuming that the source material - the material culture - that remains in our present is accurate, true and convincing while alternative interpretations are emotional or intuitive perpetuates a mis-understanding of history, media and politics.Are students fragile? Perhaps. The greater question is why students are fragile. That is the question not asked or answered in this book. Unemployment, under-employment, exhorbitant fees for education, ridiculous payments for privatized utilities, and ill-information public policies are only part of our corrosive present.Protests exist because there is no space to be different, to be defiant, and - in the case of George Floyd - to breathe. This is not emotion or intent. This is verified and an outcome of claustropolitan structures. A provocative book. It lacks a deep engagement of the political economy. Therefore - and ironically - it is part of the identity politics superficiality it wishes to critique."
221,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7258380-dan-graser,5,"This collaboration between Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt is fantastic on many levels and addresses a thorny issue with precision, honesty, and language that is free of the usual superficial pejoratives found in such discussions. They begin with three fundamental Untruths that they have distilled from their own experiences working in academia and social psychology:1) What doesn't kill you makes you weaker.2) Always trust your feelings.3) Life is a battle between good people and evil people.These ideas are discussed in the context of current political divides, campus culture, parenting, and general discourse on social media. Throughout, they use 6 ""explanatory threads"" to understand how we have gotten where we are, sociologically and politically:1) There has been a steady increase in affective polarization since the 1980's, such that people don't feel a stronger kinship with their party but bond more over hatred of the opposition.2) There has been a nation-wide rise in adolescent anxiety and depression since 2011, mainly affecting those who belong to the ""iGen"" or Generation Z.3) There has been a shift, starting in the 80's and reaching a peak in the 90's among more educated families especially, to fearful and needlessly overprotective ""paranoid parenting.""4) The steady decline of unsupervised free play among children due to the above trend. 5) The growth of campus bureaucracy and the expansion of over-protection of students who themselves, don't wish it or need it, resulting in the transmission of the very type of psychological issues the campus is trying to prevent. 6) The rise of social justice activism, rightfully, in response to turbulent and emotionally powerful political events between 2012 and 2018.As someone who works in academia and is genuinely concerned about students' well-being, I always enjoy reading works that provide data, facts, and arguments based in psychology to suggest how we can improve that mission while dealing with the issues present in the larger social-political context, with which our students are dealing. This book contains the finest discussion of this I have seen in addition to great, level-headed discussions of modern parenting, social justice activism, and identity politics. Well worth your time!"

223,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2319320-melissa,5,"Wonder why the young generation seems so bad at thinking? This book sheds light on what ""we"" collectively as a society have done to cause it. We've taught three falsehoods as truth: That individuals are fragile, that we can trust our feelings, that life is a battle between good and bad people. Do you feel, like me, that there is no way you're going to write down your thoughts on a particular topic esp. publicly, because no matter how well reasoned or how good your intentions, if you use one wrong word, you're deemed evil for life by one side or the other? (You're ""cancelled."") We've hearkened back to the time of witch hunts, and I found that chapter of the history of what leads to the eras of witch hunts (which we're in a time of those right now) enlightening about why the heck one word in a well meant email can cause a person's complete ruin. We need to get back to a time where we give people the benefit of the doubt! The information on Cognitive Behavior Therapy was also enlightening. As a society, we are essentially going against good psychological practice and teaching bad ways of thinking. One of my sons is a doomsday thinker and I'm happy to have some of these CBT tools to see if I can help him stop the negative thinking habits of thinking the worst about everything and everybody. We see this reflected in society right now, everyone jumps to conclusions on a story that's not an hour old with nothing but a headline and decide they have the ability to be judge, jury, and executioner on that alone and then move on as if ruining that person's life was not a weighty matter. I don't want my son growing up to be like that and it's been frustrating to try to talk him out of his thought processes because I want him to grown up sound of mind unlike many people I've encountered lately, and I've wondered why it is they can be such bad thinkers, and this book enlightens on that some of the reasons.The practical application section is worth the price of the read on what we can do to turn the boat around. Thankfully, I've been already doing a lot of the suggestions for my kids in my determination to have them grow up sound of mind, but this was nice to have the facts and stats to help solidify what I'm doing to help. This is another book that shows our overly scheduled, screen-heavy existence is doing nothing good for our youth. The authors of this book reveal toward the end of the book what their political leanings are and they're nearly the opposite of mine, but I'd say there is no slant, because I agreed with nearly all of it, it was logical, reasoned, well laid out--we're facing a problem that affects both sides of the political spectrum. It is a bit of a slog at the beginning with all the research and the fact that they are very academic writers with the ""I'll tell you this, I'm telling you, and now I'll summarize what I just told you"" which probably is all right if you're one to read at leisure instead of read books from cover to cover like me, that would help you remember what you read if you put it down for any amount of time, but be forewarned that it isn't a fast paced read. But it's an excellent read."
224,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2007216-peter-derk,4,"What an interesting book.I think what would prevent most people from reading this is probably some version of a sentiment that can be summed up as ""Okay Boomer."" But if that's how you're feeling, I would encourage you to give it a shot.Although there are lots of examples from college campuses, they're pretty balanced between things that overly-sensitive people are doing and things that crazy people are doing (usually white power weirdos). And while there is some condemnation of behavior, I felt like the author was very empathetic towards people and wasn't saying anything remotely like, ""These snowflakes need to shape up!"" or ""These iGen kids are ruining everything!"" If you read it that way, that's probably your preconceived notion and sensitivity lenses at work, not the real content of the book. The most interesting portions to me were related to parenting and how much it's changed in just a few decades. There was a section that listed a checklist for parents for school readiness for young kids. 30 or 40 years ago, the list was a lot of things like, ""You child can ride a two-wheel bicycle, Your child can walk alone to a store or home 2 or 3 blocks away..."" where now it looks more like, ""Your child can spell phonetically, Your child can understand basic mathematical concepts..."" So where once it was ""Is your child capable of managing their physical safety?"" now it's more ""Can your child fill out a worksheet?"" Which seems profoundly stupid to me. This is my Okay Boomer moment, so buckle up.When I was a kid we used to roam around the town in small groups of 2-4 kids. Sometimes on bikes, sometimes just walking. And it wasn't like we had to check in every hour with our parents. I rode the bus to the mall. I would go to the grocery store alone or with a friend. In the summer, this was basically all we did, screw around during unstructured time. You learn a lot without realizing it. You learn to avoid true danger, like weirdos and creeps. You learn how to do simple shit like walk into a grocery store, pick something out and pay for it. You learn how to take a bus. You learn the geography of where you live. I had a coworker who lived in a very safe neighborhood and wouldn't allow her son to walk to the bus alone. It was like a block. Eventually, she did let him do it, but he had to be on a walkie talkie and talk to her the whole time until he got on the bus. I've had a number of people tell me that when their kids are learning to drive, they have no idea where they are inside of their own towns. They don't know how to get from home to school. Every day, the school I work next to, parents line up their cars to drive up to the door of the school, at which point their child is released, gets in the car, and then the parents drive them home. Like they're goddamn diplomats in need of a secure escort. This line of cars extends several blocks, and parents will wait up to an hour in a line of cars to pick up their kids. The kids can walk or bike or whatever, but very few, if any, do this, and if they do want to do it this way the parents have to sign a waiver. I can already hear the parents: You don't have a kid, so you don't understand. If you don't have kids, you'll hear this all the time. And I totally agree, I don't have the emotional understanding of a parent. However, I would proffer this: I probably have a more realistic assessment of danger to children because I'm NOT a parent. I'm not emotionally invested, which means when I'm looking at the realistic dangers, my thinking isn't tainted by my personal stakes. There are some parents who agree with me, that kids should have a little more freedom. There was the mom profiled in the book, the sort of mother of the Free Range Kids movement, who let her young son ride the subway home by himself at one point, which turned out great.I do think kids probably need a little more room, a little more agency, and a little less structure. One of the more profound insights in the book had to do with the level of discourse we're experiencing today. In short, people suck at discussing things because they never had un-referee'ed disagreements as kids. When you're a kid, if you're playing a game with 4 other kids, you have to learn how to argue or disagree without the other kid getting up and leaving, at which point the game is unplayable. Newer parents tend to referee everything, jumping in if things get intense. But letting kids work these things out themselves might be a way to help them learn the skills of discussing things without getting to the point that everyone takes their ball and goes home.The best part of the book, however, is that it offers a lot of potential solutions. I've found that I'm a solutions-based thinking, so solutions speak to me. Even when I disagree with the solutions, I think solutions-oriented thinking speaks to me and gets me thinking along the lines of productive movement. Way too many books that I might put in the sociology category seem very focused on talking about the problem. I usually hear what the author is saying and think, ""Okay, I buy that this is a problem, but what now?"" To borrow an analogy from another book, a problem that's well-explained is great, but if you went to the doctor with a pain, and if that doctor could explain why you're feeling this pain, does knowing the pain's origin solve the problem? No. You go to the doctor not for an explanation of the history of the pain, but for the cure. It's how I feel when a cold is being passed around the office, and everyone wants to trace back to patient zero. As if it's really that person's fault. Sidebar: it's my pet peeve that people come in when they're sick. Don't do that. But once you're sick, figuring out who ""got you sick"" is a complete waste of time and energy. Once you know, does that help your symptoms? Does it speed your recovery? Absolutely not. Yes, I think the history of some things can be valuable in understanding them. But the history and origin of a problem without solution is not terribly useful. I think a lot of people don't have the guts to offer a solution. Because that's the easiest thing to attack. You can nitpick someone's solution, which will be seen as an effective way of discrediting their entire argument. Which is stupid. I deeply appreciate the solutions offered in this book, especially because they're solutions based mostly in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (which totally works) and because they're solutions that any individual can choose to apply. It's not a set of solutions that goes ""You motherfuckers need to stop doing X."" It's a set of solutions oriented towards, ""If you want to be a better person and have a better life, here are some realistic options.""Great read, and I'd definitely call it a must-read for parents of young kids who haven't given a lot of thought to giving their kid some rope. And parents who feel pressured by other parents, who are afraid of being seen as bad parents."
225,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31910342-josh,3,"I previously read Lukianoff's ""Unlearning Liberty"" earlier this year. While I thoroughly enjoyed that work, I was somewhat disappointed by this joint venture with social psychologist Jonathan Haidt. This is partly because while ""Unlearning Liberty"" was a searching examination of how higher education in recent years has failed in its central purpose to discover ""truth"" by prohibiting many forms of offensive speech on campus, this book tries to further that inquiry in some ways by putting together a composite of factors for why ""iGen"" (those who were born c. 1996) have embraced ""safetyism"" on college campuses. ""Safetyism"" is essentially the conflation of being offended with being in physical danger. The book is divided into three parts. The first unpacks what the authors call the ""three great untruths"" that iGen embraces: the world is divided between distinctly ""good"" people and wholly ""bad"" people; trust your feelings (i.e. emotional reasoning over logic); and ""safetyism"" which the authors describe as ""what doesn't hurt you, makes you weaker."" The second narrates a series of recent episodes of censorship and both far left/far right violence on college campuses, such as Berkeley Antifa protests against Milo Yiannopolis, the Alt-Right protests at UVA; and the Charles Murray episode at Middlebury. The final part explains what the authors believe are the six contributing factors that are the ""bad ideas [that] are setting up a generation for failure."" The last two chapters in this section deal with a) how parents should ideally raise children to be thick-skinned and critically thinking adults and b) how primary and secondary education can offer adolescents and teenagers the mental toolset to confront offensive ideas and grow intellectually from such debates. There is a lot of ground to cover in any review of this book (and much of what follows in this paragraph I explain in more detail in my review of Unlearning Liberty). But, the gist is that colleges and universities should be wholly focused on discerning ""truth."" Various public intellectuals, such as Van Jones, have argued that colleges provide people with a rare opportunity to grapple with offensive ideas and speech by using reasoning and argument. College should be a ""gym,"" to borrow from Van Jones, that trains people to debate and compromise within our democratic system. Since the early 2010s, though, many colleges (and almost exclusively the most liberal ones) have become distracted from the goal of seeking ""truth"" by protecting students from potentially offensive speech. There's an appropriate discussion within this section of how the left has stretched the definition of ""violence"" to include intuitively nonviolent actions, such as speech. By construing offensive speech as ""violent,"" college administrators, faculty, and students have effectively nullified the free speech privileges of a wide swathe of conservative intellectuals (and alt-right wackos) by appealing to the need to keep students ""safe"" on campus. The six factors that have contributed to the current climate of ""Safetyism,"" censorship, and unrest are best summed up as follows:1) American politics have become increasingly polarized (entering a ""polarization cycle"") where very little compromise is ever reached between left and right.2) The advent of social media and the internet has made ""iGen"" far more depressed and anxious than previous generations. 3) Parents since the 1980s have increasingly become ""helicopter"" parents, not allowing their children to experience any discomfort and sheltering them from the real world, so to speak. 4) What the authors term the ""decline of [free] play."" In other words, children have far less time relative to previous generations to socialize, initiate play, and be creative. This is caused by the fact that elite colleges and universities select from those with an abundance of extracurriculars (etc.) and parents respond by over-structuring their children's time with various activities. 5) Primary and secondary education have become obsessed with keeping students ""safe"" from offensive ideas and taboo subjects. 6) ""Social justice"" and its quest for equal outcomes has created a ""common enemy identity politics"" focused on subdividing people into various ""intersectional"" identities. The authors compare this to Martin Luther King, Jr.'s ""common humanity"" identity politics that sought to authentically include all Americans in the civil rights movement by appealing to the American civic religion. These six factors (covered in six chapters) are unevenly persuasive, although I generally agree with the authors that the cult of ""safe spaces"" and ""free speech zones"" on campuses is extremely problematic. I think I agree with some of the other reviews on Goodreads that some of their solutions contain assumptions grounded in a middle-class ethos. Specifically, their idea that children should be given more rein to explore their neighborhoods, talk to strangers, and even use public transportation at young ages (i.e. nine years old). The authors argue that our perception of danger is massively inflated by the 24 hour news cycle and John Walsh's crusade to catch ""America's Most Wanted."" I agree in part, but would argue that many parents (and single parents) living in certain rural or urban areas with high crime rates have legitimate concerns about allowing their children to be ""free range children."" Being a parent myself, I generally found their Dr. Spock parental advice annoying, at best, and naive at worst. Overall, an informative book that resonated well with my experience on campus the past seven years. Excepting the final two concluding chapters, I completely recommend this book to anyone seriously interested in learning more about what is happening on America's college campuses. But you should first read ""Unlearning Liberty."" "

The book also helped me to reexamine the educational choices that I have made for my 10 year old. I highly recommend this book, even though I didn't agree with everything that the authors had stated.

Kidding.This book is so relevant to the culture that we live in and the future that we are entering into. With its many different antidotes and research, the author does a fantastic job of bringing to the surface different lies (or 'Untruths' as he calls it) that have good intentions but can lead to detrimental effects overall. The stories can definitely get your blood pumping and outrage you at points and I think that's the point. 10/10 would recommend this to most people.One of the best parts of the book is the way the authors write in such a humble and transparent way. The consistently mention how the issues are more complex than they make them out to be and never claim to have the only answer. They also very openly share their political views and how they could influence their own writing when writing about political polarization. So good!"
229,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3730838-maggie-boyd,2,"I'm always interested in books critiquing our current educational system and sat down to read this one with enthusiasm. However, this book is less about what is wrong with our system and more about criticizing liberals for the horrors they have wrought upon our society. It begins with vilifying our current crop of college students: kids born after 1995 who began going to college in 2013. These children are having three great untruths fed to them by liberal universities: 1. The Untruth of Fragility: What doesn't kill you makes you weaker. 2. The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: Always trust your feelings. 3. The Untruth of Us versus Them: Life is a battle between good people and evil people. They go on to say that by creating safe spaces, colleges teach students to believe the above. The evidence? Students are preventing speakers from holding lectures they disagree with at their universities. As others have pointed out, this in no way keeps the speaker from disseminating their ideas. Milo, the target of one of these riots, was still making television appearances and publishing books. The students were asking that he not be allowed to speak in spaces their tuition paid for, a very different thing than asking that he never be allowed to speak anywhere. Moreover, this wasn't a question of not giving the speaker a chance to present his point but a reaction to the point the speaker had already made. Finally, the United States has over 3,000 4 yr. universities and the author's ""evidence"" centers around approximately 1% of those institutions having students make demands they felt were unreasonable. This is nowhere near epidemic. Then the authors get to what I felt was the primary point: Viewpoint diversity reduces a community’s susceptibility to witch hunts. One of the most important kinds of viewpoint diversity, diversity of political thought, has declined substantially among both professors and students at American universities since the 1990s. To sum up the first portion of the book has two major points: Anything that prevents someone from making a point, even if that point is offensive, is ""coddling"" and colleges are too liberal. We need more balance. (They didn't speak to the 600 Christian colleges where the staff is predominantly conservative.) After spending several chapters ""building a case"" on how the great untruths listed in the first paragraph are destroying young collegiate minds, the author's come to a startling conclusion: You can see why it was hard for us to make a strong case that universities were causing students to become anxious and depressed by teaching them disordered ways of thinking. Anxiety and depression rates were already rising for all teenagers before they arrived at college, and for those who never attended college as well. Clearly universities were not causing a national mental health crisis; they were responding to one. With liberal universities out as a scapegoat, bring in liberal parenting policies. Safteyism, where parents go to purportedly unreasonable limits to protect their kids might be a factor in kids being more fearful, which might be a factor in them being depressed. No direct evidence of this is available but they offer up some random events and show how those few events point to liberals running amok and creating too much fear in our kids. They have to admit, grudgingly, that many of the safety measures have worked. Putting it all together, from 1960 to 1990, there was a 48% reduction in deaths from unintended injuries and accidents among kids between five and fourteen years of age, and a 57% drop in deaths of younger kids (ages one to four).Lukianoff, Greg. The Coddling of the American Mind (p. 169). Penguin Publishing Group. Kindle Edition. In summary, the authors offer anecdotes and a handful of studies to showcase their points but the math in no way supports what they are saying. If you are someone who feels PC culture is at the heart of what is wrong with our country, you'll love this book and may believe it supports your view point. If you know how to do elementary school level math and have an understanding of the basic principle of percentages, you will quickly realize this tome is meant to speak into a very specific echo chamber and provides no substantial evidence to support the view that liberals will be the death of America."

He previously wrote The Righteous Mind, which was a powerful and thought-provoking read. Haidt, along with Greg Lukianoff, provide another powerful analysis and thought-provoking read with this book. I would recommend it to any and everyone. While there are specific recommendations that some may have differing personal preferences/opinions on, there is no lack of research in their presentation and arguments (and it’s safe to say they would welcome the discourse of another perspective). I especially appreciated their inclusion of CBT and how that could be a beneficial practice for many to adopt, as well as parents and institutions to encourage and teach. Looking forward to anything else Haidt writes. "

Over the 3 months since I finished The Coddling of the American Mind I cannot believe how many times I have shared the ideas of these authors with others. This book is just so pertinent, so timely, and so important that it comes up again and again. I generally read books and move on to the next so quickly, but this one has found a permanence in my worldview. I think that makes it worthy of 5 stars.Nov 21, 2018Why are so many college students struggling with anxiety and depression? Why are so many university campuses coming up against student demands to disinvite ""dangerous"" guest speakers, to penalize professors who propone unpopular opinions, and to dismiss any who threaten their conception of safety? This very insightful book discusses 3 great untruths of the ""IGen"" (the generation born after 1994, coinciding with the ubiquity of the iPhone): The Untruth of Fragility: What doesn’t kill you makes you weaker. The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: Always trust your feelings. The Untruth of Us Versus Them: Life is a battle between good people and evil people.It shows have parents and institutions have unwittingly taught youth these untruths, and have - with the best of intentions - coddled them to the point of handicapping their ability to handle the adult world. Within this framework, I gained some new insights into the reasons for our increasingly partisan political world.One thing I really like about The Coddling of the American Mind is that, unlike many books of this genre, it doesn't just rip down the system, telling us everything that's wrong with society, then leave us hopeless. Lukianoff and Haidt give pages of good, solid suggestions for how to correct the problems we have created. I would absolutely recommend this book to parents today, as well as to anyone in education or educational administration. It is quite bipartisan, but not afraid to point out problems on both side of the political spectrum. I already put the audiobook on hold for my husband!4.5 stars."

Some problems I’d wholeheartedly agree with include, treating children & young adults as if they are fragile, assuming the worst about people who disagree with you, elevating “safetyism” as a top goal in life, tolerating a “call-out” culture that represses legitimate criticism and intimidates/shames people, and embracing identity politics.

Coddling of the American Mind did this. In brief, it is about three great Untruths that are affecting US universities and making them weaker: that we are protecting them from things that they see as dangerous, because – although there are good people, there are also evil ones. The great Untruths are:1. The Untruth of Fragility: What doesn’t kill you makes you weaker. 2. The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: Always trust your feelings. 3. The Untruth of Us Versus Them: Life is a battle between good people and evil people. (p. 4) Lukianoff and Haidt are provocative, but also good at bringing together diverse kinds of information together to help us recognize, as the subtitle goes, ""how good intentions and bad ideas are setting up a generation for failure.""For a book about the dichotomous and extreme thinking characterizing parenting, students, and the university system in the 21st century, Lukianoff and Haidt slip into dichotomous thinking. As do we all from time to time.We are in an age of helicopter parenting – even bulldozer parenting – where parents attempt to intervene with their college-aged children in a way that my daughters, frustratingly, would not allow me to do when they were in grade school. Rather than helping them, except in the short-term, this sort of parenting (and overscheduling, failing to allow or encourage free play, etc.) leaves students to becoming fragile, anxious, and easily hurt. Lukianoff and Haidt argue compellingly that college students should and must be exposed to viewpoint diversity, which will help them think more critically, understand diverse perspectives, and withstand events that would otherwise make them depressed and anxious. As the authors conclude, this means that we should beseeking out challenges (rather than eliminating or avoiding everything that “feels unsafe”), freeing yourself from cognitive distortions (rather than always trusting your initial feelings), and taking a generous view of other people, and looking for nuance (rather than assuming the worst about people within a simplistic us-versus-them morality). (p. 14)I appreciated Coddling of the American Mind, but I was often annoyed and irritated by it – which are not good outcomes for this time of year. Lukianoff and Haidt gathered interesting and often compelling threads, but I wasn't convinced by all of their evidence. Clearly, there is more anxiety and depression on campus than when I was in school, but that isn't necessarily a function of ""coddling,"" but of greater access on college campuses. Students who would not have been able to attend college 20 years ago can.While Lukianoff and Haidt criticize students' complaints about controversial and noncontroversial speakers (e.g., George Will, Bill Maher, Eric Holder, Madeleine Albright), I am less dismayed. I like that students are more likely to set limits about things that my generation accepted (e.g., #metoo).Current parenting practices, among many other things, have both strengths and weaknesses. Lukianoff and Haidt primarily focus on the downside here, but maybe we can look for some nuance and attempt to create a stronger model for the next generation of parents – and universities."
238,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3052770-teri,4,"This is an important read in today's society. This book is a look at the iGen generation that seems to be obsessed with technology and social media. The authors look at how ready access to news and social media affects attitudes and higher education. iGen students seem to be obsessed with protecting themselves against any other opinion than their own. They are less open to expanding their worldview and listening to opposing views to gain a broader understanding of today's society. This has led to students feeling ""unsafe"" when dealing with someone who does not share their views. Are they truly physically unsafe or are they just unable to process opposing views? Instead of engaging in open, civil debate or listening to gain understanding, students are sheltered and professors and administrators kowtow to students, offering special ""safe spaces,"" firing faculty who simply exercise their first amendment right, or even canceling guest speakers whose views are not shared with the majority of students. In essence, the authors suggest that we are coddling America's youth and young adults, sheltering them to the point that they are unable to process opinions and ideas that they do not identify with. The authors spend a lot of time discussing how technology and social media have affected current attitudes and lifestyles. Where once young kids would go out and play in the neighborhood, without constant adult supervision, they are today being watched by helicopter parents, suggesting that kids are being overprotected. Are we coddling the younger generations to the point that they are unable to psychologically handle uncomfortable positions? It is certainly worth thinking about and this book will open that discussion to consider if we are doing a disservice to our youth.I think this is a must-read for parents, teachers, and faculty of higher education.

This makes them unable to cope, and harms them and their causes.I. Why this book is a waste of spaceTo understand why this book goes wrong, its important to appreciate a central tension in the way we think about ideas. On one hand, clearly people have been wrong about so much in the past and therefore as Mill suggests we should keep avenues for debate and change always open. On the other hand, the content of ideas currently held actually matter because they shape the world we live in both symbolically and materially. Therefore, if a certain idea is deemed wrong, it is important to resist it and its spread. It's the inability of creatures like ourselves, condemned to live in time, to resolve this tension in any general way that leads to so much chatter about free speech and its limits.The problem with the authors of this book is that they model debates as though ideas don't matter except for debate, as though fermenting debate itself were the point of ideas. The notion that there power differentials that are deeply entrenched and might not be removed by polite argumentation doesn't even come up.For example, a convenient manner to think about oppression is through ""structural analysis"" which helps make sense of the institutions and experiences that are frequent and persistent. To live in this miasma isn't merely about encountering scary ideas but actually being harmed in a variety of ways, and it really is unclear what the best way to resist and liberate. But the authors are convinced that they know best, since obviously more speech and more ideas is how victory will be won. They make much use of how the recent victories for same-sex marriage included campaigning that stressed similarity and shared community, but conveniently leave out how Stonewall was a riot.When they come close to discussing the obviously relevant idea of power, they just manage feebly to say:In calling for the dismantling of power structures, the author was using a set of terms and concepts that are common in some academic departments; the main line of argumentation fell squarely within the large family of Marxist approaches to social and political analysis. It’s a set of approaches in which things are analyzed primarily in terms of power. Groups struggle for power. Within this paradigm, when power is perceived to be held by one group over others, there is a moral polarity: the groups seen as powerful are bad, while the groups seen as oppressed are good. It’s a variant of the pathological dualism that Rabbi Sacks described in the quotation at the start of this chapter.All structural analysis are first reduced to ""groups struggle for power"" and then into instances of ""pathological dualism"" between the ""unimpeachably good and the irredeemably bad"".There are a lot of serious critiques possible about the relevance and fruitfulness of thinking about oppression as ""structural"", but this glib dismissal is intellectually embarrassing.Their unwillingness to take power seriously makes this entire book a slog through shallow liberal moralizing. Instead of responding to Down Girl: The Logic of Misogyny's point about how it is better to concentrate on the incident and impact instead of intent, because it makes it much, much harder to call out harmful behaviour, they just assume intent is what matters, and so anyone thinks otherwise is labouring under a ""cognitive distortion""The most evident is catastrophizing: If Milo Yiannopoulos is allowed to speak, there will be “broken bodies” on our side. I might lose my “right to exist.” Therefore, violence is justified, because it is self-defense. The author also engages in dichotomous thinking: If you condemn my side’s violence, that means you condone Yiannopoulos’s ideas. You must “pick a side.” You’re either with us or against us. Life is a battle between good people and evil people, and if you disagree with us, you’re one of the evil people…But if asking for peaceful dialogue is violent, then it seems that the word “violence” is taking on new meanings for some students.The point here isn't even that the Milo protests were the obvious way to go (although Milo's inability to get funding since suggests so), but that it's quite impossible to know antecedently or even in the short-term which strategies will be successful. Does treating every small incident as though it's important work better or does taking a more judicious strategy? Despite this lack of clarity about the truth, the authors frame the debate as young college students with good hearts making foolish choices instead of considering that they might possibly be engaging in successful resistance to entrenched evils.II. Why this book is still importantDespite this, there are three reasons this still remains a decent book.First, a significant chunk of the book concerns trends that converge in the iGen generation, including the lack of opportunity for free play, more bureaucracy, etc. It's really fun to read in one place, even if the information isn't new Second, it really is true that a lot of incidents of campus have been horrific, indicating that thinking you're on the right side of history allows for sadism and heedlessness. If you're on social media and have a functioning brain, you know the Left can go overboard in its mob mentality. As from above, I don't think we can say with certainty that these methods as a whole won't be successful, but they clearly do go against strong moral sensibilities at times. The Heckler's veto against anyone conservative, violence, cruelty all seem unacceptable, however much we tell ourselves it might ultimately be for the best.Third, the book is a lot more compelling if we don't think of it as a political project at all, but about psychologists simply talking about trends in the progressive movement that might be affecting mental health, fostering unhealthy ideas, and leading to irrational behaviour. At higher levels of explanation, trends might emerge that might be difficult to account for on a case-by-case basis, and I think the authors present a plausible case that taken as a whole, a lot of practices might be making the situation worse for students.Overall, a book better read as a summary of recent events on American campuses than as any kind of original contribution."
243,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2473528-roseanna-white,5,"Everyone with kids college-aged or younger needs to read this book! It addresses the trend of ""safetyism"" and student fragility--that the ideas of ""dangerous"" have crept from physical harm to emotional discomfort, which is proven not to make our kids STRONGER, but rather emotionally WEAKER. In it the authors not only discuss the problems that have come rather suddenly to college campuses, but the reasons behind them, and how we as parents and educators can correct it . The main theme is that there are Three Great Untruths that a generation has been taught to embrace, but which are what the psychology field knows are ""cognitive distortions."" Harmful ways of thinking that encourage us to see catastrophe, bias, and enemies where there are none. These are things we can universally recognize as untrue...but which are so easy to fall into.I'm not a big non-fiction reader these days, but I loved this book and have already made some changes to the rules for my kids based on the very sound evidence presented in it, as well as the wonderful advice.What I loved most about this book though is that it's quite possibly the only UNBIASED view I've encountered in recent years. Near the end of the book the authors do tell us their political views but up until they came out and said it, I had no idea whether they were liberal or conservative, D or R, even though they were discussing issues that dealt with the widening gap between them. They instead got at exactly what they encourage their readers to get at in our own lives: the wider circle of humanity to which we all belong."

245,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12766685-alison,3,"First - I agree with their argument on free-play time for children. As a mom, I see this as an essential part of growing up and their discussion really helped me to figure out some of the reasons why it has felt important but I was struggling to articulate that. I also appreciated the points they made about safetyism. It is something I have seen and I now have a label for it and can hopefully better communicate the risks.But, I also struggled often with this book. I think that saying someone shouldn't be offended by a comment that you didn't know would be offensive removes the responsibility from the speaker to learn anything that could stop them from saying hurtful/offensive things in the future - most of the examples they use are of ways in which people say things that perpetuate systems of oppression (racism, sexism, etc) and by shrugging things off, the system doesn't get fixed. If the speaker were able to listen and change, then getting offended wouldn't be useful, but too often that's not the outcome. This is a topic I have been working though - I don't always understand why someone got offended, but when I listen or read, I can usually get it. But it comes back on me to learn, not them to get thick skin (I'm not always the speaker, but usually a somewhat confused bystander in these cases).It will raise my hackles when a book uses the version of MLK Jr that only encompasses his Dream speech and not also his other letter, sermons, and speeches. I think they simplified things too much on this respect.The sections laying out how various professors and others in academia have been mistreated was good at pointing out the failings of those areas, but I think that if you are looking for it you could easily find bad behavior in religion, in business, in government, etc. Every aspect of our culture contains humans and within that subset, they may *misbehave* in different ways, but every area has people who misuse power or are unqualified. I also have a few gripes with the way they discuss campus protests. I think we would agree about a lot of this, but I want to point that people like Heather McDonald and Charles Murray have writt books, the people protesting them are almost certainly aware of their views (either by reading the book or discussing parts of it) and they are choosing to say that this person has bad ideas. It is not that HM or CM don't get any chance to speak or promote their ideas - they still have free speech. It is more that students wish the wouldn't be given platforms for these ideas. I agree with Coddling in that violence is abhorrent and counterproductive, but they way they frame the rest of the conversation is in error.Overall - it was a book that made me think, but had some very problematic portions."
246,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1655983-katie,1,"The flaws of this book cloud the conclusion. Some of the flaws:-Anecdotes about campus events are used despite authors demand that everyone be more focused on facts and data. Some of the incidents described are indeed examples of extreme sensitivity and intolerance. Worrisome trend, but not convincing that campuses have abandoned free speech.-Serious lack of time spent on investigating and confirming the issues college students care about. The Trump administration is a frightening turn, threatening institutions and norms - shouldn't we expect young people to protest?-CBT as a treatment for anxiety I get, but as a treatment for real threats and oppression? So insulting! We have an administration threatening to take away healthcare, women's health care, rights of immigrants, gay people, minorities. What happens when a lesbian girl is told a speaker believes she is deviant who needs to go to conversion camp? She should practice CBT and remember the speaker has good intentions? When Richard Spencer coming to campus to spout off about peaceful ethnic cleansing, should students practice CBT? Just because the book does justice to some topics - like IGen social issues, helicopter parenting and safteyism, - does not mean the book works. I also happen to agree this generation does not conceive of the First Amendment like my generation does. College kids raised with awareness of inequality in American, we were raised to worry about authoritarianism and the Cold War. I think the topic deserves scrutiny, but these authors failed in my opinion. "
247,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5862443-joseph-stieb,4,"Full disclosure: I am a Haidt fanboy, so I'm predisposed to like this book. Unlike the Righteous Mind, it is not outstanding. Books that are elaborations of long-form articles rarely are. If you follow Haidt and Lukianoff's work closely, this is mainly a summary of what they have been doing the last 4 years of so (see Haidt's excellent Wriston Lecture for a distillation). Still, this is a strong, well-sourced, and fair-minded argument about where higher ed has turned wrong and how it can be rectified.Haidt and Lukianoff argue for an older understanding of the purpose of higher education: the pursuit of truth rather than the furthering of a political agenda. They convincingly show how higher ed has become more partisan and less ideologically diverse, although they don't do much to show how this stultifies and biases research and teaching (for more on this, see Shields and Dunn's outstanding Passing on the Right). Their focus is on why things like trigger warnings, disinvitations, interruptions of speakers, micro-aggressions, etc have surged on campus in the last 5 years or so. The core of their argument is less about ideology than generational shifts. Despite the somewhat inflammatory title, they put forth a complex, nuanced argument that the I-Gen (born in mid 1990s, came of age with cellphones and social media as normal things, in contrast to millennial, who were teens when the iPhone and facebook came out) is a far more anxious and dependent generation that doesn't know how to handle conflict on its own and has been coached to go to the authorities instead. Take a far more polarized, bureaucratized university system, and you get more kids calling for ""coddling"" and more administrators giving it to them to prevent their school from becoming the next Yale or Missouri. The leftist intellectual framework that these students embrace (redefinition of safety and violence, identitarian common enemy politics, a radical interpretation intersectionality, the dismissal of anything written by a dead white guy as not worth reading because he must have been a racist/sexist) isn't the deeper cause of this surge in left-wing activism on campus. Rather, changes in the climate of US politics and the way kids are raised primes them to take in this ideological system. This can be changed on both ends, although I am more interested in how to change to college atmosphere and how to make these ideas (each of which has some value) more realistic and less polarizing and politically ""weaponized.""The intellectual cases put forth against all of these concepts that have crept into academia are excellent, as usual. They explain how each of these things encourages mentally and intellectually unhealthy thinking, feeds tribalism, and makes open, trusting conversation impossible on campus. Still, I thought they were getting a little loose from their moorings in their criticism of modern parenting. It is hard to tell parents to not be a little over-protective of their kids. There are ways to do this (like more unstructured time built into a kid's day, at school and at home, plus less screen time) but overall I think most parents do a pretty good job. I think they are both part of pretty elite social circles in which tiger parenting was very common. My middle class upbringing seemed to have plenty of free time, and my parents let me and my brothers roam the neighborhood pretty freely. I wouldn't dismiss all of their argument about parenting, but it was probably the weak link in the book.I'd recommend this book to anyone concerned about changes on campus or anyone who has heard about Haidt and is curious. It is concise, and very qualified. As usual, Haidt's critics have misrepresented his argument left and right, so make sure you go to the source."
248,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25032671-kris,4,"I first read Bloom's original The Closing of the American Mind just so that I could read this book. While it's useful to have the earlier background on past decades in academia, Bloom's original is not required reading before enjoying Haidt's great contribution here.These authors lead the reader through some great analyses -- they show how a drastic shift in the mentality of arguments/debate on college campuses happened in 2013, along with a seemingly drastic shift in mindset surrounding the purpose of education. I'll list some of their principles here: Prepare the child for the road, not the road for the child. We are all prone to emotional reasoning and confirmation bias. Your worst enemy cannot harm you as much as your own unguarded thoughts. People are prone to catastroph-izing about the future. We are all prone to tribalism. Many psychological principles on college campuses encourage students to embrace foolishness, rather than wisdom. Young people are innately anti-fragile, but they learn helplessness in correlation with rising rates of adolescent depression and anxiety, a shift to more protective parenting, and widespread play deprivation and risk deprivation. We are seeing rising political polarization and expanded bureaucracy. We also see a rising passion for justice combined with a growing commitment to attaining equal outcomes in all areas. The rise in passion for justice is admirable on its own, but when combined with a demand to see equity, not equality, it becomes misguided.Some falsehoods: What doesn't kill you, makes you weaker.

250,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4859940-tara-brabazon,3,"An important book to read - and disagree with. This monograph explores how 'fragility' is being developed in children, adolescence and students on university campuses. While much of the attention is on the left and social justice politics, there is some focus on the polarization of politics from the alt-right.The problems with this book are clear. The authors confuse a diversity of facts and interpretations with emotions rather than rigour. EH Carr stated in 1961 that ""history means interpretation."" Only particular facts have survived to our present. Therefore assuming that the source material - the material culture - that remains in our present is accurate, true and convincing while alternative interpretations are emotional or intuitive perpetuates a mis-understanding of history, media and politics.Are students fragile? Perhaps. The greater question is why students are fragile. That is the question not asked or answered in this book. Unemployment, under-employment, exhorbitant fees for education, ridiculous payments for privatized utilities, and ill-information public policies are only part of our corrosive present.Protests exist because there is no space to be different, to be defiant, and - in the case of George Floyd - to breathe. This is not emotion or intent. This is verified and an outcome of claustropolitan structures. A provocative book. It lacks a deep engagement of the political economy. Therefore - and ironically - it is part of the identity politics superficiality it wishes to critique."
251,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7258380-dan-graser,5,"This collaboration between Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt is fantastic on many levels and addresses a thorny issue with precision, honesty, and language that is free of the usual superficial pejoratives found in such discussions. They begin with three fundamental Untruths that they have distilled from their own experiences working in academia and social psychology:1) What doesn't kill you makes you weaker.2) Always trust your feelings.3) Life is a battle between good people and evil people.These ideas are discussed in the context of current political divides, campus culture, parenting, and general discourse on social media. Throughout, they use 6 ""explanatory threads"" to understand how we have gotten where we are, sociologically and politically:1) There has been a steady increase in affective polarization since the 1980's, such that people don't feel a stronger kinship with their party but bond more over hatred of the opposition.2) There has been a nation-wide rise in adolescent anxiety and depression since 2011, mainly affecting those who belong to the ""iGen"" or Generation Z.3) There has been a shift, starting in the 80's and reaching a peak in the 90's among more educated families especially, to fearful and needlessly overprotective ""paranoid parenting.""4) The steady decline of unsupervised free play among children due to the above trend. 5) The growth of campus bureaucracy and the expansion of over-protection of students who themselves, don't wish it or need it, resulting in the transmission of the very type of psychological issues the campus is trying to prevent. 6) The rise of social justice activism, rightfully, in response to turbulent and emotionally powerful political events between 2012 and 2018.As someone who works in academia and is genuinely concerned about students' well-being, I always enjoy reading works that provide data, facts, and arguments based in psychology to suggest how we can improve that mission while dealing with the issues present in the larger social-political context, with which our students are dealing. This book contains the finest discussion of this I have seen in addition to great, level-headed discussions of modern parenting, social justice activism, and identity politics. Well worth your time!"

Still, more people should be talking about some silly viewpoints that are popular at the moment. "
253,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2319320-melissa,5,"Wonder why the young generation seems so bad at thinking? This book sheds light on what ""we"" collectively as a society have done to cause it. We've taught three falsehoods as truth: That individuals are fragile, that we can trust our feelings, that life is a battle between good and bad people. Do you feel, like me, that there is no way you're going to write down your thoughts on a particular topic esp. publicly, because no matter how well reasoned or how good your intentions, if you use one wrong word, you're deemed evil for life by one side or the other? (You're ""cancelled."") We've hearkened back to the time of witch hunts, and I found that chapter of the history of what leads to the eras of witch hunts (which we're in a time of those right now) enlightening about why the heck one word in a well meant email can cause a person's complete ruin. We need to get back to a time where we give people the benefit of the doubt! The information on Cognitive Behavior Therapy was also enlightening. As a society, we are essentially going against good psychological practice and teaching bad ways of thinking. One of my sons is a doomsday thinker and I'm happy to have some of these CBT tools to see if I can help him stop the negative thinking habits of thinking the worst about everything and everybody. We see this reflected in society right now, everyone jumps to conclusions on a story that's not an hour old with nothing but a headline and decide they have the ability to be judge, jury, and executioner on that alone and then move on as if ruining that person's life was not a weighty matter. I don't want my son growing up to be like that and it's been frustrating to try to talk him out of his thought processes because I want him to grown up sound of mind unlike many people I've encountered lately, and I've wondered why it is they can be such bad thinkers, and this book enlightens on that some of the reasons.The practical application section is worth the price of the read on what we can do to turn the boat around. Thankfully, I've been already doing a lot of the suggestions for my kids in my determination to have them grow up sound of mind, but this was nice to have the facts and stats to help solidify what I'm doing to help. This is another book that shows our overly scheduled, screen-heavy existence is doing nothing good for our youth. The authors of this book reveal toward the end of the book what their political leanings are and they're nearly the opposite of mine, but I'd say there is no slant, because I agreed with nearly all of it, it was logical, reasoned, well laid out--we're facing a problem that affects both sides of the political spectrum. It is a bit of a slog at the beginning with all the research and the fact that they are very academic writers with the ""I'll tell you this, I'm telling you, and now I'll summarize what I just told you"" which probably is all right if you're one to read at leisure instead of read books from cover to cover like me, that would help you remember what you read if you put it down for any amount of time, but be forewarned that it isn't a fast paced read. But it's an excellent read."
254,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2007216-peter-derk,4,"What an interesting book.I think what would prevent most people from reading this is probably some version of a sentiment that can be summed up as ""Okay Boomer."" But if that's how you're feeling, I would encourage you to give it a shot.Although there are lots of examples from college campuses, they're pretty balanced between things that overly-sensitive people are doing and things that crazy people are doing (usually white power weirdos). And while there is some condemnation of behavior, I felt like the author was very empathetic towards people and wasn't saying anything remotely like, ""These snowflakes need to shape up!"" or ""These iGen kids are ruining everything!"" If you read it that way, that's probably your preconceived notion and sensitivity lenses at work, not the real content of the book. The most interesting portions to me were related to parenting and how much it's changed in just a few decades. There was a section that listed a checklist for parents for school readiness for young kids. 30 or 40 years ago, the list was a lot of things like, ""You child can ride a two-wheel bicycle, Your child can walk alone to a store or home 2 or 3 blocks away..."" where now it looks more like, ""Your child can spell phonetically, Your child can understand basic mathematical concepts..."" So where once it was ""Is your child capable of managing their physical safety?"" now it's more ""Can your child fill out a worksheet?"" Which seems profoundly stupid to me. This is my Okay Boomer moment, so buckle up.When I was a kid we used to roam around the town in small groups of 2-4 kids. Sometimes on bikes, sometimes just walking. And it wasn't like we had to check in every hour with our parents. I rode the bus to the mall. I would go to the grocery store alone or with a friend. In the summer, this was basically all we did, screw around during unstructured time. You learn a lot without realizing it. You learn to avoid true danger, like weirdos and creeps. You learn how to do simple shit like walk into a grocery store, pick something out and pay for it. You learn how to take a bus. You learn the geography of where you live. I had a coworker who lived in a very safe neighborhood and wouldn't allow her son to walk to the bus alone. It was like a block. Eventually, she did let him do it, but he had to be on a walkie talkie and talk to her the whole time until he got on the bus. I've had a number of people tell me that when their kids are learning to drive, they have no idea where they are inside of their own towns. They don't know how to get from home to school. Every day, the school I work next to, parents line up their cars to drive up to the door of the school, at which point their child is released, gets in the car, and then the parents drive them home. Like they're goddamn diplomats in need of a secure escort. This line of cars extends several blocks, and parents will wait up to an hour in a line of cars to pick up their kids. The kids can walk or bike or whatever, but very few, if any, do this, and if they do want to do it this way the parents have to sign a waiver. I can already hear the parents: You don't have a kid, so you don't understand. If you don't have kids, you'll hear this all the time. And I totally agree, I don't have the emotional understanding of a parent. However, I would proffer this: I probably have a more realistic assessment of danger to children because I'm NOT a parent. I'm not emotionally invested, which means when I'm looking at the realistic dangers, my thinking isn't tainted by my personal stakes. There are some parents who agree with me, that kids should have a little more freedom. There was the mom profiled in the book, the sort of mother of the Free Range Kids movement, who let her young son ride the subway home by himself at one point, which turned out great.I do think kids probably need a little more room, a little more agency, and a little less structure. One of the more profound insights in the book had to do with the level of discourse we're experiencing today. In short, people suck at discussing things because they never had un-referee'ed disagreements as kids. When you're a kid, if you're playing a game with 4 other kids, you have to learn how to argue or disagree without the other kid getting up and leaving, at which point the game is unplayable. Newer parents tend to referee everything, jumping in if things get intense. But letting kids work these things out themselves might be a way to help them learn the skills of discussing things without getting to the point that everyone takes their ball and goes home.The best part of the book, however, is that it offers a lot of potential solutions. I've found that I'm a solutions-based thinking, so solutions speak to me. Even when I disagree with the solutions, I think solutions-oriented thinking speaks to me and gets me thinking along the lines of productive movement. Way too many books that I might put in the sociology category seem very focused on talking about the problem. I usually hear what the author is saying and think, ""Okay, I buy that this is a problem, but what now?"" To borrow an analogy from another book, a problem that's well-explained is great, but if you went to the doctor with a pain, and if that doctor could explain why you're feeling this pain, does knowing the pain's origin solve the problem? No. You go to the doctor not for an explanation of the history of the pain, but for the cure. It's how I feel when a cold is being passed around the office, and everyone wants to trace back to patient zero. As if it's really that person's fault. Sidebar: it's my pet peeve that people come in when they're sick. Don't do that. But once you're sick, figuring out who ""got you sick"" is a complete waste of time and energy. Once you know, does that help your symptoms? Does it speed your recovery? Absolutely not. Yes, I think the history of some things can be valuable in understanding them. But the history and origin of a problem without solution is not terribly useful. I think a lot of people don't have the guts to offer a solution. Because that's the easiest thing to attack. You can nitpick someone's solution, which will be seen as an effective way of discrediting their entire argument. Which is stupid. I deeply appreciate the solutions offered in this book, especially because they're solutions based mostly in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (which totally works) and because they're solutions that any individual can choose to apply. It's not a set of solutions that goes ""You motherfuckers need to stop doing X."" It's a set of solutions oriented towards, ""If you want to be a better person and have a better life, here are some realistic options.""Great read, and I'd definitely call it a must-read for parents of young kids who haven't given a lot of thought to giving their kid some rope. And parents who feel pressured by other parents, who are afraid of being seen as bad parents."
255,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31910342-josh,3,"I previously read Lukianoff's ""Unlearning Liberty"" earlier this year. While I thoroughly enjoyed that work, I was somewhat disappointed by this joint venture with social psychologist Jonathan Haidt. This is partly because while ""Unlearning Liberty"" was a searching examination of how higher education in recent years has failed in its central purpose to discover ""truth"" by prohibiting many forms of offensive speech on campus, this book tries to further that inquiry in some ways by putting together a composite of factors for why ""iGen"" (those who were born c. 1996) have embraced ""safetyism"" on college campuses. ""Safetyism"" is essentially the conflation of being offended with being in physical danger. The book is divided into three parts. The first unpacks what the authors call the ""three great untruths"" that iGen embraces: the world is divided between distinctly ""good"" people and wholly ""bad"" people; trust your feelings (i.e. emotional reasoning over logic); and ""safetyism"" which the authors describe as ""what doesn't hurt you, makes you weaker."" The second narrates a series of recent episodes of censorship and both far left/far right violence on college campuses, such as Berkeley Antifa protests against Milo Yiannopolis, the Alt-Right protests at UVA; and the Charles Murray episode at Middlebury. The final part explains what the authors believe are the six contributing factors that are the ""bad ideas [that] are setting up a generation for failure."" The last two chapters in this section deal with a) how parents should ideally raise children to be thick-skinned and critically thinking adults and b) how primary and secondary education can offer adolescents and teenagers the mental toolset to confront offensive ideas and grow intellectually from such debates. There is a lot of ground to cover in any review of this book (and much of what follows in this paragraph I explain in more detail in my review of Unlearning Liberty). But, the gist is that colleges and universities should be wholly focused on discerning ""truth."" Various public intellectuals, such as Van Jones, have argued that colleges provide people with a rare opportunity to grapple with offensive ideas and speech by using reasoning and argument. College should be a ""gym,"" to borrow from Van Jones, that trains people to debate and compromise within our democratic system. Since the early 2010s, though, many colleges (and almost exclusively the most liberal ones) have become distracted from the goal of seeking ""truth"" by protecting students from potentially offensive speech. There's an appropriate discussion within this section of how the left has stretched the definition of ""violence"" to include intuitively nonviolent actions, such as speech. By construing offensive speech as ""violent,"" college administrators, faculty, and students have effectively nullified the free speech privileges of a wide swathe of conservative intellectuals (and alt-right wackos) by appealing to the need to keep students ""safe"" on campus. The six factors that have contributed to the current climate of ""Safetyism,"" censorship, and unrest are best summed up as follows:1) American politics have become increasingly polarized (entering a ""polarization cycle"") where very little compromise is ever reached between left and right.2) The advent of social media and the internet has made ""iGen"" far more depressed and anxious than previous generations. 3) Parents since the 1980s have increasingly become ""helicopter"" parents, not allowing their children to experience any discomfort and sheltering them from the real world, so to speak. 4) What the authors term the ""decline of [free] play."" In other words, children have far less time relative to previous generations to socialize, initiate play, and be creative. This is caused by the fact that elite colleges and universities select from those with an abundance of extracurriculars (etc.) and parents respond by over-structuring their children's time with various activities. 5) Primary and secondary education have become obsessed with keeping students ""safe"" from offensive ideas and taboo subjects. 6) ""Social justice"" and its quest for equal outcomes has created a ""common enemy identity politics"" focused on subdividing people into various ""intersectional"" identities. The authors compare this to Martin Luther King, Jr.'s ""common humanity"" identity politics that sought to authentically include all Americans in the civil rights movement by appealing to the American civic religion. These six factors (covered in six chapters) are unevenly persuasive, although I generally agree with the authors that the cult of ""safe spaces"" and ""free speech zones"" on campuses is extremely problematic. I think I agree with some of the other reviews on Goodreads that some of their solutions contain assumptions grounded in a middle-class ethos. Specifically, their idea that children should be given more rein to explore their neighborhoods, talk to strangers, and even use public transportation at young ages (i.e. nine years old). The authors argue that our perception of danger is massively inflated by the 24 hour news cycle and John Walsh's crusade to catch ""America's Most Wanted."" I agree in part, but would argue that many parents (and single parents) living in certain rural or urban areas with high crime rates have legitimate concerns about allowing their children to be ""free range children."" Being a parent myself, I generally found their Dr. Spock parental advice annoying, at best, and naive at worst. Overall, an informative book that resonated well with my experience on campus the past seven years. Excepting the final two concluding chapters, I completely recommend this book to anyone seriously interested in learning more about what is happening on America's college campuses. But you should first read ""Unlearning Liberty."" "

The book also helped me to reexamine the educational choices that I have made for my 10 year old. I highly recommend this book, even though I didn't agree with everything that the authors had stated.

Kidding.This book is so relevant to the culture that we live in and the future that we are entering into. With its many different antidotes and research, the author does a fantastic job of bringing to the surface different lies (or 'Untruths' as he calls it) that have good intentions but can lead to detrimental effects overall. The stories can definitely get your blood pumping and outrage you at points and I think that's the point. 10/10 would recommend this to most people.One of the best parts of the book is the way the authors write in such a humble and transparent way. The consistently mention how the issues are more complex than they make them out to be and never claim to have the only answer. They also very openly share their political views and how they could influence their own writing when writing about political polarization. So good!"
259,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3730838-maggie-boyd,2,"I'm always interested in books critiquing our current educational system and sat down to read this one with enthusiasm. However, this book is less about what is wrong with our system and more about criticizing liberals for the horrors they have wrought upon our society. It begins with vilifying our current crop of college students: kids born after 1995 who began going to college in 2013. These children are having three great untruths fed to them by liberal universities: 1. The Untruth of Fragility: What doesn't kill you makes you weaker. 2. The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: Always trust your feelings. 3. The Untruth of Us versus Them: Life is a battle between good people and evil people. They go on to say that by creating safe spaces, colleges teach students to believe the above. The evidence? Students are preventing speakers from holding lectures they disagree with at their universities. As others have pointed out, this in no way keeps the speaker from disseminating their ideas. Milo, the target of one of these riots, was still making television appearances and publishing books. The students were asking that he not be allowed to speak in spaces their tuition paid for, a very different thing than asking that he never be allowed to speak anywhere. Moreover, this wasn't a question of not giving the speaker a chance to present his point but a reaction to the point the speaker had already made. Finally, the United States has over 3,000 4 yr. universities and the author's ""evidence"" centers around approximately 1% of those institutions having students make demands they felt were unreasonable. This is nowhere near epidemic. Then the authors get to what I felt was the primary point: Viewpoint diversity reduces a community’s susceptibility to witch hunts. One of the most important kinds of viewpoint diversity, diversity of political thought, has declined substantially among both professors and students at American universities since the 1990s. To sum up the first portion of the book has two major points: Anything that prevents someone from making a point, even if that point is offensive, is ""coddling"" and colleges are too liberal. We need more balance. (They didn't speak to the 600 Christian colleges where the staff is predominantly conservative.) After spending several chapters ""building a case"" on how the great untruths listed in the first paragraph are destroying young collegiate minds, the author's come to a startling conclusion: You can see why it was hard for us to make a strong case that universities were causing students to become anxious and depressed by teaching them disordered ways of thinking. Anxiety and depression rates were already rising for all teenagers before they arrived at college, and for those who never attended college as well. Clearly universities were not causing a national mental health crisis; they were responding to one. With liberal universities out as a scapegoat, bring in liberal parenting policies. Safteyism, where parents go to purportedly unreasonable limits to protect their kids might be a factor in kids being more fearful, which might be a factor in them being depressed. No direct evidence of this is available but they offer up some random events and show how those few events point to liberals running amok and creating too much fear in our kids. They have to admit, grudgingly, that many of the safety measures have worked. Putting it all together, from 1960 to 1990, there was a 48% reduction in deaths from unintended injuries and accidents among kids between five and fourteen years of age, and a 57% drop in deaths of younger kids (ages one to four).Lukianoff, Greg. The Coddling of the American Mind (p. 169). Penguin Publishing Group. Kindle Edition. In summary, the authors offer anecdotes and a handful of studies to showcase their points but the math in no way supports what they are saying. If you are someone who feels PC culture is at the heart of what is wrong with our country, you'll love this book and may believe it supports your view point. If you know how to do elementary school level math and have an understanding of the basic principle of percentages, you will quickly realize this tome is meant to speak into a very specific echo chamber and provides no substantial evidence to support the view that liberals will be the death of America."

He previously wrote The Righteous Mind, which was a powerful and thought-provoking read. Haidt, along with Greg Lukianoff, provide another powerful analysis and thought-provoking read with this book. I would recommend it to any and everyone. While there are specific recommendations that some may have differing personal preferences/opinions on, there is no lack of research in their presentation and arguments (and it’s safe to say they would welcome the discourse of another perspective). I especially appreciated their inclusion of CBT and how that could be a beneficial practice for many to adopt, as well as parents and institutions to encourage and teach. Looking forward to anything else Haidt writes. "

Over the 3 months since I finished The Coddling of the American Mind I cannot believe how many times I have shared the ideas of these authors with others. This book is just so pertinent, so timely, and so important that it comes up again and again. I generally read books and move on to the next so quickly, but this one has found a permanence in my worldview. I think that makes it worthy of 5 stars.Nov 21, 2018Why are so many college students struggling with anxiety and depression? Why are so many university campuses coming up against student demands to disinvite ""dangerous"" guest speakers, to penalize professors who propone unpopular opinions, and to dismiss any who threaten their conception of safety? This very insightful book discusses 3 great untruths of the ""IGen"" (the generation born after 1994, coinciding with the ubiquity of the iPhone): The Untruth of Fragility: What doesn’t kill you makes you weaker. The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: Always trust your feelings. The Untruth of Us Versus Them: Life is a battle between good people and evil people.It shows have parents and institutions have unwittingly taught youth these untruths, and have - with the best of intentions - coddled them to the point of handicapping their ability to handle the adult world. Within this framework, I gained some new insights into the reasons for our increasingly partisan political world.One thing I really like about The Coddling of the American Mind is that, unlike many books of this genre, it doesn't just rip down the system, telling us everything that's wrong with society, then leave us hopeless. Lukianoff and Haidt give pages of good, solid suggestions for how to correct the problems we have created. I would absolutely recommend this book to parents today, as well as to anyone in education or educational administration. It is quite bipartisan, but not afraid to point out problems on both side of the political spectrum. I already put the audiobook on hold for my husband!4.5 stars."

It was validating to read from a secular source of a different political affiliation than me the same identification of major problems I see in our culture/universities/media. Some problems I’d wholeheartedly agree with include, treating children & young adults as if they are fragile, assuming the worst about people who disagree with you, elevating “safetyism” as a top goal in life, tolerating a “call-out” culture that represses legitimate criticism and intimidates/shames people, and embracing identity politics. It was refreshing to read. The authors are sometimes too optimistic about what can bring about the turning of the ship, and sometimes they are too repetitive.

267,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7743315-jeanne,4,"Education should not be intended to make people comfortable; it is meant to make them think. – Hanna Holborn GrayI look for books that are going to make me think, make me see things differently. Coddling of the American Mind did this. In brief, it is about three great Untruths that are affecting US universities and making them weaker: that we are protecting them from things that they see as dangerous, because – although there are good people, there are also evil ones. The great Untruths are:1. The Untruth of Fragility: What doesn’t kill you makes you weaker. 2. The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: Always trust your feelings. 3. The Untruth of Us Versus Them: Life is a battle between good people and evil people. (p. 4) Lukianoff and Haidt are provocative, but also good at bringing together diverse kinds of information together to help us recognize, as the subtitle goes, ""how good intentions and bad ideas are setting up a generation for failure.""For a book about the dichotomous and extreme thinking characterizing parenting, students, and the university system in the 21st century, Lukianoff and Haidt slip into dichotomous thinking. As do we all from time to time.We are in an age of helicopter parenting – even bulldozer parenting – where parents attempt to intervene with their college-aged children in a way that my daughters, frustratingly, would not allow me to do when they were in grade school. Rather than helping them, except in the short-term, this sort of parenting (and overscheduling, failing to allow or encourage free play, etc.) leaves students to becoming fragile, anxious, and easily hurt. Lukianoff and Haidt argue compellingly that college students should and must be exposed to viewpoint diversity, which will help them think more critically, understand diverse perspectives, and withstand events that would otherwise make them depressed and anxious. As the authors conclude, this means that we should beseeking out challenges (rather than eliminating or avoiding everything that “feels unsafe”), freeing yourself from cognitive distortions (rather than always trusting your initial feelings), and taking a generous view of other people, and looking for nuance (rather than assuming the worst about people within a simplistic us-versus-them morality). (p. 14)I appreciated Coddling of the American Mind, but I was often annoyed and irritated by it – which are not good outcomes for this time of year. Lukianoff and Haidt gathered interesting and often compelling threads, but I wasn't convinced by all of their evidence. Clearly, there is more anxiety and depression on campus than when I was in school, but that isn't necessarily a function of ""coddling,"" but of greater access on college campuses. Students who would not have been able to attend college 20 years ago can.While Lukianoff and Haidt criticize students' complaints about controversial and noncontroversial speakers (e.g., George Will, Bill Maher, Eric Holder, Madeleine Albright), I am less dismayed. I like that students are more likely to set limits about things that my generation accepted (e.g., #metoo).Current parenting practices, among many other things, have both strengths and weaknesses. Lukianoff and Haidt primarily focus on the downside here, but maybe we can look for some nuance and attempt to create a stronger model for the next generation of parents – and universities."
268,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3052770-teri,4,"This is an important read in today's society. This book is a look at the iGen generation that seems to be obsessed with technology and social media. The authors look at how ready access to news and social media affects attitudes and higher education. iGen students seem to be obsessed with protecting themselves against any other opinion than their own. They are less open to expanding their worldview and listening to opposing views to gain a broader understanding of today's society. This has led to students feeling ""unsafe"" when dealing with someone who does not share their views. Are they truly physically unsafe or are they just unable to process opposing views? Instead of engaging in open, civil debate or listening to gain understanding, students are sheltered and professors and administrators kowtow to students, offering special ""safe spaces,"" firing faculty who simply exercise their first amendment right, or even canceling guest speakers whose views are not shared with the majority of students. In essence, the authors suggest that we are coddling America's youth and young adults, sheltering them to the point that they are unable to process opinions and ideas that they do not identify with. The authors spend a lot of time discussing how technology and social media have affected current attitudes and lifestyles. Where once young kids would go out and play in the neighborhood, without constant adult supervision, they are today being watched by helicopter parents, suggesting that kids are being overprotected. Are we coddling the younger generations to the point that they are unable to psychologically handle uncomfortable positions? It is certainly worth thinking about and this book will open that discussion to consider if we are doing a disservice to our youth.I think this is a must-read for parents, teachers, and faculty of higher education. These are the children that will one day rule our nation. How will they handle our future?"

From the way, this generation of college students was raised to how schools handled shaping these young people. All of this has led to creating overprotected young adults who are taking longer to mature. The authors' intentions are to help future generations not need overprotection from society as they enter the real world and leave their family home. While kids are young they need the freedom to make mistakes and have those times used as a learning experience. Basically to sum it up let kids take risks while they're growing up. “Prepare your child for the road, not the road for your child.” "

It tackles issues within both the political left and the political right. The book mainly focuses in on college campuses which have become increasingly left-wing but the authors also zoom out and look at the poor reactions from right-wing fringe groups and even mainstream conservatism. The two authors have presented a strong case for free speech and a renewed sense of trust in the American people to be able to sift through different ideas and make smart choices about which ones reign true and which ones prove false.

272,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28777221-sharad-pandian,3,"If you've been following the fracas on and surrounding American universities, there's nothing new in this book for you.As the title suggests, Jonathan Haidt and Greg Lukianoff argue that American children from the iGen generation (born 1995 or beyond) are raised in situations and using methods unique in ways that make them interpret discomfort as danger. This makes them unable to cope, and harms them and their causes.I. Why this book is a waste of spaceTo understand why this book goes wrong, its important to appreciate a central tension in the way we think about ideas. On one hand, clearly people have been wrong about so much in the past and therefore as Mill suggests we should keep avenues for debate and change always open. On the other hand, the content of ideas currently held actually matter because they shape the world we live in both symbolically and materially. Therefore, if a certain idea is deemed wrong, it is important to resist it and its spread. It's the inability of creatures like ourselves, condemned to live in time, to resolve this tension in any general way that leads to so much chatter about free speech and its limits.The problem with the authors of this book is that they model debates as though ideas don't matter except for debate, as though fermenting debate itself were the point of ideas. The notion that there power differentials that are deeply entrenched and might not be removed by polite argumentation doesn't even come up.For example, a convenient manner to think about oppression is through ""structural analysis"" which helps make sense of the institutions and experiences that are frequent and persistent. To live in this miasma isn't merely about encountering scary ideas but actually being harmed in a variety of ways, and it really is unclear what the best way to resist and liberate. But the authors are convinced that they know best, since obviously more speech and more ideas is how victory will be won. They make much use of how the recent victories for same-sex marriage included campaigning that stressed similarity and shared community, but conveniently leave out how Stonewall was a riot.When they come close to discussing the obviously relevant idea of power, they just manage feebly to say:In calling for the dismantling of power structures, the author was using a set of terms and concepts that are common in some academic departments; the main line of argumentation fell squarely within the large family of Marxist approaches to social and political analysis. It’s a set of approaches in which things are analyzed primarily in terms of power. Groups struggle for power. Within this paradigm, when power is perceived to be held by one group over others, there is a moral polarity: the groups seen as powerful are bad, while the groups seen as oppressed are good. It’s a variant of the pathological dualism that Rabbi Sacks described in the quotation at the start of this chapter.All structural analysis are first reduced to ""groups struggle for power"" and then into instances of ""pathological dualism"" between the ""unimpeachably good and the irredeemably bad"".There are a lot of serious critiques possible about the relevance and fruitfulness of thinking about oppression as ""structural"", but this glib dismissal is intellectually embarrassing.Their unwillingness to take power seriously makes this entire book a slog through shallow liberal moralizing. Instead of responding to Down Girl: The Logic of Misogyny's point about how it is better to concentrate on the incident and impact instead of intent, because it makes it much, much harder to call out harmful behaviour, they just assume intent is what matters, and so anyone thinks otherwise is labouring under a ""cognitive distortion""The most evident is catastrophizing: If Milo Yiannopoulos is allowed to speak, there will be “broken bodies” on our side. I might lose my “right to exist.” Therefore, violence is justified, because it is self-defense. The author also engages in dichotomous thinking: If you condemn my side’s violence, that means you condone Yiannopoulos’s ideas. You must “pick a side.” You’re either with us or against us. Life is a battle between good people and evil people, and if you disagree with us, you’re one of the evil people…But if asking for peaceful dialogue is violent, then it seems that the word “violence” is taking on new meanings for some students.The point here isn't even that the Milo protests were the obvious way to go (although Milo's inability to get funding since suggests so), but that it's quite impossible to know antecedently or even in the short-term which strategies will be successful. Does treating every small incident as though it's important work better or does taking a more judicious strategy? Despite this lack of clarity about the truth, the authors frame the debate as young college students with good hearts making foolish choices instead of considering that they might possibly be engaging in successful resistance to entrenched evils.II. Why this book is still importantDespite this, there are three reasons this still remains a decent book.First, a significant chunk of the book concerns trends that converge in the iGen generation, including the lack of opportunity for free play, more bureaucracy, etc. It's really fun to read in one place, even if the information isn't new Second, it really is true that a lot of incidents of campus have been horrific, indicating that thinking you're on the right side of history allows for sadism and heedlessness. If you're on social media and have a functioning brain, you know the Left can go overboard in its mob mentality. As from above, I don't think we can say with certainty that these methods as a whole won't be successful, but they clearly do go against strong moral sensibilities at times. The Heckler's veto against anyone conservative, violence, cruelty all seem unacceptable, however much we tell ourselves it might ultimately be for the best.Third, the book is a lot more compelling if we don't think of it as a political project at all, but about psychologists simply talking about trends in the progressive movement that might be affecting mental health, fostering unhealthy ideas, and leading to irrational behaviour. At higher levels of explanation, trends might emerge that might be difficult to account for on a case-by-case basis, and I think the authors present a plausible case that taken as a whole, a lot of practices might be making the situation worse for students.Overall, a book better read as a summary of recent events on American campuses than as any kind of original contribution."
273,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2473528-roseanna-white,5,"Everyone with kids college-aged or younger needs to read this book! It addresses the trend of ""safetyism"" and student fragility--that the ideas of ""dangerous"" have crept from physical harm to emotional discomfort, which is proven not to make our kids STRONGER, but rather emotionally WEAKER. In it the authors not only discuss the problems that have come rather suddenly to college campuses, but the reasons behind them, and how we as parents and educators can correct it . The main theme is that there are Three Great Untruths that a generation has been taught to embrace, but which are what the psychology field knows are ""cognitive distortions."" Harmful ways of thinking that encourage us to see catastrophe, bias, and enemies where there are none. These are things we can universally recognize as untrue...but which are so easy to fall into.I'm not a big non-fiction reader these days, but I loved this book and have already made some changes to the rules for my kids based on the very sound evidence presented in it, as well as the wonderful advice.What I loved most about this book though is that it's quite possibly the only UNBIASED view I've encountered in recent years. Near the end of the book the authors do tell us their political views but up until they came out and said it, I had no idea whether they were liberal or conservative, D or R, even though they were discussing issues that dealt with the widening gap between them. They instead got at exactly what they encourage their readers to get at in our own lives: the wider circle of humanity to which we all belong."

275,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12766685-alison,3,"First - I agree with their argument on free-play time for children. As a mom, I see this as an essential part of growing up and their discussion really helped me to figure out some of the reasons why it has felt important but I was struggling to articulate that. I also appreciated the points they made about safetyism. It is something I have seen and I now have a label for it and can hopefully better communicate the risks.But, I also struggled often with this book. I think that saying someone shouldn't be offended by a comment that you didn't know would be offensive removes the responsibility from the speaker to learn anything that could stop them from saying hurtful/offensive things in the future - most of the examples they use are of ways in which people say things that perpetuate systems of oppression (racism, sexism, etc) and by shrugging things off, the system doesn't get fixed. If the speaker were able to listen and change, then getting offended wouldn't be useful, but too often that's not the outcome. This is a topic I have been working though - I don't always understand why someone got offended, but when I listen or read, I can usually get it. But it comes back on me to learn, not them to get thick skin (I'm not always the speaker, but usually a somewhat confused bystander in these cases).It will raise my hackles when a book uses the version of MLK Jr that only encompasses his Dream speech and not also his other letter, sermons, and speeches. I think they simplified things too much on this respect.The sections laying out how various professors and others in academia have been mistreated was good at pointing out the failings of those areas, but I think that if you are looking for it you could easily find bad behavior in religion, in business, in government, etc. Every aspect of our culture contains humans and within that subset, they may *misbehave* in different ways, but every area has people who misuse power or are unqualified. I also have a few gripes with the way they discuss campus protests. I think we would agree about a lot of this, but I want to point that people like Heather McDonald and Charles Murray have writt books, the people protesting them are almost certainly aware of their views (either by reading the book or discussing parts of it) and they are choosing to say that this person has bad ideas. It is not that HM or CM don't get any chance to speak or promote their ideas - they still have free speech. It is more that students wish the wouldn't be given platforms for these ideas. I agree with Coddling in that violence is abhorrent and counterproductive, but they way they frame the rest of the conversation is in error.Overall - it was a book that made me think, but had some very problematic portions."
276,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1655983-katie,1,"The flaws of this book cloud the conclusion. Some of the flaws:-Anecdotes about campus events are used despite authors demand that everyone be more focused on facts and data. Some of the incidents described are indeed examples of extreme sensitivity and intolerance. Worrisome trend, but not convincing that campuses have abandoned free speech.-Serious lack of time spent on investigating and confirming the issues college students care about. The Trump administration is a frightening turn, threatening institutions and norms - shouldn't we expect young people to protest?-CBT as a treatment for anxiety I get, but as a treatment for real threats and oppression? So insulting! We have an administration threatening to take away healthcare, women's health care, rights of immigrants, gay people, minorities. What happens when a lesbian girl is told a speaker believes she is deviant who needs to go to conversion camp? She should practice CBT and remember the speaker has good intentions? When Richard Spencer coming to campus to spout off about peaceful ethnic cleansing, should students practice CBT? Just because the book does justice to some topics - like IGen social issues, helicopter parenting and safteyism, - does not mean the book works. I also happen to agree this generation does not conceive of the First Amendment like my generation does. College kids raised with awareness of inequality in American, we were raised to worry about authoritarianism and the Cold War. I think the topic deserves scrutiny, but these authors failed in my opinion. "

Books that are elaborations of long-form articles rarely are. If you follow Haidt and Lukianoff's work closely, this is mainly a summary of what they have been doing the last 4 years of so (see Haidt's excellent Wriston Lecture for a distillation). Still, this is a strong, well-sourced, and fair-minded argument about where higher ed has turned wrong and how it can be rectified.Haidt and Lukianoff argue for an older understanding of the purpose of higher education: the pursuit of truth rather than the furthering of a political agenda. They convincingly show how higher ed has become more partisan and less ideologically diverse, although they don't do much to show how this stultifies and biases research and teaching (for more on this, see Shields and Dunn's outstanding Passing on the Right). Their focus is on why things like trigger warnings, disinvitations, interruptions of speakers, micro-aggressions, etc have surged on campus in the last 5 years or so. The core of their argument is less about ideology than generational shifts. Despite the somewhat inflammatory title, they put forth a complex, nuanced argument that the I-Gen (born in mid 1990s, came of age with cellphones and social media as normal things, in contrast to millennial, who were teens when the iPhone and facebook came out) is a far more anxious and dependent generation that doesn't know how to handle conflict on its own and has been coached to go to the authorities instead. Take a far more polarized, bureaucratized university system, and you get more kids calling for ""coddling"" and more administrators giving it to them to prevent their school from becoming the next Yale or Missouri. The leftist intellectual framework that these students embrace (redefinition of safety and violence, identitarian common enemy politics, a radical interpretation intersectionality, the dismissal of anything written by a dead white guy as not worth reading because he must have been a racist/sexist) isn't the deeper cause of this surge in left-wing activism on campus. Rather, changes in the climate of US politics and the way kids are raised primes them to take in this ideological system. This can be changed on both ends, although I am more interested in how to change to college atmosphere and how to make these ideas (each of which has some value) more realistic and less polarizing and politically ""weaponized.""The intellectual cases put forth against all of these concepts that have crept into academia are excellent, as usual. They explain how each of these things encourages mentally and intellectually unhealthy thinking, feeds tribalism, and makes open, trusting conversation impossible on campus. Still, I thought they were getting a little loose from their moorings in their criticism of modern parenting. It is hard to tell parents to not be a little over-protective of their kids. There are ways to do this (like more unstructured time built into a kid's day, at school and at home, plus less screen time) but overall I think most parents do a pretty good job. I think they are both part of pretty elite social circles in which tiger parenting was very common. My middle class upbringing seemed to have plenty of free time, and my parents let me and my brothers roam the neighborhood pretty freely. I wouldn't dismiss all of their argument about parenting, but it was probably the weak link in the book.I'd recommend this book to anyone concerned about changes on campus or anyone who has heard about Haidt and is curious. It is concise, and very qualified. As usual, Haidt's critics have misrepresented his argument left and right, so make sure you go to the source."

While it's useful to have the earlier background on past decades in academia, Bloom's original is not required reading before enjoying Haidt's great contribution here.These authors lead the reader through some great analyses -- they show how a drastic shift in the mentality of arguments/debate on college campuses happened in 2013, along with a seemingly drastic shift in mindset surrounding the purpose of education. I'll list some of their principles here: Prepare the child for the road, not the road for the child. We are all prone to emotional reasoning and confirmation bias. Your worst enemy cannot harm you as much as your own unguarded thoughts. People are prone to catastroph-izing about the future. We are all prone to tribalism. Many psychological principles on college campuses encourage students to embrace foolishness, rather than wisdom. Young people are innately anti-fragile, but they learn helplessness in correlation with rising rates of adolescent depression and anxiety, a shift to more protective parenting, and widespread play deprivation and risk deprivation. We are seeing rising political polarization and expanded bureaucracy. We also see a rising passion for justice combined with a growing commitment to attaining equal outcomes in all areas. The rise in passion for justice is admirable on its own, but when combined with a demand to see equity, not equality, it becomes misguided.Some falsehoods: What doesn't kill you, makes you weaker.

280,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4859940-tara-brabazon,3,"An important book to read - and disagree with. This monograph explores how 'fragility' is being developed in children, adolescence and students on university campuses. While much of the attention is on the left and social justice politics, there is some focus on the polarization of politics from the alt-right.The problems with this book are clear. The authors confuse a diversity of facts and interpretations with emotions rather than rigour. EH Carr stated in 1961 that ""history means interpretation."" Only particular facts have survived to our present. Therefore assuming that the source material - the material culture - that remains in our present is accurate, true and convincing while alternative interpretations are emotional or intuitive perpetuates a mis-understanding of history, media and politics.Are students fragile? Perhaps. The greater question is why students are fragile. That is the question not asked or answered in this book. Unemployment, under-employment, exhorbitant fees for education, ridiculous payments for privatized utilities, and ill-information public policies are only part of our corrosive present.Protests exist because there is no space to be different, to be defiant, and - in the case of George Floyd - to breathe. This is not emotion or intent. This is verified and an outcome of claustropolitan structures. A provocative book. It lacks a deep engagement of the political economy. Therefore - and ironically - it is part of the identity politics superficiality it wishes to critique."
281,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7258380-dan-graser,5,"This collaboration between Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt is fantastic on many levels and addresses a thorny issue with precision, honesty, and language that is free of the usual superficial pejoratives found in such discussions. They begin with three fundamental Untruths that they have distilled from their own experiences working in academia and social psychology:1) What doesn't kill you makes you weaker.2) Always trust your feelings.3) Life is a battle between good people and evil people.These ideas are discussed in the context of current political divides, campus culture, parenting, and general discourse on social media. Throughout, they use 6 ""explanatory threads"" to understand how we have gotten where we are, sociologically and politically:1) There has been a steady increase in affective polarization since the 1980's, such that people don't feel a stronger kinship with their party but bond more over hatred of the opposition.2) There has been a nation-wide rise in adolescent anxiety and depression since 2011, mainly affecting those who belong to the ""iGen"" or Generation Z.3) There has been a shift, starting in the 80's and reaching a peak in the 90's among more educated families especially, to fearful and needlessly overprotective ""paranoid parenting.""4) The steady decline of unsupervised free play among children due to the above trend. 5) The growth of campus bureaucracy and the expansion of over-protection of students who themselves, don't wish it or need it, resulting in the transmission of the very type of psychological issues the campus is trying to prevent. 6) The rise of social justice activism, rightfully, in response to turbulent and emotionally powerful political events between 2012 and 2018.As someone who works in academia and is genuinely concerned about students' well-being, I always enjoy reading works that provide data, facts, and arguments based in psychology to suggest how we can improve that mission while dealing with the issues present in the larger social-political context, with which our students are dealing. This book contains the finest discussion of this I have seen in addition to great, level-headed discussions of modern parenting, social justice activism, and identity politics. Well worth your time!"

Still, more people should be talking about some silly viewpoints that are popular at the moment. "
283,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2319320-melissa,5,"Wonder why the young generation seems so bad at thinking? This book sheds light on what ""we"" collectively as a society have done to cause it. We've taught three falsehoods as truth: That individuals are fragile, that we can trust our feelings, that life is a battle between good and bad people. Do you feel, like me, that there is no way you're going to write down your thoughts on a particular topic esp. publicly, because no matter how well reasoned or how good your intentions, if you use one wrong word, you're deemed evil for life by one side or the other? (You're ""cancelled."") We've hearkened back to the time of witch hunts, and I found that chapter of the history of what leads to the eras of witch hunts (which we're in a time of those right now) enlightening about why the heck one word in a well meant email can cause a person's complete ruin. We need to get back to a time where we give people the benefit of the doubt! The information on Cognitive Behavior Therapy was also enlightening. As a society, we are essentially going against good psychological practice and teaching bad ways of thinking. One of my sons is a doomsday thinker and I'm happy to have some of these CBT tools to see if I can help him stop the negative thinking habits of thinking the worst about everything and everybody. We see this reflected in society right now, everyone jumps to conclusions on a story that's not an hour old with nothing but a headline and decide they have the ability to be judge, jury, and executioner on that alone and then move on as if ruining that person's life was not a weighty matter. I don't want my son growing up to be like that and it's been frustrating to try to talk him out of his thought processes because I want him to grown up sound of mind unlike many people I've encountered lately, and I've wondered why it is they can be such bad thinkers, and this book enlightens on that some of the reasons.The practical application section is worth the price of the read on what we can do to turn the boat around. Thankfully, I've been already doing a lot of the suggestions for my kids in my determination to have them grow up sound of mind, but this was nice to have the facts and stats to help solidify what I'm doing to help. This is another book that shows our overly scheduled, screen-heavy existence is doing nothing good for our youth. The authors of this book reveal toward the end of the book what their political leanings are and they're nearly the opposite of mine, but I'd say there is no slant, because I agreed with nearly all of it, it was logical, reasoned, well laid out--we're facing a problem that affects both sides of the political spectrum. It is a bit of a slog at the beginning with all the research and the fact that they are very academic writers with the ""I'll tell you this, I'm telling you, and now I'll summarize what I just told you"" which probably is all right if you're one to read at leisure instead of read books from cover to cover like me, that would help you remember what you read if you put it down for any amount of time, but be forewarned that it isn't a fast paced read. But it's an excellent read."
284,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2007216-peter-derk,4,"What an interesting book.I think what would prevent most people from reading this is probably some version of a sentiment that can be summed up as ""Okay Boomer."" But if that's how you're feeling, I would encourage you to give it a shot.Although there are lots of examples from college campuses, they're pretty balanced between things that overly-sensitive people are doing and things that crazy people are doing (usually white power weirdos). And while there is some condemnation of behavior, I felt like the author was very empathetic towards people and wasn't saying anything remotely like, ""These snowflakes need to shape up!"" or ""These iGen kids are ruining everything!"" If you read it that way, that's probably your preconceived notion and sensitivity lenses at work, not the real content of the book. The most interesting portions to me were related to parenting and how much it's changed in just a few decades. There was a section that listed a checklist for parents for school readiness for young kids. 30 or 40 years ago, the list was a lot of things like, ""You child can ride a two-wheel bicycle, Your child can walk alone to a store or home 2 or 3 blocks away..."" where now it looks more like, ""Your child can spell phonetically, Your child can understand basic mathematical concepts..."" So where once it was ""Is your child capable of managing their physical safety?"" now it's more ""Can your child fill out a worksheet?"" Which seems profoundly stupid to me. This is my Okay Boomer moment, so buckle up.When I was a kid we used to roam around the town in small groups of 2-4 kids. Sometimes on bikes, sometimes just walking. And it wasn't like we had to check in every hour with our parents. I rode the bus to the mall. I would go to the grocery store alone or with a friend. In the summer, this was basically all we did, screw around during unstructured time. You learn a lot without realizing it. You learn to avoid true danger, like weirdos and creeps. You learn how to do simple shit like walk into a grocery store, pick something out and pay for it. You learn how to take a bus. You learn the geography of where you live. I had a coworker who lived in a very safe neighborhood and wouldn't allow her son to walk to the bus alone. It was like a block. Eventually, she did let him do it, but he had to be on a walkie talkie and talk to her the whole time until he got on the bus. I've had a number of people tell me that when their kids are learning to drive, they have no idea where they are inside of their own towns. They don't know how to get from home to school. Every day, the school I work next to, parents line up their cars to drive up to the door of the school, at which point their child is released, gets in the car, and then the parents drive them home. Like they're goddamn diplomats in need of a secure escort. This line of cars extends several blocks, and parents will wait up to an hour in a line of cars to pick up their kids. The kids can walk or bike or whatever, but very few, if any, do this, and if they do want to do it this way the parents have to sign a waiver. I can already hear the parents: You don't have a kid, so you don't understand. If you don't have kids, you'll hear this all the time. And I totally agree, I don't have the emotional understanding of a parent. However, I would proffer this: I probably have a more realistic assessment of danger to children because I'm NOT a parent. I'm not emotionally invested, which means when I'm looking at the realistic dangers, my thinking isn't tainted by my personal stakes. There are some parents who agree with me, that kids should have a little more freedom. There was the mom profiled in the book, the sort of mother of the Free Range Kids movement, who let her young son ride the subway home by himself at one point, which turned out great.I do think kids probably need a little more room, a little more agency, and a little less structure. One of the more profound insights in the book had to do with the level of discourse we're experiencing today. In short, people suck at discussing things because they never had un-referee'ed disagreements as kids. When you're a kid, if you're playing a game with 4 other kids, you have to learn how to argue or disagree without the other kid getting up and leaving, at which point the game is unplayable. Newer parents tend to referee everything, jumping in if things get intense. But letting kids work these things out themselves might be a way to help them learn the skills of discussing things without getting to the point that everyone takes their ball and goes home.The best part of the book, however, is that it offers a lot of potential solutions. I've found that I'm a solutions-based thinking, so solutions speak to me. Even when I disagree with the solutions, I think solutions-oriented thinking speaks to me and gets me thinking along the lines of productive movement. Way too many books that I might put in the sociology category seem very focused on talking about the problem. I usually hear what the author is saying and think, ""Okay, I buy that this is a problem, but what now?"" To borrow an analogy from another book, a problem that's well-explained is great, but if you went to the doctor with a pain, and if that doctor could explain why you're feeling this pain, does knowing the pain's origin solve the problem? No. You go to the doctor not for an explanation of the history of the pain, but for the cure. It's how I feel when a cold is being passed around the office, and everyone wants to trace back to patient zero. As if it's really that person's fault. Sidebar: it's my pet peeve that people come in when they're sick. Don't do that. But once you're sick, figuring out who ""got you sick"" is a complete waste of time and energy. Once you know, does that help your symptoms? Does it speed your recovery? Absolutely not. Yes, I think the history of some things can be valuable in understanding them. But the history and origin of a problem without solution is not terribly useful. I think a lot of people don't have the guts to offer a solution. Because that's the easiest thing to attack. You can nitpick someone's solution, which will be seen as an effective way of discrediting their entire argument. Which is stupid. I deeply appreciate the solutions offered in this book, especially because they're solutions based mostly in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (which totally works) and because they're solutions that any individual can choose to apply. It's not a set of solutions that goes ""You motherfuckers need to stop doing X."" It's a set of solutions oriented towards, ""If you want to be a better person and have a better life, here are some realistic options.""Great read, and I'd definitely call it a must-read for parents of young kids who haven't given a lot of thought to giving their kid some rope. And parents who feel pressured by other parents, who are afraid of being seen as bad parents."
285,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31910342-josh,3,"I previously read Lukianoff's ""Unlearning Liberty"" earlier this year. While I thoroughly enjoyed that work, I was somewhat disappointed by this joint venture with social psychologist Jonathan Haidt. This is partly because while ""Unlearning Liberty"" was a searching examination of how higher education in recent years has failed in its central purpose to discover ""truth"" by prohibiting many forms of offensive speech on campus, this book tries to further that inquiry in some ways by putting together a composite of factors for why ""iGen"" (those who were born c. 1996) have embraced ""safetyism"" on college campuses. ""Safetyism"" is essentially the conflation of being offended with being in physical danger. The book is divided into three parts. The first unpacks what the authors call the ""three great untruths"" that iGen embraces: the world is divided between distinctly ""good"" people and wholly ""bad"" people; trust your feelings (i.e. emotional reasoning over logic); and ""safetyism"" which the authors describe as ""what doesn't hurt you, makes you weaker."" The second narrates a series of recent episodes of censorship and both far left/far right violence on college campuses, such as Berkeley Antifa protests against Milo Yiannopolis, the Alt-Right protests at UVA; and the Charles Murray episode at Middlebury. The final part explains what the authors believe are the six contributing factors that are the ""bad ideas [that] are setting up a generation for failure."" The last two chapters in this section deal with a) how parents should ideally raise children to be thick-skinned and critically thinking adults and b) how primary and secondary education can offer adolescents and teenagers the mental toolset to confront offensive ideas and grow intellectually from such debates. There is a lot of ground to cover in any review of this book (and much of what follows in this paragraph I explain in more detail in my review of Unlearning Liberty). But, the gist is that colleges and universities should be wholly focused on discerning ""truth."" Various public intellectuals, such as Van Jones, have argued that colleges provide people with a rare opportunity to grapple with offensive ideas and speech by using reasoning and argument. College should be a ""gym,"" to borrow from Van Jones, that trains people to debate and compromise within our democratic system. Since the early 2010s, though, many colleges (and almost exclusively the most liberal ones) have become distracted from the goal of seeking ""truth"" by protecting students from potentially offensive speech. There's an appropriate discussion within this section of how the left has stretched the definition of ""violence"" to include intuitively nonviolent actions, such as speech. By construing offensive speech as ""violent,"" college administrators, faculty, and students have effectively nullified the free speech privileges of a wide swathe of conservative intellectuals (and alt-right wackos) by appealing to the need to keep students ""safe"" on campus. The six factors that have contributed to the current climate of ""Safetyism,"" censorship, and unrest are best summed up as follows:1) American politics have become increasingly polarized (entering a ""polarization cycle"") where very little compromise is ever reached between left and right.2) The advent of social media and the internet has made ""iGen"" far more depressed and anxious than previous generations. 3) Parents since the 1980s have increasingly become ""helicopter"" parents, not allowing their children to experience any discomfort and sheltering them from the real world, so to speak. 4) What the authors term the ""decline of [free] play."" In other words, children have far less time relative to previous generations to socialize, initiate play, and be creative. This is caused by the fact that elite colleges and universities select from those with an abundance of extracurriculars (etc.) and parents respond by over-structuring their children's time with various activities. 5) Primary and secondary education have become obsessed with keeping students ""safe"" from offensive ideas and taboo subjects. 6) ""Social justice"" and its quest for equal outcomes has created a ""common enemy identity politics"" focused on subdividing people into various ""intersectional"" identities. The authors compare this to Martin Luther King, Jr.'s ""common humanity"" identity politics that sought to authentically include all Americans in the civil rights movement by appealing to the American civic religion. These six factors (covered in six chapters) are unevenly persuasive, although I generally agree with the authors that the cult of ""safe spaces"" and ""free speech zones"" on campuses is extremely problematic. I think I agree with some of the other reviews on Goodreads that some of their solutions contain assumptions grounded in a middle-class ethos. Specifically, their idea that children should be given more rein to explore their neighborhoods, talk to strangers, and even use public transportation at young ages (i.e. nine years old). The authors argue that our perception of danger is massively inflated by the 24 hour news cycle and John Walsh's crusade to catch ""America's Most Wanted."" I agree in part, but would argue that many parents (and single parents) living in certain rural or urban areas with high crime rates have legitimate concerns about allowing their children to be ""free range children."" Being a parent myself, I generally found their Dr. Spock parental advice annoying, at best, and naive at worst. Overall, an informative book that resonated well with my experience on campus the past seven years. Excepting the final two concluding chapters, I completely recommend this book to anyone seriously interested in learning more about what is happening on America's college campuses. But you should first read ""Unlearning Liberty."" "

The book also helped me to reexamine the educational choices that I have made for my 10 year old. I highly recommend this book, even though I didn't agree with everything that the authors had stated.

With its many different antidotes and research, the author does a fantastic job of bringing to the surface different lies (or 'Untruths' as he calls it) that have good intentions but can lead to detrimental effects overall. The stories can definitely get your blood pumping and outrage you at points and I think that's the point. 10/10 would recommend this to most people.One of the best parts of the book is the way the authors write in such a humble and transparent way. The consistently mention how the issues are more complex than they make them out to be and never claim to have the only answer. They also very openly share their political views and how they could influence their own writing when writing about political polarization. So good!"
289,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3730838-maggie-boyd,2,"I'm always interested in books critiquing our current educational system and sat down to read this one with enthusiasm. However, this book is less about what is wrong with our system and more about criticizing liberals for the horrors they have wrought upon our society. It begins with vilifying our current crop of college students: kids born after 1995 who began going to college in 2013. These children are having three great untruths fed to them by liberal universities: 1. The Untruth of Fragility: What doesn't kill you makes you weaker. 2. The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: Always trust your feelings. 3. The Untruth of Us versus Them: Life is a battle between good people and evil people. They go on to say that by creating safe spaces, colleges teach students to believe the above. The evidence? Students are preventing speakers from holding lectures they disagree with at their universities. As others have pointed out, this in no way keeps the speaker from disseminating their ideas. Milo, the target of one of these riots, was still making television appearances and publishing books. The students were asking that he not be allowed to speak in spaces their tuition paid for, a very different thing than asking that he never be allowed to speak anywhere. Moreover, this wasn't a question of not giving the speaker a chance to present his point but a reaction to the point the speaker had already made. Finally, the United States has over 3,000 4 yr. universities and the author's ""evidence"" centers around approximately 1% of those institutions having students make demands they felt were unreasonable. This is nowhere near epidemic. Then the authors get to what I felt was the primary point: Viewpoint diversity reduces a community’s susceptibility to witch hunts. One of the most important kinds of viewpoint diversity, diversity of political thought, has declined substantially among both professors and students at American universities since the 1990s. To sum up the first portion of the book has two major points: Anything that prevents someone from making a point, even if that point is offensive, is ""coddling"" and colleges are too liberal. We need more balance. (They didn't speak to the 600 Christian colleges where the staff is predominantly conservative.) After spending several chapters ""building a case"" on how the great untruths listed in the first paragraph are destroying young collegiate minds, the author's come to a startling conclusion: You can see why it was hard for us to make a strong case that universities were causing students to become anxious and depressed by teaching them disordered ways of thinking. Anxiety and depression rates were already rising for all teenagers before they arrived at college, and for those who never attended college as well. Clearly universities were not causing a national mental health crisis; they were responding to one. With liberal universities out as a scapegoat, bring in liberal parenting policies. Safteyism, where parents go to purportedly unreasonable limits to protect their kids might be a factor in kids being more fearful, which might be a factor in them being depressed. No direct evidence of this is available but they offer up some random events and show how those few events point to liberals running amok and creating too much fear in our kids. They have to admit, grudgingly, that many of the safety measures have worked. Putting it all together, from 1960 to 1990, there was a 48% reduction in deaths from unintended injuries and accidents among kids between five and fourteen years of age, and a 57% drop in deaths of younger kids (ages one to four).Lukianoff, Greg. The Coddling of the American Mind (p. 169). Penguin Publishing Group. Kindle Edition. In summary, the authors offer anecdotes and a handful of studies to showcase their points but the math in no way supports what they are saying. If you are someone who feels PC culture is at the heart of what is wrong with our country, you'll love this book and may believe it supports your view point. If you know how to do elementary school level math and have an understanding of the basic principle of percentages, you will quickly realize this tome is meant to speak into a very specific echo chamber and provides no substantial evidence to support the view that liberals will be the death of America."

He previously wrote The Righteous Mind, which was a powerful and thought-provoking read. Haidt, along with Greg Lukianoff, provide another powerful analysis and thought-provoking read with this book. I would recommend it to any and everyone. While there are specific recommendations that some may have differing personal preferences/opinions on, there is no lack of research in their presentation and arguments (and it’s safe to say they would welcome the discourse of another perspective). I especially appreciated their inclusion of CBT and how that could be a beneficial practice for many to adopt, as well as parents and institutions to encourage and teach. Looking forward to anything else Haidt writes. "

Why are so many university campuses coming up against student demands to disinvite ""dangerous"" guest speakers, to penalize professors who propone unpopular opinions, and to dismiss any who threaten their conception of safety? This very insightful book discusses 3 great untruths of the ""IGen"" (the generation born after 1994, coinciding with the ubiquity of the iPhone): The Untruth of Fragility: What doesn’t kill you makes you weaker. The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: Always trust your feelings. The Untruth of Us Versus Them: Life is a battle between good people and evil people.It shows have parents and institutions have unwittingly taught youth these untruths, and have - with the best of intentions - coddled them to the point of handicapping their ability to handle the adult world. Within this framework, I gained some new insights into the reasons for our increasingly partisan political world.One thing I really like about The Coddling of the American Mind is that, unlike many books of this genre, it doesn't just rip down the system, telling us everything that's wrong with society, then leave us hopeless. Lukianoff and Haidt give pages of good, solid suggestions for how to correct the problems we have created. I would absolutely recommend this book to parents today, as well as to anyone in education or educational administration. It is quite bipartisan, but not afraid to point out problems on both side of the political spectrum. I already put the audiobook on hold for my husband!4.5 stars."

It was validating to read from a secular source of a different political affiliation than me the same identification of major problems I see in our culture/universities/media. Some problems I’d wholeheartedly agree with include, treating children & young adults as if they are fragile, assuming the worst about people who disagree with you, elevating “safetyism” as a top goal in life, tolerating a “call-out” culture that represses legitimate criticism and intimidates/shames people, and embracing identity politics. It was refreshing to read. The authors are sometimes too optimistic about what can bring about the turning of the ship, and sometimes they are too repetitive. Overall, I’d highly recommend the book to anyone working with iGen, any school and university administrators, and parents."

A couple of white dudes telling me that microaggressions aren't really a thing and impact over intent is wrong? Miss me with that.They are also obsessed with CBT and with attempting to prove its superiority over psychoanalysis. That's not why I picked up your book, guys."

297,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7743315-jeanne,4,"Education should not be intended to make people comfortable; it is meant to make them think. – Hanna Holborn GrayI look for books that are going to make me think, make me see things differently. Coddling of the American Mind did this. In brief, it is about three great Untruths that are affecting US universities and making them weaker: that we are protecting them from things that they see as dangerous, because – although there are good people, there are also evil ones. The great Untruths are:1. The Untruth of Fragility: What doesn’t kill you makes you weaker. 2. The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: Always trust your feelings. 3. The Untruth of Us Versus Them: Life is a battle between good people and evil people. (p. 4) Lukianoff and Haidt are provocative, but also good at bringing together diverse kinds of information together to help us recognize, as the subtitle goes, ""how good intentions and bad ideas are setting up a generation for failure.""For a book about the dichotomous and extreme thinking characterizing parenting, students, and the university system in the 21st century, Lukianoff and Haidt slip into dichotomous thinking. As do we all from time to time.We are in an age of helicopter parenting – even bulldozer parenting – where parents attempt to intervene with their college-aged children in a way that my daughters, frustratingly, would not allow me to do when they were in grade school. Rather than helping them, except in the short-term, this sort of parenting (and overscheduling, failing to allow or encourage free play, etc.) leaves students to becoming fragile, anxious, and easily hurt. Lukianoff and Haidt argue compellingly that college students should and must be exposed to viewpoint diversity, which will help them think more critically, understand diverse perspectives, and withstand events that would otherwise make them depressed and anxious. As the authors conclude, this means that we should beseeking out challenges (rather than eliminating or avoiding everything that “feels unsafe”), freeing yourself from cognitive distortions (rather than always trusting your initial feelings), and taking a generous view of other people, and looking for nuance (rather than assuming the worst about people within a simplistic us-versus-them morality). (p. 14)I appreciated Coddling of the American Mind, but I was often annoyed and irritated by it – which are not good outcomes for this time of year. Lukianoff and Haidt gathered interesting and often compelling threads, but I wasn't convinced by all of their evidence. Clearly, there is more anxiety and depression on campus than when I was in school, but that isn't necessarily a function of ""coddling,"" but of greater access on college campuses. Students who would not have been able to attend college 20 years ago can.While Lukianoff and Haidt criticize students' complaints about controversial and noncontroversial speakers (e.g., George Will, Bill Maher, Eric Holder, Madeleine Albright), I am less dismayed. I like that students are more likely to set limits about things that my generation accepted (e.g., #metoo).Current parenting practices, among many other things, have both strengths and weaknesses. Lukianoff and Haidt primarily focus on the downside here, but maybe we can look for some nuance and attempt to create a stronger model for the next generation of parents – and universities."
298,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3052770-teri,4,"This is an important read in today's society. This book is a look at the iGen generation that seems to be obsessed with technology and social media. The authors look at how ready access to news and social media affects attitudes and higher education. iGen students seem to be obsessed with protecting themselves against any other opinion than their own. They are less open to expanding their worldview and listening to opposing views to gain a broader understanding of today's society. This has led to students feeling ""unsafe"" when dealing with someone who does not share their views. Are they truly physically unsafe or are they just unable to process opposing views? Instead of engaging in open, civil debate or listening to gain understanding, students are sheltered and professors and administrators kowtow to students, offering special ""safe spaces,"" firing faculty who simply exercise their first amendment right, or even canceling guest speakers whose views are not shared with the majority of students. In essence, the authors suggest that we are coddling America's youth and young adults, sheltering them to the point that they are unable to process opinions and ideas that they do not identify with. The authors spend a lot of time discussing how technology and social media have affected current attitudes and lifestyles. Where once young kids would go out and play in the neighborhood, without constant adult supervision, they are today being watched by helicopter parents, suggesting that kids are being overprotected. Are we coddling the younger generations to the point that they are unable to psychologically handle uncomfortable positions? It is certainly worth thinking about and this book will open that discussion to consider if we are doing a disservice to our youth.I think this is a must-read for parents, teachers, and faculty of higher education. These are the children that will one day rule our nation. How will they handle our future?"
299,0735224897,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9955253-amy-foxy-blogs,0,"The Coddling of the American Mind  looks at the generation graduating college now and tries to see why they are so fragile emotionally. From the way, this generation of college students was raised to how schools handled shaping these young people. All of this has led to creating overprotected young adults who are taking longer to mature. The authors' intentions are to help future generations not need overprotection from society as they enter the real world and leave their family home. While kids are young they need the freedom to make mistakes and have those times used as a learning experience. Basically to sum it up let kids take risks while they're growing up. “Prepare your child for the road, not the road for your child.” "
