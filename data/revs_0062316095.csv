It will certainly not be the next A Brief History of Time, which is often named as the world's top unfinished popular bestseller.Both A Brief History of Time and Sapiens share a similar, worthy goal - to explain complex issues in a way which can actually be understood and comprehended by most people. Just as A Brief History... aimed at explaining cosmology to a lay audience, Sapiens aims to provide a readable and concise historical summary of the progress of human evolution - all in under 500 pages.Is this possible? Of course not - histories of individual countries often take up several volumes, and histories of entire civilizations and ultimately an entire specie would take up hundreds if not thousands of volumes. Because Harari's book is limited to just a single volume (and a relatively short one at that), he has to severely limit his scope to what he considers to be the biggest life-changing developments of our species, which essentially reduces it to a collection of trivia about these events. But that's not the true flaw of the book. Sapiens begins strong enough with a very interesting presentation of early human history and development of early human species, which culminated in the rise and eventual dominance of our own - the Homo Sapiens. However, the rest of the book consists largely of author's own musings and thoughts about the human condition and character - while some of these thoughts I find interesting and agreeable (such as our collective belief in the value of money), one thesis he that he put forward struck me as truly bizarre.Basically, Harari considers the agricultural revolution to be ""history's biggest fraud"", which instead of improvement left humans who settled down to farm worse off and more miserable than their nomadic, foraging ancestors. To prove his point, Harari waxes poetics about hunter-gatherers and their daily existence: they lived in egalitarian communes where property and love was freely shared, and were much more adept at survival in the wilderness than their descendants who plowed the fields. Hunter-gatherers had to have a much larger knowledge of their surroundings, and possessed vastly superior mental reflexes and physical dexterity which put future generations to shame. Although we have since gained vast knowledge as a collective, Harari argues that on the individual level ancient foragers were ""the most knowledgeable and skillful people in history"".For Harari, our foraging ancestors were not only mental and physical supermen, but also enjoyed a much more comfortable and rewarding lifestyle than all the subsequent peasants, workers and office clerks. They worked fewer hours and since they had no homes, they also had no household chores; this allowed for plenty of free time to play with one another, tell stories and just hang out. Since foraging necessitated exploration, it also provided plenty of adventure: what better thing to do than explore new places to look for cool plants and other edible things? Because they were always on the move and therefore not dependent on a single source of food, hunter-gatherers enjoyed a superior, multi-nutrient diet and were less likely to suffer from hunger and starvation than subsequent agricultural societies, which often depended on a single crop, and not only were receiving much less nutrients but also suffered heavily from famines when their food source failed. Farming? Bah! Humbug.True, there were some drawbacks, Harari reluctantly agrees. Although some lucky souls made it longer, life expectancy averaged only 30 to 40 years. Children dropped dead like flies, and sometimes wild tigers came out of the bushes and ate you and your whole family and tribe. Not to mention that sometimes you and your band wandered and wandered, and the food simply wasn't there. Or even worse - the food was there, but so was another tribe which was not exactly keen on sharing their already limited supply. What about this? ""It would be a mistake to idealize the lives of these ancients"", says the author, though I do not really understand why, since this is exactly what he appeared to be doing, ""though they lived better lives than most people in agricultural and industrial societies, their world could still be harsh and unforgiving."" Ain't that the truth. Sometimes, life is just hard. Rocks fall, everyone dies. But agricultural revolution? It sucked, Harari argues. First, he has unnamed (and presumably fictitious) scholars proclaim the development of agriculture as ""a great leap forward for humanity"", which ""produced ever more intelligent people(...)able to decipher nature’s secrets"". But this is not true - ""there is no evidence that people became more intelligent with time"", he says, as ""foragers knew the secrets of nature long before the Agricultural Revolution, since their survival depended on an intimate knowledge of the animals they hunted and the plants they gathered"". As I mentioned above, Harari states that agricultural revolution made things worse for farmers - it robbed them from excitement of hunting and gathering by forcing them to settle down next to their fields and perform menial farm work, which strained our joints and spine. Although farming provided a surplus of food it did not provide the farmer with a better diet, robbing us of the diversity of meals experienced by a hunter-gatherer. Farming also failed to provide us with economic security - crops can always fail and lead to hunger, whereas hunter-gatherers can always move on and hunt for other types of food (unless, of course, they do not find any and starve to death). Farmers also had to stay and defend their land if attacked by a hostile group, whereas foragers could always escape to another area, look for food there, and survive (they could, of course, end up not being able to escape -who can fight or run on an empty stomach? - or...not find any food, and starve to death).So, what exactly has agriculture ever done for us? Since it has taken so much not only from our fathers but also from from our fathers' fathers, what has it ever given us in return? The aqueduct? Sanitation? Wine? And why have humans not returned to hunting and gathering but stubbornly toiled their fields and broke their miserable backs, while they could be climbing trees and camping in the wilderness? The answer is simple: more food allowed women to have children more often, and even though they still died fairly often this time births outpaced deaths several times. Village population increased, and soon entire generations of people no longer remembered the good old days of running in the forests and looking for berries. ""The trap"", Harari writes, ""was shut"".He goes on to say: ""Since our affluence and security are built on foundations laid by the Agricultural Revolution, we assume that the Agricultural Revolution was a wonderful improvement"".Yet, we are wrong in thinking this, because ""it is wrong to judge thousands of years of history from the perspective of today"" (though apparently not when it comes to foraging, which was a blast by all accounts - that is, the author's). Harari neglects to mention the exact reason why the agricultural revolution took place - farming first arose in places where hunting and gathering was no longer possible, and in the long run prevailed as the better option. Hunter-gatherers simply did not choose to one day walk out of the woods and start domesticating animals and plants; they were forced to do that because the environment they were living no longer allowed for foraging to remain a viable option. The Younger Dryas interval in ancient Levant is often linked to the adoption of agriculture in the region, as an example of the first deliberate cultivation of plants. People understood that seeds developed into plants at the time when they desperately needed to increase their food supply in order to survive, and linked one with the other.It is interesting that Harari does not only romanticize hunting and gathering, but actually looks at the agricultural revolution and its impact from a perspective of a hunter and gatherer - that is, focusing on the thing that mattered most to our foraging ancient ancestors: food. Hunter-gatherers spend their lives pursuing food; as Harari admits, because of their nomadic lifestyle they had very few possessions, as they were constantly moving around in search for food to sustain them. Food was their driving force; their lives centered around food, as they never had a steady supply of it and always had to hunt and look for more if they were to survive. In contrast, agricultural revolution provided humans with a steady and regular supply of food, and or the first time in our history allowed humans to take our minds off food and constant travel. The impact of this is monumental and cannot be stressed enough. Basically, without agricultural revolution, our knowledge would be stagnant - as we would simply not have the luxury of time to develop it. Food surplus and settling down allowed humans to think more and develop new ideas and technologies, allowing for more efficient farming - which in turn allowed for more time to think and develop even more ideas and technologies. In contrast to general knowledge of our forager ancestors, surplus of food and settler lifestyle allowed for skill specialization, which in turn allowed us to do things beyond their wildest dreams, and become technologically advanced. Basically, I would argue that societies comprised of hunter-gatherers cannot advance and live up to the full human potential - it is impossible to have a truly technologically advanced nomadic society, while it is possible to have a technologically advanced settler society which is able to send some of its members into the world as hunter-gatherers. To put it very simply: hunter-gatherers live in the wilderness, living day to day on what they find or hunt down, while agriculturists discover penicillin, split the atom and fly into space.Although the author later brings up valid concerns about our treatment of animals and abuse of collective power, his rant against agriculture is truly bizarre considering that without it he would not be able to write this very book. It's as if he disregarded the very Sapiens which he aimed to describe, and which has defied his thesis by abandoning hunting and gathering to settle down and farm. Still, there are good parts and certain valuable and interesting insights in this book - it's just a shame that it's tainted with such a weird and contrived chapter."
1,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4684009-william2,2,"This book is a superficial gloss on human history. Nice try but it excludes too much data in favor of an overarching conceptual view to be deeply interesting. Stopped reading for reasons detailed below at p. 304 of 416.Considering the outlandishness of some of its claims—the downside of the Agricultural Revolution, the joys of Empire—the book seems weirdly under-sourced. The bibliography is beyond meagre. Don't get me wrong, I like a little informed speculation as much as anyone. Take for example the claim that houses, their advent, ""became the psychological hallmark of a much more self-centered creature."" (p. 99) I, for one, would be delighted to know how one can discern the psychology of someone who lived more than 9,000 years ago. The apparently relevant note cited is ""2 Robert B. Marks, The Origins of the Modern World: A Global and Ecological Narrative"". But when one looks up Mr. Marks' book one sees that it pertains only to the 15th to the 21st centuries CE.Another thing, the book seems all biological determinism—and we know what that sort of thinking led to: the Konzentrationslager. The life of the mind is nothing here, the intellect nothing, all because it has no discernible basis in biology—so reductive and materialist, too. I'm hoping this is just a rhetorical device. Please, let it be. Moreover, the author cherishes a certain sneering and glib tone which I find annoying. Well, yes, now he's changing his tune, isn't he? But not before thoroughly pissing me off. Was that necessary? Ah, now he's starting to celebrate the very social constructs—the law, the state, joint stock corporations, etc.—that he so glibly belittled as ""imaginary myths"" a few pages back. So his earlier arguments were disingenuous. That's not something I prize in a writer. Notwithstanding the questionable attempt to raise the reader's hackles, just mentioned, I find myself on p. 170 and 95% of this is material I already know. Granted, the author tries to package it as felicitously as possible, but it's still stuff I know and, no doubt, material my well read GR friends will also know. What I had hoped for on cracking this formidable spine was something far more intellectually challenging, like Naipaul. Still, I find myself nursing a hope that this is just an overly long introduction to a thrilling thesis. At the same time I fear it will turn out to be another tedious read for a far less learned general reader than myself. Am I overqualified for this book? Trepidation abounds. 2.0 stars so far, inauspicious. Meh. It's really an undergraduate survey course, if that. It's a great review of common knowledge that seeks to find new linkages and epiphanies. It sometimes works. But often the linkages are specious. As when he terms liberal humanism a religion. It isn't, though it's a neat shorthand for his minimalist theories. Now I'm reading about how religions are unifiers. The author certainly has a flair for the obvious, I'll say that much. Here's an example of author Harari's reductiveness, which is inevitable in a book skirting so many vast subjects. On p. 232 we read: ""The Aryan race therefore had the potential to turn man into superman."" Nietzsche is nowhere mentioned. The statement is wholly lacking in context—the Nazis are glossed but that's all. It really doesn't make coherent sense. Gloss, that's the word that best describes this book. A gloss.The writer is careless with metaphors. We're told that cultures are ""mental parasites,"" that ""history disregards the happiness of individuals"" and that ""history made its most momentous choice."" (p. 243-244). To say such things is to give agency to the non-sentient and adds to the narrative's by now utterly grating superficiality. Here's yet another bizarro statement:Had the Aztecs and Incas shown a bit more interest in the world surrounding them – and had they known what the Spaniards had done to their neighbors – they might have resisted the Spanish conquest more keenly and successfully. (p.292)Nonsense. The Spaniards had guns, germs and steel. Reread Jared Diamond and William H. Prescott, Mr. Harari. Foreknowledge would have availed the indigenous peoples little or nothing. The author goes on to admit as much in the paragraphs to follow, but why then wasn't that earlier sentence cut? But it gets better: If the subject peoples of the Inca Empire had known the fates of the inhabitants of Mexico, they would not have thrown in their lot with the invaders. But they did not now....[Thus] the native peoples of America...[paid] a heavy price for their parochial outlook.It's astonishing the author should use that ecclesiastical word. For what was the ostensible motivation of the conquerors but the glory of Christendom. Harari is blaming the victims. The world view of the Aztecs and Incas and others was limited. Harari blames them because they had not yet advanced beyond that basic if incomplete awareness. He then goes on to excoriate all of Asia and Africa for not having had the wherewithal to explore the world and conquer others. But these are cultural predilections, not standardized goals applicable to all. This leads to an unseemly West is the Best argument that's right out of Niall Ferguson's Empire: The Rise and Demise of the British World Order. Is this book popular because it essentially functions as the West's cheering section? It's lovely we have developed science and technology and historiography etc. I'm glad I live in the West. But it's absurd to say that earlier cultures, because they did not develop in a timely manner our own particular brand of curiosity, were deficient. All cultures are blood soaked, our own included. The world is only what it is, not some counter-factual supposition."

Is there anything more dangerous than dissatisfied and irresponsible gods who don't know what they want?
What a fantastic book. I can see why everyone from Bill Gates to Barack Obama was raving about it. It's an extremely compelling, accessible history - almost like a novelization - of humankind.I've read a few of these ""brief history of the world"" books, most notably  A History of the World in 100 Objects and Bryson's  A Short History of Nearly Everything. I liked both, but neither is as engaging as this book. Also, Harari's book stays vague on the physics, dinosaurs and such, unlike Bryson's work, making this not so much about the whole universe, but specifically about humans. Or, I should clarify, homo sapiens.Most of all, I like how easy to digest the author makes all this information. I have a lot of respect for authors who can present something complex in simple terms. I've always liked the quote attributed to Einstein “If You Can’t Explain it to a Six Year Old, You Don’t Understand it Yourself”. Anyone with a thesaurus can make something seem more dense and complicated than it is; it's much harder to explain something long and complicated in a way that everyone can enjoy.And it does read like a really exciting and fascinating novel. Harari takes us through the history of human development and migration, through the Cognitive Revolution (view spoiler)[a sudden increase in cognitive ability around 70,000 years ago, not the 1950s intellectual movement (hide spoiler)] and Agricultural Revolution. He looks at how currency and coinage developed, the creation of religions, the arrival of imperialism and capitalism, and the history of inequalities and injustices.I especially like how he presents a relatively unbiased view of events. He focuses on what we know, and is quick to say when something remains a mystery to biologists and anthropologists. When there are conflicting theories, he outlines all the main ones. The only agenda Hariri seems driven by is a desire to present the most accurate view of humanity's history.This book filled me with a sense of wonder. Wonder at how far we've come in just a few millennia; wonder at all the twisting roads of history; wonder at where we could possibly end up. The final chapters of the book take a peek at the future's possibility, making me even more excited (and a little scared) to read  Homo Deus.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube"

But this book was something else. Beautifully written and easy to read, this book just made me want to know more and more about how the author thinks the world evolved to what it is today. Revolution by revolution, religion by religion, conception by conception, things were simplified and yet still maintained valid points - and it was never boring.The best thing about it was that it actually made me think.The author doesn't treat you as ignorant at all - he doesn't assume you know nothing but assume you know a lot and understand a lot, and doesn't lecture about anything, and that attitude makes the book a pleasure to read.Just read it."

But I didn’t stop. I kept reading, . . . until it got so bad, I found myself unable to do more than skim, and eventually, to just skipping large chunks.It starts out as a fascinating discussion of the development and rise of our species, homo sapiens. But starting in the second section on the Agricultural Revolution, Harari shift gears and drops any pretense of an scholarly work. From that point on, it’s all personal bias all the time. This guy absolutely hates human beings and society. It seems that he is completely stuck in the idea that the world would have been better off had humanity simply stayed put in the hunter-gatherer stage.It seems all the countless billions of humans who lived since then are deluded and don't get it, and that only he understands. Yeah, right!OK. There are worse sins than personal bias. Many great writers have it and let it show. But unlike Harari, the good ones work to try to justify the positions they take. Harari, on the other hand just bombards readers with one opinion after another and treats them as proven fact, even though what he says is often debatable or out and out wrong. That’s one of the reasons I gave up on a close reading as I progressed into the second half. Even when it seemed as if Harari was selling me something I didn’t know (which did not occur often), I simply did not trust him. An author can choose to forego many things. Credibility and trust are not among them.Perhaps the best way to illustrate this mess is through a conversation I once had among people who liked to discuss philosophy. Somehow or other, though, this conversation veered off into a set of irritating rants on how western society sucks. The thing that sticks out most in my memory is how the host went off on a diatribe about the greatness of nature and Native Americans and about how he was fine being a non-vegetarian because the cows understood human need for meat and were happy to offer themselves as a precious spiritual gift to humanity. My reply: “That conclusion is based on interviews with how many cows?” The conversation abruptly ended. That is exactly the way I reacted to the self-serving gibberish offered by Harari under the guise of scholarly presentation. "
6,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,4,"I see many people complaining about the wild leaps of logic and the lack of footnotes - but honestly, what did you expect in a 500 page book, not even with small print, that's supposed to give you a summary of all history from the emergence of Homo sapiens to the present day? Personally, I thought the basic idea was terrific: the author has taken it upon himself to defend the Book of Genesis and show you that it's all true. I have seen creationists attempt the same thing and fail miserably, with their pseudo-scientific explanations of why the Earth is actually six thousand years old, how the Flood explains geology, etc. None of this nonsense for clever Dr Harari. He doesn't bother arguing about the places where science has obviously got it right (the Big Bang, plate tectonics, evolution), but takes them as givens. He doesn't get into the tangled reasoning about where a Creator might come into the picture; here, there is none. Instead, he cuts to the chase and gives you a story that's actually very interesting. About ten thousand years ago, people largely stopped being hunter-gatherers and started being farmers. This is usually presented by modern commentators as a Good Thing. But in Genesis, it isn't: we are expelled from the Garden of Eden and forced to eke out a miserable existence tilling the unforgiving soil, and now we have to live with the consequences. We have had the presumption to eat the fruit of the Tree so that we may become as gods, knowing good and evil. Harari ingeniously defends the idea that this, more or less literally, is what happened. We became farmers, then we started developing better technology, then we constructed cities, and finally, very recently, we invented science. We have made the most of our position as lords of creation, driving many species extinct and turning a few others into efficient machines for producing meat. But none of this has made us happier. In fact, as the Bible says, it's made us more and more miserable. We're evolutionarily adapted for being hunter-gatherers, not software engineers or stock traders. We are on the verge of learning how to conquer death and make ourselves immortal: but even then, we won't be as happy as we were back in the Garden. We'll more likely find new and even worse ways to cut ourselves off from our true heritage.Harari takes the position that our great strength as a species, the thing that sets us apart from all other living beings, is our ability to make up stories about things that are only to be found in our imaginations, and then treat them as though they were real; by this process, they become real. As he points out, empires and religions and money don't actually exist, but now they rule our lives. He's particularly interesting on the subject of money. Again, I can see some readers who dislike what they call his cheerleading for modern Western society. I don't think Harari is a fan of the West, and the book is in my humble opinion not Eurocentric at all; for example, Harari seems to like Buddhism rather more than Christianity. He's just pointing out the indisputable fact that Western society has taken over the world, and he ascribes that, more than anything else, to the West's ability to make up a better story about money, which we call capitalism. If this is where you're coming from, talking about the power of myth to transform human existence, you don't go overboard with the footnotes. There are no footnotes in the Bible. You do your best to tell a great story, and you hope that it will transform our existence.I think Harari's done pretty well here in terms of achieving those goals. Kudos.[I also have a frivolous review of the book here.]"

Here we go with the review. Prepare your tomatoes and raw eggs (someone actually threw a raw egg at me once for fun but it bounced from my bum )Sapiens’ beginning was fantastic. I loved the author’s voice and the information about the early days of the human kind was fascinating. I did not read any non-fiction about the origin of humans so I was excited to understand our origins better. I could not stop highlighting interesting passages to include in my review or to read later. Here are some of the ones that picked my interest.“It’s relatively easy to agree that only Homo sapiens can speak about things that don’t really exist, and believe six impossible things before breakfast. You could never convince a monkey to give you a banana by promising him limitless bananas after death in monkey heaven.”“Telling effective stories is not easy. The difficulty lies not in telling the story, but in convincing everyone else to believe it. Much of history revolves around this question: how does one convince millions of people to believe particular stories about gods, or nations, or limited liability companies? Yet when it succeeds, it gives Sapiens immense power, because it enables millions of strangers to cooperate and work towards common goals.”However, everything started to go downhill from somewhere in the middle of Part II. From an eager and excited reader I slowly became pissed off, disappointed and struggled to finish. I had several problems that plagued my reading experience and I plan to exemplify them below. First of all, I soon grew tired of the author’s ironic and condescending humor. His ego was transpiring from all his words and his personal opinions and the way he tried to enforce them annoyed me more and more. Secondly, I felt like many of his assumptions and extrapolations had no proof and they only represent the author’s personal opinion. For example, the way he supported for the whole book that humans were better of as hunter-gathers without bringing no real arguments to support his opinion.Finally, I had a problem with the scope of Sapiens. As the titles suggests, the book tries to be A Brief History of Humankind. I believe he did not succeed very well to do that and the reason is that it is quite impossible to do what the author planned in less than 500 pages. The task is too vast. The result is mix of everything with no structure, jumping from one subject to another and confusing the reader. The information was too vague, too general, it all resembled a set of interesting trivia.When reading other negative reviews of Sapiens I stumbled repeatedly on a recommendation: Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies. The book was already on my TBR so it is going to be the next read on the subject. I hope it will be better."
8,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48483884-michael-finocchiaro,2,"History and Sociology for Dummies, this book is almost irrecoverably watered down intellectually. [and for all those commenters that think I am calling them dummies, I am simply referring to the popular XXX For Dummies books and I am not intentionally insulting folks that enjoyed the book.] Sapiens does make some interesting points and probably opens a few debates, but it disappointed me. There are lots of soundbites here, especially the oft-quoted one about the agricultural revolution being ""history's greatest ripoff"", but they remain soundbites because they never really reach a conclusion. The book starts out alright was the hunter-gatherer civilizations are discussed in some detail and without focusing exclusively on North America, Europe, and the Middle East. Harari's chapters here did make for decent reading about the concept the author calls the cognitive revolution which separates us from other animals. Unfortunately, the next section about the agricultural revolution is a bit too polemical. Yes, it was a radical change and yes it did lead to new problems (disease, famine, etc), but without it, the human species would likely have never evolved to the point of me typing this text on my laptop and you reading it in a browser. There are not parallel paths proposed, just a vague condemnation of agriculture before he takes on the subject of religions. Here, he talks of the evolution of monotheism from the polytheistic systems that abounded before. I felt he did not discuss in sufficient death the animist systems (which still dominate Africa, South America, and the Arctic among others.) He seems to favor Buddhism (the pages there have a much more tolerant and fawning tone than those of the other religions) which seemed a little intellectually dishonest to me - I mean if he is trying to develop a dispassionate argument about how religions develop, he should not take a particular position without announcing it first. Anyway, after this, the book covers the industrial revolution and brings us up to modern times. Honestly, I felt that the end of the book really soured the whole product for me. Well, I was already annoyed with all the cute phrases and the prolific use of ""!"" at the end of 20% of the sentences (OK, I am exaggerating but seriously, a ""history"" book shouldn't use the exclamation point says the snob reviewer). But when the author sets up an argument about where we should be headed as a human race, he then goes off on bizarre tangents about cyber technology and refers to an obscure Project Gilgamesh (which unless I missed something major earlier in the book, he never mentioned before). I felt that the last chapter just came out of nowhere and made absolutely no sense. Perhaps, as other reviews here on GR have suspected, no one actually reads this book, preferring to leave it unsullied on their coffee table as a prop to their showoff intellectualism. In any case, it didn't do it for me.Unfortunately, my in-laws who bought me Sapiens also bought me the sequel so I suppose I will be guilted into reading it at some point. In conclusion, I prefer reading REAL history books with caffeine rather than this decaffeinated, saccharin substitute for them. I would highly suggest the more factual and far less polemical Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies which deals with a similar topic, but without the excessive punctuation (!).I am not alone in my disdain for this over-publicized waste of trees. A friend passed me this article: https://www.thenewatlantis.com/public... in which the author concludes: ""But Sapiens provides us with no resources for answering questions about the moral implications of scientific and technological change. A commitment to a reductionist, mechanistic view of Homo sapiens may give us some insight into some of the aspects of our past most tied to our material nature. But Harari’s view of culture and of ethical norms as fundamentally fictional makes impossible any coherent moral framework for thinking about and shaping our future. And it asks us to pretend that we are not what we know ourselves to be — thinking and feeling subjects, moral agents with free will, and social beings whose culture builds upon the facts of the physical world but is not limited to them.""This book is waaaaay overrated.As an aside, I wanted to briefly talk compare The Overstory and The Hidden Life of Trees: What They Feel, How They Communicate – Discoveries from a Secret World with this book. In the Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, the author bemoans the wanton destruction caused by the agricultural revolution, but to my mind proposes no alternative and just leaves the reader with empty, vacuous soundbites. In the former two books, we are given a vast insight into how trees communicate and how they are intimately related to human beings. Yes, our ignorance of their speech (as alien to us as would be expected because our life spans and perception of time is on the same magnitude as that of flies to humans) has caused irreparable damage to the ecosystem. And there is an obvious domino effect: global warming and climate change. But, in the two books about trees, even if a militant outlook is shown to be a dead-end, it is demonstrated that being custodians of nature, we can help forests come back and preserve our biodiversity. It is not all of humankind that is to blame, as Harari would have us believe, but rather, rapacious grift driving large corporations which reap a direct, short-term financial benefit from wholesale environmental destruction. If the law was enforced rather than trampled upon, the jobs could be converted to conservation-related jobs and the forests could be preserved. I found that this positive message was stronger than any of the superficial aphorisms in Harari's book."
9,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17744555-blackoxford,5,"Choose Your Fictions CarefullyThere are far too many fascinating assertions in this book to even mention. But for me the most fascinating is Harari’s idea of the Cognitive Revolution which took place about 70,000 years ago. ""We might call it the Tree of Knowledge mutation. Why did it occur in Sapiens DNA rather than in that of Neanderthals? It was a matter of pure chance, as far as we can tell. But it’s more important to understand the consequences of the Tree of Knowledge mutation than its causes.""It is this mysterious, and as yet unexplained, change in human genetics that he pinpoints as the primary reason for the ultimate success of the species Homo Sapiens in competition not just with established flora and fauna but with other human forms. Interestingly, Harari’s argument also establishes the anthropological foundations for literary post-modernism.To over-simplify, but not by much, the Cognitive Revolution of Sapiens is precisely the ability to tell, and eventually read and write, stories, that is, fictional narratives which are interesting, entertaining, and above all convincing. This ability, an evolutionary enigma because it does not give obviously immediate advantage, underlies human ability to organize beyond very small units, to cooperate in matters of survival, and to prevail against competing species which are stronger, quicker, better adapted to the environment, able to speak in a more varied manner, and even more clever.These narratives, according to the narrative told by Harari, begin in gossip, talk among ourselves about ourselves, which is a behaviour that is now as far as anyone knows unique to Homo Sapiens, and may even have even been unique among others of the genus Homo. Gossip leads to shared tales about common experiences, ancestors, and problems. These tales evolve into myths which are widely shared and identify large groups as ‘us’. ""There are no gods in the universe, no nations, no money, no human rights, no laws and no justice outside the common imagination of human beings.""Such tales incrementally employ an increasing lexicon of fictional, that is to say abstract, ideas. It is these ideas which allow the ultimate success of Sapiens, not necessarily because of their pragmatic qualities, but because, whatever they are, they are shared: “Myths, it transpired, are stronger than anyone could have imagined. When the Agricultural Revolution opened opportunities for the creation of crowded cities and mighty empires, people invented stories about great gods, motherlands and joint stock companies to provide the needed social links. While human evolution was crawling at its usual snail’s pace, the human imagination was building astounding networks of mass cooperation, unlike any other ever seen on earth.”As modern existential and linguistic philosophers have thought for some time, these ideas - scientific, religious, technological, social, legal - are fundamental fictions that become progressively indistinguishable from the ‘natural’ world which is apart from the imagined world of language. As Harari states what is a reiteration of this philosophical conclusion: “Three main factors prevent people from realising that the order organising their lives exists only in their imagination:... a. The imagined order is embedded in the material world... b. The imagined order shapes our desires... c. The imagined order is inter-subjective.”It is this invisibility of these linguistic fictions which constitute daily life that is both the greatest strength and greatest flaw of our species. We are able to organise ourselves, because of them, to travel to the Moon. We are also able to believe a half dozen untruths before breakfast. The internet is perhaps the best example of the paradox of our fraught existence since it promotes both cooperation and mass deceit. For me the implications are clear: 1) literature is the only hope for the world. Fiction - novels, fairy tales, fantasies, and lots of 'em - are the only means to get a grip on reality. Reading lots of fiction developes the aesthetic sense. And it is only through aesthetics that one can decide what is important and how to deal with what is important. 2) It is also clear to me that novels cultivated our species genetically over millennia for this very reason - to get us better at reading them.Postscript: For a rather plausible opposing view to Harari’s, see: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show..."

We have advanced from canoes to galleys to steamships to space shuttles – but nobody knows where we’re going. We are more powerful than ever before, but have very little idea what to do with all that power. Worse still, humans seem to be more irresponsible than ever. Self-made gods with only the laws of physics to keep us company, we are accountable to no one. We are consequently wreaking havoc on our fellow animals and on the surrounding ecosystem, seeking little more than our own comfort and amusement, yet never finding satisfaction.”

Cave of the Hands. Cueva de las manos in Argentina. The art in this cave dates from 13,000 to 9,000 years ago. I find this photograph to be very emotional to think about because this band of Humans are saying...we were here.The pursuit of happiness is one of the many big themes that Yuval Noah Harari covers in this remarkable book about the history of Homo Sapiens. He brings us from the beginning of our known history to the present and offers his interpretations and evaluations of our conduct along the way. There are many points in the book where he crystallized my thinking about a subject, and there are several other points where he encouraged me to think about what I know in different ways. Since taking myself out of the rat race, I’ve had a lot of time to ponder exactly what I was trying to accomplish for the 30+ years I pursued money and career advancement. Now, I want to make sure with what time I have left to spend it pursuing something much more meaningful and satisfying than the pursuit of more and more money. This book will make you uncomfortable. You may disagree with some of his conclusions, but do not use that as an excuse to not read the book. He will also enlighten you on other points that very well may help shape your personal philosophy. I have been thinking about reading the book for some time, but what convinced me was all the one star reviews for the book on Amazon. It was quickly apparent to me that most of those reviews were written by religious people who never read the book but were told they should be offended by it because of his opinions on religion. He doesn’t just believe that Christianity is a fabricated construct, but also thinks that nationalism and a whole host of other -isms are as well. ”How do you cause people to believe in an imagined order such as Christianity, democracy or capitalism?”Or how about this one?”It may well be that we’d all be better off if Christianity and Islam had been forgotten or defeated.”Why did Constantine the Great pick Christianity as the religion of the empire? We really don’t know. It was far from a dominant religion at the time. Harari compares it to a POTUS waking up one morning and deciding that the Hare Krishnas are the national religion. It is hard to fathom that it was a moment of altruism. He was an intelligent man and must have felt that Christianity offered the best way to better control his people and unite them under one concept, instead of the host of gods that polytheism offered. I come away from this book realizing how deeply brainwashed I’ve been about a whole host of issues, and I have been remiss in not questioning more of the foundations of thought or intent behind most of my long held beliefs. The big revelatory moment for me was when he talked about individualism. ”The state and the market approached people with an offer that could not be refused. ‘Become individuals,’ they said. ‘Marry whomever you desire, without asking permission from your parents. Take up whatever job suits you, even if community elders frown. Live wherever you wish, even if you cannot make it every week to the family dinner. You are no longer dependent on your family or your community. We, the state and the market, will take care of you instead. We will provide food, shelter, education, health, welfare and employment. We will provide pensions, insurance and protection.’ Romantic literature often presents the individual as somebody caught in a struggle against the state and the market. Nothing could be further from the truth. The state and the market are the mother and father of the individual, and the individual can survive only thanks to them.”How often do we hear the term “stand on your own two feet?” Or “pull yourself up by your own bootstraps?” Looking for help from others in current culture is seen as a sign of weakness. Standing as individuals has made us weaker, not stronger. We are accused of a form of co-dependency if we are too attached to our extended family or our friends. I’d never really thought about how being individualistic was actually helping the powers-that-be to exert more control us. We are experiencing a great divide in politics, and many of my friends have already decided they won’t be going home for the holidays. We used to be able to set disagreements aside and focus on what we do agree on, like...baseball or reading books or the weather, but now politics has become such a defining part of our lives that we feel like those who disagree with us are actually immoral. Have all these technological advances made us happier? To a degree yes, but also very unhappy in other aspects. The demands on our attention are more immediate and all consuming. Even when we relax, we are not really relaxed. Faster and more efficient doesn’t necessarily equate to making anyone, but the people making the enormous amounts of money at the top, any happier. ”Nothing in the comfortable lives of the urban middle class can approach the wild excitement and sheer joy experienced by a forager band on a successful mammoth hunt. Every new invention just puts another mile between us and the Garden of Eden.”I made 62 highlights reading this book, which is an all-time record for me. I could have had even more! Harari gave me so much to ponder and consider that I’ve already decided that in a few years I’m going to reread the book. I borrowed the book from the library, but I already know I will need to own this one because a book like this needs to be readily available to help me better explain my own thoughts. I could have written a review as long as the book itself because there are so many assertions in this book that cause the mind to expand and make new connections across a myriad of subject matters. It is the most important book I’ve read in a long time. I hope it will be for many of you as well. We are gods on this planet, and we need to change our view of how we see ourselves in the context of the planet and the future. ”Is there anything more dangerous than dissatisfied and irresponsible gods who don’t know what they want?”If you wish to see more of my most recent book and movie reviews, visit http://www.jeffreykeeten.comI also have a Facebook blogger page at:https://www.facebook.com/JeffreyKeeten"
11,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27788046-sean-barrs,4,"This is a hugely ambitious book; it takes a very broad approach, condensing huge topics into short chapters in an attempt to provide a basis for the development of our entire species. The parts I found most interesting were regarding ecology and man’s interaction with the ecosystem. Human history is that of ecological disaster. Wherever we go, whatever we do, we fuck up the ecosystem and leave our mark of destruction. This is not a new phenomenon, it’s something Sapiens have always done. When we developed our massive brain, we came up with new and creative ways to dominate and control our environments and these were often destructive and to the detriment of all other forms of life. We learnt to survive. We learnt to thrive. But the price was paid with the extinction of many other species.Harari writes that man is so far removed from his natural self. Despite the modern world he lives in, he still has his innate biological drives and instincts (as governed by our genetic makeup) and when these aren’t fulfilled (which they never could be in a metropolis) man becomes depressed and isolated. It’s because we jumped to the top of the food chain and the ecological system was not given time to adjust and neither was man’s biology. These things normally take a millennium, not a few centuries. We still have the same bodies (and instincts) of our ancient kin and it does not meet the environment we live in. This occurred because of three major revolutions in human history. The first was the cognitive revolution which allowed for the creation of language, effectively setting us above all other forms of life in terms of intelligence. The second was the agricultural revolution, which allowed us to harvest the earth and control it to meet our dietary needs. The third was the scientific revolution, which allowed us to take the first steps in understanding life and the universe and use the discoveries to benefit humankind and industry. Harari narrates all these monumental events with much detail, though because of the nature of the book he does fall into generalisations, but I didn't mind too much. There were also quite a few funny comments to offset it:
“You could never convince a monkey to give you a banana by promising him limitless bananas after death in monkey heaven.” 
And through this he also raises many questions. What would have happened if the other species of human had survived? Would we be at harmony? What religions, science and art could the other species of human’s developed had they the opportunity to flourish like we did? These are such interesting questions, and ripe material for a science fiction novel exploring such ideas. I’m sure someone has written one about it somewhere. So this was a great read, full of interesting facts and ideas, with the potential to change how you view the human race and its history. "
12,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-x,4,"The book was too much a basic primer for me, at least to start with, but that's probably because I've read too many books on our origins biologically and culturally. Once the author had us settled into the civilization of cities he waxed romantically (as authors on this subject quite often do) on the life of the hunter gatherer and its perfection. (I've just finished Sebastian Junger's Tribe: On Homecoming and Belonging and there was more of that.) If it was all so perfect then more of us would return to that ancient life style where people had more leisure, freedom and happiness according to Harari and Junger, neither of whom have given up their miserable materialistic lives for stalking around with a spear. The book got better. There were some good explanations of why we are as we are and how things developed, Such as human conversation evolving (see below) so we could gossip about our fellow tribes people. I didn't always agree with the author. But I always enjoy books like that to some extent because it gives me a different point of view, different reasons and things to think about. So this was good. But then it dragged at the end as the author got preachy and scifi technological about our bionic futures. At some time not in the unimaginable future, robots will think for themselves and be able to feel, and then they will supercede us... Yes well Asimov covered all that more than half a century ago. It's not going to happen we are too complex to duplicate. And anyway I can't see robots gossiping and if they don't do that what have they got to talk about (view spoiler)[the weather I suppose, if they were British robots. (hide spoiler)] that will make them 'human'? If the desire to gossip gave us speech, then the inability to gossip puts us right back into the pre-sapiens world. Robots are retrogression. Bionic bodies though, that might be progress._________Written on reading the book. According to the author, basic vocal communication was solved by the primates. And although animals aren't supposed to have theory of mind, green monkeys have been heard calling 'beware there's a lion' when there's no such thing, they just don't want to risk losing or having to share food they've just found.Human conversation apparently evolved so we could gossip. As a social animal, we need to know whose screwing who, who ripped off who, and who lives in a really disgusting midden. Maybe the author's right. He also says that we are not a tolerant species. He got that right for true."

When Captain America says so, you listen.It’s been almost three years since I joined Goodreads and this is literally the second non-fiction book I finished reading. The last time I read a non-fiction book was in December 2016, it was an autobiography titled In Order to Live by Yeonmi Park. Anyone who knows my reading taste should know that I don’t read non-fiction, not only I found the majority of them to be boring, the main reason behind why I read is escapism and the best genre to offer me the best escapism experience lies in SFF. I don’t even know how to rate and review this book because it always made me feels awkward to give a rating to a non-fiction work, especially if it’s an autobiography, which luckily this book is not. Please remember that my rating—as always—speaks mostly for my reading enjoyment, not the technicality of the book.

“Nothing captures the biological argument better than the famous New Age slogan: ‘Happiness begins within.’ Money, social status, plastic surgery, beautiful houses, powerful positions – none of these will bring you happiness. Lasting happiness comes only from serotonin, dopamine and oxytocin.” 

Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind by Yuval Noah Harari is exactly what the title claimed to be. Harari did a spectacular job in compressing important moments—which are HUGE—of our history into this book. I’ve heard so many incredible things about it but never gotten around to it because I thought I would be bored with it, this book, however, proves to be incredibly enlightening and engaging than I thought it would be. There are way too many topics of discussion to unpack in a single review for me, Harari elaborated on how humanity became the most powerful race, the insane power in collective belief, money, war, advancements of technology, religions, and many more important topics.

“Money is the most universal and most efficient system of mutual trust ever devised.” 

A huge part of why I found this book to be not as factual as I expected. Don’t get me wrong, Harari provided tons of facts and well-researched notes, but the author’s belief and opinion definitely bleeds into the text. This isn’t particularly a problem for me; I found it highly intriguing to read his perspective on humanity and our history. In general, I like to understand why people act or think the way they do about something and Harari explained his reasonings. Obviously, there were some of his opinions that I agree with, some that I don’t. However, I never found the book to be preachy, his combination of knowledge, facts, and opinion made me think about our society these days. Plus, I doubt that this book would’ve been compelling for me to read if it were all pure facts and data.

“How many young college graduates have taken demanding jobs in high-powered firms, vowing that they will work hard to earn money that will enable them to retire and pursue their real interests when they are thirty-five? But by the time they reach that age, they have large mortgages, children to school, houses in the suburbs that necessitate at least two cars per family, and a sense that life is not worth living without really good wine and expensive holidays abroad. What are they supposed to do, go back to digging up roots? No, they double their efforts and keep slaving away.” 

I’m sure there are thousands of reviewers more knowledgeable than me that can tell you why this book is incredible. I’ll close this review by saying that if you feel intimidated by this book, I can assure you that Harari’s prose was utterly easy to digest. Sure there were a few topics—like capitalism—that bored me but most of the time I had a fantastic and enlightening time reading this book. Heck, I personally think this book should be available as a must-read book for everyone at school when they’re learning about history. Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind made education and information a joy to read. The last pages of the book showed glimpses of Harari’s thoughts about the future of humanity, which I assume is what his book, Homo Deus, will be about and I look forward to reading it, hopefully within this year.

14,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35537079-andy,3,"The only parts of this book that really grabbed my attention were the chapters on early humankind, and especially the interaction between Homo Sapiens and other Homo species. The rest of it is a very pedestrian and basic journey through some aspects of human history, with the author making a lot of sweeping assertions and tending towards a rather vague and disembodied explanation of things like culture, money, etc. These sort of general explanations might be good for someone new to the study of history, but the reader should beware that they don't get taken in too much by the author's often simplistic and one-sided explanation of these concepts. The unifying theme of it being ""a history of humankind"", focusing on Homo Sapiens as a species, often disappears and it becomes a general plod through whatever aspects of history the author is interested in. More on Homo Sapiens' relations with other species and with nature might have been good."

Who told you that?- I just figured it out myself. Oh, there you are. What are you doing curled round that branch?- Waiting for a chance to talk to you, Eve. So tell me, where are you going today?- I'm gathering. See, Adam and me are hunter-gatherers and we take turns. Today he's hunting and I'm gathering. He's going to catch a rabbit, and I'm going to find mushrooms and wild garlic for the delicious rabbit and mushroom casserole we're making for dinner.- It sound exhausting.- It takes about three hours a day. And it's fun. I love it.- I see you already have your mushrooms. So where are you going to gather your garlic?- There's a good place just past that hill. - You know that?- I know every inch of the Garden of Eden like it was the back of my hand.- But tell me, what will you do if you get there and a bear has eaten it? I understand that bears love wild garlic.- They do! They're so naughty. But they're so big and strong and cuddly too, you have to take the whole package. I'll go look somewhere else, I know another good spot.- What if those naughty bears have eaten the garlic there too?- Well, I don't know. - Wouldn't Adam be mad if you got home without any garlic for your favourite dinner?- Of course not. He's crazy about me. I'd just kiss him and he'd forget the whole thing a minute later.- But suppose he was really looking forward to dinner, and he was too hungry to want sex right there and then?- Adam's never that hungry. - But suppose.- Look, I have no idea. What am I supposed to do about it?- Well, you could start a vegetable patch.- What's that?- You take some wild garlic, and all the other things you're especially fond of, and you start growing them in one place. - That won't work. The bears would find out about it and they'd come by one night and eat the lot.- No problem. You make a strong fence around the vegetable patch so they can't get in. - A fence? - You take big logs and drive them into the earth, very close together.- Big enough to keep out bears?- You're starting to get the picture.- And all this trouble just so that I can be sure of having garlic when I need it?- Oh, it's not just garlic! You can grow all sorts of things in your vegetable patch. Wheat for example.- Wheat?- It's a kind of grass. You take the seeds and grind them up and mix them with water and herbs and bake them over a fire. Then you eat it with honey.- I like the honey part, but the rest of it sounds disgusting. Why would anyone want to do that?- Look, it's more efficient. You could grow all your food in your vegetable patch, and then you wouldn't have to spend so much time walking around gathering.- I told you it was just three hours a--- You'd be able to start a larger family. You know how much attention kids need. Wouldn't little Cain and Abel like to have a few baby brothers and sisters?- Well now you mention it, Adam and I have talked about that. But I hate this wheat idea. Burned ground-up seed paste. Yuk.- In fact, bread is quite tasty.- I'm sure it's not good for you just eating seed paste. The Lord Jehovah always tells us to maintain a balanced diet with plenty of fresh greens. Trust me, He knows everything about food and nutrition.- If you tried it, you might find it's better than you think.- And look, if we started this vegetable patch, then we'd need to look after it all the time. We couldn't move around. It's fun being a nomad.- But it wouldn't be so much fun if you had a larger family, would it?- Okay, you have a point there.- See, this vegetable patch is just the start. You think ahead a bit. When Cain and Abel are grown up, they'll start families of their own and move off to the next valley to hunt and gather there. You'll never see your grandchildren. Won't that be sad?- Well, it's true--- You start growing wheat, and there'll be enough for you, and Adam, and Cain and Abel, and all their families too. And you'll be able to play with the grandchildren every day.- But look, if there's, like, fifty of us living in the same place for ages then it'll get filthy. We tried staying put once. Didn't work. After a year, we went back to being nomads.- What's more important, a bit of dirt or seeing your grandchildren?- Uh--- Just think about it unselfishly, Eve. - Okay, okay, I guess the grandchildren. I guess. But look--- Yes?- If we start doing this, then after a while there'll be too many of us for the vegetable patch.- So, some of you will go off and start a new vegetable patch.- But then we'll never see them. We'll be back where we started.- You need to invent some technology, Eve. - What's technology?- You know, things like axes and bow-drills and stuff. But a bit more complicated. You'll be amazed. - I'm not sure it sounds like a good idea. Bow-drills are plenty complicated for me.- Eve, just try it! Don't be so prejudiced. You admitted you were wrong about the vegetable patch.- My head is spinning. Why don't you come back and have dinner with us? See, I found the garlic while we were chatting. I'm sure Adam would love to talk to you. I promise, our rabbit casserole is killer.- What's for dessert?- Dessert?- Eve, there are so many things you need to learn! Here, let me tell you how to make an apple pie...[I also have a serious review of the book here.]"

I am convinced by this author's arguments and my view of the human condition has changed permanently. I thought this would be a book that would delve lavishly in later human evolution, but it is does not. It discusses it briefly and moves on, concentrating its effort on the times of agricultural revolution and forward. It is a masterpiece of anthropology. ""Ever since the Cognitive Revolution, Sapiens have thus been living in a dual reality. One the one hand, the objective reality of rivers, trees and lions; and on the other hand, the imagined reality of gods, nations and corporations. As times went by, the imagined reality became ever more powerful, so that today the very survival of rivers, trees and lions depends on the grace of imagined entities such as United States and Google.""""Unlike lying, an imagined reality is something that everyone believes in, and as long as this communal belief persits, the imagined reality exerts force in the world. [...] Most millionaires sincerely believe in the existence of money and limited liability of companies. Most human-rights activists sincerely believe in the existence of human rights.""I have never considered the extent of the imagined reality we all live in before. I have never equated my belief in human rights with the belief in Vishnu, or considered that a corporation too is all in our collective heads. The author moves on through history and gives plenty of new perspectives on events. ""Most people today successfully live up to the capitalist-consumerist ideal. The new ethic promises paradise on the condition that the rich remain greedy and spend their time making more money, and that the masses give free rein to their cravings and passions - and buy more and more. This is the first religion in history whose followers actually do what they are asked to do. How, though, do we know that we'll get paradise in return? We've seen it on television.""These are just a few tidbits of insight and perspective. I absolutely loved this book! Highly recommended to anyone curious about the human condition."

Now, that is a mean cliffhanger on page 466! I am so done with Sapiens, I am willing to enter the realm of posthuman Homo Deus out of spite for my species. During the time it took me to read the ""short"" history of humankind, written in funny sarcastic prose, painting with broad brush strokes what made us develop into this bizarre population of 7 billion people, I have rated this brick of a book five stars, one star, no star, all the fault in our stars. The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, though. I am as surprised as I can be that my fingers eventually ended up choosing four of them to head my review. It must mean that my serotonin levels are particularly high today.Let's be honest. There are difficulties in this book. And there's no surprise there, as it is written by a homo sapiens, a species notoriously wellknown for making false assumptions and creating individual and collective fictions to survive, adapt and conquer the world. The author, who specialises in world history according to the oxymoronic blurb (what is his GENERAL field then, I would like to ask?), sells his narrative as a factual account a bit too often for me to enjoy it fully. I felt myself tending towards one star while reading the superficial analysis of empires, for example. I kept asking myself what the preferred audience for this book is, as it is clearly too difficult to read for people who are not interested in history, and too shallow for those who are. I was building up a real emotional rage (my serotonin levels were bad between pages 200-350!).BUT!This books keeps people in my environment talking, discussing, reflecting. And that is a good thing, I believe. As long as homo sapiens tries to acquire more sapientia, the world becomes more serene according to my worldview, aka imagination. I like Harari's premise, that the ability to create collective fictions and use them as guidelines for our shared communities defines us as a species.And part of my irritation derived from the fact that he is excellent at demonstrating the human narrative skill in his book. I felt his story took over, and interferred with mine. I have a different idea of the Agricultural Revolution. So I can get into a rage when reading his? I am confirming his premise by doing so.My annoyance with his easygoing, dismissive style is at the same time what kept me reading - he is like the laughing philosopher who despairs of the world and decides that all is a joke, while I most of the time take the position of the crying philosopher who wants to change humankind for the better. Harari does for homo sapiens what Hitchens did for gods. He puts them in their place. This book has its place in the meaningless, yet amusing narrative of a bunch of mammals whose best and worst skill is storytelling.Be warned, but read it!"
18,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"This is an excellent book about the history of humans, covering all aspects; evolution, anthropology, geography, psychology, religion, ideologies, and the future of humans. Physically, the book is beautiful; the glossy paper makes it heavy as well. What really makes the book interesting is the unique points of view that the author, Yuval Harari, brings to life.For example, early in the book, Harari mentions that chimps and sapiens (humans) can only organize in groups of up to 150, without organizing into a hierarchical structure. So, how did cities grow to their enormous size? Through fiction. Yes, that's right, through fiction, through beliefs in common myths. These are myths about ideologies. These imaginary fictions include human rights, nations, and currency; they work because many people cooperatively believe in them.Some civilizations are built quite differently from our own. For example, the Bari Indians believe that genes do not come from a single pair of parents, but that they are contributed by multiple fathers. Monogamous relationships do not exist among their tribes. Harari discusses a number of controversial theories about nuclear families and monogamous relationships. One theory states that infidelities and divorce of modern times stem from forcing people to live in unnatural, permanent relationships. Another theory holds that monogamy and nuclear families are core human behaviors.Harari describes the disappearance of many animal species in certain habitats that are coincidental in time with the arrival of humans. For example, Australia lost 23 of 24 large animal species at about the same time that humans migrated there. Many other islands were also rich in large mammals until humans arrived.Harari discusses the agricultural revolution in some detail. He addresses the question why agriculture became important in the Middle East, Central America, and China, but did not become popular in Australia, Alaska, or South Africa. He explains that most plants and animals cannot be domesticated, and that regions where there is a deficit in domesticatable plants and animals did not develop agriculture.It is obvious that Harari laments the rise of agriculture. He claims that hunter gatherers, who roamed the lands and did not stick to one location like agriculturists, were more stimulated, less in danger of starvation and disease. Their diets were more varied. Agriculture increased the volume of food, but not better quality of food, and did not yield more leisure-time. Agriculture created population explosions and pampered elites. In fact, Harari claims that the agricultural revolution is ""history's biggest fraud."" The culprits of this fraud were wheat, rice, and potatoes, all plants that domesticated humans! Also, farming encouraged warfare, because it forced people to fight to protect territory. And agriculture, because it developed over millennia (not overnight), created consequences gradually. People could not anticipate the full consequences of their decisions. More wheat helped to lead to more children, and less food for each.Harari compares the Code of Hammurabi with the American Declaration of Independence. Hammurabi's code implicitly acknowledges three classes; superiors, commoners, and slaves. The Declaration of Independence states that all men were created equally. But Harari disputes this; he states that men were not created at all, but instead they evolved differently.From a sociological point of view, Harari asks why are most cities patriarchical. It is not because men are stronger. Physical prowess is inversely proportional to social power in most societies. He explores various theories, but none of them are very compelling.Since the French Revolution, political history is a series of attempts to reconcile liberty--which involves individual freedom--and equality. In order to understand another culture, one should look at the ""Catch 22's"", that is, look where rules and standards contradict each other. These contradictions are part of culture. For example, in Medieval Europe, there was a clash between Christianity and chivalry. In modern Western civilization, there are clashes between equality and liberty.I have just scratched the surface of this big book. I will leave you with one more unique point of view expressed in this book. Harari calls the present modern age the ""Age of Ignorance."" I won't explain this; it would be a spoiler. This book is a wonderful introduction to sociology, and I highly recommend it to all."

I don't think I've ever read a book with such grand scope, or a book that promises to cover so much and actually delivers. Dealing with the biggest questions about our species - Why are we here? Why are we the way we are? What does our happiness mean? - Harari writes precisely and with shrewd use of metaphor, providing answers that seem intuitively right but leading us to think further than we have before. The links between giant forces that control our world such as capitalism, science, and empire are made brilliantly and made me see the world through fresh eyes.Dizzyingly good. Everyone should read this."

Everything I read in this book to some extent I learned at the anthropology courses taught by academician Balaceanu-Stolnici.Harari is a good writer, but one with a very decided agenda. I had to point out how surprisingly little he seems to have read on quite a number of essential topics. "

It is obviously a book directed at non-academics interested in 'Big History'. If I were to compare Wright's writing for a general audience and Harari's, I'd probably suggest that Harari is a bit more flamboyant in his speculations and inferences (a bit more like Mann). I imagine more than a few academic anthropologists, geneticist, archaeologists would read this book with a need to keep their eyes from rolling back. I'm not saying he's wrong. I seriously don't have enough evidence, or enough background to argue individual points. I'm just saying his flag on this flies pretty high. For entertainment, this book is firmly a 5. For veracity, perhaps a 3?But it is VERY engaging and like Wright, Mann, and Gladwell before him, Harari has capture the imagination of the reading public by taking academic topics and smoothing out the rough edges and making it easier for a general audience to swallow and digest. That is why these pop-academic books keep getting written, they sell WELL. The end of 'Sapiens' jumps ahead to the future of mankind and serves as almost a tease for Harari's next book Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow."

- This book discusses the whole of Human History. These are some interesting excerpts from it - “Not all people get the same chance to cultivate and refine their abilities, whether or not they have such an opportunity will usually depend on their place within their societies remained hierarchy.- Harry Potter is a good example. Removed from his distinguished family and brought up by ignorant muggles he arrives at Hogwarts without any experience in magic, and it takes him seven books to gain a firm command of his powers and knowledge of his unique abilities.- Even if people belonging to different classes develop exactly the same abilities, they are unlikely to enjoy equal success because they will have to play the game by different rules.- If in British ruled India an untouchable, a Brahmin, a Catholic Irish man and a Protestant English man had somehow developed exactly the same Business acumen they still would not have had the same chance of becoming rich because the economic game was rigged by legal restrictions and unofficial glass ceilings.”- It is sad to say that even though the world has progressed to a large extent in terms of latitudes for the weaker sections of the society based on race and cast, there is still a long way for us to go to say that each and every individual is treated equally and provided with equal opportunities like everyone else.- If you are a person who is more into fiction and plans to read just one non-fiction book this year, this should be the one you should pick."
23,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,2,"A friend of mine at work recommended I read this during the week – and it is hard not being struck by the odd coincidence of that. Not so much him recommending a book to me, he’s done that before, but this book is very similar to The Patterning Instinct and I only read that a week or so ago. And that’s odd too, since it is years since I’ve read a book on this theme, despite it being a bit of a favourite at one time. So, reading two books on much the same topic, covering lots and lots of the same ground, and in quick succession, recommended by completely different sources all seems strange to me.If you are tossing up whether or not to read this one, I would probably recommend reading The Patterning Instinct instead. Not least because, I think it covers the non-Western philosophies and spiritual traditions it discusses much more on their own terms than this one does. It also covers them in ways that make you feel, even though the Patterning’s author provided merely a thumbnail sketch of each, that it is a sketch of the philosophy itself. This one made me feel I was being presented an ‘example’ rather than a ‘sketch’ – with the history of humans being presented much more as a kind of story that leads to us in the West as the culmination. That is, I came away from tins one thinking of Said’s Orientalism, feeling that this was a white guy explaining other-people’s-cultures – which might even have been true of the patterning book too, but that one felt more inclusive. I want to say ‘objective’ but that’s probably not the right word.The patterning book was, even in its title, a bit of a dig at Pinker – whereas, this one pays him homage repeatedly throughout. And that is interesting here, since we are seeing essentially the same ‘data’ being used to justify significantly different conclusions in the two books. So, in that sense, I really didn’t come away from reading these two books in quick succession feeling it was a waste of time. I do understand that you might not want to read both of them together – although, I feel like I’ve read them in the way that an ex-Australian Prime Minister used to collect various conductors’ interpretations of Mahler Symphonies. The benefit of reading both has been that I got to see ‘evidence’ from the past, even when it is pretty much the exact same evidence, being used to justify significantly different conclusions. Obviously enough, I would recommend the Patterning book because it more closely corresponds with my prejudices – something that would be hardly surprising, I guess. But that said, I would also recommend it because I think it presents the material in more depth and in ways that are likely to provide you (and maybe even provoke you) with more insight into the complexities of the material too. The author of that one remains clear and accessible, despite the complexities of the material presented – something this one is too, by the way, it just I didn’t quite feel this one was as comprehensive – so the clarity here was also a function of the simpler presentation of the material.I found a lot of the last of this to be – well, a bit too Pinker for my tastes as well. This happened a couple of times throughout – for instance, there is a bit early on where he discusses males and aggression and their hormones and the genetic selection that encouraged it, and so on – and since I have just finished reading Fine’s T-Rex book on all this, that section proved a bit of a cringe. The bits at the end where science is proposed as being about to swoop down and save the day (and look, I know I’ve making a bit of a strawman of his argument here, but too not much of a strawman) left me cold, to be honest. My problem with the promise that ‘human ingenuity will triumph in the end’ is that, well, maybe it will, but betting the house on something that simply can’t be a sure thing seems a little reckless to me. Particularly when all life on earth might be wagered on the other side of the bet. I’m not much of a betting man, so perhaps I’m too cautious. But then, maybe we should be a little more cautious with this kind of gamble, even if we end up laughing at how overly cautious proved to be while we are looking back from the glorious future that is always promised us. It’s just that some scientists believe that if global warming proves to be as bad as they think it is going to be, the total population of people on the planet could end up being about half a billion people – which means that about 7 billion people will be in excess to requirements and so will have to die one way or another.Bits of this were really very good – I’m definitely not saying ‘don’t read this book under any circumstances’ – not in the least, but if you’ve read neither of these two books and only plan to read one – read the other one."

The book surveys the history of humankind from the evolution of archaic human species in the Stone Age up to the twenty-first century, focusing on Homo sapiens. The account is situated within a framework provided by the natural sciences, particularly evolutionary biology. Harari's work situates its account of human history within a framework provided by the natural sciences, particularly evolutionary biology: he sees biology as setting the limits of possibility for human activity, and sees culture as shaping what happens within those bounds. The academic discipline of history is the account of cultural change. Harari surveys the history of humankind from the evolution of archaic human species in the Stone Age up to the twenty-first century, focusing on Homo sapiens. He divides the history of Sapiens into four major parts:The Cognitive Revolution (c. 70,000 BCE, when Sapiens evolved imagination).The Agricultural Revolution (c. 10,000 BCE, the development of agriculture).The unification of humankind (the gradual consolidation of human political organisations towards one global empire).The Scientific Revolution (c. 1500 CE, the emergence of objective science).....تاریخ نخستین خوانش: ماه جولای سال 2019 میلادیعنوان: انسان خردمند: تاریخ مختصر بشر؛ نویسنده: یووال نوح حراری (هاراری)؛ مترجم: نیک گرگین؛ تهران، فرهنگ نشر نو؛ چاپ اول تا ششم 1396؛ در 621 ص؛ شابک: 9786008547037؛ چاپ دیگر: تهران، فرهنگ نشر نو: آسیم؛ چاپ هفتم و دوازدهم 1397؛ عنوان دیگر: تاریخ مختصر بشر؛ موضوع: تمدن و انسان و تاریخ؛ تکنولوزی و تمدن، از نویسندگان اسرائیلی - سده 21 مصد هزار سال پیش، دست‌کم شش گونۀ انسانی بر روی زمین زندگی می‌کردند. امروز تنها یکی به‌جا مانده است: ما، انسان‌های خردمند. چطور گونۀ ما در نبرد برای سلطه بر دیگران پیروز شد؟ چرا نیاکانِ شکارگر – خوراک‌ جوی ما اقدام به ساختن شهرها و برپایی پادشاهی‌ها کردند؟ چگونه به خدایان و ملت‌ها و حقوق بشر ایمان آوردیم، به پول و کتاب‌ها و قوانین اعتماد کردیم، و خود را برده ی بوروکراسی و مصرف‌ گرایی و حرص و آز برای خوشبختی ساختیم؟ دنیای ما در هزاره ی آینده چه شکلی به خود خواهد گرفت؟ انسان خردمند به‌ گونه‌ ای جسورانه، همه‌ جانبه و بحث‌ برانگیز هر آنچه را تا کنون گمان می‌کردیم در مورد انسان می‌دانیم: افکارمان، رفتارمان، اعمال‌مان، اقتدارمان… و آینده‌ مان را، به چالش می‌کشد. از همگی‌مان با هر ایمان و باوری می‌خواهند که روایتهای زیربنایی جهان را زیر پرسش ببریم، پیشرفت‌های گذشته را با دلمشغولی‌های کنونی مرتبط کنیم، و از نتایج جدل‌ برانگیز آن نهراسیم. دکتر «یووال نوح حراری» از دانشگاه «آکسفورد» دکترای تاریخ دارند، و در دانشگاه «بیت‌ المقدس»، تاریخ جهان تدریس می‌کنند. موضوع اصلی این پژوهش ایشان پرسشهای صریحی است، همچون: رابطۀ تاریخ و زیست‌ شناسی چیست؟ آیا عدالتی در تاریخ یافت می‌شود؟ آیا در مسیر تاریخ مردمان سعادتمندتر شده‌ اند؟ شصت و پنج هزار تن، در دورۀ اینترنتی تدریس تاریخ مختصر بشر ایشان، ثبت‌ نام کرده‌ اند. ا. شربیانی"

And since I am a complete beginner, perfect for me.I finished this some six months ago: interesting to see what has remained: gossip, something I hate and rarely indulge in, is an important factor in creating social cohesion, (so perhaps I should revise my attitude to it). True, when you think about it: you and I can only gossip about someone we both know. And it might be important to know who is forming an alliance behind our back. However, as social glue, gossip can only work in smaller groups: once you get past around forty or fifty it becomes unwieldy. Then you need to invent some story that everyone believes in, a story to bind 'us' together, that 'we' are 'we' and 'we' are defined (not 'them', who believe in something 'other'). Exceeding accessible, enjoyable, packed with information. I learned a lot, but then I was starting from absolute zero. "

This book is one of them. It asks fundamental questions about our evolution as humans and offers counter intuitive, tangential viewpoints. It tests our thinking, provokes new trains of thought. The book is highly readable and an immense provocation. It must be read, whether or not you are particularly interested in mankind, its history, its evolution or its future. I can't repeat myself often enough. Its an absolute mandatory read. No question about it. A NOTE ON RATING: I rate most good books at 3 stars, meaning it was a good read and was worth the time it took to read. I work on the principle that a good book is par for the course: we are all expected to write good books. If any ingredient is missing, I downgrade it to two stars. This is the only book I have given five stars. I need not say more. Please just read it. "

28,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1-otis-chandler,5,"I haven't read a ton of ""history of the world"" books, but this was fascinating. Highly recommended. I think the author is incredibly good at explaining and simplifying big concepts. He take on complex things like religion & capitalism and explains them in very simple terms that you likely hadn't thought about before. The history of religion chapter was very interesting. I hadn't thought about the fact that many early religions were animists or polytheists, or dualists. Nor the fact that they all sort of merged into todays concepts: ""monotheism, as it has played out in history, is a kaleidoscope of monotheist, dualist, polytheist and animist legacies, jumbling together under a single divine umbrella. The average Christian believes in the monotheist God, but also in the dualist Devil, in polytheist saints, and in animist ghosts.""There was a fascinating bit on the scientific mindset, and how it was key to Europe taking power. After the scientific revolution, they believed in science and its ability to let man discover new things, make more money, etc. This made them into explorers, whereas many other cultures remained very static. Great example of China having had gunpowder for hundreds of years but not using it for anything other than fireworks, and didn't invent the gun. Reminded me a bit of the Mindset.The chapter on capitalism was fascinating. There line about before its invention that the economy didn't grow, and was ""frozen"" as nobody poured money into new things, so there was no growth. Then the notion of credit was discovered, and as growth started, the combination snowballed. In 1500 the annual per capita production was $550 and today its $8,800 - this is an astounding increase, and all because of the virtuous growth cycle of capitalism: money is invested -> businesses grow -> people make money -> they invest their money. I never thought about the fact that reinvesting profits is a core piece of capitalism, but from this lens it really is. ""The human economy has nevertheless managed to keep on growing throughout the modern era, thanks only to the fact that scientists come up with another discovery or gadget every few years – such as the continent of America, the internal combustion engine, or genetically engineered sheep.""What I didn't see coming is how the end of the book was dedicated to human happiness. Fascinating questions to ask if we are happier today than 1,000 or 2,000 years ago. By metrics of death rate, average age of death and general health, we ought to be. But clearly peasants after the agricultural revolution were on average less happy than they were before as hunter-gatherers. And now we live in an always-on internet age, with pressure to continue growing our economy. So are we happier? It is the right question, in my opinion. The book then gave the basics of the happiness framework that I've also read in other places and believe in: that people are happy when they have 3 things: (1) Friends and family that love them (2) Are part of a community that makes them feel like they below (3) have a purpose to their life and feel like they are doing something meaningful. However, the book then adds onto this in another way that I have been learning about but hadn't put together with this: meditation. ""According to Buddhism, the root of suffering is neither the feeling of pain nor of sadness nor even of meaninglessness. Rather, the real root of suffering is this never-ending and pointless pursuit of ephemeral feelings, which causes us to be in a constant state of tension, restlessness and dissatisfaction. Due to this pursuit, the mind is never satisfied. Even when experiencing pleasure, it is not content, because it fears this feeling might soon disappear, and craves that this feeling should stay and intensify. People are liberated from suffering not when they experience this or that fleeting pleasure, but rather when they understand the impermanent nature of all their feelings, and stop craving them. This is the aim of Buddhist meditation practices.""So the moral of the book is basically that we should all meditate a lot, stop worrying, and be happy with what we have."

Whatever your beliefs, you'll find plenty of food for thought in this relatively brief outline of our history from a middling animal to whatever the hell we are now. It's about 15 hours long, but never dragged a bit. I made excuses to listen every minute that I could & even downloaded the ebook to reread sections for clarification & to ponder a bit more at length. I highly recommend this method. (I'm putting this section first because I wax poetic (read ""long winded"") below.) ---------------------Update 16Dec2018: here is a good piece about Harari's philosophy that should be taken into account when reading his books. I don't agree with it all, but it does contain important points to consider.https://www.thenewatlantis.com/public...---------------------I've listened to several books on evolution lately: Voyage of the Beagle, Undeniable: Evolution and the Science of Creation, & Before the Dawn: Recovering the Lost History of Our Ancestors. I would have thought these books sufficient since I have no particular interest in or need for this branch of science, but it was the runner up for the monthly read for the ""Science & Inquiry"" group. It looked interesting & was available in audio, so I took a chance. I'm so glad I did. It goes far beyond those. It's not just biology, anthropology, sociology, politics, or even history, but an examination of us through them all. Harari uses a macro overview of our evolution from the mere biological to the cognitive, agricultural, unification, & scientific revolutions. He then looks at what they really mean to us both as a species & as individuals.Harari's timeline summarizes much of his text nicely. The times below are in years ago.4.5 billion: Formation of planet Earth.3.8 billion: Emergence of organisms. Beginning of biology.6 million: Last common grandmother of humans and chimpanzees.2.5 million: Evolution of the genus Homo in Africa. First stone tools.2 million: Humans spread from Africa to Eurasia. Evolution of different humanspecies.500,000: Neanderthals evolve in Europe and the Middle East.300,000: Daily usage of fire.200,000: Homo sapiens evolves in East Africa. (Update to this. In 2017, 300K year old Homo Sapien fossils were discovered. May not have been confined to East Africa.) 70,000: The Cognitive Revolution. Emergence of fictive language. Beginning of history. Sapiens spread out of Africa.45,000: Sapiens settle Australia. Extinction of Australian megafauna.30,000: Extinction of Neanderthals.16,000: Sapiens settle America. Extinction of American megafauna.13,000: Extinction of Homo floresiensis. Homo sapiens the only surviving human species.12,000: The Agricultural Revolution. Domestication of plants and animals. Permanent settlements.5,000: First kingdoms, script and money. Polytheistic religions.4,250: First empire – the Akkadian Empire of Sargon.2,500: Invention of coinage – a universal money. The Persian Empire – a universal political order ‘for the benefit of all humans’. Buddhism in India – a universal truth ‘to liberate all beings from suffering’.2,000: Han Empire in China. Roman Empire in the Mediterranean. Christianity.1,400: Islam.500: The Scientific Revolution. Humankind admits its ignorance and begins to acquire unprecedented power. Europeans begin to conquer America and the oceans. The entire planet becomes a single historical arena. The rise of capitalism.200: The Industrial Revolution. Family and community are replaced by state and market. Massive extinction of plants and animals.The Present: Humans transcend the boundaries of planet Earth. Nuclear weapons threaten the survival of humankind. Organisms are increasingly shaped by intelligent design rather than natural selection.The Future: Intelligent design becomes the basic principle of life? Homo Sapiens is replaced by superhumans?The human animals were in the middle of the food chain & basically not significant players in evolutionary terms for over 2 million years. Homo Erectus & Neanderthals were around, even tamed fire & used tools. It’s a common fallacy to envision these species as arranged in a straight line of descent, with Ergaster begetting Erectus, Erectus begetting the Neanderthals, and the Neanderthals evolving into us. This linear model gives the mistaken impression that at any particular moment only one type of human inhabited the earth, and that all earlier species were merely older models of ourselves. The truth is that from about 2 million years ago until around 10,000 years ago, the world was home, at one and the same time, to several human species. And why not? Today there are many species of foxes, bears and pigs. The earth of a hundred millennia ago was walked by at least six different species of man.The big take away is that we are not exclusive. There are even indications that we interbred both with Neanderthals & at least one other.It wasn't until our cognitive evolution of 70,000 years ago that Homo Sapiens really began to emerge from the other animals & they did so with a vengeance. We wiped out all competition with thoroughness & the paranoia of a Banana Republic dictator. (His comparison & an apt one in relation to his argument.) Megafauna (animals over 100 lbs) die-offs followed our emergence into an environment with regularity all over the globe. It's really interesting how much we have changed the environment for so long. He contends that no human has lived ""naturally"" since our cognitive leap.Evolutionary Success means the more copies of the DNA, the better. This does NOT equate to individual comfort, circumstance, or survival, simply to the overall number of individuals available to reproduce. This perspective is very important in the course of the book. For instance, did we domesticate wheat or did it domesticate us? Wheat went from a scattered grass in one small region of the globe to covering an enormous amount of the globe & it didn't really do any favors for the early average humans that raised it. Overall, their individual lives were probably worse than that of their free ranging contemporaries, but more humans could live in smaller areas - an evolutionary success & the Luxury Trap: What was once a luxury quickly becomes a necessity. His take on our ability to communicate is wonderful. We're not the only species who can lie (monkeys can & do) nor the best at making sounds (parrots are better), but we're the ones that gossip & spin collective fictions (shared myths) that we agree on: money, empires, & religion - the main forces that unify us. Money is a shared myth, an imaginative leap to believing that a particular item of little practical worth was in fact a counter of far reaching consequences. His explanations of the failure of barter, shared favors, & economies are masterful.He gets into the shared structures & ways we dealt with the increasing complexity of life. Where the hunter-gatherer only had to remember where food was, the farmer had to think ahead & deal with supporting more specialized humans - leaders & taxes. That led to writing which started out as accounts & math. His queries & examples on why we primarily have patriarchal societies was interesting, if inconclusive. That's one of the things I like about his writing; he doesn't insist on conclusions, but is OK with describing interesting points to ponder.His macro view of the unification of the globe was excellent. Empires were eventually good things for humanity as a whole, but pretty horrific on those participating in their formation & pure hell on the environment.Religion: While he says Religion can thus be defined as a system of human norms and values that is founded on a belief in a superhuman order. he later refines this with the discussion of those that believe natural laws provide the order, not a supernatural being. ...Jainism and Buddhism in India, Daoism and Confucianism in China, and Stoicism, Cynicism and Epicureanism in the Mediterranean basin, were characterized by their disregard of gods. Animistic religions had little need to spread the word & those with pantheons often adopted some of the conquered gods, so it wasn't until the rise of monotheism that the real religious trouble started.Monotheists have tended to be far more fanatical and missionary than polytheists. A religion that recognizes the legitimacy of other faiths implies either that its god is not the supreme power of the universe, or that it received from God just part of the universal truth. Since monotheists have usually believed that they are in possession of the entire message of the one and only God, they have been compelled to discredit all other religions. Over the last two millennia, monotheists repeatedly tried to strengthen their hand by violently exterminating all competition. He further stretches his definition of religion to include shared myths. The modern age has witnessed the rise of a number of new natural-law religions, such as liberalism, Communism, capitalism, nationalism and Nazism. These creeds do not like to be called religions, and refer to themselves as ideologies. But this is just a semantic exercise.I've always thought politics & economics were just another form of belief system & he confirms that. He looks into our various empires & how they evolved through history along with the many changes they caused.The Scientific Revolution is plain incredible in the amount of change it has made in the world in such a short time - a mere 500 years. He calls it ""The Discovery of Ignorance"". Where religions pretend to know it all or else dismiss it as unimportant, science admits ignorance & tries to cure it. When coupled with the hunger & resources of empires based on capitalism, it launched us into today - for good or ill - he has plenty of examples of both.He wraps up by asking some hard questions about the future. He doesn't even pretend to know where we might wind up in even a few decades. In fact, he admits that he probably didn't even mention what will seem a likely scenario from hindsight, but he does point out a few of the things that should trouble us. Much of it he ties to the Gilgamesh Project - our search to cure disease & stave off death possibly unto immortality. On the surface, this seems like a noble aim, but it is guaranteed to raise some thorny problems along the way.- We will soon be able to resurrect the Woolly Mammoth from extinction. This seems like a laudable project, but what about resurrecting the Neanderthal or any other species of sapien?- What if a new drug that cures Alzheimer's makes regular people smarter? Should we regulate it? Could we? Considering the success of the current 'War on Drugs', I highly doubt it. What would that do to our society?- The irony of those arguing for 'Intelligent Design' as an alternative to the 'Theory of Evolution' is that intelligent design is actually happening now for the first time ever in our history. We're regularly teaching bacteria to perform new tricks & are actively trying to change the genome of domesticated animals in ways that breeding can't accomplish such as changing pork's Omega 3 to Omega 6 ratio. What about doing it to people? When it becomes simple to change a fetus' genetic predilection for high cholesterol, it will probably also be easy to change their sexual orientation or intelligence.- As far as we've advanced in the biological sciences, bionics is coming along as is pure hardware. People are getting more & more artificial body parts. Scientists are seeking to create artificial intelligences as well as create human to machine mind interfaces. What is human?He also asks a great question - are we better off or happier? He spends a chapter on happiness. What is it? While he doesn't really try to answer the question, there is a lot to think about.An interesting quirk of his is to use the feminine rather than masculine pronouns in ambiguous situations. It made no difference in the content, of course."
30,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27098959-leonard-gaya,4,"Sapiens is based on a series of lectures Harari gave in Jerusalem in the early 2010s, and it reads in fact like a bunch of TED Talks bundled together. The author (a historian specialised in medieval crusades, to begin with) sounds well versed in all sorts of disciplines: palaeontology, anthropology, history, economics and social sciences and a bit of philosophy to boot. And Sapiens is a little bit of this and a little bit of that. Don’t get me wrong, though: all these bits are sewed together almost seamlessly and provide some fascinating insights on the human condition. No wonder that this book has been on the international bestsellers lists for a while. So, if you want to save yourself the time required to go through the works of Richard Dawkins, Jared Diamond, Jeremy Rifkin or even Michel Foucault, reading Sapiens looks like a good, quick and engaging alternative.In a way, Harari is to humanities what Carl Sagan and Neil deGrasse Tyson are to astrophysics: a brilliant populariser, in the vein of Loren Eiseley and Pierre Teilhard de Chardin — arguably the fathers of pop-science. The strong point of all these authors is that they manage to not only digest abstruse and dry theories into entertaining and thought-provoking learnings but sometimes convey a genuine sense of wonder.Sapiens covers a potpourri of far-reaching questions. How did homo sapiens become the last remaining species of the homo genus (and a very successful one at that!)? How did the hunter-gatherers invent agriculture and become slaves to this revolutionary invention? How did these humans later establish trading nations and world empires? How did the industrial revolution and capitalism shape modern consumerism and how we have become, once more, slaves to this way of life?In his account of historical progress, Harari stresses, in a way that might be reminiscent of Karl Marx, two opposing movements. On the one hand, the deterministic forces of evolutionary biology, economics, energy production and consumption, etc. On the other hand, the shaping agency of human ideas, stories and inventions, such as myths, religions, laws, money, bureaucracy (and books!). Harari shows how these things are both figments of our collective imagination and formidable agents of progress:Ever since the Cognitive Revolution, Sapiens have thus been living in a dual reality. On the one hand, the objective reality of rivers, trees and lions; and on the other hand, the imagined reality of gods, nations and corporations. As time went by, the imagined reality became ever more powerful, so that today the very survival of rivers, trees and lions depends on the grace of imagined entities such as the United States and Google. (p. 34)One of Harari’s recurring themes throughout the book is that of individual happiness and suffering among human beings as well as other sentient beings. Of particular note are his revolting descriptions of the cruel treatment inflicted on livestock in modern slaughterhouses and meat factories. If this cannot convince you that vegetarians/vegans are doing the right thing, I don’t know what can.Harari ends his book with a few considerations on the near future of humanity, more specifically the consequences of genetic engineering, life extension research, robotics and artificial intelligence. A few lofty arguments (e.g. the imminent coming of the “singularity” and the end of humankind) are quite redolent of fancy trans-humanist thinkers like Ray Kurzweil or Nick Bostrom. Very little is said on climate change, however. This probably hints at the lines of reasoning that lay ahead, in his next book, Homo Deus… To be continued."
31,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4252261-tom-la,2,"In this book, professor Harari crammed EVERYTHING. Or, to be precise, a bit of everything with astounding randomness. Towards the mid-section you can also find a useful guide on how to train your hummingbird. The book's initial chapters are its strongest feature. They also mislead you into thinking that the book is going in a certain direction (anthropology and evolution), while the one that it actually takes is completely different. Too bad!I found the brief portion about history in relation to happiness interesting, or at least original, because I had never heard that perspective before. Like all sociological and philosophical writers, however, Harari wants to sound completely detached from his object of study but fails miserably, and like many others who write on such broad topics, he ends up serving up his personal views and opinions as if they were perfectly objective assessments. Example: he is steeped in women's rights as if they were part of an ""objectively"" right ""imagined order"". Or in the portion about sexuality, where ""open mindness"" is presented as the non-refutable objectively best approach to sex. In other words: every type of mental order is ""imagined"" (he really means ""deluded"") except for his own  (which can be easily summed up in scientism and liberalism).Among other ""imagined realities that are not imagined because imagined by the author"" , Harari keeps banging on the necessity for the global unification of humankind. I also love the concept, but so did John Lennon (not a great realist) and so does a 10 y.o. who knows nothing about history. ""Imagine all the people sharing all the world"" is not a sound foreign policy (despite what many idealists around the world actually think). He says that the great unifiers of mankind are 1) money 2) empires 3) religion. In this order. And that they are all imagined. Politheists are intrinsically open-minded, therefore cool guys, because they never wanted to convert anyone. In line with the relativist zeitgeist of our era, he keeps using the word ""open minded"" as an objectively positive quality for people. Time to remind Harari of the great Chesterton quote: “Do not be so open-minded that your brains fall out!”. The last chapters present futuristic scenarios that SF readers have been very familiar with since the '50s - but for Harari, they are excitingly fresh and original. He seems to be unaware of the non-originality of these scenarios, and shows his abyssal ignorance in the SF field in more than one occasion. For example, when he says ""science fiction describes developments of our present society, only with more advanced technologies"", which is probably less than 50% of SF literature. Also ""Nobody foresaw the internet"" (!) Wow. Just wow. That's an ""F-"" in Science Fiction class, professor Harari. Religion. Throughout the book, Harari doesn't demonstrate a real understanding of religion, aside from the formal and technical aspects of it. For example, in line with western mainstream pop thinking, to him Buddhism is the most interesting of all religions, because ""it's the one focusing the most on happiness"". God, what a horribly superficial and conventional and stereotypical statement! He goes on to idealize Buddhism, which ""gives profound serenity by stopping the pursuit of feelings"". I don't need to add anything here for anyone who has a fair knowledge of Christianity or Judaism or Islam. Clearly, he doesn't. I could go on for hours and highlight every instance where Harari presents totally subjective and arguable points as if they were not, but l won’t. Instead, I will briefly point out the  worst thing about this book : that is, how the author spent his time trying to destroy ideas and ""imagined things"", illusions, while making zero efforts to be constructive. Here is the thing: among educated people, today, stripping sense and meaning out of anything is the easiest thing to do. Just ask ANY teenager. What is really difficult, on the other hand, is to BUILD. To believe. To develop. To create hope. All things that this book does not do for one second,  ... although it could have done, and without breaking out of the endless boundaries that it gave itself (“to talk about everything”). The very last sentence of the book perfectly sums up this pessimistic point of view: ""Is there anything more dangerous than dissatisfied and irresponsible gods (human beings) who don't know what they want? "". So to sum up, a weird, pessimistic, sometimes engaging, but fundamentally flawed and overhyped book."

Although, the book is filled with the author's opinions. He believes that Earth is better off without humans. Some part of the book is very intriguing and some are so boring that you wish to stop reading. There is a lack of information about Neanderthals which made me unsatisfied.

The Icarus Myth is remembered for thousands of years; the farmer in the painting had lived and died in anonymity. Why, therefore, had Bruegel painted such a small and marginal Icarus and such a central farmer?“A Brief History of Humankind” by Yuval Noah Harari isn’t a conventional, standard history book. Its points of view are of a surprise also for the scholar reader and the professional historian; they satisfy one's curiosity, they are thought-provoking and they may enrage many readers. It’s not a history text whose content is foreseeable, that fits a certain outlook, and in whose index the reader might find anything he already knows, expects and likes.Through illuminating connections between events and their meanings, and through a spectacular integration of history, paleontology, anthropology and sociology, Harari reviews the key questions dealing with the riddle of our being here: how had Homo Sapiens had developed from a minor zoological species to the position of the ruler of the Earth? Which mental structures and beliefs it had created in order to stabilize and expand its domination? What were these ideas? How were created the ideas which had changed human history? What can one learn about the human nature by reviewing the way it all had happened? The questions Harari asks enlighten the history through an important, fascinating and clarifying perspective – much more than the routine pile of tyrants, commanders, battles, dates and eras that any regular history book is composed of.Which events influenced most on humanity's fate? Not wars but domestication of plants and animals; not conquests of cities but technical inventions and scientific discoveries; not formulating political coalitions but the invention of ideologies: money, religions, nations. Every change in the perception of the human consciousness, every change in communication, Technology or medicine, any development of the interconnectedness of the ultra-values of the western world – capitalism, technology, science - had influenced the human fate much more than any conquest of a certain city, a certain battle or an empire's rising and falling. That's why the medical researcher William Harvey is much more important than Genghis Khan; that's why the Penicillin discoverer Ernst Boris Chain has influenced – and is influencing – the lives of much more people than Hitler and Stalin has ever influenced, combined; that's why fifty Osama bin Ladens aren't the equal of one Thomas Edison, Humphry Davy or Michael Faraday. That's why the anonymous peasant who had brought a sheaf of wild wheat to his house is much more important than Icarus; and that's why Yuval Noah Harari's book is one of the most important popular history books of the recent years."

Where Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs, and Steel was a transformative investigation of the origins of civilization, Yuval Harari's Sapiens is a divisive, ideologically driven [Cognitive Revolution = Cultural Determinism] which twists data to fit a pre-existing theory. Back of it all, the entire book, is the final chapter where Harari frets about genetic engineering, cyborgs, and AI [artificial intelligence]. Readers, unless committed cultural determinists, will experience a forced and missionary posturing over the course of the book. That said, Sapiens is a fascinating history of humanity from 70,000 BP [Before Present] to the present. Recommended for cultural determinists and those okay with a new book about fear [genetic engineering, cyborgs, and AI] -- though the latter does not appear until the final chapter. The whole point of the book is the final chapter and it is almost certainly vastly overstated. Rating: a generous 3 out of 5 stars. "

“Culture tends to argue that it forbids only that which is unnatural. But from a biological perspective, nothing is unnatural. Whatever is possible is by definition also natural. A truly unnatural behaviour, one that goes against the laws of nature, simply cannot exist, so it would need no prohibition.” 
This book was incredibly fucking interesting. Somehow Yuval Noah Harari is able to condense human history into 450 pages, and it's both concise enough to not drag, but detailed enough to feel like you're really developing knowledge. I love all the different threads this book bought together: history, science, culture, anthropology and philosophy all combined to create some really interesting discussions about Homo Sapiens. What I liked about this was that it was so educational, but also quite funny and entertaining. It was so easy to follow because of how the author infused it with jokes and funny comparisons. If you're someone like me who enjoys non-fiction but isn't a massive buff that balance between facts and humour was so nice. It's definitely a beginners, ""I don't do this often"" type book, but thats what I am so for me it was perfect. This book definitely blew my mind, multiple times. Can't tell you how many times I messaged friends and family like ""did you know that scientists are going to inject Neanderthal DNA into a human so they give birth to a Neanderthal"" and ""did you know Homo Sapiens, Homo Erectus and Neanderthal's were alive at the same time?"" and ""Did you know that aluminium used to be worth more then gold so Roman kings served their favourite guests on aluminium plates and everyone else had to 'make do' with the gold plates"" All the little trivia facts and things like that were fun to collect and I definitely remember a lot of the things that happened in hereI also found the discussion aspects illuminating and open-ended enough that I could debate it with myself. My perspective on some issues were challenged which was really nice. Some of the chapters though were definitely less interesting then others. The beginning was so interesting and my favourite part, early human civilisations were covered so well, but some of the discussions on economics and religion didn't engage me as much. Maybe because I hate math? regardless, the middle wasn't as exciting to me as the beginning and the end. 
“You could never convince a monkey to give you a banana by promising him limitless bananas after death in monkey heaven.” 
Overall, I definitely recommend this if you want a brief but educational book about history. It's easy to read despite it's subject matter, and definitely taught me a thing or ten. I actually listened to this on audiobook and I highly recommend that, the narrator was fantastic and actually had a really soothing tone that helped me fall asleep (in the good, this calmed me down way not the bad it was so boring I fell asleep way)Will definitely check out the sequel, Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow "

Not everyone will agree with Harari's take on things but I enjoyed it and will read more of his books in the future."
37,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49577504-george,1,"“Sapiens” by Yuval Noah Harari is a poorly written book. Its quality ranks somewhere between mediocre and terrible. “Too Clever By Half” would be a more fitting title for this book. About 50 percent of the book’s content is standard, conventional information on the main topics (e.g., Hunter-Gatherers, the Agricultural and Industrial revolutions, etc.), information you can read in Wikipedia. The other 50 percent of the book is the mediocre and terrible part: The author’s attempts at clever phrasing, unsubstantiated claims, sweeping generalizations, straw men, picked cherries, inane examples, inconsistencies, shallow observations, superficial philosophical and theological statements, and even a quote from the author’s breakfast cereal box!  Given that it has been a best seller and has received many rave reviews, I would say that “Sapiens” is a contender to be the Facebook generation's Non Fiction ""Fifty Shades of Grey.""  If you want to read a couple of solid introductory books about the evolution of Homo Sapiens and the societies they create, I recommend reading ""The Story of the Human Body"" by Daniel E. Lieberman and “Guns, Germs, and Steel” by Jared M. Diamond.  “Sapiens” feels like a college professor’s lecture notes turned into a book – and it doesn’t work in this case. While the clever phrases and sweeping claims may wow a lecture hall full of wide-eyed 18 year olds, they will irritate and aggravate anyone who stops to reflect on the author’s claims. In section after section the author doesn’t just state the facts – he embellishes the text with clever phrases, unsupported claims, and irrelevant points – which end up frustrating a thoughtful reader. As a small sampling of these embellishments, I’ll conclude with three quotes from chapter 16 (on Capitalism): “What [Adam] Smith says is in fact that Greed is Good, and that by becoming richer I benefit everybody and not just myself. Egoism is Altruism.”  “Medieval nobleman wore colorful robes of gold and silk and devoted much of their time to attending banquets, carnivals, and glamorous tournaments. In comparison, modern CEOs don dreary uniforms called suits that afford them all the panache as a flock of crows and they have little time for festivities.”  “Some religions, such as Christianity and Nazism, have killed millions out of burning hatred. Capitalism has killed millions out of cold indifference coupled with greed.”  Note: I listened to the unabridged audiobook (Tantor Audio, Release Date:02-10-2015)"
38,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14773738-julie,2,"To be fair: 2.5 stars, solidly in the middle of a ""stinking rotten book"" and ""exceptionally brilliant"". To do as Harari does, I speak only ""generally"" when I say this is a nice little synopsis of Anthropology One OH One, Physical and Cultural, with a lean towards the Cultural. In Ancient Days, when I was in First Year Anthro, I had two brilliant tutors -- one in each of the sub-disciplines noted above, who led us in wondrous discussions on all the possibilities of humankind, past present and future. During those tutorial classes we engaged in discussions to far out-rank anything that Harari puts forth in this little notebook. In fact, Harari may have been the studious little fellow sitting at the back of the room, scribbling furiously, while most of the others participated in animated and enthusiastic dialogue. Nonetheless, it is good to note that subsequent generations will have this handy little cahier to refer to, now and again, when they lose their way, anthropologically-speaking.NB: Try as she might, my GR friend Lisa has not managed to eradicate the Irony And Sarcasm Affliction with which I have struggled all my life, ab ovum.'Tis arrogance in the first place to write a brief history of humankind, and so I can only surmise that it is done most ironically. Even so, the story manages to get certain things wrong, at its most basic, and indulges in wild flights of fancy at its most preposterous. It's all in his prerogative to do so, and in mine to rage against it, once it's been put forth in the world.The book is very well written and his thought processes are most interesting, at times, but it is nothing that should shake the stage by its entrance into the book world. One can reduce Harari's argument to one main thesis: that human culture is an invention. STOP THE PRESSES. I cannot fathom such an astounding, and outstanding, premise. Or, as Homer Simpson might have been heard to mutter on occasion, ""Duh.""Can you imagine having the audacity to write a ground-breaking book on the premise that human achievement is of {our} own invention? Why has not the world stood still, to take pause, and absorb the magnitude of that?I take a bit more issue than I (normally) do with such works only because I have viewed this author's website and it seems to me that Dan Brown could have taken lessons in promotional advertising when releasing his Da Vinci Code. Lots of hype and hyperbole. All promotion and propaganda: there doesn't seem to be much substance, much like the book. A nice story, if you missed the first weeks of Anthro 101. Too much ego here, too little substance. Can hardly wait to ignore the next book:  Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow. Now if that doesn't speak of arrogance, I can't imagine what does. “… man, proud man,Dressed in a little brief authority,Most ignorant of what he’s most assured,His glassy essence, like an angry ape,Plays such fantastic tricks before high heavenAs make the angels weep.”(Measure For Measure)"

Like many, I am fascinated with the history of the human race, and enjoy learning as much as I can possibly absorb. This book provides a good timeline of how we came to be, yet attempts to answer questions that we will never have the answers to. The author answers the questions with certainty that he is stating fact, and I found it a little humorous at times. The book took twists and turns that were unexpected, such as discussing the treatment of animals by the human race, and dives into what I felt were lectures defending his own opinion. I do understand that it all fits together with the human race and how it has evolved, and his words really put into perspective how we impact the ecosystem and the dangers that we are creating. I specifically liked learning about the Sapiens cousins, such as the Neanderthals. This is definitely a book that will make you question all of what you have grown up learning, and keep you wanting more! "

41,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16135750-marvin-chester,1,"	A precious nephew gave me 'Sapiens' (2015) by Yuval Noah Harari as a gift. It offers us a 'Brief History of Humankind'. It is a mockery of historical scholarship. Hopefully the author meant it to be that; a mockery. Whether meant or not it is comedy.The book is physically heavy. Unusually so for its 400 pages. That's because each page is thick and glossy. Presumably to assure its readers that the material is substantive - heavy. Heavy book, heavy intellectual content. Pretty funny.Some people are interminable complainers. ""This is no good. That is no good"". Harari, the book's author, has taken the art to new heights. For him, the entire history of man is no good. Harari's book is an elaborate rant. His thesis is that man has been going from bad to worse throughout history. In Yiddish a complainer is called a kvetch. Harari has written a Kvetch History of Mankind. All that mankind has done doesn't suit him. Today we may be living in high-rise apartments with over-stuffed refrigerators, but our DNA still thinks we are in the savannah. That's what makes some of us spoon down an entire tub of Ben and Jerry's when we find one in the freezer and wash it down with a jumbo Coke. p.41This is sitcom television historical analysis, unfounded kitchen-table gossip. He cites no evidence for the connection between jumbo Cokes and life on the savannah. It is a currently fashionable platitude; to blame obesity on archaic genes. ... they (hunter gatherers) lived better lives than most people in agricultural and industrial societies ... p.52What could 'better life' mean? Harari doesn't define it. But, evidently, betterness for Harari is not material well being. Hunter gatherers didn't have better material well being. They had shorter lifetimes. Suffered far more violence. 'Better lives' is a value judgement based on some fantasy idea of what a good life is. Harari lets some currently fashionable new age health-food idea (their ""wholesome and varied diet"" p.52) infect his portayal of history. It is hard to measure the goodness of lives, even today when evidence is available. And the 'goodness' found ranges down to 'badness' over the world. We cannot answer the question whether life is better today than it was 10 years ago, much less eons ago. Judging history by good or bad is not what a scholar does. A scholar informs us how life might have been lived - the daily tasks, the customs, the diet, the longevity, the tools ... And makes connections that have verifiable meaning. Harari finds our ancestors guilty of the extinction of the Australian megafauna.Why ... did (the giant diprotodon of Australia) disappear 45,000 years ago? ... The evidence is circumstantial, but it's hard to imagine that Sapiens, just by coincidence, arrived in Australia at the precise point that all these animals were dropping dead of the chills. p.66But he doesn't stop there.... mass extinctions akin to the ... Australian decimation occurred again and again in the ensuing millennia - whenever people settled another part of the Outer World. In these cases Sapiens guilt is irrefutable. p.66Long before the Industrial Revolution, Homo sapiens held the record among all organisms for driving the most plant and animal species to their extinctions. We have the dubious distinction of being the deadliest species in the annals of biology. p.74If things continue at the present pace, it is likely that whales, sharks, tuna and dolphins will follow the diprotodons, ground sloths and mammoths to oblivion. Among all the world's large creatures, the only survivors of the human flood will be humans themselves, and the farmyard animals that serve as galley slaves in Noah's Ark. p.74In his chapter ""History's Biggest Fraud"" he decries the transition from hunter gatherer to agriculture as a step backwards in human welfare... the transition to agriculture brought about a plethora of ailments, such as slipped discs, arthritis and hernias. p.81Harari spends many pages on making his argument - ten. Had Harari been in charge at the time of the Agricultural Revolution he would not have let it happen.Humankind was better off as hunter gatherers says Harari. It would be pointless to argue with him on this matter. The matter is undecidable. 'Better' is a value judgement with no basis for a conclusion. In the sandbox children have serious arguments about whether green is better than red. Evidently the matter will never be resolved. There is no substance to it. So it is with Harari's writing. No substance.Imagine facing the problem of 'why grass is green' from the perspective, 'It ought to be blue'. Without explicitely stating it, Harari takes it as axiomatic that species extinctions are 'bad'. And then finds that man is ""guilty"" of causing many of them. But extinctions are natural phenomenon. Is it not the destiny of humans - as it is of every species - to perturb their environment? Even to extinguish other species? A scholar does not deprecate the workings of nature. A scholar strives to perceive nature as natural. If he feels he must complain about it then a scholar knows he doesn't understand it. Not so Harari. A truly scholarly book on world history is ""The Wealth and Poverty of Nations"" by David Landes (1998) Norton, N.Y.Harari's fundamental failing (or comedic acuity) is to confuse scholarship with advocacy. He wants desperately that humankind do something; alter its ways and save itself. He is sure of the problem: that humankind is destroying its environment. So he bends history to portray humankind as misbehaving. It is pseudo-scholarship. Harari has read widely but not thought deeply My view on humankind's future is quite different. It may very well go to extinction. Everything else in nature has a lifetime. Is humankind not natural? But, if anything will extend the lifetime of humankind, it will be the power of thought. And that power derives from scholarship uninfected by value judgement. Trying honestly to know how the world works without distorting the findings by personal fancy on how it ought to work. Mankind doesn't lack advocacy; it lacks understanding. "

43,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12800930-bharath,5,"Sapiens is a very interesting book – and one which everyone must read. Where it scores is in it's frank and insightful narrative, which calls out without hesitation what we homosapiens are good at and where are going wrong. Homosapiens (us) are the only human species who survived. We reached all corners of the Earth and have developed enormous power – and yet at a huge cost. The evidence suggests that we were responsible for the extinction of many life forms such as the mammoth. I was very surprised by the author's comments around the agricultural revolution. One would have assumed this helped organize the way we lived and ensured we got food where we were, instead of travelling far and wide for it. He makes good points to suggest that this made the farmers busier, made them weaker, more prone to disease and also heightened the risk in case of crop failure. The surmise around stories which bind us is very insightful. The reason Sapiens collect in large groups is because they bind themselves with myths and stories – around history, religion, nationhood etc. This allowed people who are strangers otherwise to get together and later form large communities and cities. Some of the matter is obviously speculative (eg: Aryan invasion of India is disputed by many historians), but then that is the best one can do in retracing history.The central sections around how capitalism grew, and the concept of money are too detailed and can get a little tiring. The book nevertheless returns to some excellent passages around our delusions, ambition and happiness. All of us have our own delusions, nor have we given up our destructive tendencies since ages. For instance, we have scientific confirmation that animals have physical as well as psychological needs – and yet we deny them that. Animal farming is one of the most cruel acts we engage in, but refuse to acknowledge or introspect.We do more and more, but are never satisfied and are not happy. He opines that the insights Buddhism provides around our suffering due to our tendency to crave is reality. The book ends with sentences which certainly need to provoke us to think. We are gaining more and more power – we will successfully increase our lifespans further or even defeat natural death. Yet, we do not know what we want and continue to inflict misery on fellow animals and the ecosystem for our comfort and even worse pleasure. Can we learn?"

Harari takes the reader through thousands of years of human development with analysis and introspection second to none. His own commentary is thought-provoking and well formulated, so even if one disagrees with his assessments of human achievement it is impossible to overlook their scholarly nature. I learned a lot from reading this book.I particularly liked his observations of our progress. He is direct and unmerciful in his pronouncements, and although many of his reflections on humanity were unflattering I found myself agreeing with most of them.Tremendous eye-opening book. Highly, highly recommended."
45,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35276649-amin,2,"""فارسی در ادامه""Evolution, as a method, not a theoryEvolution is mainly regarded as a theory, for explaining a phenomenon such as the survival of a species over another one, which means an epistemological approach towards understanding the reality. However, evolution can be used as a ""method"" for describing different phenomena around us; a neo-Darwinian approach which counts on evolution as a methodology of study, rather than a theory. Such a perspective is becoming popular very rapidly, especially since simple to grasp and believable for the majority of people. However, evolution as a theory and as a method have a big difference, which I try to explain with an example. An exampleSuppose we'd like to study the sleeping behavior of modern human beings. From an evolutionary perspective, or evolution as a method of understanding, there might be different viewpoints, or stories about it. For instance, someone can say our sleeping habits are the same as the stone-age ancestors, since they lived for hundreds of thousands of years and any further changes in the later periods are negligible. Another person may argue we sleep with the same pattern as the agricultural ancestors, since they settled in one place for the first time, with a substantial change in the lifestyle, which roughly still persists. The third person may argue the modern sleeping behavior is different from all previous periods, due to the speed of technological advances after the industrial revolution with a profound impact on our lifestyle. All these interpretations of stories seem more plausible and logical than an event-based or top-down interpretation, such as ""God had created us with the existing sleeping pattern!"" These evolutionary interpretations focus on the incremental changes, which makes them more believable for people, but it doesn't make one of them true, and the two others wrong, and we know it cannot be the case that all of them are correct. So, this the my main comment about evolution as a method of explaining history, which makes it easy to read and understand, but doesn't necessarily prove the arguments. In order to prove or disprove, a more scientific approach is needed with a more detailed scrutiny of the subject. As a result, for a person with no background knowledge, these evolutionary stories might look very profound and mind-blowing!Evolutionary method of this bookThis is the situation I see in this book; where one can see a melange of story-telling of the author, his ideological views about the history and some scientific knowledge. such an evolutionary method looks insufficient and unconvincing, when faced with difficult questions, especially when a historian uses it. For instance, in the first chapters in response to the reasons behind the cognitive revolution, he simply asserts we don't know, but most probably it was based on an accident! Or in the cultural debate around the evolution of sexes and genders, he evades to discuss the case of homosexuality, probably since it could be a difficult topic to discuss from an evolutionary perspective.The ideological view of a liberal history This perspective, of course cannot be unbiased, since it is supposed to choose among different plausible stories. IN general, my opinion is that the author's framework is to consider all possible phenomena based on an evolutionary thinking as natural, and all other things, limiting factors, etc. as unnatural. For instance, a natural culture is the one which doesn't limit human beings, since ""evolution enables, but culture binds!"". In addition, he uses a sarcastic and ironic tune around all non-evolutionary phenomena. The most obvious example all over the book is religion, where he considers God as a planner who blocks the evolutionary path, as the natural path. Of course he doesn't consider some important, but again more difficult questions, such as whether these two are necessarily conflicting or mutually exclusive.Two other points regarding this issue: first, when addressing an interdisciplinary topic, in order to show the arguments are valid, they should be valid from different disciplinary perspectives; in other words, if experts from each discipline say the parts related to their expertise is non-sense, then the whole interdisciplinary argument could be refuted. For instance, about Islam he mentions Muslims have a huge capacity to believe in an omnipotent God, and at the same time in an independent evil! Then they believe this God needs our help! to fight against the evil, and the result would be jihads and the Crusades. Such arguments arise from a very superficial and opportunistic understanding of Islam and religions. So, the simplest approach for argumentation would be to walk along with the line of obvious contradiction between science and religion, and escape all the difficult questions and confusions it may arise. Second, we don't see such a sarcastic approach towards Judaism, which makes the author's approach even more biased. The reason might be some sort of self-censorship, since the book was originally written in Hebrew and in Israel. Lessons from a writing styleAbout from these issues, I think we can learn a lot from this writing style. it shows even a historian can arise lots of attention from general audience, and teach them how to take an evolutionary method for understanding complex phenomena around us, although he doesn't elaborate about the limitations of this approach.تکامل، به عنوان یک روش، و نه یک نظریهتکامل را میشود همچو یک نظریه برای توضیح یک پدیده، مثلا بقای یک گونه جانوری، درنظر گرفت، یعنی رویکردی معرفت شناسانه که نوع دانش ما درباره چیستی پدیده را بیان می کند. اما می توان آنرا به عنوان یک روش برای توضیح پدیده ها هم درنظر گرفت؛ یعنی رویکردی نئوداروینیستی که تکامل را به صورت یک متودولوژی مطالعه در نظر می گیرد، و نه یک نظریه. این روش در حال گسترش است و به خاطر سادگی و باورپذیری طرفداران زیادی پیدا کرده و پیدا خواهد کرد. اما تکامل بعنوان نظریه و به عنوان یک متود تفاوتی بزرگ با هم دارند. با یک مثال توضیح میدهم یک مثالفرض کنید درباره ""خواب طبیعی"" انسان تحقیق می کنیم. توضیحات مختلفی به لحاظ تکاملی - تکامل بعنوان یک روش مطالعه - می تواند درباره آن وجود داشته باشد. مثلا عده ای بگویند خواب ما همچو خواب انسان دوران عصر غارنشینی است که صدها هزار سال به یک شیوه بوده و تغییرات بعد از انقلاب کشاورزی و دوران مدرن اثری نمی تواند بر روی آن داشته باشد. دسته دوم می گویند خواب ما شبیه دوران کشاورزی است که انقلابی شگرف در نوع زندگی یکجا نشینی بوجود آمد و تغییرات بعدی هم تغییری در نوع خوابیدن به وجود نیاوردند. دسته سوم هم می گوید گذشته طولانی مهم نیست، تغییر تکنولوژیکی شگرف و پیشرفتهای مدرن آن قدر تاثیرات کوتاه مدت بر زندگی داشته اند که خواب ما متفاوت از تمام دوران است. تمام این سه تفسیر در این زمانه، قابل پذیرش تر از تفسیری سنتی و مبتنی بر وقایع یکباره است، مثل اینکه بگوییم خداوند انسان را با این شیوه خوابیدن فعلی آفریده است! سه تفسیر تکاملی که بر تغییرات تدریجی تاکید دارند، باورپذیر تر اند، اما مسئله اینجاست که این باورپذیری نسبی، باعث صحیح بودن یکی و اشتباه بودن دوتای دیگری نمی شود، و می دانیم هر سه نمی توانند همزمان درست باشند. بنابراین، تکامل به عنوان یک روش توضیح پدیده ها آنها را خواندنی و باورپذیر می کند، اما لزوما آنها را درست نمی کند. بلکه برای تعیین صحت آنها نیاز به تحقیق علمی و کارشناسانه داریم. در نتیجه برای کسی که درباره موضوع هیچ چیزی نمیداند، داستان می تواند بسیار آموزنده و درست به نظر بیایدروش تکاملی در محتوای کتاباین دقیقا نسبت بین وضعیت من و این کتاب است. روشی تکاملی که کتاب را تلفیقی از داستان سرایی نویسنده و عقاید ایدئولوژیک وی در مطالعه تاریخ، با چاشنی پیشرفتهای علمی می کند. روش تکاملی هم وقتی به سوالات دشوار می رسد، مخصوصا وقتی از جانب یک مورخ باشد، پاسخهای قانع کننده ندارد. مثلا در ابتدای کتاب که در توضیح دلیل ایجاد انقلاب شناختی، به سادگی از کنار آن می گذرد و می گوید نمی دانیم اما احتمالا بخاطر یک تصادف بوده است! یا مثلا در بحث های فرهنگی و تمایلات جنسی توضیحی برای همجنس گرایی ارائه نمی کند، چون به نسبت توضیح تمایلات مردانه و زنانه به مراتب دشوارتر استنگاه ایدئولوژیک به تاریخی لیبرالاین شیوه داستان گویی تکاملی، نمی تواند چندان بیطرف باشد چون قرار است از بین داستانهای گوناگون انتخاب کند. به طور کلی روش نویسنده اینگونه است که هر چه ممکن است طبیعی در نظر گرفته می شود و هرچه محدودکننده و موکد ناممکن هاست غیرطبیعی است و باید رد شود. مثلا فرهنگ در نهایت نباید انسان را از چیزی منع کند، تا طبیعی به نظر برسد. چرا که بیولوژی توانمند می کند اما فرهنگ منع می کند. نسبت به هرچیزی هم که غیرتکاملی می تواند باشد، رویکردی طعنه آمیز و مخرب بکار می برد. نمونه بارزش مذاهب هستند، که خداوند را بعنوان ماهیتی برنامه ریز برای جهان، که طبیعی بودن مسیر آن را مختل می کند، کنار می گذارد اما تکامل را مسیر طبیعی درنظر می گیرد. به سوال دشوارتر هم کاری ندارد که مثلا آیا لزوما این دو متناقض هستند؟ خب سوال ساده ای نیست و کنار می گذارد. البته دو نکته در بحث ادیان جای فکر بیشتر دارد، چرا که نشان می دهد وقتی درباره حوزه های مختلفی صحبت می کنیم و به قولی بحث چند رشته ای داریم، بحث از هر حوزه مجزا باید به تنهایی درست باشد، و برای کسانی که در آن حوزه صاحب نظراند، به قول معروف خزعبلات به نظر نرسند. مثلا در حوزه دین و مسیحیت می گوید ادیان چندخدایی در ادیان وحدانی شکل گرفته اند. مثلا خدایان تبدیل به افراد مقدس شدند و اگر سردرد داشتی می بایست سنت آگوستین و اگر دندان درد داشتی سنت آپولونیا را دعا کنی! یا درباره اسلام می گوید دینداران ظرفیت بالایی برای اعتقاد به تناقض دارند! شاهد اینکه به خالقی توانا معتقدند و همزمان به شیطانی مستقل! بعد همین دین داران معتقدند خدای خوب به کمک ما برای مبارزه با شیطان یا خدای بد نیاز دارد که نتیجه اش میشود حرکتهای جهادی و جنگهای صلیبی. از طرفی ترجیح میدهد روی خط بین تضاد علم و دین حرکت کند. مثلا می گوید اگر به محمد و مسیح و بودا می گفتین برای فهم ذهن بشر و درمان بیماری هایش باید آمار یاد بگیریم، گیج می شدند و جوابی نداشتند. نکته دوم اینکه همین رویکرد طعنه آمیز در مواجهه با دین یهود شکل خودسانسوری به خود می گیرد و برای کتابی که در اسرائیل به زبان عبری چاپ شده است، اشاره خاصی به دین یهود، در میان اشارات فراوان به سایر ادیان وجود نداردیادگیری از روش نگارشی هوشمندانه با همه این نقدها و بحثهای زیادی که پیرامون کتاب شده است، برای ما و نسل جدید نویسندگان ما یک درس بزرگ دارد. این روش نگارش، حتی اگر به حوزه تخصصی درحال افولی مثل تاریخ تعلق داشته باشیم، باعث خوانده شدن فراوان، و بحثهای جدید می شود. بجای نگارش کتابهایی با زبان خسته کننده، شبه تحقیقاتی، پرسانسور و ابهام آمیز، می بینیم که وقتی متنی شجاعانه نوشته شود، حرفهای تازه داشته باشد، در قالبی قابل فهم و دسترس برای خواننده های عمومی نگاشته شده باشد و مرتبط با زندگی روزمره باشد، مخاطب خودش را پیدا می کند و می تواند مفاهیم ساده و پیچیده را به هم بیامیزد. بنابراین به نظرم کتاب بسیار روان و خواندنی است، حتی نسخه انگلیسی آن که بخاطر فرار از سانسور احتمالی بدان پناه بردم، و چیزهای زیادی درباره نگاه به تاریخ و وقایع آن می توان از آن یاد گرفت، حتی اگر با بسیاری از بخشهای آن موافق نباشیم و داستان خودمان را داشته باشیم"

He is also not afraid to make controversial statements, which get you thinking about some deep questions.I think my main complaint is that he comes across as a little too sure of his own opinions, stating them as facts. Indeed he himself says that today's scientific culture is one of ""ignorance"", meaning we know there are things we don't know (just like Donald Rumsfeld), so how can he present various cosmological theories as indisputable facts?"

49,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18643650-mark-porton,5,"Yuval Noah Harari’s Masterpiece, Sapiens A Brief History of Humankind, is exactly that, a Masterpiece!! If you like writers such as Jared Diamond and love history are a fan of non-fiction - you will LOVE THIS!!!For the past week I’ve been treated to a visit to the birth of our planet and then shot by a cannon to witness the formation of our planet, the beginning of biology, the evolution of Homo Sapiens, I’ve said goodbye to Neanderthals (bit sad), seen empires come and go, been through the scientific and industrial revolutions, delved into religions and examined what’s going on today and what may happen into the future. This author can inform and tell a story. I even think he may be a bit better than Jared Diamond (let me settle down a bit before giving a final opinion on that – am a bit excited!!).There are countless significant milestones described in this book. However, the author repeatedly refers to two events – The Cognitive Revolution where Humankind developed language, abstract thought, created gods, made art and many other things we recognise today as ‘being human’. The other is The Agricultural Revolution, which sounds simple, but its implications are massive. This revolution enables an increasingly smaller percentage of the population to grow food for others in society enabling these people to do other things like make iron, think, bake and all the other duties that make up a developing society. The Cognitive Revolution occurred about 70,000 years ago and the Agricultural Revolution around 12,000 years ago. In between, we were Hunters and Gatherers.Around 2.5 million years ago humans evolved. Some of our siblings included Homo rudolfensis (East Africa), Homo erectus (East Asia) and Homo neanderthalensis. Homo erectus proved to be the most durable of the human species, lasting 2 million years (wow – makes us seems so insignificant really). Homo sapiens started kicking goals in East Africa around 200,000 years ago. Yep – that’s how young we are!!! The author makes the assertion “it’s doubtful Homo sapiens will be here in 1,000 years from now; but definitely not in 2 million years-time. Homo sapiens managed to drastically disrupt whatever environment they moved into (now there’s a surprise) relatively quickly. We were responsible for the extinction of 50% of Megafauna before we invented the wheel, started writing or making iron tools. In fact, our first wave of colonisation was one of the greatest ecological disasters to befall the animal kingdom. Seems to me, we are still carrying on this work – with more zeal than ever before. It seems, that’s what we do.The author tackles the hard to define notion of happiness. He says historians have neglected this indicator over time, to be fair it seems a hard thing to measure. But he believes the increase in complexity of human evolution from the Agricultural Revolution has really resulted in a decrease in human ‘happiness’. I understand what he is saying – seems during our time as hunters and gatherers we would have had spare time to relax after we ‘hunted and gathered’. The advent of more complex societies seems to have burdened us with tasks, jobs, deadlines, costs, responsibilities. If you look at our lives today, we are surrounded by technology, money responsibilities, change, screens, alarms, traffic the list is endless. It’s not difficult, in my view, to mount an argument that we humans are perhaps under more pressure, busier, and maybe un-happier than ever before. That’s not to mention the misery we have inflicted on millions of others over the centuries in wars, slavery and various other forms of subjugation.It was good to see how the author recognised (as a self-confessed vego) the misery and degradation we have subject animals to, especially since the advent of intensive farming of livestock. We do so, without any regard for their natural desires, and needs – whether it be chickens, cattle, sheep or pigs. We, frankly, abuse these poor creatures. Some of the statistics he quotes are mind-blowing.I promise only to mention a couple of other things…………………………………Harari mentions, humans tend to have the natural inclination to self-manage any society/group they are living in up to around 150 individuals. After that, we have found the need to develop ‘myths’ or human constructs to organise ourselves, create discipline, order, cohesion. Some myths he provides as examples are religions/gods, money, governments, organisations amongst others. This again, makes a bit of sense to me. As without a cause or something to follow – perhaps we are just an uncontrollable rabble?Lastly (I promise), he believes there are 3 mechanisms used by humans over the years to create order and control of the populous. These are Money (e.g. gold, cash), Empires and Religion. Must say, I reckon he nails that too.To be fair though, this book covers some extremely complex issues. I have only given you snapshots of certain assertions the author makes, and I’ve produced various facts out of thin air. The author makes these points after formulating arguments with ample evidence. It’s therefore a long book, not quick reading but totally, totally, worthwhile.An incredible piece of work.5 Stars"
50,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5759543-sam-quixote,3,"In an attempt to get a gold star from teacher and prove he’s a big brain, Yuval Noah Harari tackles the mind-boggling task of writing a narrative history of humanity – homo (hehe) sapiens – condensing some 70,000 years (to be fair most of that was undocumented and could easily be covered) into a modest sub-500 page book! Which he nevertheless almost achieves, albeit in what turns out to be a rather dry and dull read in Sapiens. Being a student of history, as well as having read a few sociological books on humanity already, I found Sapiens to be unengaging at times with its basic approach. That’s not to say though that I didn’t learn anything from this book. I thought it was interesting that the reason the Renaissance took place in western Europe, along with most major scientific advances, was due to Europeans’ adoption of capitalism. Hence why nowhere else in the world were people motivated enough to make these discoveries and take them as far as they could: no money in it. Start offering up rewards and, voila – progress! Harari takes quite a dim view to the Agricultural Revolution and looks at the diets of our hunter-gatherer ancestors as vastly more healthy. I sort of agree with his reasoning in that mass-produced, processed food, particularly grain and wheat, is much less healthy than meat and vegetables (not to mention that this diet is probably behind the obesity epidemic currently engulfing the world). If we went back to eating primarily meat and vegetables, there’d be a lot less fat people around with fewer chronic diseases. On the other hand an abundance of easily accessible, somewhat nourishing food also afforded many of us the time to focus on other things, besides looking for sustenance, in order to advance our collective knowledge that much quicker. Yin, yang. And I take his point too that technology and culture has advanced much faster than humans have. He thinks if we paid more attention to our basic needs – being outdoors, interacting face-to-face with people, exercising – we’d be a lot happier than most of us who sit in chairs at home, at work, or on the way to and from either, staring at screens all day and communicating in the abstract via email, phones, etc. And I agree – we’re not as advanced as we think we are; evolution is slow so it’s worth paying attention to our true nature. His closing chapters on technology and a merging of humans and machines didn’t exactly blow my mind given how many episodes of the Joe Rogan Experience I’ve listened to – Joe goes on about the forthcoming war with our machine overlords alllll the time! And, with the way humans can operate artificial limbs by thought alone, that’s Harari’s conclusion: that humans have evolved from apes into gods. Once you start looking back at the book from that standpoint, the entire narrative feels a bit pat. But I’ll give him some leeway on this as it is such an enormous topic. And that’s the biggest issue I have with this book: the subject’s size. It did feel a lot like the author was meandering on a number of topics (Culture! Money! Religion! Anything!), like I was reading some interesting, if unconnected, titbits of random trivia that could’ve benefitted from tighter focus. It doesn’t help that the author is at times maddeningly glib. Like when he asks what makes humans happy. His answer: hormones. Well, duh! But what triggers those hormones is what we really want to know!! Ultimately Sapiens is an informative read but I honestly can’t say I enjoyed reading it much which I think is down to the subject being too broad. The history of expansion was largely interesting, as were some of the parts on human behaviour, though I found large chunks of the science, economic theory and politics to be too esoteric and/or dreary. At any rate, kudos to Harari for his ambition and erudition, though, because I don’t find everything fascinating, I found myself compelled by only some of Sapiens and just ground through the rest. "

54,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793473-clif-hostetler,4,"The trajectory of our species according to this book can be traced as a succession of three revolutions: the cognitive revolution (when we got smart), the agricultural revolution (when we got nature to do what we wanted), and the scientific revolution (when we got dangerously powerful). The author Mr Harari predicts that humanity will see one more epochal event. We will vanish within a few centuries, either because we’ve gained such godlike powers as to become unrecognizable or because we’ve destroyed ourselves through environmental mismanagement.Harari observes that, “beginning about 70,000 years ago, Homo sapiens started doing very special things.” Our ancestors suddenly overcame their inertia and moved out of Africa, meanwhile inventing boats, battle axes and beautiful art. What happened? Harari suggests that a yet-undiscovered “Tree of Knowledge mutation” altered the “inner wiring” of our brains, allowing us “to communicate using an altogether new type of language,” one that allowed humans to cooperate in groups. With this change in place, humankind spread across the planet. It’s my understanding that there is scholarly debate on the details of how and when this “cognitive revolution” occurred. Homo sapiens have been in existence for more than 200,000 years, so whatever the details of the change, it took awhile to occur. Harari is probably a bit too prejudice in favor the hunter-gatherer way of living when discussing the Agricultural Revolution. He calls the domestication of cereal crops “history’s biggest fraud.” He gives his reasons for making this statement, but I’m not convinced. If you believe that planet earth would be a much better place with no humans present, you will probably agree with the author’s point of view. Vegans will agree with his critic of industrial farming methods.Harari believes our capacity for language allowed us to invent common “myths” or “fictions.” With these terms he is referring to ideas and institutions such as money, religion and empire. These allowed people to unite across continents in ways that are beyond the capacity of non-sapiens (i.e. other mammals).Harari believes that the Scientific Revolution happened when Europeans began to favor present observations over past traditions. He believes Columbus’s unintended bumping into the previously unknown continents of North and South Americas was the pivotal event that obliged Europeans to search for new knowledge. The wisdom of the ancients was thought to be the apex of human knowledge prior to discovery of the Americas. But the ancients didn't know about the Americas so obviously they didn't know everything. Thus the new way of thinking was to find and develop new knowledge leading to enhanced future power and wealth—thus the Scientific Revolution. Europe’s explorer-conquerors according to Harari were something new in the history of the world. “The Romans, Mongols, and Aztecs voraciously conquered new lands in search of power and wealth—not of knowledge. In contrast, European imperialists set out to distant shores in the hope of obtaining new knowledge along with new territories.”So where is all this headed? Harari observes that advances in science and technology has provided a better life based on material comforts. But better living has not made humans more content. Citing recent research in psychology, he observes that happiness “depends on the correlation between objective conditions and subjective expectations.” Because we moderns expect more, we aren’t satisfied by material conditions and objects that would have overjoyed our grandparents. So what does Harari project for the future of the human project? Having remade the Earth, he says, we will remake ourselves. Within decades we will see a radical amplification of human abilities, whether by direct mental connection to the Internet, the adoption of cyborg technology, the manipulation of the human genome, or all three. Eventually we will change so much that Homo sapiens will effectively cease to exist. Our descendants may become incomprehensible to us. The only thing stopping this picture, in Mr. Harari’s view, is the possibility of environmental catastrophe, which also may wipe out our species.This cautiously optimistic view of the future is consistent with the rest of the book's style of writing. Some readers may be a bit jarred by the author's inclusion of capitalism, communism and religion all within the term ""fictional myths."" The book has several chapters on these items so labeling them as ""fictional"" doesn't mean that author ignores them. Rather they are fictional in the mind of the author because they only exist in the minds and behaviors of the sapiens roaming the earth. If it weren't for humans they wouldn't exist. As a matter of fact, the author's description of the basis and history of capitalism is one of the most clear—almost elementary—explanations I've ever read. The narrative at times is a bit jarring in the way it throws around descriptive words which probably bothers experts in the field. But it makes for interesting reading.Below is a quotation from this book that places Capitalist consumerist ideal as a religion that people can actually live up to, unlike other traditional religions: Most previous ethical systems presented people with a pretty tough deal. They were promised paradise but only if they cultivated compassion and tolerance, overcame craving and anger, and restrained their selfish interests. This was too tough for most. The history of ethics was a sad tale of wonderful ideals that nobody can live up to. Most Christians did not imitate Christ, most Buddhist failed to follow Buddha, and most Confusions would cause Confucius a temper tantrum. In contrast most people today successfully live up to the Capitalist consumerist ideal. The new ethic promises paradise on the condition that the rich remain greedy and spend their time making more money, and the masses give free reign to their cravings and passions to buy more and more. This is the first religion in history who’s followers actually do what they are asked to do.(added emphasis is mine) Below is an extended quotation that I found interesting taken from this book. Note the third paragraph below which indicates that the numbers of Christians martyred at the hands of the Roman Empire appear minuscule when compared to the extent of Christian on Christian violence. It's clear that throughout history the worst persecution of the Christian faith in terms of numbers killed was done by Christians against other Christians with whom they didn't agree. ""Polytheism is conducive to far-reaching religious tolerance. Since polytheists believe, on the one hand, in one supreme and completely disinterested power, and on the other hand in many partial and biased powers, there is no difficulty for the devotees of one god to accept the existence and efficacy of other gods. Polytheism is inherently open-minded, and rarely persecutes 'heretics' and 'infidels' .""Even when polytheists conquered huge empires, they did not try to convert their subjects. The Egyptians, the Romans and the Aztecs did not send missionaries to foreign lands to spread the worship of Osiris, Jupiter or Huitzilopochtli (the chief Aztec god), and they certainly didn't dispatch armies for that purpose. Subject peoples throughout the empire were expected to respect the empire's gods and rituals, since these gods and rituals protected and legitimised the empire. Yet they were not required to give up their local gods and rituals. ...""The only god that the Romans long refused to tolerate was the monotheistic and evangelising god of the Christians. The Roman Empire did not require the Christians to give up their beliefs and rituals, but it did expect them to pay respect to the empire's protector gods and to the divinity of the emperor. This was seen as a declaration of political loyalty. When the Christians vehemently refused to do so, and went on to reject all attempts at compromise, the Romans reacted by persecuting what they understood to be a politically subversive faction. And even this was done half-heartedly. In the 300 years from the crucifixion of Christ to the conversion of Emperor Constantine, polytheistic Roman emperors initiated no more than four general persecutions of Christians. Local administrators and governors incited some anti-Christian violence of their own. Still, if we combine all the victims of all these persecutions, it turns out that in these three centuries, the polytheistic Romans killed no more than a few thousand Christians. In contrast, over the course of the next 1,500 years, Christians slaughtered Christians by the millions to defend slightly different interpretations of the religion of love and compassion. (added emphasis is mine)""The religious wars between Catholics and Protestants that swept Europe in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries are particularly notorious. All those involved accepted Christ's divinity and His gospel of compassion and love. However, they disagreed about the nature of this love. Protestants believed that the divine love is so great that God was incarnated in flesh and allowed Himself to be tortured and crucified, thereby redeeming the original sin and opening the gates of heaven to all those who professed faith in Him. Catholics maintained that faith, while essential, was not enough. To enter heaven, believers had to participate in church rituals and do good deeds. Protestants refused to accept this, arguing that this quid pro quo belittles God's greatness and love. Whoever thinks that entry to heaven depends upon his or her own good deeds magnifies his own importance, and implies that Christ's suffering on the cross and God's love for humankind are not enough.""These theological disputes turned so violent that during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, Catholics and Protestants killed each other by the hundreds of thousands. On 23 August 1572, French Catholics who stressed the importance of good deeds attacked communities of French Protestants who highlighted God's love for humankind. In this attack, the St Bartholomew's Day Massacre, between 5,000 and 10,000 Protestants were slaughtered in less than twenty-four hours. When the pope in Rome heard the news from France, he was so overcome by joy that he organised festive prayers to celebrate the occasion and commissioned Giorgio Vasari to decorate one of the Vatican's rooms with a fresco of the massacre (the room is currently off-limits to visitors). More Christians were killed by fellow Christians in those twenty-four hours than by the polytheistic Roman Empire throughout its entire existence.""The above excerpt from the book is copied from www.delanceyplace.com.The following short review is from PageADay's Book Lover's Calendar for August 18, 2018:""A brief history of humankind” might sound like an impossible feat, but Yuval Noah Harari’s treatise on human evolution is shockingly easy and enjoyable to read—and his wry sense of humor will keep you smiling. He begins with one question: Out of the six species of humans that existed a hundred thousand years ago, how did Homo sapiens come to dominate the planet? It’s not a simple answer, but historian Dr. Harari is more than up to the task, offering fascinating insights into what it means to be human.
SAPIENS: A BRIEF HISTORY OF HUMANKIND,
 by Yaval Noah Harari (Harper, 2015)"
55,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,2,"It’s all here: Evolution, anthropology, archeology, ancient history, medieval history, modern history, economics, sociology, biology, geopolitics, religion, and the future of mankind. Just about everything you want to know about humankind is skimmed through in 400 dashing pages. Fascinating tidbits to peak your interest are sprinkled throughout. Everything complicated is made simple. Unfortunately these scattershot slices of history, the humanities and science are not enough to support Harari’s glib conclusions. After a brief excursion into evolution, Harari describes the life of hunter gatherer societies prior to the agricultural revolution. He depicts these people as happier than their successors, leading “more interesting lives”, collaborating well with family and friends, enjoying “ideal nutrition” while working fewer hours. He paints an idealized picture of this catch as catch can existence. He views the agriculture revolution as a step down for sapiens. He notes that many experts don’t agree. They think the hunter gatherer life was harsh, violent and cruel. But Harari doesn’t elaborate on their views. After superficial analyses of just about every aspect of human society over the ages Harari ends with a picture of a surreal future of post human cyborgs. He shows concern for the poor souls who would get left behind. And I just worry about the mundane: Climate change, mass extinctions, a world full of nuclear weapons and seething hostilities, a world where immense power is in the hands of destabilizing leaders like Donald Trump, King Jong-un and Vladimir Putin. Harari seems to think we can work all these problems out; that those nasty world wars are far in the past. He offers his favorite statistics to show that the world has never been more peaceful. Oddly one statistic he cites is that among a remaining indigenous tribe deep in the Amazon 25-50% of men die a violent death competing over property, women and honor. So much for the idyllic life of the hunter gatherers. I don’t want to dismiss everything Harari said. There were many things I agreed with. But I was disappointed. Most of the information provided read like boilerplate. Bold assertions were based on rudimentary analysis. His tone made these speculations sound substantial. It’s a slick presentation but shallow.

The beginning was so good, I was engaged and was immersed into learning about the psychology and development of humans and the way we created the society that exists today.Chapter 8 was my favourite and honestly was so informative and made you think. A couple chapters after that, couldn’t help but start getting bored.To get it over with, I just had it playing in the background when doing other things and I couldn’t help but barely take any of it in. It was boring about 60% onwards and I just didn’t care about what was being said.Overall would recommend but only the first half really, because that was really good.

All the while I was reading Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari, this song was playing in my head.Humankind has had a long journey. From his very late entry into the evolutionary fairy tale, this unlikely species has advanced at tremendous speed, adapting, adopting, breaking and making the world to their specifications; wiping out competition from equals and subjugating inferiors. And in a surprisingly short period (equivalent to the blink of an eye in evolutionary terms), they stand on the brink of a precipice: where the outcome can be either annihilation or prevalence.How did this ""naked ape"" (to borrow from Desmond Morris), weak physically in all aspects while compared to almost all the other mammals, achieve this? Well, the answer is a ""no-brainer"" - the outsize human brain. But even this development of intelligence, too, was not achieved overnight. From the caves in the hills to the caves of concrete, it has been a hectic journey.Harari charts this journey in the following steps:1. The Cognitive Revolution: Homo Sapiens was just one among six similar species on the face of the earth. But between 70,000 and 30,000 years ago, some kind of genetic mutation supposedly rewired human brains in such a way that abstract thinking became possible: language developed, not only to talk about concrete things but also about inchoate concepts: shared myths, stories and lore became possible: in short, the thing we call ""culture"" came into being. Human beings began to cooperate in large numbers, and thus overran all competing species like the Neanderthals.2. The Agricultural Revolution: The next big revolution was when the happy-go-lucky wanderers decided to settle down and become farmers. But it was not the automatic and inevitable transition as we have come to think of it as, according to Harari. The life of a farmer was much tougher than the one of the forager: he had to work harder, ate a less balanced diet, and was sick more often. Then why did it happen? Because once human beings discovered farming, they started staying put and multiplying - the species began growing exponentially because a settled life could support huge populations where even the weak survived. Before we knew it, we were farmers, without the chance of going back - like Harari says, ""we didn't domesticate wheat, it domesticated us.""3. The Unification of Humankind: By the unification of humankind, the author does not mean that all human beings are one society - oh no, far from it. But the settled lifestyle brought about by agriculture helped create kingdoms and nations - and empires. Mankind was unified by three means: through conquest by emperors, through trade and money, and by the spread of the proselytising religions. Even while we retained our differences, the earth became a connected whole.4. The Scientific Revolution: With all this happening, until about 500 years ago, there was not much change within settled human society. However, from A.C.E. 1500 onwards, it began to change drastically, because human beings admitted their ignorance - and began the search for knowledge, through scientific enquiry. And once imperialism and capitalism discovered that science could empower them, they had no qualms in backing it. So we owe our current society to science empowered by imperialism and funded by capitalism - and industry, the child of science and capitalism, which has changed the face of the world to such an extent that there is no going back.This brings me to the lyrics which I quoted above. Harari's book seemed to agree with the sentiments of the songwriter, expect for the ending - instead of the ""endless shore of loneliness"", we seem to be standing on a precipice. Whether we dive down to environmental disaster or grow wings and fly away to a new dawn of human experience is anybody's guess. After all, it has been chance all along - as Harari reiterates time and again, ""there is no justice in history"".***The extremely truncated review above does not do justice to this wonderful book. Yuval Noah Harari has written a tome which is scholarly yet as breathtakingly exciting as a suspense thriller - once in, you won't want to put it down. He reminds you, again and again, that history is a story; worth telling with all the sound and the fury. This book is eminently quotable (I had highlighted 180+ passages!) and it was with great reluctance that I forebore to include them in the review, for fear of ""literary elephantiasis"" (to borrow from Stephen King).You may find some of the author's conclusions contentious. That is all right; he is presenting them just as theories. That is the best you can do while dealing with history. But he does make you think - and for me, that is an invaluable plus point in a book."

Reading non-fiction can sometimes be a little tricky but this book was very engaging right from the start. It is a mix of the history, biology, philosophy which was fun and very informative.The author presents interesting facts that challenge the ones that we have been taught. For eg., I believed that the evolution of Homo Sapiens was linear but I learned that there were actually 6 different species of ‘humans’, out of which only one survived. I also loved the way the author presented his unbiased opinion regarding various events; he gives credit to Sapiens where it’s due but also calls them out for their actions.
“We study history not to know the future but to widen our horizons, to understand that our present situation is neither natural nor inevitable and that we consequently have many more possibilities before us than we imagine.”
The book analyses the three important revolutions that influenced humanity- the cognitive revolution, agricultural revolution, and the scientific revolution. It not only takes a look at how the lives of humans changed but also the impacts on the other species of animals, food chain, and ecosystem.The Cognitive revolution discusses in detail about how Homo Sapiens, then living as hunters-gatherers distinguished themselves from other species of humans to group together and managed to survive. Most of the human behavior today can be explained by taking a look at the way our ancestors lived as our brain is adapted to that lifestyle which subconsciously still influences us. The Agricultural revolution talks about the transition of the lifestyle of hunter-gatherer to that of a farmer and its ramifications. It caused the domestication of humans by plants and animals by humans. This led to the formation of large societies, social norms which defied the biological instincts. It also has an interesting discussion about religion, racism, sexism etc.The Scientific revolution takes a look at all the factors that led humans on a pursuit of knowledge. It discusses the link between science and imperialism, the emergence of capitalism which led to the industrial revolution which the author calls the Second Agricultural Revolution and appearance of consumerism.
“A meaningful life can be extremely satisfying even in the midst of hardship, whereas a meaningless life is a terrible ordeal no matter how comfortable it is.”
Apart from that, we learn a great deal about how history progressed; how the formation of empires, the creation of money and religion led to the unification of mankind. At last, the author has an interesting discussion on the psychology of happiness and how it compares to the happiness of the older generations.All in all, reading this book felt like reading a really entertaining history textbook. It was really fascinating to take a look at the history and realize how far we’ve come and it only makes you wonder at the endless possibilities. I felt like the book dragged a bit towards the end but it was worth it.I definitely recommend reading it.Read on blog"

64,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23395276-artur-olczyk,2,"Note: This is my first review on GR. Be considerate.Yuval Noah Harari's bestseller, Homo Sapiens, aims at providing a general history of us, Homo Sapiens, and our ancestors, reaching back as far as 2.5 million years ago. The author considers three major revolutions that set a course for what turned out to be human and civilization. In Harari's own words, this is a book that  tells the story of how these revolutions have affected humans and their fellow organisms. Considering the length of the book, it was quite a bold venture. Minor oversimplifications, then, were unavoidable but it does not justify cherry-picking the facts and scientific data.When Harari presents modern theories of the origins of human language, he rightly evokes Dunbar's gossip theory (vide: Human Evolutionary Psychology and Grooming, Gossip, and the Evolution of Language) and Pinker's there-is-a-lion-near-the-river theory (vide: The Language Instinct and Language Learnability and Language Development), although somehow fails to acknowledge Terrence Deacon's combined theory of the two (vide: The Symbolic Species). I agree with his notion that the truly unique feature of our language is not its ability to transmit information about men and lions. Rather, it's the ability to transmit information about things that do not exist at all. What I can't agree with is, he practically proclaims, in as-a-matter-of-fact way, that humans created the language to talk about gods and create religions; and that without religious myths, there would not be any development. Any large-scale human cooperation is rooted in common myths that exist only in peoples collective imagination. Churches are rooted in religious myth. This seems a bit far-fetched, considering the lack of direct evidence, which he himself admits over and over again.Next, he goes on to talk about how special the religious elites are because their existence  goes against the most fundamental principles of natural selection, since these dominant members of society willingly give up procreation. Instead, they choose to pass on the stories of the New Testament and of Catholic canon law. (His insistence on the overall positive uniqueness of religion is evident throughout the whole book, which seems to be a bit too one-sided to me.)Harari does not trouble himself to mention that it was not 
the passing on the stories
 that made the Catholic priests forego their procreation; the reasons were purely economical (and surely not Biblical). When the Church was at the beginning of the road, a priest was allowed to have a wife and children, so when he managed to accumulate a certain amount of wealth, his family would inherit it, not the Church. Clearly, that was not something that the religious elites could agree on, so they invented the celibacy (vide: Law, Sex, and Christian Society in Medieval Europe and The Body and Society). Also, if that sexual renunciation was effective, we would not be having recurring paedophile scandals in the Church.The biggest flaw of this book, in my opinion, is the author's take on and romanticizing of foraging groups. I applaud his evolutionary explanation of modern binge-eating but can't comprehend his Rousseauist, now widely-discredited claims of pre-state harmony of foragers. Harari says that they  lived in communes devoid of private property, monogamous relationships and even fatherhood. In such a band, a woman could have sex and form intimate bonds with several men (and women) simultaneously, and all of the band's adults cooperated in parenting its children. He provides a modern equivalent of the Aché Indians, as a hunter-gatherer group that is representative to his claim. I can also add the !Kung San in support of it (vide: The Kung San). Nevertheless, it does not change the fact that these two examples are the exception to the general rule represented by tribes, such as the elitist and stratified Yanomamö (vide: Noble Savages). Undoubtedly, peaceful tribes had existed in the past but considering modern paleoarcheological and evolutionary evidence that point out to a dominantly violent past of our pre-agricultural ancestors (vide: Sick Societies, War before Civilization, War in Human Civilization, and The Adapted Mind), one may wonder how those amenable tribesmen had fared against their brutal rivals. Evolutionarily speaking, they failed.The author ecstatically names the positives of nomadic lifestyle: shorter hours of work, fewer household chores (since you most probably do not have an actual household to take care of), more time to play, gossip, no plane accidents. He does not seem to consider that today, we have healthcare systems (one better than the other), laws to protect us, social services, and do not face a daily and risky gamble of being eaten alive by a hungry predator or poisoning ourselves with an unknown plant that was supposed to increase our rich diet, in author's words. I do not blindly praise today's world and know that we are living in a stressful monotony but, brutal as it may sound, it is tit for tat.There is no evidence that people became more intelligent with time. Foragers knew the secrets of nature long before the Agricultural Revolution, since their survival depended on an intimate knowledge of the animals they hunted and the plants they gathered, excitedly exclaims Harari. He actually equals intelligence with a duly acquired experience, learned by trials and errors. Back then, when a forager wanted to hunt for a big game or gather a plant, he had to taste it (someone must've done it first to preserve the experience). He may or may not have died while trying. Nowadays, using products of our intelligence we do not have to face such a risk.There are two more things in the book that seem flawed to me. First, Harari talks about some scientists, some scholars and some partisans that he takes his claims from but fails to say who those scientists and scholars actually are. I give him the benefit of the doubt but the book would be so much appealing if he shared with the reader his sources. Second, his attitude towards the collective is illogical. He praises it while talking about collective advantages of religion and its connection to an overall development but scorns it when faced with collectively-fixated modern world (e.g. the state is more focused on a general outcome, not on an individual's happiness).I do not mean to exonerate modern civilization by saying that it does not have flaws. It has flaws because we, humans, are flawed. The central point of the book, I think, is to teach us humility, and I could not agree more with Harari's remarks on that. Now that we are a dominant species on the planet, the burden of responsibility rests on our shoulders, though we have not so far lived up to the challenge. The most promising thing is, we have changed so much in the history of our evolution that it seems like we are capable of changing one more time and making this world hospitable again.P.S. The rest of the book is written rather coherently, especially chapters about more recent history that I had a real pleasure reading. The closer to modern times, the more informative and the less speculative the book is. Harari's remarks on the rights of men and the enslaving ascent of money are on the mark."

His book begins in a most promising way, weaving history and narrative in a way that breaks down preconceived notions of linear evolution. It's terrific at this point. At roughly page 120, the book begins to veer into a bizarre social justice screed, and the author begins citing as true facts things that are neither footnoted nor true. It became so poorly sourced and agenda-driven that I had to set it down, as it differed significantly from all that preceded it. It's not a history - it's ""Pop History."" Superficial with lots of bold assertions without any corroborating evidence. With five minutes on Google you can discover that some of the most outlandish stories are false. At many times in the book I felt the author departed from what scientific evidence/research supports and instead conveyed a more political/biased view of things.I would have liked to have him bring his educated opinions, emotions and humanity into the book more directly and openly, with facts and ideas that show how he arrived at these beliefs, rather than disguise his emotions as science and cherry pick a few facts to support himself. It cheapened what could otherwise have been a very good, thought provoking and otherwise well written book.Given his next book is about the future, I am going to avoid it. In the middle of the book, I even wanted to give it up. Towards the end I had to push myself through the book."

69,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15736187-robert-gustavo,1,"This is a terrible, terrible book. The author rehashes evolutionary psychology papers in an attempt to create a meaningful historical narrative out of them, and comes up with page after page of poorly supported generalizations. The subject of the book is so broad that it, by necessity, touches on a large number of fields and historical trends, but the author has only a minimal understanding of any of them, and then extrapolates from this minimal understanding. He gets many of the first-order facts right, but is often wildly inaccurate about the details.And then he just flat out makes things up, such as his description of pre-agricultural communities: ""the average forager could turn a flint stone into a spear within minutes."" He assumes no specialization within the community, and a rate of production, with no supporting evidence given for either.He makes broad claims about the role of Christianity in the founding of America and states that the idea of equality comes directly from a belief in God creating people, but does not note the contradiction of Jefferson literally rewriting the Bible to remove all miracles and signs of divinity.There are elements of good thought in the book, though, as the author has presumably spoken to some intelligent and well-informed people, but there is also a lot of stuff like this:""Medieval noblemen wore colourful robes of gold and silk, and devoted much of their time to attending banquets, carnivals and glamorous tournaments. In comparison, modern CEOs don dreary uniforms called suits that afford them all the panache of a flock of crows, and they have little time for festivities."" ""During the first half of the twentieth century, scholars taught that every culture was complete and harmonious, possessing an unchanging essence that defined it for all time.""The bad parts of this book not only outweigh the good parts, but they infect the good parts. Any worthwhile thought the author is regurgitating from evolutionary psychology papers he has read is placed alongside complete worthless drivel, and is likely to get lumped in with the drivel. Is the claim that homo sapiens big jump was the ability to believe stories unsupported because the author just didn't support it, or is it unsupported because it cannot be supported (Neanderthals could have had Neanderthal stories that we don't know about), or is it unsupported because it is completely made up?

Did I agree with all he had to say, hell no. And yet, I did agree with a lot of it. He delves into a broad history of humanity, that takes big turns looking at cultural, philosophical, and socio-political constructs. I really love this stuff. The part where he calls the agricultural revolution a complete disaster and one of the worst things to ever happen... ummm, I don't know on that. I don't think humans pre-agriculture were living some idyllic amazing lifestyle. Agriculture opened the doors for humanity to build denser communities which in turn turbocharged the exchange of ideas and allowed for the rapid increase in science and technology. It did also lead to a whole host of new issues, it didn't just turbocharge science, it turbocharged infectious diseases and zoonotic illnesses (from our domesticated animals), and it did lead to a vast agr0-industrial complex that treats animals like objects and completely shredded the environment and terraformed vast landscapes. The advent of agriculture had certain negative effects on human and animal health, that is for sure.So yeah, I didn't fully disagree with his assessment on the agricultural revolution, twas a bit too simplistic in my opinion. Same with his overviews on capitalism and consumerism, I do agree that these two things, unchecked, are very dangerous, but I do not believe they are what will destroy us. Without capitalism and consumerism, I'm sure we are smart (stupid?) enough to discover other methodologies that will lead us to our doom, ha. But yeah, we aren't exactly on the perfect path as things stand today, can't disagree with that! The best part about this book is it made me think, and it made me think about very interesting concepts and forced me to question the paradigms we have constructed for ourselves. I respect Harari and his way of thinking, and the writing was very well done and very accessible. "

The chapters and parts are properly structured, it's easily accessible and definitely a page-turner, but that's all there is. It's obvious that there's a lot of research behind it, and this is possibly the best way to stuff the promised content in a four hundred something pages (or not possible at all). Sapiens is one of the most discussed books, atleast over here, often hailed as life-changing book, but I can't find justification for this glorification.

76,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63883678-vartika,2,"I believe this is a rather unpopular opinion, but what is best-selling isn't always good. In this case, it isn't even average. In fact, the only reason I ever finished reading this was in order to cut through the inexplicable rave reviews Harari has gotten, and so I'm going to be as honestly scathing as I can be. I first chanced upon Sapiens in 2016, the year I started out at university. I was immediately (and naively) drawn in by the author's ambitious proposition—""A Brief History of Humankind""—but was only able to get myself a copy in June 2018. Now, it takes me a few days to read most books. Sometimes, with difficult books or heavy tomes, it takes me a week or so. This one is neither, but it still took me over a year to finish. There is a reason for that.  Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind  is a horrendously reductive text disguised as immensely readable 'history'. In hindsight, the title suggests just as much: whereas all historical and sociological scholarship is built on the premise of expanding knowledge, Yuval Noah Harari seems to have written this book in order to do the opposite. I understand that a volume like this would attract readership precisely because of that, but Sapiens isn't at all what it claims: instead of being a simple survey of our history on this planet, it is a simplistic, poorly researched storybook.The thing is, Harari starts out well enough. The first few chapters present an arresting and decently insightful understanding of early human civilisation and its development over the ages our present sentient state as homo sapiens. However, that is as good as it gets. To be perfectly candid, I'd say it gets much, much worse.Harari's approach post the initial chapters seems more suited to an amateur blog than a book of serious non-fiction: he writes in a strangely ironic tone, waxing irreverent with his unsubstantiated personal views on the human condition and supporting those claims with absurd and inadequate information, often from dubious sources. In fact, the bibliography of the book is not only suspiciously slim for a volume claiming to tell the history of humankind, it is also often irrelevant or incorrect. The truly, bizzarely problematic begins with the section on Agriculture: Harari claims that the agricultural revolution was the ""biggest fraud in human history""—he says so on the basis of imagining himself in place of the hunter-gatherer. Then, in typical biological determinist fashion, he blames the 'weak' Aztecs and Incas and other non-western societies for what happened to them. At one point, Sapiens argues that all mental orders imply imagined realities which do not really hold true, but dives into a celebration of these very realities a couple of chapters later. There is also a rather absurd endorsement of capitalism here—absurd, because it is backhanded and unsure, but forms the implicit foundations of the latter half of this book all the same. Religion has also been thrown in every now and then for good measure, and as mentioned before, imperialism is made to look like the good guy. Harari's general approach throughout the middle of the book is to bring up major problems in our present social environment and attempt to tear them down, but since systemic problems are valourised elsewhere, these attempts are clearly forced and rather unconvincing. While quick to denounce, Sapiens provides no constructive criticism or alternate approaches—and at least Nietzsche held his ground, unlike Harari who seems to be confused and all over the place. Towards the close, he mentions how Mary Shelley's  Frankenstein  shows us the kind of destruction human scientific progress can lead to—right after exalting the exact same thing for a good 100 pages!What erases any last shreds of credibility this book may have is the extent to which the author attempts to pass subjective opinions as objective fact. The tone of the book is inconsistent, too: the last part of the book is devoted to a 'study' of human happiness punctuated with one too many exclamation points and flat, pseudo-philosophical ideas. All in all, Sapiens lives up to only one of its promises: it is undeniably brief. However, it is by no means a credible 'history' of any kind, full as it is of conjecture. The only tenable arguments in this book are merely facts of common knowledge that the author tries to embellish and present as new information.Why are people still reading this?"
77,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1944947-barnaby-thieme,2,"Harari attempts to leap through hominid history in a few great bounds, organized into a few arbitrarily-chosen watersheds such as the scientific revolution, and by so doing to illustrate through example his underlying conceptual framework, which is evolutionary humanism. We can therefore ask two questions of the book: is the high-level history he presents interesting and useful, and is the conceptual framework he employs persuasive? For this reader, the answer to both of those questions is a resounding no. His two purposes are sufficiently at odds that his attempts to tell some kind of story of human evolution are erratic, arbitrary, and peripatetic, directed hither and thither as they are by his philosophical interests. After long trying I abandoned trying to hold the common thread of his story of human history when I at last concluded that there was no thread to follow, and the book instead consists largely of an assemblage of chronological anecdotes. I was surprised to find that Harari is a professor of history, because his work is highly theoretical and shows little grounding in empirical historiography. He makes numerous errors, such as interpreting the Code of Hammurabi as though it were intended as an actual legal document, when we know from copious extant Mesopotamian court records that it was not used so. More surprising, his presentation of the concept of chivalry in the Middle Ages is so ahistorical that I was genuinely stunned to learn that he is not only a specialist in the European medieval period, but focused on political ideology and treated it in several books. It does not show from his gross generalizations that repeatedly border in outright distortion, or indeed, cross right over the line. In tone, I found this book to be smug and off-putting in the fashionable ""intellectual-who-knows-everything"" style of countless insufferable TED talks and Big Thinkers a la Steven Pinker or Malcolm Gladwell, who similarly lack any evidence that they've mastered the fundamentals of the disciplines they deign to illuminate for us lay persons. I could go on with my criticisms, but you get the message - I found it neither conceptually nor factually illuminating, learned little from his manifesto on atheist humanism as a conceptual paradigm, and generally was alienated by its tone.

81,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44110461-esme,4,"I wanted to write a review of this book, but although I remember liking this book a lot - it had been a while since I read it. So I re-read it to give it a proper review. This book goes way back into ""cave man"" era of the hominid species, and touches on Neanderthals, Homo Sapiens, Homo Erectus and a few other extinct species of humanoids. That was pretty interesting, but what I found more interesting were the philosophical themes within the books. Mostly, about how we cooperate as a species and how that's possible. Cooperation and group living is a key aspect to our evolution and our survival, and it's interesting to see different theories on how that developed. It goes into the idea that even now our society is based on common myths/beliefs that we all just agree to follow in an effort to coexist successfully. It went into the agricultural revolution, and how even though our numbers soared after we figured out how to harvest crops instead of relying on hunting/foraging - that our 'quality of life' went down significantly. We grew in number at the cost of comfort and ease of living. It went into how whenever we showed up on a new continent, the flora and fauna of that area suffered greatly. We caused several mass extinction events where ever we migrated to, and the most devastated groups were the large mammal species of that area. There used to be giant mammal species like the giant sloth here in the Americas that went extinct in the blink of an eye as soon as we showed up. It also went into how we developed different number systems, language, ancient data storage and ancient vs modern governments and societies. It even went into the philosophical implications of having things like limited liability corporations. It made me reflect a lot on how far we've come and what it means to live in the era we live in now with mass technology, an overabundance of food - but we still have people starving. We have medicine and vaccines and technically we have the capability of helping people that we simply don't help. This book is accessible to people who don't have a strong background in anthropology or evolution, you don't have to be a scientist to get something from this book. It's also not written in a harsher overtone in regards to religion like some authors of science tend to be (cough Richard Dawkins) - so if you're religious and want to read about evolution and how we came to be this would be an okay book to pick up. It doesn't involve creationism it's firmly in the Natural Selection camp - but it doesn't shit on religions either. This book wasn't dry, it definitely kept my attention from beginning to end, and even though I've got a strong background in this sort of thing I still learned a lot, I had forgotten so much since it has been a while since I read it.

82,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52763346-farhana,4,"Actually 4.8 .No doubt, Harari is a wonderful writer and for me the main attraction of the book has been his intuitive writing style. Whether one agrees to all of Harari's insights about the humankind or not, one will find his perspective and arguments interesting. Though he has exaggerated in some places, overall the writing is at its best - engaging & informative. He has produced several neat thoughts in his writing like when he says, ""we did not domesticate wheat. It domesticated us.""""the agricultural revolution was history's biggest fraud.""""the history of ethics is a sad tale of wonderful ideals that nobody can live up to.""""money is the most universal & most efficient system of mutual trust ever devised."""
83,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13198822-settare,4,"I will try to explain, shortly, why I think this is a great and important book. I think the Goodreads star rating system doesn't accurately reflect what one has to say about a book, therefore people tend to read or skip entire reviews based on the rating the reviewer has given the book. Now, bear with me, if you rated this 0ne star or three stars or anything, do read this review. What is this book? It claims to be ""a brief history of humankind"". Is it really? Well, not exactly. Yes and no. Harari uses a linear timeline and the evolution of Homo sapiens as a template, in which he expresses his perception of the life of humankind on earth as a whole. But,Is this a history textbook? No. Is it always credible as a historical reference? Again, no. Is what is stated in this book 100% factual and objective? No, no, and no. Does that make it a bad book? Certainly not. A very neat way to define this book is what Golnoosh said in her review: ""In my opinion, Mr. Harari’s popular history book didn't quite register as a ""brief history of humankind"" but as ""various musings on humankind"""" and I agree with this. Harari is a professor of history, but in this book, he's an intellectual, by definition: a person who engages in critical thinking and reading, research, and human self-reflection about society. That's literally what Harari is doing. He just uses his extensive knowledge of history to try and make a narrative for his viewpoints. He wrote Sapiens as an intellectual and storyteller. And, well, the result is quite frankly brilliant in my opinion. Those who expect to learn the entire human history by reading a 500-page book are ignorant to the scope of human history, and those who pick up this book waiting to see Harari fail to recount the whole history of humankind in one book, are obviously bound to find it an unpleasant read. I find the book a very worthy read, because Harari presents ideas that are very thought-provoking and worthy of contemplation. In the beginning, he presents his take on the early stages of human evolution. Here he gives a suggestion about the relationship between humans and wheat, which is one of the most monstrously brilliant thoughts I have ever come across. That's the point where I decided this book was a five star for me. Later on, he goes on to talk about money, religion, the scientific revolution, and imperialism and capitalism, and here my liking to the book is mostly because I agree with him. I agree with Harari on most of the points he makes. Then in chapters 18 and 19, he talks about Happiness and Peace, and here is where I DISAGREE with a lot of what he says. He believes that the world today is mostly at peace, and while statistically, that could be kind of true, I would like to quote Simone de Beauvoir to disagree with him based on my personal moral beliefs and definition of ""peace"": ""All oppression creates a state of war"". Relying on this quote (which could be called sentimental or irrational or whatever), I would like to argue that the world is not at peace today and it will never be and it doesn't matter that the statistics show that most of the human population is today living in safety, without the fear of ""war"". In my opinion, peace is not just a lack of war, and Harari agrees somehow, but I still am annoyed by his notion of world peace. Moving on, he makes some very strange points about the pursuit of happiness, with which I don't necessarily ""agree"". Here is the point where I decided to give the book 4 or even 3 stars. Then I realized that agreeing with EVERYTHING the author has to say is not only unreasonable but also an unfair measurement to rate the book, because, honestly, there will never be a person whose whole belief system is identical to mine; we all disagree to some extent even with those whose beliefs are most similar to us, and from the thinkers and authors whose works I have read, Harari's beliefs are the closest I have found to my own. Then, yes, I am rating this book 5 stars because a) I agree with Harari most of the time, but also b) because I think regardless of whether you agree with him or not on his take on human history, you definitely must pay attention to what he predicts about our future. The last two chapters of the book and its epilogue are truly, truly alarming and brilliant, and I think even if you don't want to read the rest of the book or if you disregard it, we all should try to think about the questions he raises at the end and talk about them. Maybe it is my own personal belief system that makes me find this important, or maybe not. I am a biology student, I am highly concerned for animal rights and the climate crisis, I am an atheist and somehow a pessimist too, and I am highly alarmed by the closing paragraph of the book. Nonetheless, even if you don't share my beliefs and concerns, I think the final two chapters and the closing paragraph of this book are very important to you as well, and we should be having conversations about them. I'm closing the review by citing that ending paragraph, and no it is not a ""spoiler"", if anything, it should urge you to go read the rest of it. I think even if you end up hating the book and giving it up, if you just take away these two chapters and even this one paragraph and seriously think about it, Harari has done his job. 
 Moreover, despite the astonishing things that humans are capable of doing, we remain unsure of our goals and we seem to be as discontented as ever. We have advanced from canoes to galleys to steamships to space shuttles – but nobody knows where we’re going. We are more powerful than ever before, but have very little idea what to do with all that power. Worse still, humans seem to be more irresponsible than ever. Self-made gods with only the laws of physics to keep us company, we are accountable to no one. We are consequently wreaking havoc on our fellow animals and on the surrounding ecosystem, seeking little more than our own comfort and amusement, yet never finding satisfaction.Is there anything more dangerous than dissatisfied and irresponsible gods who don’t know what they want?
That's it. I agree with this. This is important. "
84,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2576681-shakespeareandspice,1,"Review originally posted on A Skeptical Reader.In Sapiens, Yuval Noah Harari attempts to condense human history by capturing the peak points of human progress. Harari begins with the Paleolithic era and goes all the up to modern day, with a decent range of periods covered in between.It is indeed a ‘brief history’ for it barely scratches the surface on a lot of topics I consider essential. I understand there are limitations to what the author can discuss but he spends a disproportional amount of time on certain subjects as opposed to others, which is where his bias seeps through. For example, he spends a lot of time on the study of human obsession with capturing land and the violence that comes with it but on the topic of sexism, he states the most obvious and moves on quickly. Furthermore, a lot of history in the book is also fairly well-known. This might entirely be a personal issue but so many of the things he spoke of during the early years just felt boring to me.Harari also seems to have penance for passing off unconfirmed theories by the way of fact and I am not comfortable with his tone. It’s a subtle form of fake news. His arguments for certain theories are also weak and he seems to move on fairly quickly from the subject once he makes a statement that clearly needs more support. For example, at one point he states that our civilization didn’t benefit from agriculture but rather agriculture just created more problems and this a huge statement to make without sufficient proof. Particularly so if you look at the situation we are in now, one where a lot of our problems are stemming from a lack of agriculture—not because of it. This is either just pure laziness on his part or he doesn’t have enough evidence to follow through. Either way, I don’t appreciate being mistreated as his reader.Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, Harari fails to cite most of his sources and this is a big no-no for someone who spent fours years honing in the art of reference and citation etiquette. Not only is this unprofessional but it borderlines on unethical behavior. Harari is asking for blind trust that most readers have no need to offer him. Frankly speaking, after finishing this book, the author retains less trust from me than he had before I started reading.In the end, I can see the appeal of this book for a lot of readers. It’s very accessible, rather engaging at times, and maintains a seemingly perceptive voice. However, I found far too many problems with the book in the author’s approach to research, the conclusions he makes from it, and the presentation of said research. In my honest opinion, this is not a book I would recommend for masses nor to the more academically invested in the subject."

This is one of those books.I read Jared Diamond’s “Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed” (review here) and remember being blown away with it. This book deserves its place next to this master work.The animal that became a God70.000 years ago, Homo Sapiens was an animal just as all other animals, trying to survive just like everybody else in a corner of Africa. Today, this animal is rapidly destroying the ecosystem, is without any doubt the master of the Earth and stands at the threshold of becoming a God: on the verge of creating eternal youth, and acquiring the divine abilities of creation and destruction.Unfortunately, we have so far produced little that we can be proud of. Did we decrease the amount of suffering in the world? Were we able to improve the suffering? And what do we want to achieve?We have advanced from canoes to space shuttles, but nobody knows where we’re going. We’re more powerful than ever, but we don’t know what to do with this power. As Gods, with only the laws of physics to keep us company, we are accountable to no-one. Is there anything more dangerous than dissatisfied and irresponsible Gods who don’t know what they want? "
86,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15148795-marija,4,"I heard about this book from the author once he was interviewed on NPR. I thought I knew what to expect from it. I didn´t. Although the book is lacking structure in terms of the way Harari handled the topic, I truly enjoyed reading it. He divides different phases of Sapien´s development into Agricultural Revolution, Cognitive Revolution and Scientific Revolution. Since the subject is considerably broad, it is not unusual that alongside gods, universe, money, human rights, social patterns, Christianity, dharma, colonialism, the author writes also about new technologies, the immense diversity of imagined realities that Sapiens invented, capitalism, Karl Marx, the discovery of America and much more. I felt like we jumped very quickly from the story about Neanthertal to the question like ""what maintains the military order?"" or from the image of hunter-gatherer to the portrait of Buddha. Nevertheless, I really admire his style of writing and before all, I agree with him."

89,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/233507-s-ach,5,"It is only once in a while that I come across a book that challenges the things that I have taken for granted for long and makes me rethink my beliefs. This outstanding book by Yuval Noah Harari is one of them. I can't help but admire the brilliance of the author with every page I read.History, as we come across, is predominantly a chronicle of happenings and happenstances recorded and many a times manipulated by historians, and we the students of life try to make sense out of it by our analysis and bias. But mostly, we confine ourselves to a particular event and try to understand that event in isolation. This is 'reductionist' approach. Harari takes a 'holistic' approach instead and analyzes the history of human kind in its entirety and provides a very thought provoking synthesis. The only other author I have read, who manages to treat history in similar fashion is Jared Diamond, who incidentally happens to be a big influence for Harari (courtesy: wiki).Starting from the early cognitive and agricultural revolution to the latest achievement of mankind in genetic engineering, Harari focuses more on ""why"" we are the way we are now and ""what"" are the underlying themes and ideas that saw us through, than the trivialities of ""who"" and ""when"". What made us the winning species in the natural selection? Was agricultural revolution a boon or a bane? Is history just or mere chronicle of the might? What unified humankind? What are the significances of money, empire and religion in forming human societies? Has science uplifted humanity or degraded it? What is worse - the success of capitalism or the failure of communism? Are we happier as we progress with time? - These are significant historical questions which Harari attempts to answer with his excellent deductive reasoning. This book by Harari is a magnificent achievement in man's power to understand history as a whole. Everyone should read this book. "

I haven't got bored even for a second, with every page I read I get more and more curious about the next page and next chapter.Sapiens - a brief history of humankind as the name suggests it does explain the events of history but the writing is such that you won't feel that you're reading a history book of school. If only I had this book in my school I would have paid much more attention in history class.Everything, every event is explained and in a way and in terminology that can be understood by everyone. There are examples given in some places which makes things much easy to understand.

91,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13611321-steve-griffin,5,"This is an astonishing book, giving an overview of the major phases of our evolution. It is often grim in its rendering of our collective fictions, but it's also balanced with glimmers of hope, such as the relative peacefulness of recent times, improvements in medicine, and the reductions in global poverty. Most unnerving is the ending, which touches on the huge pressures we face to undertake more bioengineering, and where that might lead. Nonfiction such as a Moment on the Earth and fiction such as Hyperion, by Dan Simmons, address some of these issues. But this book wakes you up to the prospect that, in the long view, our turbulent history might just be a staging post in the evolution of intelligent design."

Naturally this makes me wonder about how much to trust the rest of the book. Harari is also prone to making sweeping generalizations which sometimes don't even hold up against common sense--on page 355, for instance, where he claims that the Industrial Revolution led to ""the disintegration of the patriarchy."" The women of the world have some bad news for you on that front, my friend. "

You are a prominent species of life on the planet : does it fill you with pride ? a radiant energy ? The power of atoms have been harnessed into weapons and means for energy generation, vehicles running on fossil fuel take you overland to destinations, a metal tube flying overhead can take you across the planet in 48 hours, one click of a button on a device connects you with anyone on the planet on instant messaging. What does that make you feel ? These are glorious achievements which a mere 100 years ago would have been dismissed as material worthy of fantasy literature. Makes you feel good, doesn’t it ?While you bask in these glories, I want you to forget human beings as a species for a moment and take a look at the environment. Across the world, mankind has demolished mountains, levelled plains, filled up lakes, decimated forests and converted landscapes into unrecognizable ones. Hundreds of organisms went extinct as a prize of progress and many more will do so in the years to come. Was this destruction worth the progress made ? This question has been asked in forums, seminars and world congresses but against the voice of advancing population and technological development this voice is slowly dying down. From a naked ape on the plains of Africa to the masters of the world of today has been a long and bloody journey aided by some key tools, technologies and belief systems. This is the story behind this book : where we came from, what we did, how we got here and where we are heading as a species. This book has the capacity to persuasively argue for a rethinking of our status in society as a species and what we trampled underfoot to get here.At the core of the book lies an argument about what made humanity rise from among the multitude of species. There are three factors that transformed diverse groups of humans into a coagulated mass that was unbeatable. The forces of : Money, Empire and Religion was the secret mix. Whether it was for good or bad, diverse groups came together under the aegis of these forces to shape the lives and fates of countless millions of people. In a process of trial and error, humanity progressed into the shape and form it is in today. Agriculture, industry and science entered the fray in between thereby scaling up the standards of living for everyone involved. Mankind has gone through countless wars, revolutions and usage and discarding of political systems until the world as we know it today rose from the turmoil. This book is an account of how they were all derived. Considering that it crams centuries worth of information into it, the book only offers a bird’s eye view into history without delving into many details. In an earlier book by Carl Sagan (Dragons Of Eden), he asks a question as to how Homo Sapiens managed to wipe out every other species of humanoid to be in sole control of the Earth. Harari tries to answer that question here by citing that the formidable organization skills, shrewdness and adaptability of this ape helped it overcome its physically superior cousins. Would the world have been different if we had Neandarthals around ? We would never know. The book asks more questions than it answers but all those are questions that make a reader relook at the entire history of mankind in a different light.The author seems to be in awe of our past as hunter gatherers for he seems to return to the lives of hunter gatherers again and again. The hand-to-mouth existence, the physical exertion of a hunt, the close bonds of a tribe are all traits he seems to point at and asks subtly : weren’t we better off this way ? I did not quite get the logic of this. Also, he has a particular axe to grind against agriculture whereby he calls the agricultural revolution as history’s biggest fraud. A statement made by him that : Man never domesticated wheat but it was the other way round makes for a thought provoking read. Harari also highlights how man has destroyed the lives of countless farm animals in the race to produce more and more food products for an ever increasing population.This is a very important book if you are keen on understanding history from the viewpoint of mankind. It is not a pleasant or even cheerful story for the story our lives are grim, dark and full of terrors.Highly recommended ! "

It's not supposed to be a full-out treatise, nor is it giving citations, but I've read a ton of other books that talk about almost everything in here. It's not new stuff. It is, however, written in such an engaging way that I pretty much fell out of my seat in love with the way they are all presented.I really got into the counterarguments against agriculture, but before that, I loved the idea that people were all always pretty much always people. Language, myths, and ideas changed us all into the creatures we are now. It's a very Campbellian view. Language increases complexity, but also a closer reliance on details. Abstract concepts arose to help people conceptualize groups of people much larger than a decent gossip circle. We tell ourselves lies and stories in order to accomplish much bigger things.Easy, right? Well, the author takes us all the way through the agricultural revolution, into cultural theories, monetary theories, political theories, and scientific theories. All of these have made us what we are, and all of them come from the basic storytelling concept. We believe banks work, and so they do. We believe that our social structure works, and so it does. If we don't trust it, it falls apart, but that's the whole point. We trust the story to be true, and we continue on. Money works this way. The author goes into the fantastic rabbit-hole called Credit. Fractional reserve. We all know it works so long as we trust it works. The same is true for Capitalism, or Buddhism, or the Medieval outlook, or Christmas. Shall we dismiss, or enshrine, the rest of human history this way?Sure! Why not? It FEELS right. The story this author tells FEELS trustworthy. I'm hooked.But then, I'm a writer, myself. I believe in the written word and its power to transform the world. Myth as Life. Myth IS Life. Every instant of our own lives is the artifact of the stories we tell about ourselves. It's not so hard to believe that everything else we do as a species follows the same method.Hello, money. What makes you think I should believe in you? Oh, wait, you tell a very compelling story. :)I like this book. :) "

Some might say impossible. I am possibly among them. Harari makes a compelling effort. Though thought provoking, I found it superficial and simplistic, with Harari quoting one example to support assertations about why things happened the way they did and then promptly moves on to the next subject…because he has to. I actually enjoyed this surface-y stroll through history. I confess my impressions suffered because of the unexpected pop culture(ness) of the book. I expected more intellectual heft along the lines of Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies (except perhaps more interesting). What I got was closer to Malcolm Gladwell's The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference, or Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking, or [insert Gladwell book here].In short, I liked and enjoyed the book. I suspect that Harari has the intellectual gravitas to presume to write a book of this magnitude in concept. In fact, he did just that, and he is a very interesting and compelling author. But I also think this book lacks substance. It's not after all suppose to be an opinion piece. It's a book about history, sociology, anthropology, geography, economics, religion, psychology, biology, cybernetics, chemistry technology, etc…3.5 Stars rounded up because its very readable and interestingListened to audiobook.

To my surprise this book has almost no science, very little about natural selection, etc. Everything that you would expect.Instead, this is a history book that's very well written. It's a pleasant read and the author found a very clever approach by giving every important humankind phase a chapter or better yet, as the Author calls a revolution. This way it's easier for the reader to differentiate and compare the main phases our kind has gone through and their differences.Harari also keeps a pretty optimistic tone throughout the book, so it can give the reader a hopeful feeling.

As a condensed read on history and evolution of human kind it is very good. I don't dare say great because I not exactly enjoyed all of it - I had a bit of a hard times while getting into the first part and was thoroughly bored with money & economics part (because it's definitely not my thing in this life) - but all in all it was really interesting.

98,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49415231-amir-tesla,4,"Having sparked off so much heat, I guess this book needs no further intro. So I'll dive into the content directly.Harari Argues that the history is shaped through three major revolutions: the Cognitive Revolution sparked off history about 70,000 years ago. The Agricultural Revolution boosted the progress about 12,000 years ago. The Scientific Revolution, which got under way only 500 years ago, may well end history and start something completely different.History has seen six different species of man, from Homo-neanderthals (‘Man from the Neander Valley’), Homo erectus (‘Upright Man’) ... to finally Homo-sapiens ('wise men'). I. The Cognitive RevolutionThe appearance of new ways of thinking and communicating, between 70,000 and 30,000 years ago, constitutes the Cognitive Revolution. What caused it? No one knows yet (a fluky genetic mutation maybe) and more important than its causes, are the consequences of this revolution amongst which, language is a major one. The truly unique feature of our language is not its ability to transmit information about men and lions. Rather, it’s the ability to transmit information about things that do not exist at all. This ability to speak about fictions is the unique and most extraordinary feature of Sapiens language. 1. The Legend of Peugeot: Large numbers of strangers can cooperate successfully by believing in common myths. | Any large-scale human cooperation is feasible if everyone believes in a collective set of myths. Peugeot company was the first to introduce the concept of ""limited liability company"", an entity which resides merely in concepts and imagination. The Original Affluent Society: Sapiens were hunter gatherers before settling down and they did not forage only for food and materials. They foraged for knowledge as well. It's interesting to note that they used to be taller, healthier than their settler descendants, suffered less from infectious diseases and the secret was their varied diet.Harari nicely pulls the curtain away and reveals the dark side of the Sapiens, virtually wherever they stepped, they brought genocide and distinction to the locals. Were the Australian extinction an isolated event, we could grant humans the benefit of the doubt. But the historical record makes Homo sapiens look like an ecological serial killer.The Agricultural Revolution1. History’s Biggest Fraud: The transition to agriculture began around 9500-8500 BC in the hill country of southeastern Turkey, western Iran, and the Levant. The Agricultural Revolution certainly enlarged the sum total of food at the disposal of humankind, but the extra food did not translate into a better diet or more leisure. Rather, it translated into population explosions and pampered elites. The average farmer worked harder than the average forager and got a worse diet in return. The Agricultural Revolution was history’s biggest fraud.Cultivating wheat provided much more food per unit of territory, and thereby enabled Homo sapiens to multiply exponentially. DNA helixes. Just as the economic success of a company is measured only by the number of dollars in its bank account, not by the happiness of its employees, so the evolutionary success of a species is measured by the number of copies of its DNA. From such a perspective, 1,000 copies are always better than a hundred copies. This is the essence of the Agricultural Revolution: the ability to keep more people alive under worse conditionsWhen the Agricultural Revolution opened opportunities for the creation of crowded cities and mighty empires, people invented stories about great gods, motherlands and joint stock companies to provide the needed social links. While human evolution was crawling at its usual snail’s pace, the human imagination was building astounding networks of mass cooperation, unlike any other ever seen on earth.imagined order (shared myth):For me, the most illuminating part of the book was the Sapiens capability of imagining fictions and clinging to them as a reference point which makes cooperation in large-scale possible. Harari argues there are three reasons that prevent people from realizing that the order organizing their lives exists only in their imagination which are: a. The imagined order is embedded in the material world.b. The imagined order shapes our desires.c. The imagined order is inter-subjective.In order to establish such complex organisations, it’s necessary to convince many strangers to cooperate with one another. And this will happen only if these strangers believe in some shared myths. It follows that in order to change an existing imagined order, we must first believe in an alternative imagined order.To be continued ..."

Accordingly, the author refrains from making any prediction. However, despite the ""chaos"" and the difficulty in outlining the history of Sapiens, the author makes a valiant attempt at explaining how these sapiens have evolved. I don't think there is a better book that covers such issues as have been covered in this book more comprehensively without being deterministic. The beauty is that despite such extensive details and research to back it, the book keeps you riveted.""The ability to speak about fictions is the most unique feature of Sapiens language"". Harari goes on to illustrate this at length and quite convincingly. He is , however, quite critical of the way in which sapiens have come to earn the ""dubious distinction of being the deadliest species in the annals of biology"".As the author traverses through he evolution of human species, he finds that ""money is the most universal and most efficient system of mutual trust ever devised"". How true. Harari's analyses of various religions and their practices is incisive but simple. This gets illustrated in his understanding of Buddhism : ""the only way to be fully liberated from suffering is to is to be fully liberated from craving; and the only way to be liberated from craving is to train the mind to experience reality as it is""A book worth reading and worth keeping"
100,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7288965-manray9,4,"Yuval Noah Harari's Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind is engrossing, thought-provoking and often profound. Harari uses a multi-disciplinary approach with insights from biology, anthropology, paleontology, and economics to evaluate history through assessment of three human revolutions: the Cognitive, Agricultural, and Scientific. In Harari's view, human history is characterized by the transition of life from one ruled by biological imperatives toward one subject to the imaginary creations of Homo sapiens – culture, religion, nationalism, capitalism, philosophy and politics. This transformation has resulted from the long and irregular march toward larger and more sophisticated networks of human cooperation. It is a tale of the push and pull between the physical world and the cultural. His conclusions cast an unusual and perceptive light upon the past and future of the human race. Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind should be of interest not only to readers of anthropology or biology, but those with an eye on history as well. Harari's book is highly recommended and deserving of Four Stars."

It's not quite as it's billed--the evolution bit is just the first part and the last part heads into a bit of everything--capitalism, buddhism, etc. I would usually fault the author for such meandering, but I was riveted the entire time. I didn't always agree with his conclusions, but it's an essential perspective on human history and the future and even the ways of the mind and searching for happiness. I've thought a lot about it since I finished. "
102,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43477226-todd-stockslager,1,"Review Title: Not badly written, but horribly wrongI have to give this popular book which is earning extravagant reviews a very rare 1 star 'waste of paper' rating, but not because it is so badly written, but because it is so badly wrong.By p. 27 Harari has already branded all religions as fictions ""wasting precious time,"" and on p. 30 as ""common myths that exist only in people's collective imaginations."" I immediately lose respect for any writer (I can not call him a thinker or a scientist) who would make such unsupported statements of a strict materialism more faith based and ""mythical"" than any religion would dare to be.To be fair his strict materialism is consistent; he also identifies corporations, law, human rights, anything with no material existence, as fictions. Regardless of my position on religion, I find strict materialism abhorrent and patently unprovable so I find Harari's arguments completely unconvincing, perhaps most of all because he makes no attempt to prove them, but states them as self-evident ""just so"" stories.He proceeds later to deconstruct the opening of The Declaration of Independence in evolutionary biological materialist terms (p. 121-124): men are not created equal because they are not created and he dismisses the ""Christian myths about God"" out of hand so therefore men are not in any sense equal but genetically and environmentally mutated. The materialist horror of eugenics is just beneath the surface here, and most frighteningly, there is no moral code or natural law to prevent the materialist like Harari from declaring it optimal and deciding who lives, who dies, and worst of all who is castrated, raped, brutalized, and ghettoized. We apparently won the battle over Nazism in World War II but lost the war for humanity to materialism.I have used the term ""materialism"" and ""materialist"" throughout this review. While Harari does not use the terms anywhere in his book, his repeated denial of the existence of any nonmaterial (religion, law, corporations, justice) concept is by definition materialist. By failing to identify his philosophical position, he allows himself room to manipulate. Early in the book in discussing genetic markers of different species of the genus homo, he suggests that ""there well may be genetic differences between Africans, Europeans and Asians."" (p. 17) While acknowledging that this is ""political dynamite,"" he is bound by his implicit philosophy to accept it as truth, but bypasses discussion of the issue at that point. Then when he later comes back to the ""imagined"" justifications for racism in the US, including biological, he says ""biology can't explain the intricacies of. . . American racial dynamics."" (p. 161] Perhaps he's conveniently forgotten his often stated position about the nonmaterial being ""fictions"" or ""myths"" when he suggests looking elsewhere for the explanations.It's obvious Harari has struck a chord with me here. It is very seldom I read a book that I believe the author has gotten so wrong on a topic I feel so strongly about. I am not a professional scientist, but a well read layman who understands the scientific evidence for and against materialism, and I find the theory wrong on both philosophical and empirical grounds, as do many scientists.When he gets to the topic of money Harari's ""fiction"" argument does make solid sense, finally, as money is truly a fiction based on universal trust. And he scores a brilliant point here by observing that the trust isn't just my trust that the money I use is good (of consistent value backed by a reliable government), but my trust that other people with whom I want to exchange money for goods also have the same trust: ""whereas religion asks us to believe in something, money asks us to believe that other people believe in something."" (p. 207)An interesting observation, and for me by far the best and the only interesting part of the book. I began to wonder what these gushing reviewers were reading, because he soon goes off the rails again. Human life is nothing but biology, chemistry, and physics, Harari says at one point, so when he quotes a Nazi era German school textbook:Biology not only tells us about animals and plants, but also shows us the laws we must follow in our lives, and steels our wills to live and fight according to those laws. (p. 262)We are supposed, I believe, to feel horror at past Nazism, but I am more seriously frightened by his own present materialism that has no response to rebut it.And his materialism, stated as fact and not the bleak religion that it is, leads him to the blackest of conclusions about the present: As far as we can tell, from a purely scientific viewpoint, human life has absolutely no meaning. Humans are the outcome of blind evolutionary processes that operate without goal or purpose . . . . Any meaning that people ascribe to their lives is just a delusion. (p. 438)But tying his religion of biology, chemistry, and physics to speculation about a brave new world of genetic engineering and manufactured Frankenstein monsters is a conclusion that leaves me in fear that the people who are buying and presumably reading this book at bestseller levels do not have enough depth of thinking to see the horror behind his unstated religion. As with the Nazi textbook, Harari's materialism leaves him no rebuttal to Huxley's dystopia. You start to understand the darkness of Harari's philosophy when you realize how far up toward the light he is looking when he references the notoriously nihilist existentialist Nietzche's statement ""if you have a why to live, you can bear any how."" (p. 437)One reason this book hit me so wrong is that I read it immediately after finishing the excellent literary biography of the Inklings (The Fellowship) which documents the explicitly stated spiritual position of its subjects in a clear and logical exposition. Tolkien and C. S. Lewis's scientific explanation of the power of myth and legend in representing the history of humankind and the world is the exact opposite and antidote to Harari. Please, if you are standing in a bookstore or library deciding which of these to read, choose life and truth, not Nazism and death. "
103,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47799008-tudor-vlad,5,"Wow. I don’t think I’ve ever had this much fun reading a non-fiction book, it resonated with me in so many ways. What’s impressive is that even if this book had so much information, it didn’t suffer because of it for one second. I’m awed by the way in which the author managed to synthesize the information while also making it flaw naturally, in a coherent way that really engaged me, retaining my full attention from start to finish. Huge quote incoming. How can we distinguish what is biologically determined from what people merely try to justify through biological myths? A good rule of thumb is ‘Biology enables, Culture forbids.’ Biology is willing to tolerate a very wide spectrum of possibilities. It’s culture that obliges people to realise some possibilities while forbidding others. Biology enables women to have children – some cultures oblige women to realise this possibility. Biology enables men to enjoy sex with one another – some cultures forbid them to realise this possibility.Culture tends to argue that it forbids only that which is unnatural. But from a biological perspective, nothing is unnatural. Whatever is possible is by definition also natural. A truly unnatural behaviour, one that goes against the laws of nature, simply cannot exist, so it would need no prohibition. No culture has ever bothered to forbid men to photosynthesise, women to run faster than the speed of light, or negatively charged electrons to be attracted to each other.In truth, our concepts ‘natural’ and unnatural’ are taken not from biology, but from Christian theology. The theological meaning of ‘natural’ is ‘in accordance with the intentions of the God who created nature’. Christian theologians argued that God created the human body, intending each limb and organ to serve a particular purpose. If we use our limbs and organs for the purpose envisioned by God, then it is a natural activity. To use them differently than God intends is unnatural. But evolution has no purpose. Organs have not evolved with a purpose, and the way they are used is in constant flux. There is not a single organ in the human body that only does the job its prototype did when it first appeared hundreds of millions of years ago. Organs evolve to perform a particular function, but once they exist, they can be adapted for other usages as well. Mouths, for example, appeared because the earliest multicellular organisms needed a way to take nutrients into their bodies. We still use our mouths for that purpose, but we also use them to kiss, speak and, if we are Rambo, to pull the pins out of hand grenades. Are any of these uses unnatural simply because our worm-like ancestors 600 million years ago didn’t do those things with their mouths?"
104,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25091532-h-m-ada,5,"A sapien myself, I found this fascinating. It's history, sociology, philosophy, evolutionary psychology - everything about us and what makes us tick and how we got where we are. I have to say that when it's all laid out like it is here, we don't come across so great. Even the last chapter, which speaks to what our future may hold, is unsettling. So this is a pretty critical self-analysis. That said, I loved every minute of it. For the most part, I thought the author's conclusions were right on, and even where I disagreed, I enjoyed thinking about the issues raised. As children, we all memorize facts about things like the agricultural revolution, European exploration and conquest, nationalism, and the rise of capitalism, but we often forget, or maybe never even explore in the first place, just how much history says about our nature as humans and where we are or might have arrived at instead. I listened to the audiobook and thought the reader's voice was just perfect for this. In addition to being thought provoking, this book was genuinely entertaining, and I would recommend it to all members of my species. In fact, I would even recommend it to those belonging different species. Whether you're watching us right now from a far, or you've stumbled on this review long after sapiens have altered ourselves unrecognizably or blown ourselves up, this book is a great way to learn about who we are or were.

Harari took me on the incredibly interesting journey of us, giving me a greater understanding of human evolution. Sapiens gave such a thought provoking story on humans progression, mistakes, and future. I really enjoyed the beginning of the book when it talks about other human species and the agricultural revolution. I also really enjoyed the ending of the book when it talks about the study of happiness and future 'super humans'. My mind has expanded so much from reading this book and I can't complain. After reading this book, I realized just how temporary current life is and how much faster it changes every day. Enjoy the moment that you are in, because it will all be apart of history one day that people, more intelligent and super than we ever can imagine, will be mesmerized by. "
106,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63911735-adam-mohd-noor,5,"I'm not going to lie, I found the first few chapters of Sapiens (the Hunter & Gatherer Society and the Agrarian Revolution) to be an utter snooze fest to the point I've unjustly concluded that Sapiens was just another boring history book. Fortunately, I realised that Sapiens wasn't such a dull book as I had initially thought. Sapiens focuses on complex macro-historical issues, namely, religion, money, language, empire, knowledge, biological engineering etc. Not to sound cheesy but I've to admit that this is one of the best books I've ever read as it challenges me to think differently against every established aspects crucial in our lives which had been pre-determined prior to our existence. Readers should be wary though, Harari tends to favour a modern humanist ideology/thinking especially when he writes about religion as merely an artificial man-made social mechanism.It's one of those books which will change how I've personally perceived and felt about my existence. "
107,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3359025-jigar-brahmbhatt,4,"This is really a perception-shifting book, at least for me. It surveys the entire length of human history (taking cues from evolutionary theory, anthropology and history itself) and in that sense it is very ambitious. It finally dwells into the notions of consumerism and how it has changed the world, along the way giving insights into how nations and religions work, but what really interested me were the beginning chapters concerning our per-historic existence. So I have nothing better to do (I might not even call it a review!) than to put down my hasty notes here, a selfish goal which will kill two birds at once:1) I will have an organized place to record them.2) Should the reader find them info-taining, I'd be happy.So here goes...1) Because early humans (before they figured they could create weapons/ before the invention of fire) were quite weak compared to other predators, they relied on the left-overs of other animals and since not much meat was left they survived on bone marrow. It was the one true niche of early humans - to survive on marrow. 2) Learning to walk on two legs (we didn't do it before) had its advantages - for one, you could easily scan the savanna for predators. It sounds natural or normal because we are wired to do it but it was a boon. It made the hands free. One could now wave to a friend, throw stones, or create weapons. Free hands helped move us up the survival/evolutionary ladder. They paved the way for the future. 3) There is no exact date when Homo Sapiens appeared on earth. But by 150,000 years ago East Africa was populated by Homo Sapiens that looked exactly like us. Around 70,000 years ago some of the Sapiens traveled to Middle East and Eurasia, places that were already populated by Neanderthal, Homo Soloensis, Homo Eractus and other sets of humans. So at some point in time there were different human species around the world, but currently there is only us - Sapiens. What happened to the others? There are two theories: i) Interbreeding Theory - as the name suggests this theory states that when Sapiens reached Eurasia they bred with Neanderthal. When they reached China they bred with Homo Eractus, and likewise formed mixed races. This theory is a political dynamite because it states that there might be Neanderthal traits in people from Eurasia or Eractus traits in people from Asia. So apart from race there is another human division based on human groups. ii) Replacement Theory - it states that there was no sex between different human groups, and even if some managed to copulate they could produce only sterile children because their anatomies were different. It tells of a genocide in which Sapiens replaced every other group on the planet and we are the part of the victorious group. That's why we have roughly the same DNA. There is an ongoing debate on the above two, with the majority preferring the Replacement Theory.4) Sapiens' invention of needle was a major breakthrough for them to start surviving in colder and colder climates - they could sew things, so could make boots or coats made of animal skin to keep them warm. A major advantage over other human groups. 5) Invention of language brought gossip in human life, without which it could have been difficult to survive in groups. Things like who liked whom, who was a braver warrior, who would be likely to run away on the sight of a lion - all of this might have been discussed while they cooked raw meat on fire. Another boon was being able to convey large amount of information. And most importantly to create fiction - talk about things that didn't really exist. For example, ""a lion spirit is guiding our tribe"". We are the only species in the animal kingdom that can create fictional ideas. If one dares to expand this though a bit further: government, corporations, religions - these don't really exist. These are fictional ideas we have created to align ourselves to order and purpose in life. 6) Genetic evolution took a lot of time, but once we acquired cognitive abilities the cultural revolution was brought about drastically. Starting from the domestication of fire we catapulted ourselves to the top of the evolutionary hierarchy. We created societies, religions, and all the possible complicated structures. 7) Evolutionary Psychology says that evolutionary pressures not only shaped human anatomy but human psychology too. I don't know how true this is. But imagine this: in the savanna, among the hunter-gatherers sugar was very rare so whenever a tribeswoman would find fruits on a tree she would try to eat as many as possible because there was no surety that when she returned again to the tree the ripened fruits would still be there. Who knows a band of baboons might finish them off? And that's what we continue to do even today. When we open the refrigerator in the middle of the night and see a chocolate cake, the hunter-gatherer in us wants to gorge it all in one go. 8) Homo Sapiens might have practiced Animism - a belief that the world is filled with animated beings that communicate with one another directly. So there is no deity up there, but the spiritual powers are localized among the trees, rocks, streams, animals and likewise. 9) Wheat helped cultivate humans. There was a time when humans did nothing but worked from morning to night to help wheat grow. Starting in Middle East wheat spread all around the world. It can be said that wheat helped domesticate us. It helped keep many more people alive under harsh conditions. 10) Gobekili Tepe, excavated in 1995 around Turkey, is an estimated 9,500 years old site created by hunter-gatherers some 7,000 years before Stonehenge. The people who created it were probably part of different human bands, all joined together for a singular spiritual purpose. The carvings point to religious symbolism and there is a whiff that the spiritual practices that led to the creation of this site may have been more evolved than we'd like to believe. Exactly 30 kilometers away from this site there are traces of domesticated wheat, and not the wild wheat that happens on its own. It is believed that wheat was grown around these parts to feed the workers who helped build this site. Interestingly, humans didn't start cultivating wheat in order to make life easier for themselves. The switching from gathering wild wheat to purposefully cultivating it at one site did not result from the need to domesticate society but to support the building of such cultural centers or temples. Conventionally, we think that villages were established first and temples came later. This site suggests that that may not be the case. Temples came first, and what they learned by cultivating wheat in one place to support the building of such centers, the obvious advantages of it, brought about domestication. This is just another way of looking. 11) Domestication of cattle, pigs, and chicken brought diseases that were earlier unknown to man. This is described in great detail here: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1... 12) Pigs were difficult to domesticate because they were apparently more intelligent, and in order to control them their noses were copped off, a practice that was still dominant in New Guinea, because noses helped them track food. Without their devices they had to rely on humans for food. Interesting, right? We have a history of being cruel. Both to nature and animals, despite what we like to believe about ourselves. A lot of books and documentaries already inform us about how animals are treated by the mighty food industries.13) Imagined realities helped create social order as societies grew. An early example is the Code of Hammurabi, written about the virtues of Hammurabi, the just king (which he may not be), and provides ways of living in the kingdom. ""An eye for an eye"" comes from this code. The Code severed a singular purpose, to sustain order, called ""just or correct way of life"" by Hammurabi. Not only this but any important political document, say the American Declaration of Independence, or any agreed-upon model of society, is based on imagined realities. We have come a far way from saving ourselves from hungry beats to manipulating reality - to create societies based on fictional ideas. In order to sustain empires, cities, towns, cults...fiction is necessary. 14) Writing was invented to store large amount of data. Human brain was not evolved to memorize large amount of information so when things like tax collection happened along, relying on brain was not a good idea. Writing helped. Sumerians reached their first.15) The recent surge in people going for vacations, or wanting to have different experience might be because of this imagined reality which states that the purpose of life is to have varied experiences, explore new cultures, or to experience different relationships, even different food. Some companies have started selling experiences now and not commodities (like that scuba-diving or yoga package that will change your life, broaden your senses), something which historians call Romantic Consumerism. 16) All imagined realities are inter-subjective. They are not objective, but form a network of individuals who commonly believe in a certain version of reality. A subjective change in the perception of one individual hardly changes the imagined reality. The imagined order is challenged only when most present in the network change their views."

109,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33424987-helen,4,"3.5 STARS This was a really thought-provoking book, which has a collection of varied chapters everyone should at least give a quick skim through at some point or other. It doesn't matter if you're not a history nerd, or even if you like history at all, this book gives a very brief overview of what is essentially the history of humankind, so is nowhere near as dense or technical as the usual academic history book. It contains many points that I believe would be of interest to any reader, no matter what their broader interests may be. I lost track of the amount of times I thought ohh... interesting... I can't believe I never thought of that..., after which I would repeat the interesting titbit to myself so that it can be filed away in my memory and whipped out any time I need to look particularly knowledgeable or educated. That being said, the first chapter was definitely the strongest, with certain points he made in the following chapters being a bit hit and miss. I'm inherently sceptical of these non-fiction books that profess to be both factual and entertaining at the same time, and don't like to take their claims at face value. Some of the points he made about changing social structures, culture and the development of commerce weren’t substantiated with many examples like some of his better chapters were, for instance, on religion and the relationship between capitalism and warfare. Many of his points are nothing more than personal speculation, particularly towards the end when he veers into the murky waters of philosophy and psychology, so that’s something to keep in mind. However, I still think it’s an important read because the good points he does make are really quite insightful and thought-provoking indeed. It’s worth skimming through a few chapters of pretentious waffle in order to get to the real gems that made this book so renowned."
110,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7139041-dorin,1,"Ok, where do I start? Let's start with the end from my perspective. The point where I stopped reading Sapiens is where the author insists that wheat domesticated humans to become the most successful weed in history. I get it. I am well aware of the current of opinion that humans are the worst thing that happened in history, and Harari is a good exponent of that. Building on a very fictional interpretation of the very few things we know about prehistoric humans he creates a very entertaining self punishment material, a reminder that you are horrible. No wonder people rate it 5 enthusiastic stars. Harari is entertaining in his masochism, a door opened wide by the likes of 50 shades of grey. Recommendations by Bill Gates on the cover only serves to remind us that neither programmers, nor business people, no matter how successful, can be trusted when it comes to fields they didn't study. On the other hand Harari has a PhD in history, and that doesn't seem to help either. Sapiens is definitely undeserving of the enthusiasm of its fans.What bothered me most is the interpretation of information we don't have, things like ""the hunter gatherer is happier than the agriculturist"". It all builds towards his social and political views, towards social masochism and public wailing. But he has a market in busy people who don't have time to check his claims, too challenge his opinions. He collects some interesting information, but the information is really covered in piles of faulty logic and unfounded opinions. Avoid this book, it's just a waste of time."
111,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25582110-kate-savage,2,"I'll tell you what I liked: That Harari insists on calling all species of the genus Homo ""human."" And that when he's diving into our deep past as a species, he resists the generalizations and just-so stories of other pop-science ('we're naturally jealously monogamous!' 'we're naturally bonobo polyamorists!' etc.). Instead he leaves open the full diverse bizarrities of our past.Also, it's kind of nice that Harari is skeptical of many forms of 'progress,' and takes note of the way other species are devastated in our 'advanced' cultures. He retains a little shudder of horror when he talks about our possible futures as a species.And I'll tell you what I didn't like:Once you get through the first bit on early humans, Harari serves up an all-you-can eat buffet of evo-psy-tinged nonsense. All the writers who steal and expound on each other -- Steven Pinker, Malcolm Gladwell, Jonathan Haidt -- get their stupidest unifying theories regurgitated here.And the worst of these is the pseudo-sophisticated moral equivalency argument for empire. You know the one: well, empires were bad, sure. Sure they killed a lot of people. BUT, if you THINK ABOUT IT -- if you're brave enough to put your moral repugnance aside and look it full in the face -- they are also good! The four-part argument goes like this:1) Because of Empire we have culture! (as though indigenous people don't have culture. As though mass genocide is a necessary fertilizer for pretty art and new ideas) How can you say you're against Empire if you're saying that sentence in an imperial language like English, hmmmm? (Gotcha)2) Throw in some Steven Pinker line about how everyone's safer and less violent now that they're ruled by white people.3) Every culture destroyed by Empire was itself an empire, just a smaller one. Some are simply better at this game than others. (Which carries the implication: if white people didn't do this first then everyone else would have done it to us and you'd all be speaking Algonquin now! Meaning: genocide is our natural state of affairs, and the ones who do it best and quickest probably deserve the reward; and the ones who do it worst and slowest probably deserve annihilation).4) Even the language used to fight against empire is an imperial construct. (As though the bullies single-handedly invented an idea of 'human rights,' and no other cultures have been able to express 'don't enslave rape pillage murder us please because that's messed up.')There are real, material, current, horrific consequences to this reasoning. The fact that the author is from Israel, site of cutting-edge ethical equivocation over stealing land and resources from brown people, was additionally haunting within this empire-boosterism book.This is what made Sapiens unredeemable for me. But since I went through all the trouble to read this heavy glossy tome, here are some more grievances:-In the drive to connect science and empire in a unified theory (both are born from a radical willingness to admit ignorance), Harari suggests others didn't genocide the Europeans first because they just weren't curious enough.-Harari talks about economics through thought experiments more than real history and anthropology. This is a favorite trick of economists, and allows them to say shit like:""Capital trickles away from dictatorial states that fail to defend private individuals and their property"" (pg. 318). Harari then concocts a make-believe scenario about why this is the case ('imagine that Joe Smith lends blah blah to Mr. Jones blah blah'). As for history, he then shows how Dutch companies got filthy rich while Spain stagnated, and claims that's because the Dutch respected individual rights. The actual history here is the Dutch invaded Indonesia, and with love of freedom, individual rights, and private property in their hearts, ended the freedom, smashed the individual rights, and stole the property of the Indonesian people. By 'respect for property', Harari should clarify that he means 'respect for white property.' In sum: I'm sick of tries at moral equivalency between imperial genociders and the genocided. Yes, the people who have been murdered aren't pure and perfect, but I'm so tired of people who hunt down and glory in those imperfections to dodge the overwhelming moral weight of our own histories. I'm sick of people who think they sound daring, nuanced, and clever by crafting gotcha sentences to make us admire empire, war, and exploitation. In an aside, Harari mentions the people of Tasmania, who were systematically hunted down and eradicated by white colonizers. He has an image of Truganini, the last native Tasmanian alive. Her dead body was put on display in colonizer's museums, her skin and hair were held at the English Royal College of Surgeons until 2002. This page, admitting a clear and brutal story, was a powerful one in the middle of the nonsense. But the fact that he can speak Truganani's name, invite us to look at her face, and then set her and the other murdered ones up on a scale, with 'culture' and 'inevitability' on the other side, and proclaim that the two sides balance -- this made the book nearly unreadable for me."

It's something that seems like a simple question, but without knowing the history of humanity, how can we answer?Sapiens lays out a clear path for how we got to our present state, so that with that knowledge you can have an idea for where we -- as a species -- are headed. Harari argues that three things really shaped the modern world: Money, Religion, and Science. He shows how these all came together to create Capitalism, which has mostly shaped the modern world.From the dawn of humanity until about 1800, living conditions per capita never improved -- this is known as the Malthusian Trap. For every advance man made, it only allowed for more children to survive -- children that would later have to compete just to serve the ruling class. The more competition the children inherited, the worse their lives got. And as good as things are now in the West, more humans than were born up until 1800 are still living in conditions worse than ancient hunter gatherers.It's a very sad thought, but Harari gives us reason to be optimistic. The world now has the right ingredients for us to make unimaginable advances: like curing all disease, making aging a thing of the past, and possibly enabling everlasting life. At the same time, we could genetically engineer a virus -- possibly accidentally -- that could wipe out all of human life.So what do we really want? This book makes it feel like just about anything is possible. It makes you feel good about being a silly little hairless monkey. It makes you feel all-powerful almost, even if you're really not. And what's better than that?!"

114,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3809399-stormin,3,"According to Amazon, Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind is a best-seller. It's not hard to see why. This deeply interesting book is also a deeply flawed book, and all of the flaws are calculated to make the book more sensationalist and provocative than the underlying research truly allows.First of all, Harari is all-in for the hypothesis that the Agricultural Revolution was a colossal mistake. This is not a new idea. I've come across it several times, and when I did a quick Google search just now I found a 1987 article by Jared Diamond with the subtle title: The Worst Mistake in the History of the Human Race. Diamond's argument then is as silly as Harari's argument is now, and it boils down to this: life as a hunter-gatherer is easy. Farming is hard. Ergo, the Agricultural Revolution was a bad deal. If we'd all stuck around being hunter-gatherers we'd be happier. (Sometimes they go farther and argue that disease had a hard time spreading when population densities were low, so hunter-gatherer societies were also healthier.)The primary problem with this argument, philosophically, is its naked hedonism. I'm pretty sure I'd be happier if I just stayed in a perpetual, drug-induced high. And yet I don't see Harari or Diamond (or any ostensibly sane person) standing outside of drug rehab facilities wearing a sandwich board warning heroin addicts that they'd be better off just staying high. Could it be conceivable that there's more to life than minimizing the amount of time we spend procuring a bare minimum of resources to sustain life? The most frustrating thing about replying to this line of argument is that it's absurd to even have to spell these things out. Isn't the human penchant for dissatisfaction one of our noblest attributes? We're not satisfied, and so we go out and we invent. Discover. Explore. Build. And, while we're at it, plant and harvest.Of course, it's possible to take that to an extreme. Ideally, we find some way to balance the capacity to enjoy what we have--to live in the moment and to be accepting of the past--without giving up on our noble ambitions and desires to better ourselves, those around us, and the world we inhabit. The fact that this just might involve working more hours per week doesn't automatically make it a bad idea, and the fact that I have to explain any of this to folks like Diamond or Harari is just plain silly. Their arguments are not insightful or provocative. They're just childish.Sadly, since this is one of the first arguments that Harari makes, he starts out by digging a deep credibility hole that he never really climbs back out of. He compounds it with other silly fad-arguments like the idea that we didn't domesticate wheat, wheat domesticate us! Thus:The Agricultural Revolution was history's biggest fraud. Who was responsible? Neither kings, nor priests, nor merchants. The culprits were a handful of plant species, including wheat, rice, and potatoes. These plants domesticated homo sapiens rather than vice versa. Think for a moment about the Agricultural Revolution from the standpoint of wheat. Ten thousand years ago wheat was just a wild grass, one of many, confined to a small range in the Middle East. Suddenly, within just a few short millennia, it was growing all over the world. According to the basic evolutionary criteria of survival and reproduction, wheat has become one of the most successful plants in the history of the Earth. In areas such as the Great Plains of North America, where not a single wheat stalk grew 10,000 years ago, you can today walk for hundreds upon hundreds of miles without encountering any other plant. Worldwide, wheat covers about 870,000 square miles of the globe's surface, almost 10 times the size of Britain. How did this grass turn from insignificant to ubiquitous?The biggest problem here is that the very first thing that Harari argues for in his book is the distinction between ""humans"" (a term that covers many species) and ""homo sapiens"" (a term that refers to just one particular species). He puts all kinds of emphasis on this distinction, including making it the title of his book! And yet, in the passage above, he treats ""wheat"" as just a plant. Yet, according to Wikipedia, wheat is a term (like human) that refers to nearly 2-dozen distinct species. Again, it's a hit for his credibility to be so sanctimonious about a technicality in one case, and then so cavalier about it in another. More than that, however, it substantively undermines his argument. Because the reality is that in domesticating various plants and animals, humans were engaged in slow-motion genetic engineering. The result, from the various species of wheat to animals like dogs and chickens, is a species that is genetically distinct from their ancestors. This matters a lot. Because if Harari wants to define a species genetically (which he does) then the domesticated wheat species is not the same thing as the wild wheat species from which it was derived over tens of thousands of years of selective breeding.To clarify this mistake, imagine that he tried to argue that humans were domestictaed by wolves instead of vice versa. And so now wolves live in the houses of their domesticated humans, right? Well, no. Dogs have domesticated humans, but dogs (Canis familiaris) are not the same things as wolves (Canis lupus, Canis rufus, Canis lycaon, etc). And so you can't say ""wolves domesticated humans"" because man's best friend is no longer a wolf. Similarly, the wheat that we grow for food everywhere isn't the same creature as its wild ancestor. Once again, this isn't just wrong, it's silly. When you see memes on the Internet about how cats own humans, that's funny. When you see someone trying to turn the exact same Internet joke into a serious scientific point in an ostensibly non-fiction book, it's just sad and a little pathetic.Harari's book suffers a lot from this kind of sloppy sensationalism. In addition to these examples, he also spends a lot of time ironically stating that there are no objective values on the one hand and then--often within mere sentences--making sweeping claims about how modern society is better than ancient society in this or that particular respect. Better, according to which values? It's just another example of the utter failure of ostensible relativists to actually enact the relativism they claim to believe in. If there are no objective values, then there's no basis for making statements like that.So, enough of the criticism. What's good?Well, for starters, his separation of ontological concepts into three categories: objective, subjective, and inter-subjective is actually quite useful. He is sloppy about conflating ""subjective"", ""myth"" and ""false"" (these terms are not synonyms, but he think they are), but the definition of inter-subjective as distinct from mere subjectivity is really quite good:An objective phenomenon exists independently of human consciousness and human beliefs. Radioactivity, for example, is not a myth. Radioactive emissions occurred long before people discovered them, and they are dangerous even when people do not believe in them. Marie Curie, one of the discoverers of radioactivity, did not know during her long years of studying radioactive materials, that they could harm her body. While she did not believe that radioactivity could kill her, she nevertheless died of aplastic anemia, a disease caused by overexposure to radioactive materials. The subjective is something that exists depending on the consciousness and beliefs of a single individual. It disappears or changes if that particular individual changes his or her beliefs. Many a child believes in the existence of an imaginary friend who is invisible and inaudible to the rest of the world. The imaginary friend exists solely in the child's subjective consciousness, and when the child grows up and ceases to believe in it, the imaginary friend fades away. The intersubjective is something that exists within the communication network linking the subjective consciousness of many individuals. If a single individual changes his or her beliefs or even dies, it is of little importance. However, if most individuals in the network die or change their beliefs, the intersubjective phenomenon will mutate or disappear. Intersubjective phenomena are neither malevolent frauds nor insignificant charades. They exist in a different way from physical phenomena such as radioactivity but their impact on the world may still be enormous. Many of histories most important drivers are intersubjective: law, money, gods, nations.I also liked a lot of his later theories. As much as he made a hash of the Agricultural Revolution, his argument about the interrelationship between imperialism and science, for example, was really quite fascinating.Scientists have provided the imperial project with practical knowledge, ideological justification, and technological gadgets. Without this contribution, it is highly questionable whether Europeans could have conquered the world. The conquerers returned the favor by providing scientists with information and protection, supporting all kinds of strange and fascinating projects, and spreading the scientific way of thinking to the far corners of the Earth. Without imperial support, it is doubtful whether modern science would have progressed very far. There are very few scientific disciplines that did not begin their lives as servants to imperial growth and that do not owe a large proportion of their discoveries, collections, buildings, and scholarships to the generous help of army officers, navy captains, and imperial governors.This is a genuinely insightful argument, and it's one I'd never heard before. It's not hard to see why. Our culture--especially our intellectual culture--continues to treat science with a great deal of deference and respect. The mere existence of the term ""social science""--combined with the embrace of statistical and other formal mathematical techniques in economics, psychology, etc.--all show how deeply ingrained this deference is. But imperialism? That's practically a bad word in academic settings. Imperialism is pretty close to the Original Sin, as far as anyone residing in the Ivory Tower would believe. And so obviously it's incredibly uncomfortable to suggest that imperialism and science are linked or even, not going quite that far, that historically science got a significant boost from imperialism. This is an embarrassment to modern Western sensibilities, and so the only kind of person who will bring it up is someone like Harari who seems intent on offending every conceivable member of his audience. The only time when mockery is really called for is in response to power, and so it is deployed appropriately in this case, and that is where the same penchant for kind of immature provocation turns from an annoyance (as with his silly theories about the Agricultural Revolution or wheat domesticating humans) into something important and serious.Along these lines, I was also really struck with his argument about the consumerist-capitalist ethic. Here goes:How can we square the consumerist ethic with the capitalist ethic of the business person according to which profits should not be wasted and should instead by reinvested in production. It's simple. As in previous eras, there is today a division of labor between the elite and the masses. In medieval Europe, aristocrats spent their money carelessly on extravagant luxuries, whereas peasants lived frugally minding every penny. Today the tables have turned. The rich take great care managing their assets and investments while the less well-heeled go into debt buying cars and televisions they don't really need. The capitalist and consumerist epics are two sides of the same coin, a merger of two commandments. The supreme commandment of the rich is ""invest"". The supreme commandment of the rest of us is ""buy."" The capitalist-consumerist ethic is revolutionary in another respect. Most previous ethical systems presented people with a pretty tough deal: they were promised paradise, but only if they cultivate compassion and tolerance, overcame craving and anger, and restrained their selfish interests. This was too tough for most. The history of ethics is a sad tale of wonderful ideas that nobody can live up to. Most Christians did not imitate Christ. Most Buddhists failed to follow Buddha. And most Confucians would have caused Confucius a temper tantrum. In contrast, most people today successfully live up to the capitalist-consumerist ideal. The new ethic promises paradise on condition that the rich remain greedy and spend their time making more money, and that the masses give free reign to their cravings and passions and buy more and more. this is the first religion in history whose followers actually do what they are asked to do. How, though, do we know that we'll really get paradise in return? We've seen it on television.Given his frequent borrowing of ideas I recognize from other sources, I suspect this is not original to Harari (I had the audiobook, so I have no idea if he's got footnotes), but it is fascinating to me.There are several more examples of these kinds of points Harari makes that are contrarian and interesting. Some I was already familiar with (such as the nonsensical notion that primitive humans lived in harmony with their environment, something that approaches farce once you actually look at the global swathes of mass extinctions that actually followed the spread of homo sapiens around the globe) and others were either new or particularly well-reasoned (such as his explanation of corporate personhood and intersubjective reality via Peugot). For those reasons: I do recommend reading this book. Just take everything in it with a grain of salt."

In other words, you probably can't have close, personal relationships with more than 150 people at any given time.It takes time and energy to maintain close relationships, and as we all know, time and energy are finite resources. In groups below 150, it's feasible that each member could know each other personally, and have at least a superficial bond.In groups of over 150 people, odds are good that at least some of of the people in the group don't know each other at all. In other words, in groups and communities over 150, you get strangers (those people grandma warned you about). And strangers tend to treat each other differently (probably worse) than people with close personal relationships (that's why grandma told you to avoid them).It has been observed in many domains of human social organization, that when a group e.g. a village, a corps of soldiers, a corperation etc. exceeds 150 individuals, than the social fabric begins to tear and a whole different kind of social regulation is necessary to prevent the group from splintering into factions.What kind of social regulations you ask?Well, you tend to need laws, maybe police to enforce them. You may need religions, and priests to do what ever they do. You may need economic systems and treasuries etc. to replace bartering and collectivistic cooperative ""I'll hunt, you gather, we'll share the spoils"" kinds of arrangements"". You may need ideologies and documents like the bill of rights, or the constitution, or the communist manifesto to galvanize the people into a particular group identity.So what's the thread that stitches all of these systems of social regulation together?What's the common factor necessary to construct these social regulations?According to Yuval Noah Harari, it's fiction. That's right. Were the most massively cooperative animal on the planet, and we're the story telling animal, and the stories we tell about what's right and what's wrong, and what's true and false, and what's acceptable and unacceptable are the very sutures that bind us Sapiens into cooperative groups that total into the billions at this point in our history.According to Harari, religion, money, limited liability corporations, laws, human rights, nations and consumer tribes etc. are all fictions i.e. inter-subjective realities. Products of our collective imagination. Shared beliefs that are agreed upon and collectively observed, but are more or less made up and arbitrary.This is a strong, very compelling argument. But the real value of the book is in the presentation.Yuval Noah Harari doesn't mince words or bar holds (two phrases I have to admit, I've never completely understood. Baring holds sounds like a wrestling thing, but mincing words? WTF? Oh hold on, I'll Google it, okay, mincing means ""to soften"", like minced meat. So mincing words means to soften or otherwise engineer your speech so as not to offend. Check. Correct usage there. Harari doesn't do that. And ""no holds barred is in fact a wrestling thing. I guess prior to the formation of the rules, wrestling was a ""free-form"" affair. That sounds ummm.... how you say....homoerotic?Anyway, with the introduction of rules, certain ""holds"" were ""barred"" so no holds barred is an idiom that draws a parallel between wrestling and arguing a point. Stating that an argument has a no holds barred quality connotes an unregulated, ""free form"", less than cautious kind of approach. Check. Correct again).For the life of me. I can't figure out if Yuval Noah Harari is brilliant or insane or both. He's certainly brilliant, but I'm leaning towards both. Some of the shit in this book is insanely brilliant and utterly outrageous. I kind of love this guy for being so willing to speak so frickin irreverently about so many sacred cow subjects including race, gender, sex, politics and religion. Last time I checked, that's pretty much the litany of hot button topics one typically avoids in polite company.In fact, Yuval Noah Harari would top my ""punk as fuck without knowing it"" list, except for the fact that I think he kind of knows it.One of my wife's friends asked me ""what's not punk as fuck""? I said I don't know, and she said ""punk rock"". So true. I also can't figure out if Sapiens is grounded in science or if it's just one long opinionated rant or both. 60% of Sapiens reads like a brilliant, highly educated dude just pulling opinions out of his keister. 40% reads like solid science. It's just kind of hard to tell which is which. The book is really discursive and frankly a little disorienting at times. But again. Wonderfully so.One of Yuval Noah Harari's tacit claims in the book is that we (Sapieans) are a bunch of murdering fuckers. And it's a very compelling argument to say the least. Harari asserts that, for a period of tens of thousands of years, anatomically modern humans ""Sapieans"" walked the earth with other human species of humans such an Neanderthal and Denisoven. However, when and where ever modern humans arrived on the scene, other species of human populations rapidly declined a eventually disappeared via a combination of assimilation (interbreeding, if you catch my drift) and extermination.What made our brand of human so dominant? We pretty much raped and killed everyone. How did we achieve this marvelous achievement?Harari posits that Sapieans became the dominant species of human due to a ""Cognitive Revolution"" which occurred circa of 70,000 ago which engendered our ancestors with the capacity for (a) advanced language, and (b) fiction.Again, by fiction Harari means any sociolinguistic construct you can think of including rules, laws, and most prominently myths and religion.According to Harari, religion was the first fiction that enabled large groups of humans exceeding 150 individuals to cooperate effectively.So the idea is, that modern humans i.e. Sapiens, evolved to be able to (a) use advanced language, and (b) create fictions such as origin myths and religions, and this galvanized them in to large cooperative groups that could overwhelm and dominate any other pack of animals including rival human species.Okay. Cool. First he called religion a fiction, then he asserted that it was the primary mechanism that enabled humans to galvanize into massive murdering, pillaging death squads. Awesome.Now can you see why I love this guy!But of course, it's not all about plunder.Harari also asserts that these fictions facilitated the formulation of large scale cohabitation e.g. villages, cities etc. which enabled division of labor and specialization. This enabled humans to live ways that are unprecedented elsewhere in the animal kingdom.Harari asserts ""The heated debates about Homo sapiens 'natural way of life' misses the main point. Ever since the Cognitive Revolution, there hasn’t been a single natural way of life for Sapiens. There are only cultural choices, from among a bewildering palette of possibilities""""At the time of the Cognitive Revolution, the planet was home to about 200 genera of large terrestrial mammals weighing over 100 pounds. At the time of the Agricultural Revolution, only about a hundred remained. Homo sapiens drove to extinction about half of the planet’s big beasts long before humans invented the wheel, writing, or iron tools.""Ooooops. My bad. I guess it is all about plunder.But who is plundering whom (note the use of the pretentious variant of who e.g. whom).The Agricultural Revolution (the luxury trap):Harari asserts that us Sapiens (human people) were, in many ways, way better off as hunter gatherers. For the first several thousand years of agriculture, people worked harder and were more pestilent and miserable than hunter gatherers.So why did people bail on the good life to become sick and dirty farmers? According to Harari, it happened incrementally and by accident. The theory goes, that people started gathering grains like wheat from surrounding grass lands. They spilled some of them on their way home. The seeds grew nearer to their encampments. People began to harvest the plants. This enabled easier food collection. Which enabled populations to expand. Which necessitated more focused planting and more permanent encampments. Which facilitated even bigger populations. And then people were trapped. Slaves to Wheat:People found them selves laboring all day, working the land, clearing rocks, digging trenches, planting seeds, hauling water, weeding, killing bugs, all for the benefit of the wheat. The whole situation sucked bad. And the populations were too big to go back to the more chill hunter gather life without mass starvation. We were trapped. People had become slaves to wheat.Science:So, long story short, people invented the scientific method, created a bunch of industry and technology, became slaves to that, and here we are, teetering on the verge of extinction. Great Book.Five Stars !!!!!"

There were parts that I really enjoyed and parts that made me quite uncomfortable. Harari has taken the concepts of collective fictions, the purpose of mankind and the implication of our actions, and the limits to growth, and made it accessible in this book. However, he serves some of his ideological and philosophical notions as scientific and that is my real concern. His ideas are valuable as philosophy and had he presented them as such this would have been a much more respectable effort. However, the inevitable consequence of writing a macro-history is that you are bound to be wrong in some manner. I'm unsure if one can be any more rigorous when given the amount of imagination involved in writing a sweeping macro-history of mankind.The idea of a collective fiction is the same as that of a social construct. Naming it thus, however, highlights the notion that any form of unity humans perceive is based on mutable ideas. This is a valuable reminder to evaluate what we have come to accept as a way of life, but is not a sustainable one. These ideas are so deeply ingrained with the daily life that one can't think of fixing the system without also assuming that one would have to turn all that man has achieved so far on its head. Mankind is going to have to make that attempt if we wish to understand our impact on nature that in turn is impacting the quality of our lives on this planet.

I'd be curious if anybody who rejects evolution, for example, has changed his/her thinking because of this book. I say this because the book feels like a long argument, but I'm not sure who he's arguing with. One of his big points is that people believe in ""myths"" and that this has been useful in many ways. I know that it's been a huge revelation to economists that people aren't rational robots devoid of emotion, but I think it's been pretty obvious all along to everyone else. This is not my favorite kind of book. It read like a series of one-line book summaries strung together into their own book. Because of the breadth of the topic--all of history--the author gets a pass on the lack of depth. I think that shallowness is a problem nowadays, but I guess that in the current post-truth era, it's refreshing just to read something that at least accepts science. 1 bonus star for that.

This is the sort of book that many of us have, it looks great on the shelf!, but that most of us put off reading because we think it will be dry and something of a slog to get through.I'm really delighted to say that that is not the case with ""Sapiens"" at all. Despite the topic at hand, which is to say, us, it does not read at any point like the very long scholarly journal article I once feared it would be. Harari has done a great job of writing a readable, I'd even say relatively fast-moving, account of homo-sapiens.The way ""Sapiens"" takes important issues and weaves them together is masterful. In some sense, this feels like many books in one — Harari writes more insightfully about ideology, money, capitalism, religion, tribalism, the cognitive revolution, the agicultural revolution, etc etc etc, better than many books on these subjects have managed to — and yet they all mesh perfectly into one.I'm not interested in summarizing the general ideas here, or in reciting many of the excellent points the authors makes — you should read the book, or another review, for that — but what I can say is that the notes one could take from the interesting points Harari raises could easily fill a medium-sized notebook.The bottom line, as I found it, is that homo-sapiens are primarily unique in that we are united around myths. We've all heard this before, but this idea hits you as newly revelatory after Harari has delved exhaustively into all the curious details of our species. It gave me a new appreciation for art and for storytelling, without which we really would be no different than the other animals.""Sapiens"" definitely gives one pause when contemplating whether or not our species is actually a force for good in our world. While many of the genocides our species has committed may be behind us, Harari gave me a new appreciation for the tragedies we may currently be engaged in committing, both in regard to environmental destruction, but also animal abuse in the form of things like factory farming.This is essential reading for our species. Understanding how we got here must certainly be key to understanding how we move forward to a better future. "

Entertaining is a bonus.In the first two chapters, the author belittled every other species to walk the Earth, raised homo sapiens up on a pedestal, wrote off all religion in less than a sentence, attributed human intelligence to the need for gossip and so many other broad conclusions that lack any subtlety and show the author's disregard for or misunderstanding of scientific (and even social scientific) investigation.

Straightforwardly told and by covering such as huge topic in a short format, what we lose in depth certainly gives a really good perspective. It loses pace a bit towards the end - somehow it's more fascinating reading about the origins of man, the development of societies and religions, the exploration of the planet and such than the development and mechanisms of modern economics (even if the author places quite much weight on economy and ascribes more effects to it than what probably immediately comes to mind). Unfortunately, I think that this is one of those books that those who would benefit most from it - in terms of challenging own ideas, views and misconceptions - will probably never go near it. In a few instances, I jumped - Harari definitely draws own and quite questionable conclusions a few times. A book like this, however, kind of begs to be read with an inquiring mind. "

A Brief History of Humanity, could be summed up in two images: the one that reminds us, from the very first pages, of our not-so-noble origins: Just 6 million years ago, a single female ape had two daughters. One became the ancestor of all chimpanzees, the other is our own grandmother.And the one that ends the book with the not-so-flattering description of a petulant, overbearing humanity:Is there anything more dangerous than dissatisfied and irresponsible gods who don’t know what they want?In between, our not-so-glorious (hi)story, built solely on cruelty and destruction.The unfortunate (for all the other beings on our planet but also for itself) tale of Homo Sapiens began some 70,000 years ago, when took place the first of the three revolutions that would shape its history: The Cognitive Revolution (The Agricultural Revolution would follow about 12,000 years ago and The Scientific Revolution, about 500 years ago). It was caused, according to some theories, by an accidental genetic mutation that “changed the inner wiring of the brains of Sapiens, enabling them to think in unprecedented ways and to communicate using an altogether new type of language. We might call it the Tree of Knowledge mutation.”This “new type of language” was not used only for essential utilities anymore (for signalling a danger or announcing that there is food nearby, like in the case of other animals), but also to speak about the others and about things and entities that cannot be touched, seen or smelled. This gossip theory could easily explain their ability to cooperate, to form much bigger groups than other animals (a chimpanzee troop consists of about twenty to fifty individuals), for all inhabited a dual world – the natural one and the imaginary one – and believed in the same myths, either religious, juridical or political. Was it the same “wiring of the brains” that gave Sapiens their unique talent for destruction, too? Maybe, because they showed it from the dawn of time, by decimating all the other human species – Homo neanderthalensis, Homo erectus, Homo soloensis, Homo floresiensis, etc. Next in line were animals. Some 45 000 years ago, Sapiens navigated to Australia, where they irreversibly changed the ecosystem, killing, in a few thousand years, almost 90% of the continent’s megafauna: giants kangaroos and koalas, marsupial lions, giant lizards and snakes, diprotodons (a two-and-a-half-ton wombat), and so on. How did they manage to do this? There are three explanations that do not exclude each other: because the killings were faster than breeding (which is slow for large animals); because they burnt vast areas to create grasslands; and because of the climate change (but in the absence of humans they had survived others). The same “ecological serial killer” took care of the large mammals in North America where thirty-four out of its forty-seven genera were lost and in South America, where fifty out of sixty disappeared within 2000 years of the humans’ arrival. At the time of the Cognitive Revolution, the planet was home to about 200 genera of large terrestrial mammals weighing over fifty kilograms. At the time of the Agricultural Revolution, only about a hundred remained. Homo sapiens drove to extinction about half of the planet’s big beasts long before humans invented the wheel, writing or iron tools.And of course, they did not stop there, for every revolution had its own extinction wave: therefore, the extinction initiated by the foragers would be continued by the farmers and by the industrial activity. After conquering new lands by eliminating its ugly inhabitants, Sapiens were ready for a change in their modus vivendi, too. The foragers accidentally discovered how to grow plants and settled down: thus began the Agricultural Revolution called by Harari “history’s biggest fraud” for it was a “luxury trap” that worsened the life of humans instead of bettering it: the average farmer had to work much harder than the forager, hoeing and ploughing, weeding, watering and fertilizing, developed aches and diseases (bad back, arthritis, hernias, etc.), had more children to feed (around 13 000 BC in Jericho, Palestine there were about a hundred well-nourished foragers, around 8500 BC there were about 1000 malnourished farmers) and became even more violent because he had to protect the land and the harvest. However people couldn’t return to forage days because they were too many and because this way of life had been the same for generations.Little by little, farmers discovered how to domesticate chickens and cattle, and the gene of cruelty showed again, teaching them how to put savage animals into cages, how to bind and leash, whip and castrate them. Even nowadays, when scientific studies have incontestably demonstrated that animals suffer both physical and emotional distress, cattle are still some of the most miserable animals that ever existed on planet Earth.The domestication of animals was founded on a series of brutal practices that only became crueller with the passing of the centuries.Therefore. Eliminating other species of potentially menacing humans – check. Killing giant and potentially dangerous animals – check. Domesticating and imprisoning potentially useful ones – check. It was time now for Sapiens to take care of their own backyard, to organize their society. And what better tool for it than hierarchy, strengthened by convincing myths?Two of the best-known myths, the Code of Hammurabi and The Declaration of Independence, although separated by exactly a millennium (1776 BC, the first, 1776 AD the second) strangely share the same principles and values: both claim to be written in the name of God(s), both promise to bring justice for all. Both establish a social hierarchy, explicit in Hammurabi’s that divides Baylonian society in three classes, superior people, commoners and slaves and implicit in the Declaration that simply suggests that men are above women, whites above coloured, and riches above poor.Hierarchies serve an important function. They enable complete strangers to know how to treat one another without wasting the time and energy needed to become personally acquainted.If natural order is stable (gravity exists even though you don’t know about it) human order is not because it depends on myths that vanish when people cease to believe in them; but people are educated to think that the imagined order is a natural one and are prevented from realising it exists only in their imagination by the fact that it is embedded in the material world, taking the shape of our desires (the desire to travel is not natural but programmed; consumerism makes us buy things we don’t really need) and linking the subjective consciousness of people.It seems that all human cultures are full of what is called “cognitive dissonance”, holding contradictory beliefs and incompatible values. A good example is religion, either old or new: the monotheistic religion eliminated competition, but the saints replaced the polytheistic gods (the chief goddess of Celtic Ireland, Brigid, will become St. Brigit, the most revered saint in Catholic Ireland); it couldn’t satisfactory explain the presence of evil in the world; in the name of peaceful Christ were committed massacres; etc. In the last 300 years, old religion was replaced by equally contradictory natural-law religions (which call themselves ideologies): communism, capitalism, liberalism, nationalism and Nazism. Communism strongly opposed religion but had its own gods (Marx, Engels and Lenin), holy script (The Capital), and heretics (the Trotskyism). Capitalism, although it brought morality to the rich (whose “capital” invested benefited the others as well) seems to be more beneficial for society than for the individual. Finally, humanist religions worship humanity but because they could not agree upon the definition of it, they split in three: liberal humanism, believing in human rights, in the free and sacred nature of each individual; socialist humanism, believing in the collective, not individual humanity; evolutionary humanism, or Nazism, believing in the evolution of the humankind and protecting the Aryan race. Anyway, it is obvious that the dynamics of history are not directed towards enhancing human well-being, and there are theories to prove it: for example, the memetics theory, which says that culture is a parasite that infects humanity by replicating its cultural information (called memes) the same way genes replicate organic information, with no regard for humanity (ex. the infection with nationalism in the 19th and 20th centuries) and the game theory, which demonstrates that views and behaviours that harm all players in a multi-player system spread inexorably (ex. arms races that bankrupt every player without changing the military balance: everyone continues to buy the weapon the others bought).And here we come to the last and even more potent revolution: the scientific one, beginning around 1500, when humanity became aware of progress (until then they did not invest in discoveries, only took care to maintain the existing knowledge). For the first time, science admitted ignorance, learned to centralize information to obtain new knowledge and began to acquire new technologies. One of its main priorities is the Gilgamesh Project – the eternal life. To succeed, Sapiens dared break the laws of natural selection creating new species, cloning existing ones, reconstructing Neanderthal DNA to implant it into a Sapiens ovum etc. This intelligent design is only one step away from producing superhumans. In fact, we are already more or less bionic, depending on “devices such as eyeglasses, pacemakers, orthotics, and even computers and mobile phones (which relieve our brains of some of their data storage and processing burdens). We stand poised on the brink of becoming true cyborgs, of having inorganic features that are inseparable from our bodies, features that modify our abilities, desires, personalities and identities.”The frenzy of the progress has not, however, stopped the destruction and the cruelty. We are still torturing animals, we are still carelessly destroying ecosystems, we are still happily killing each other. If I recall correctly, the author says somewhere that the human damage would never be thorough, because nature is indestructible. I wish I could share his belief, but as I see it, humanity is a cancer that has spread inexorably and menaces to leave Earth “a pebble in the sky”. If the Human Brain Project, founded in 2005, which wants o recreate the human brain inside a computer, succeeds, maybe the artificial intelligence will take over. And maybe, after a thorough analysis, it will decide to cure Earth. And it will be exactly what we deserve, no more, no less. PS My reading was gloomy, despite the optimistic tone of the author who always tried to show both sides of the coin. However, to leave in a more cheerful tone, here are some interesting and sometimes amusing information:•	discovering cooking shortened human beings’ intestines decreasing their energy consumption (a chimpanzee chews five hours a day raw food – a human only one hour);•	the Arabic numerals were in fact invented by the Hindus (but it was the Arabs who spread it);•	money represents the apogee of human tolerance: we do not trust the stranger, but we trust his money ☺;•	history cannot be explained by determinism and cannot be predicted because it is a ‘level two’ chaotic system (a level one is chaos that cannot react to prediction like the weather, a level two reacts to it, so it can never be accurately predicted, like politics);•	it was Daoist alchemists who accidentally invented the gunpowder by searching for the elixir of life. They used it only for firecrackers and only 600 years later it was used for canons;•	once, companies could fight and own lands, like the Dutch West Indies Company (WIC), that built a settlement called New Amsterdam on an island at the Hudson river’s mouth. The British captured it in 1664 and changed its name to New York. On the remains of the wall built by WIC to defend its colony against Indians and British is today paved Wall Street;•	the First Opium War, between Britain and China (1840–42) broke out because the Chinese government, after seeing millions of Chinese becoming addicts, issued a ban on drug trafficking, and began to confiscate and destroy drug cargos. Britain declared war on China in the name of ‘free trade’, won and forced China to let British drug merchants sell in the country and to surrender Hong Kong, which became the base for drug trafficking. “In the late nineteenth century, about 40 million Chinese, a tenth of the country’s population, were opium addicts.”;•	the aluminium, discovered in the 1820s, was so difficult and costly to separate from its ore than for decades it was more expensive than gold (Emperor Napoleon III of France put aluminium cutlery in front of his most distinguished guests, and gold one in front of the others);•	timetable was initially created by factories, then adopted by everyone and spread by public transportation. In 1784, a carriage service in Britain published for the first time a schedule specifying only the hour of departure. British cities had their own local time, different from London until 1847, when British train companies decided to calibrate all train timetables to Greenwich Observatory time. In 1880, the British government legislated that all timetables in Britain follow Greenwich.And some disturbing quotes:History is something that very few people have been doing while everyone else was ploughing fields and carrying water buckets.*Consistency is the playground of dull minds. *Real peace is the implausibility of war. There has never been real peace in the world. (…) Today humankind has broken the law of the jungle. There is at last real peace, and not just absence of war. For most polities, there is no plausible scenario leading to full-scale conflict within one year. *Like Satan, DNA uses fleeting pleasures to tempt people and place them in its power.*Unless some nuclear or ecological catastrophe intervenes, so goes the story, the pace of technological development will soon lead to the replacement of Homo sapiens by completely different beings who possess not only different physiques, but also very different cognitive and emotional worlds."
124,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,1,"This is advertised like a scientific tour of the history of our species. But that's a thin veil to sell the author's crank ideas.1. He starts off with the noble savage myth. This is the idea that prehistoric humans lived an idyllic life free of violence and in harmony with nature. This idea has been roundly contradicted by paleontology (megafauna seem to go extinct in our wake) and anthropology (contemporary hunter-gatherer tribes make war with each other, often practice infanticide, etc.). Worse, he even describes a violent practice whereby a tribe might kill aging members who are a drag on the community, then on the same page talks about this as being a society with ""no violence""!2. He claims that ""The Agricultural revolution was history's biggest fraud"". He recites Michal Pollan's anti-agriculture rhetoric that serial crops were the ones that domesticated humans, which is clearly the reverse of the truth. He says that hunter-gatherers lead ""a rather good life"" and that agriculture leads to a ""miserable existence"" which, if the author had ever truly been hungry a day in his entire privileged fucking life, he would surely recognize as the reverse of the truth. He says about the agricultural revolution that it gave us ""the ability to keep more people alive under worse conditions."" I wonder, has this schmuck ever tried to make his daily calories from wild foods? Has he ever tried to build his own shelter (as nomads must often do)? It's romantic to think about our recent evolutionary environment. But let's not fool ourselves and believe those conditions are better than even the most cramped, bubonic, medieval comforts.3. He has this habit of calling human inventions ""myths"" and uses this merely as a pejorative. He dismisses laws, money, governments, human rights, etc. this way, whenever it serves him. But he never slanders an idea he's supporting with this label. Joseph Campbell would not be pleased. He also uses the phrase ""imagined order"" to the same effect. Cranks tend to invent their own terminology and jargon as a means to confuse or obfuscate.4. He calls everything that he dislikes a ""religion"". Marxism, Humanism, Capitalism, etc. But for some reason he thinks Buddhism (which actually is a religion) is merely an ""ideology"". As a philosopher, he should know that belief in the supernatural characterizes religion. He acts like its some big discovery he's made that these things are really religions, like he's seen something other people didn't notice. Cranks tend to consider themselves geniuses.5. He hates Humanism and devotes a whole chapter to battering against a straw man of it. He actually defines humanism as the elevation the status of humans above that of other animals. Which completely misses the point! He repeats the tired old religious apologetic that Humanism ""borrow from religion"" (it doesn't). He claims that the racist genocidal Nazi ideology was ""accurate to the science of the day"" (it wasn't). He clearly didn't feel the need to consult an expert on Humanism, Nazism, or religious apologetic. Cranks tend to work in isolation from their colleagues.6. He's got that whole denial of the moral arc cultural relativism thing going on. He says that history is nondeterministic therefore somehow we can't form objective opinions about cultures or make predictions about future based on historical trajectories. Which is a bunch of bullshit. I mean, this guy actually has a doctorate in philosophy!7. He glibly repeats the myth that the Tasmanian aboriginals were driven extinct. They weren't. This guy is an historian, writing a book about history. How did he get such a simple fact like this wrong? How are we supposed to trust him when he makes more difficult to verify claims like that Europeans conquered the world because they had ""capitalism and science""? The book contains a long list of unsupported claims where, as an avid reader of popular science books, I've come to expect evidence. But time after time, he fails to deliver even the least shred of evidence to support his often grandiose claims.8. When discussing morality, he confuses happiness for ""well-being"". He attacks some bizarre straw man of utilitarianism as though it only considers, I kid you not, people's serotonin levels. Remember, he has a degree in philosophy, so I can't help but conclude he's being purposefully deceitful here. He says that ""happiness is based on self-delusion"". Yeah, no, I don't know what that means, either. He says that theists who derive meaning from their religion are on equal (delusional) footing with a secular person who decides it for themselves. But we recognize delusions as beliefs that are unreal or at least irrational. This is true for theists but not for atheists. He really tips his ""Jesus College"" cards here. He's presenting a blatantly fallacious, pro-religion argument.9. He's anti-GMO. He expresses his sincere concern that people would bring back Neanderthals and use them for slave labor. He actually writes that ""Future Dr. Drankensteins could therefore create something truly superior to us, something that will look at us as condescendingly as we look at the Neanderthals."" That's an actual quote from the book.10. He says the question isn't ""what do we want to become"", it's ""what do we want to want"" and that those who aren't ""spooked"" by this question probably haven't given it enough thought. But it's the other way around: those who are used to thinking this way aren't spooked by it at all. Mindfulness isn't scary. Unless you're an unrepentant asshole deep down inside, or something like that.11. On the same page he says that sapiens stands at the verge of becoming a god, he laments we have ""so far produced little we can be proud of"". His core thesis is that civilization hasn't decreased the amount of suffering in the world. This Olympian feat of mental gymnastics is astounding. He dismisses all of the improvements to quality of life (not dying a violent death, not being hungry all the time, not being eaten my insects all day every day, or dying of preventable disease, etc.) because they only increase dopamine but don't make life truly better in any meaningful way. He's invented a new type of denial: suffering denial.And if you deny all human suffering, then yeah, civilization hasn't decreased the amount of suffering in the world.Not one bit."

Who would have thought that you can bring Neanderthals to nuclear wars, Spirit Gods to Bionic arms in the same book and still make it such a enjoyable read? You don't need to agree with all the super convincing arguments he makes but can savour the tidbits of life from hunter-gatherers to the industrial revolution. I am adding sitting in the lecture hall of Hebrew University of Jerusalem and attending Harari's History class to my wishlist!"
126,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6243880-gary-beauregard-bottomley,5,"This book is a masterpiece. I feel fortunate that I discovered it before most other people. I discovered it by reading an extremely negative review for this book in the Wall Street Journal written by a historian. (In his defense, he just didn't understand that this is not a history book, and he had no idea what Harari is getting at). This book never stops in challenging my understanding of our place in the universe. What we believe in determines what we want to want. Sapiens are distinguished by our ability to believe in fictions. The cognitive revolutions starts with the first set of hypothetical stories we allow ourselves to believe in whether they are true or not. The real importance is that the family, kin, friends, and community share those beliefs. Our fictions allow us to cooperate. They gives us the imaginary order that is necessary for societies to act together. Corporations are not people, they do not exist in reality. One can not point to a corporation. It's not the buildings, or the executives or any other physical entities that make the corporation, but it is our belief that makes them real. The author notes that the word for corporation comes from the Latin, corpus, the same as in the body (corpus) of Christ within the transubstantiation. Religion gives us comfort from the absurd and comforts us to accept death. Science (and its offshoot, technology) does the opposite. It gives us knowledge leading to life extension and makes our time alive more comfortable. The Gilgamesh Project of life extension is a major character is this book. The myths we create can never be logically consistent without contradictions. Perfect liberty will always conflict with perfect equality. Knowledge about the real world can never be 'universal, necessary, and certain', but we only get glimpses of reality by considering the 'particular, contingent, and probable'. Our myths give us comfort and subjective well being, but they are never without contradictions. The acceptance of our myths give us our commonality. He'll even say that because of the myths we chose to believe in they determine our progress. When cultures (imaginary orders) collectively know Truth, they have no reason to proceed. Biology enables us, cultures forbid us. The most important words necessary for progress are ""I don't know, but I want to find out"". He connects Imperialism with Capitalism leading to seeking knowledge (and developing science). Only those who do not believe they know everything need to search. If I were to have ever written a book (which fortunately for the reading public, I save all my writing only for book reviews!) this is the book I would have written. I believe this will be a classic in the future and am glad I discovered it. The author has written this book to make sure we do everything in our power to understand that the things we belief in will determine who we will be going forward. The myths we chose to believe in will determine what we become. "
127,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2330809-steve,5,"Wow. Big think brilliantly executed. Disclaimer: 
this book is not for everyone.
 If you don't want to question (literally) every assumption you've ever made and everything you've been taught - if you aren't willing to consider alternative explanations for every organizing rubric you understand in life (and that includes evolution, society/community/family, nations/states/empires, religion, capitalism/markets, the agricultural and scientific revolutions, and that's just the tip of the iceberg) - if you consider it heresy to challenge convention and orthodoxy, 
don't read this book.
 Add to that the fact that the book is dense, the topics and concepts come fast and furious, the presentation is elegant yet sophisticated, and the range of disciplines in play is extraordinary, well, this isn't the most leisurely beach reading you can find. But ... but ... if you like confronting life's big questions, well, this gem is for you.To say that the book is ambitious in scope is a grotesque understatement. Nonetheless, the organization and presentation is surprisingly accessible (and, for the most part, linear). To this reader, the prose was not only appropriate, but teetering on exquisite and, at times, lyrical. And the author's ability to periodically inject humor into the material only made the experience more gratifying.Part of me wishes I'd read (something like) this the summer after I finished college and before I started grad school, while part of me willingly concedes that I never would have stuck with it -- I would have rejected it early on as too far out there and wouldn't have taken it seriously. And part of me is grateful that I've read it at this point in life, having accumulated a base of schooling (and degrees), experience, and a lifetime of broad (nay, eclectic) reading (including a healthy diet of history and other non-fiction, with more than my share of science fiction). Frankly, I'm dying to hear from high school (maybe in advanced placement courses) and undergraduate academics (teaching serious students) who have experimented with assigning this to younger readers.Ultimately, I'm not surprised this is an international bestseller. Having said that, my money says that most people who buy the book won't read (let alone) finish it. Still, if you're looking for something to get the juices flowing and expand your horizons, I can't recommend it enough.*After completing the book, I decided I wanted an office (not just an electronic) copy, so I also bought a 
hardback edition
, and I'm glad I did. The book is chock full of color pictures, paintings, maps, charts and diagrams that add to the experience. And it's not just the color inserts, it's the commentary that accompanies them. Having said that, the book, given its size, its 
shockingly heavy
, which must say something about the quality of the paper (necessary for including color inserts throughout)..."

And I'm glad I did!I was worried, given that it was on such a weighty subject, that it would be a bit dense and dry. However, that wasn't the case at all. In fact, I think the author's major strength is the ability to write engagingly and entertainingly, even when examining something as factual as the history of humanity. This book covers it all - from the early beginnings of man (and the flourishing of the agricultural revolution) to conquest, war and capitalism. Certain chapters were utterly engrossing; for example, the sections on economy were incredibly eye-opening (making me think 'how on earth does such a flimsy premise as credit actually work?') and likewise the notion of Europe's spread across the world, for better or worse (mostly for worse, let's be honest). This isn't an easy, flick-through-the-pages read, but it's so accessible and interesting that you'll probably be happy to invest the time in it. I shall be looking out for his other books now! "

130,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/382662-dylan-lawrence,3,"Deceptive title, unfocused book.I know that judging a book by its cover is bad, but judging a book by its description should be better. I bought this because I thought it was about anthropology and the genetic history of sapiens. But as it says in the book there isn't much information behind the ""iron curtain"" or before written history. So instead of going deeper into what we know about genes and summarizing findings that we do have, he summarizes all of human history. This is where the book looses focus, and while it is a good read, it is far too general. In one chapter it tries to answer what happiness is, in the next it tries to speculate as to the future of humanity. It's just too much for one book. I feel the book needs to be either much longer or several books. Or perhaps a different title, like ""the future and past of humanity"" or ""what is humanity?"". Truly the majority of the book is philosophy and history, rather than science."

135,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9628169-charles-j,3,"""Sapiens"" is a book of history, but its main thrust is philosophical. It explores, or tries to explore, the conundrum that if man is built to seek meaning, but under modernity there is no meaning to be had, what is man to do? Since the author, Yuval Noah Harari, rejects all meaning as myth, yet makes meaning the focus of his book, his book has a split personality. But if you take ""Sapiens"" simply as longitudinal history, ignoring Harari’s sophomoric musings, and if you don’t mind the superficial nature of much of his history, you’ll have a reasonably good time.""Sapiens"" is only nine years old, but it shows its age from the start of the book. This is because, as David Reich outlines in ""Who We Are and How We Got Here,"" the genetic archaeology that allows us to understand our distant ancestors has radically expanded in the past decade, and it has totally changed our understanding. Thus, while Harari offers a reasonable explanation of human pre-history as known in 2010, it’s out of date. He understates the amount of interbreeding homo sapiens did with other human lineages, and overstates the likelihood of the increasingly disproven “replacement” theory, where we simply overwhelmed Neanderthals and others. More importantly, he incorrectly claims that the Cognitive Revolution, in which humans developed language and expanded communication, was a one-time event, whereas it is now evident that it happened simultaneously in widely separated areas, and thus cannot be attributed to a single chance mutation.However, this initial exposition of historical biology, whatever its factual accuracy, is merely backdrop for Harari’s main claim, that the benefit to mankind of the Cognitive Revolution was the ability to create joint fictions that unified mankind. To this Harari attributes nearly all human progress, beginning with coordinating human action beyond that of small clan groups, but progressing far beyond. For Harari, nearly everything is a joint fiction—not only all religion, naturally, but also justice, law, nations, corporations, money, and more. Everything that cannot be touched, really, counts as a joint fiction.The claim that religions, morality, and justice are mere fictions is arguable, though very boring and hardly original. Beyond that, though, Harari’s basic claim fails, because most man-made psychic structures and artificial entities are not fictional, but notional. Does Congress not exist because it is a body with power created by agreement, rather than something springing organically from the laws of physics? By Harari’s reasoning, under which corporations are fictions and money is a delusion, it does not. But that is obviously false. Similarly, while what constitutes a “nation” can be blurry, it is not fictional. One could not substitute a completely different definition for “France” by fiat; it would lack any tie to reality, unlike the actual nation of France. Similarly, Harari explicitly equates “capitalism” with a religion, claiming that if “the majority of investors and bankers failed to believe” in it our economies would collapse. This is bizarrely silly. The free market, which is what Harari means by “capitalism,” is an organic outgrowth of uncoerced exchanges of items with, ultimately, actual value. It is not dependent in any way on some collective myth.On the other hand, Harari deftly demonstrates that Communism and humanism are no less religions than Christianity and Islam. He also correctly identifies that humanism, a purely Western belief, is merely desiccated Christianity, snarkily noting “The only humanist sect that has actually broken loose from traditional monotheism is evolutionary humanism, whose most famous representatives are the Nazis.” This combination, for the reader, of alternating moments of “what the hell?” and consistent logic characterizes the book; one can never tell, in any given section, which you’re going to get. At least it keeps the reader on his toes. Perhaps sensing this conflict, Harari tries to dress up his claims with pseudo-scientific language, asserting that what he claims are fictions create an “inter-subjective” reality, a term he apparently made up. He means they are collective fictions, where a single person’s belief or unbelief is irrelevant. Maybe, but that still does not make something that is not a fiction a fiction. Harari then compounds this error by repeatedly claiming that the inevitable end result of human creation of fictions is global unity and the ending of nations and nationalism. This thesis is, um, lacking in actual evidence, not that Harari offers any.In any case, continuing with history, Harari, like James C. Scott, has a lot of sympathy for the view that hunter-gatherers, post-Cognitive Revolution, had pretty good lives, well-fed and with plenty of time to sit around and do nothing. On the other hand, he notes that those lives may not have been good for everyone involved. Thus, he points out the modern Aché of Paraguay, who blithely kill their own children who annoy them, bury alive “funny looking” babies while people laugh, and ax their old people when they become a burden. Topics like this challenge Harari, because he wants to say this is wrong, but if everything humans believe about right and wrong is a fiction, as he maintains, no morality can exist. Therefore, he tends to make occasional assertions that some actions are wrong, then run away from further thought on the matter, throwing off squid ink to distract the reader. Me, I don’t have this problem. I think it’s good that the Paraguayans put down the Aché, and that the Spanish put down the Aztecs, because they had nasty, evil societies that deserved to be destroyed. Full stop.Discussion of the Cognitive Revolution is stage setting for a lengthy and lively narration of known, that is, documented, human history up until modern times. First, humanity expanded, using its new ability to share fictions to better organize and overcome opposition, including that of nature. Then humans developed agriculture, in the Agricultural Revolution, allowing more people to exist, although Harari is very skeptical they were happier people. “We will see time and again how a dramatic increase in the collective power and ostensible success of our species went hand in hand with much individual suffering.” By this Harari includes animal suffering, a topic about which he is much exercised, although again, if morality is a fiction, why that should be, other than some instinctive squeamishness, is not clear. (When my wife and I first started dating, she had recently acquired a cat, which she loved almost as much as me. Naturally, she talked to it, and doted on it. Every so often, I would grumpily admonish her, “Stop anthropomorphizing the cat.” This is an error that Harari often falls into, where he anthropomorphizes both animals and the natural world, desperate to show that humans are both different and not different at all.)In any case, we travel, very rapidly, accompanied by frequent didacticism to remind us of Harari’s frame of fiction, through early pastoralists and farmers; to Hammurabi; through the rest of human history, to the present day. It’s modestly interesting, though there is no new information here. Harari is fond of broad-stroke history, but seems to lack small-scale knowledge, which does not inspire confidence. No, a thirteenth-century Frenchman could not sell his children into slavery, or be enslaved for debt himself. Slavery had disappeared in Europe long before the thirteenth century (other than in Muslim-controlled areas, notably parts of Spain), and this is not an obscure fact. (Harari’s claim is made even stranger by that three hundred pages later he accurately says “At the end of the Middle Ages, slavery was almost unknown in Christian Europe.”) No, medieval people were not dissuaded from starting businesses because “they could end up totally destitute” due to lack of limited liability; small-scale medieval businesses did not have liabilities in the same way we do now, with leverage and lawyers, and anyway the same thing is true today, since limited liability does not apply to personally guaranteed debts, which is all small business debt. It is false that “In the US, the technical term for a limited liability company is a ‘corporation’ ”; those are distinct types of legal entities. The Roman emperor killed at Adrianople was Valens, not Valence. As the Spanish gradually and heroically reconquered Spain from Muslim invaders, they sometimes minted coins with Arabic inscriptions not, as Harari implies, because they thought that Muhammad might actually have been Allah’s messenger and they were hedging their bets, but because copying accepted coins in newly conquered territory was a standard medieval practice to avoid trade disruptions. Such errors accumulate.On a more substantial level, Harari ties himself in knots trying to harmonize the unarguable existence of core and biologically dictated differences between men and women, as shown by many undeniable facts, including the universal existence of patriarchy and the complete absence of matriarchies, with the politically correct delusion that differences between men and women are cultural, that is, in Harari’s frame, purely fictional. He just can’t fathom it. “If, as is being demonstrated today so clearly, the patriarchal system has been based on unfounded myths rather than on biological facts, what accounts for the universality and stability of this system?” Of course, the word “clearly,” as usual, indicates something not shown at all, that any “unfounded myths” exist, and with this covering statement, Harari flees the scene, generously releasing more squid ink.To move history to the present day, Harari outlines the Scientific Revolution. He appropriately credits it purely to Europeans (with a few halfhearted attempts to falsely claim that, for example, English medical texts adopted American Indian “treatments,” similar to the “history” taught schoolchildren today that Indians invited the hypodermic needle), though he dates it later than most scholars, and tries to avoid giving credit to Christianity, instead giving credit, weirdly, to the discovery of America by Columbus. He also appropriately ascribes the Great Divergence, the lead taken by the West in the Industrial Revolution over the rest of the world and maintained to this day despite the blessings developed by the West being freely available to all, to other cultures’ inability to organize themselves around the right fictions—in other words, to their inferior cultures. And so we arrive at today.At this point, Harari faces the dilemma of all modern scholars who want to predict the future, as it relates to science. Will it be, in Charles Mann’s words, that of the Prophets, who predict future doom based on resource exhaustion, or of Wizards, who predict future prosperity based on technology? Of course, as Mann points out in his excellent The Wizard and the Prophet, only Wizards have ever, so far, proven to be correct. Harari chooses sorcery, white sorcery, as well, for the short term. In his exposition, he is much like Steven Pinker, noting the very many material improvements of the modern world, without the verbal diarrhea that characterizes Pinker.Harari does touch on problems that result, such as unbridled consumerism and animal suffering, although, once again, since he is all for unlimited personal autonomy and he rejects morality, he glosses over how it is that he can call these problems. This half-a-loaf approach to moral questions is emblematic of much of Harari’s writing about modernity—he criticizes aspects of it, and even shares the insight with conservative writers that autonomic individualism is midwifed by, and benefits, the state and the market, not human beings. But he is unwilling to contemplate any other system—perhaps because Harari himself, although he mentions none of it in this book, is the very essence of an atomized modern man. He is a vegan, atheist, meditation-obsessed homosexual, with (consequently) no children. His kind would find little place in any society that did not worship autonomy or held to any traditional standard of morality. Thus, he cannot bring himself to contemplate that any other kind of society could be acceptable, even though he perceives the problems in the society we have.All this focuses on the material world, both of plenty and of peace. What, though, of happiness, harder to quantify but arguably a deeper and more important question? Harari, who earlier noted correctly that our ancestors were no less smart than us (and may have been smarter, because they had to be), here observes that our ancestors, despite the pains and dangers they suffered, may have been happier than us. Thus, mere scientific advancement will not lead to more happiness, since what man seeks, and what makes him happy, is not more toys, or even better health, but meaning. Harari ascribes that men in past ages were content because their “collective delusions” gave them meaning, by which he primarily means religion, although he may also mean, and should mean, other forms of seeking after meaning, such as the search for glory.What should we do, then? Well, first Harari issues a brief plug for Buddhism (the real thing, not the pallid version pushed by most Westerners). He instructs us that what people need, most of all, is to know the truth about themselves; from that they can derive meaning. Why that should be is unclear, and it fits poorly with the author’s earlier assertion that meaning is derived from collective delusion. No matter, though, since Harari has a solution. He predicts, and advocates, black sorcery—the destruction of homo sapiens through our replacement by a predicted, and wholly imaginary, future of some new type of engineered man.Here the book falls apart. In fifteen pages, Harari speeds through a superficial but glossy set of fantasies, throwing out terms that sound sexy and telling us that, most likely, the Singularity is coming and we will remake humanity from whole cloth. This is all stupid. As with artificial intelligence, something that is going exactly nowhere, recreating ourselves through rebuilding our genome is not going to happen. Harari issues numerous sweeping yet contentless statements, punctuated with a picture of what is supposed to be a miracle advance, a misshapen partial human external ear grown on a mouse’s back. From 1996. I am not impressed. When YouTube can auto-generate subtitles that are 100% accurate, instead of the gibberish Linear A it does now, and someone transplants a human eye, then I’ll believe that any of this is coming.Oh, I suppose it’s theoretically possible to do, just like almost anything can be imagined, but there is very little evidence of any progress in this direction. One only has to review all the never-arriving cures that we were promised were imminent through new applications of biology, from angiogenesis in cancer to stem cells, to realize that we are very, very far away from homo deus (the title of the book Harari wrote next). And since the pace of scientific innovation has, in fact, slowed down greatly (exemplified by Peter Thiel’s complaint that he was promised flying cars and got 140 characters), and the West, which has produced all relevant scientific progress to date, is killing its dynamism, competency, and capability by a combination of having no children and worshipping the destructive Left gods today named diversity and inclusion, there is no chance whatsoever that any of what Harari predicts will happen will actually happen. At the rate we’re going, unless we remake society rather than remaking ourselves, we’ll have less relevant science in fifty years, not more.He never quite comes out and says it, but what Harari seems to be trying to say is that new humans will subsist on new forms of meaning, thus solving the problem that modernity has erased man’s ability to find meaning. This is a dumb pipe dream. If people are unhappy in modernity, the correct response is to fix modernity, and cohere our dreams to our nature. We should keep the science that sprang from the West and Christianity, which has nothing to do with autonomy, democracy, or any other Enlightenment or pseudo-Enlightenment garbage principle, and throw the rest of the modern world overboard. As I like to say, why not the High Middle Ages with rockets? That’s the project we should be starting, not trying desperately to insert meaning into our lives by reworking our DNA."
136,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/267189-todd-n,5,"I think this is one those new fangled “big history” books because it starts with the Big Bang. But then again it ends with us either as transhumanist gods or self-inflicted evolutionary road kill. So maybe secular eschatology since there are no homo sapiens by the end? I also read a review describing this book as pyscho-social history, which I can dig. There’s plenty of philosophy and more than a little meditating on the nature of happiness mixed in.Near the end of the book, Mr. Harari surveys the accomplishments of Homo sapiens and wonders whether Neil Armstrong was any happier than whoever left that red hand print 30,000 years ago in that cave in France. If not, then what was the point.Well, I didn’t walk on the moon but I was born in Ohio and I went to school at Purdue, and I can attest that a lot of things in civilization really, really annoy me, but I’m also grateful that I don’t need to worry about getting eaten by saber-toothed tigers. So it's a wash.The book is broken up into three main revolutions: the cognitive revolution (70,000 years ago), the agricultural revolution (10,000 years ago), and the scientific revolution (500 years ago).It begins with a murder mystery. There are 6 to 12 Homo species hanging around Earth. Sapiens is just one undistinguished species among many. In fact, erectus existed for 2M years, making them likely to hold the record for all time most successful Homo species. Homo sapiens wandered up to Europe and was easily beaten back by neanderthalensis.But then around 70,000 years ago some sort of light switched on in Homo sapiens’ head starting the cognitive revolution. This enabled all sorts of complex language, abstract thought, and who knows what else. Suddenly sapiens is the only Homo species.And then there was one. The best case scenario is that sapiens interbred (most likely forcibly after conquest). The worst case is that they were hunted and killed, similar to what Europeans did to the natives of New Zealand when they were discovered. Also, large land mammals suspiciously tended to disappear when Homo sapiens arrive on the scene.From this cognitive revolution on people were unhooked from biological evolution. Through the power of abstract principals like God, empire, and Taco Tuesday, millions of Homo sapiens is able to work in organizations far bigger than even bees, ants, and termites. And these organizations can be reconfigured on timescales much quicker than evolution and at relatively low cost.So money is just a mind-virus, and so is religion, and humanism, which is deemed the most dominant Western ""religion"" by this book. I definitely have to read me some more mimetics.Then around 10,000 years ago people decided to settle down and farm. This is a big mystery because over the long run it resulted in a poorer quality of life — worse diet, longer hours, more hierarchical societies, more diseases, and probably more wars.Mr. Harari calls it the worst fraud in history and wonders maybe if wheat domesticated us instead of the other way around. I read one theory that we switched to agriculture because we liked beer so darn much. It’s probably just our selfish genes tricking us yet again because the end result was a lot more human DNA per area.With the scientific revolution, European sapiens are willing to admit ignorance and work from empirical observation. This coupled with running around the world like Daffy Duck going “Mine mine mine!” winds up being a powerful combination.I liked the discussion of capitalism because it made two really important points: (1) Capitalism depends on investing the excess profits back into the system — turning profits back into capital. The wealthy in ancient Rome would build big statues or hold elaborate games because there was really nowhere to invest. (2) Capitalism also depends on having faith in the future — a feeling the whole pie is going to get bigger and benefit everyone. While we all know that this is predicated on increasing consumerism, it also requires a feeling of security that property rights are protected and that courts will judge fairly. There is a good example of Dutch vs. France given. I wonder whether 21stC America will continue to meet these criteria.Then we come to the aforementioned discussion of happiness, which apparently isn’t much discussed by historians. Not having studied history, I have no idea.But this is important because barring any unforeseen environmental catastrophes, world wars, or plagues, we’ll probably be able to start intelligent designing ourselves by the end of the century. He ends with this sentence: “Is there anything more dangerous than dissatisfied and irresponsible gods who don’t know what they want?”The pages are thick and glossy, I guess for the color printing, which makes the book unusually heavy.Very highly recommended"

I didn't know much about ancient history or anthropology, so I was only vaguely familiar with some of the info in Sapiens, and a lot of it was completely new to me. So I was fascinated, really. If you've read lots of anthropology books that examine these periods/topics in great depth, probably Sapiens won't be as interesting to you. It covers a lot of ground in a relatively short number of pages. Besides enjoying the content of the book itself, I also liked the author's style. From time to time he made some kind of a provoking comment like 'capitalism is a religion', then backed his opinion up. These jolts kept me on my toes the whole time. Perhaps without them, the book would have been dry.I also liked that Harari didn't pretend he had all the answers or that history was deterministic. When reasons for something were unclear or there were several conflicting theories, he said so. He laid the possibilities out, listing factors supporting and discrediting them, reasons preventing modern science from knowing for sure, etc. I appreciate the honesty.It feels like Homo Deus: A History of Tomorrow is a sequel :) I'll definitely read it, and probably soon!So, I loved this book.

My bestie Amanda recently purchased Sapiens on the strength of several recommendations, with someone even suggesting she could use it as a university course textbook. However, she is neck-deep in writing a PhD thesis right now, so I’m subbing in! I do loves me some world history … just not this one.Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind attempts to chart the development of the human species as it spreads around the world and transforms the world through science, technology, exploration, and war. Harari begins with prehistory and the emergence and survival of Homo sapiens as the sole remaining Homo species on the planet. From there he leads us through ancient history and towards more modern history, all the while ruminating upon how various cultural developments (such as religion, writing, and capitalism) might have been the killer apps of each period. At the end of the book, he allows himself the luxury of speculating where the human species might be heading in the future.All of this sounds great on the surface, and I definitely see why people would find this book fascinating and enjoyable. Had I read this, say, 7 to 10 years ago, back in my more impressionable university days, maybe I would have been one of them (I used to think Jared Diamond had interesting things to say; what can I say, I was naive). As it is, Sapiens is just making me want to re-read 
A Short History of Nearly Everything
, which I haven’t read in years. I respect that Bill Bryson, who does not have a histor doctorate, doesn’t disguise the fact that his book is basically pop history. Because don’t let the references in the end notes fool you: that’s what Sapiens is too.At one point, Harari writes, “As the twenty-first century unfolds, nationalism is fast losing ground.” This, from a book originally written in 2011 but updated in 2014, is … puzzling. I’m pretty sure that even as far back as 5 years ago people were sounding the alarm about the rise of nationalism. And now … well, sigh, now where we are.So, yeah, Sapiens seems a little short-sighted at times?Also there are lots of diagrams that look like the author created them with Word’s Shape Art on a rainy afternoon when he had nothing better to do.Such quipping critiques aside, though, really, Sapiens just made me uneasy the whole time I was reading it. A great deal of what Harari says sounds reasonable and interesting. I learned a lot while reading this book, which is why I think many people enjoyed and are endorsing it. Harari is a compelling writer in the sense of how he structures and lays out each chapter. Yet that’s entirely my issue: I feel like I was being lulled into a false sense of security only to have questionable, pseudo-philosophical premises slipped into my brain when I wasn’t paying attention.For a book with a fair amount of scholarship apparently behind it (given the endnotes), Harari doesn’t ever seem interested in engaging with specific scholars. He prefers to say, “scholars agree” or “some scholars say,” as he addresses various theories. Lining up these broad attributions with specific scholars is an exercise best left with the reader, I guess? Anyway, it’s difficult for the average reader to really understand how well-grounded Harari’s ideas are, except of course if you just take Harari at his word, which is exactly what he wants you to do.Harari tries to play the eminent rationalist who presents his analysis and arguments without the hindsight fallacy (which he talks about explicitly) or personal bias.Here’s the thing though: you can’t be unbiased and objective about history. Literally you can’t. If you were, it would be the most boring thing, and also the most useless thing, because if you’re trying to tell a brief history, you’re going to have to cut some things out. And what you cut out reveals your biases, really. So I would much prefer if someone is upfront about their biases and about the perspective they’re using when they look at history. Harari is pretending to a neutrality he cannot have and which would be useless anyway.Here’s what I’ve unravelled in my reading. Harari likes empires, but not imperialism per se. He thinks empires are the most natural, stable form of human governance, because why else are there so many of them? (Is this not the hindsight fallacy?) He laments how various empires have interacted in ways that might not be so good for Indigenous peoples, but he points out that this just how it goes. And now we’re all one global society anyway, so … yay? Capitalism is great because money is a liquid asset but the peak capitalism of the 20th century is troubling. Overall, Harari just seems quite impressed by how we’ve managed to spread around the world and make fire and Twinkies. (He does not actually mention Twinkies; it’s called subtext, people.)Just before embarking on a look at the Scientific Revolution, Harari ends a chapter with a particularly egregious passage which is too lengthy for me to want to transcribe here. But basically it’s a shrug of the shoulders and an attempt to say that no one really knows why anything happens in history, and conceivably it all could have turned out differently. Oh, and western Europe had “no important role in history” prior to the Scientific Revolution.For the most part, Harari actually acknowledges that various Indigenous peoples around the world often had civilizations of equal, if not greater, cultural and technological sophistication than the European invaders who showed up during the so-called Age of Discovery. Nevertheless, I feel like Harari’s viewpoint remains mired within a Western, colonial lens. Specifically, Harari is obsessed with “progress” as a metric by which we measure the success of our species. He doesn’t assign a morality to the Spanish conquest of the Aztec and Inca Empires, of course, because that Is Not Done these days—yet he basically shrugs and says that the Spanish won because … progress. More broadly, Homo sapiens won out over other hominins because … progress?You can fight me on this but maybe it’s worth acknowledging that even if you personally believe we should be striving for more inventions, more discoveries, etc., that’s not necessarily what every person or every culture wants. The Inca Empire didn’t invent the wheel, of course—and had the Spanish never shown up and the Inca went on for further millennia without wheels, would that be so bad? Colonizers always fall back on the idea that, whatever losses of life happen during the actual conquest period, everything is better now because … progress, brought to you, naturally, by your colonial overlords.At the end of the day, I’m not giving this book 1 star because it’s still a fairly interesting read, at least until I started getting fed up with it towards the end. Sapiens has a lot of little moments that leave me nodding—I’m definitely receptive to some of what Harari is saying. Overall, however, his style of argument and the way he draws overly broad conclusions leaves me, as a sometime-scholar and occasional academic, quite uneasy. As I’ve told my friend, I’m sure there are way better books to use as textbooks in a course on sustainability.

Although there are only 416 pages, the amount of information provided is phenomenal and substantial, and I may read it again to pick up what I missed. It is not a biological review but more a behavioral development of mankind. It discusses the beginnings of Homo sapiens from one hundred thousand years ago and brings the reader forward from you and I as hunter gatherers to the agricultural revolution, the scientific revolution, the industrial revolution, capitalism and consumerism. The author tells us of the early kinds of money, religions and various stages of economic development, and how some empires’ expansion conquests were more successful than others. I enjoyed how the author would provide more than a single point of view, and as a history book, it is written in narrative format making it surprisingly easy to read. The author did not provide esoteric views to confuse but when making a point, he builds it with logical discussion. The final chapter has a lot of surprises about what the future holds. His discussion revolves around what science is capable of and what should be done, ethically. You may disagree with his views, so read with an open mind. Yuval Noah Harari, has a Ph.D. in history from Oxford and currently teaches at the University of Jerusalem. I highly recommend this book. It is intellectually and curiously stimulating."

It was so much more than I was expecting and reading this has taught me so much, more than I can I even process right now. I can tell I will be pondering all this information for a long time to come. Taking you through a rapid summary of the history of homo sapiens, Harari covers on pretty much everything about who we are, where we came from and where we're heading, and what it means to be human. Biology and evolution, the invention of culture, the creation of states, identity, the meaning of happiness, the myths our societies are built on... It's incredible how much information Harari crammed in, while still creating a book that is readable, accessible and perfect for complete beginners in this area. Some parts and theories were more familiar to me than others, but there is so much here from many different areas of research that I guarantee, whoever you are, you will learn a lot from reading this book. There also were the parts that really shocked and disturbed me. Harari really doesn't hold back and at first I found it really difficult to stomach his seemingly cynical and harsh view on humanity. I still need time to ponder what I've learnt, but the more I think about it, the more it makes sense, and this could very well change how I view us as a species. Truly eye-opening."

It is insightful to know the Interbreeding theory and the Replacement theory, which talk about how homo sapiens possibly destroyed other humans/humanoids. However, I think the author oversimplifies the agricultural revolution - referring to it as a big fraud, and responsible for modern settled life, as opposed to the oh-so-cool nomadic hunting and gathering. While I agree that there's a certain degree of romance associated with being a hunter-gatherer, but the perks of city dwelling are not to be pooh-poohed either.There are numerous contradictions and the author seems to go back and forth quite a bit. Some of the premises fall flat - farming was a bad idea because you were tied to a place and hostile tribes could attack you and seize control of your land. Also, what if crops fail?However, the author fails to realize that hostile tribes could also be competing with you for your share in hunting, and/or you could starve just because you couldn't find any big game to hunt. I suggest you prop your feet up on a comfortable chair, sip a glass of wine, and flip through the book on your e-reader. Appreciate the evolution of mankind into settled individuals and feel happy in the realization that our lives are probably far more comfortable than those of our ancestors.

""Is there anything more dangerous than dissatisfied and irresponsible gods who don't know what they want?""

Sapiens
, as is evident from the subtitle, traces briefly the history of humankind. There are cues from history, literature, politics, among other fields. This book has challenged my perception and played very well with my tacit knowledge; afterall, nobody needs to be told that we are wreaking havoc on the planet, or for that matter, not even that happiness is a conducive reality. Little do we understand what it is, even though it is something we look for all our lives. The most diabolical thing this book made me realise is that we, the homo sapiens are the most threatening creatures on this planet. It is not just diptrodons, ground sloths and mammoths that disappeared from the Earth's surface, but also the members of the genus Homo. This book is essentially divided into four parts: The Cognitive Revolution, The Agricultural Revolution, The Unification of Humankind and The Scientific Revolution. In all the four parts, Harari has traced the past and present in a very systematic manner, while also trying to give a future glimpse of the matter at hand."

It has a meager amount of citations and a tremendous amount of opinions, musings by the author, and interpretations of historical events that are nonsense. If you want to read a book about human origins and dispersion over the planet I would recommend ""Who We Are and How We Got Here"", by David Reich, a well researched and documented book by a true scientist. ""Sapiens"" pretends to be scholarly, but how can one take his discussion of the chicken holocaust perpetrated by modern homo sapiens seriously? His dismissal of all religions and philosophies as made up stories, without discussion, is superficial and pretty ignorant. Finally, If you want to write about the horror of eating meat and climate change, just say so and those who want to read about that will do so.

Unfortunately, the Sapiens regime on Earth has so far produced little that we can be proud of. We have mastered our surroundings, increased food production, built cities, established empires and created far-flung trade networks. But did we decrease the amount of suffering in the world? Time and again, massive increases in human power did not necessarily improve the well-being of individual Sapiens, and usually caused immense misery to other animals.
My opening quote – coming as it does from the end of Sapiens – pretty much serves as a summary for the whole: Homo sapiens (shortened to “Sapiens” by author Yuval Noah Harari) are not inherently remarkable animals, but through a series of sudden leaps forward, or “Revolutions”, we have somehow come to dominate the Earth and its other inhabitants; to the detriment of all; even to the detriment of ourselves. I picked this book up because I thought it would be an interesting slant on the history of human civilisation (along the lines of Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs, and Steel), but this book is too agenda-driven to read as fun pop-history: Harari never misses an opportunity to take swipes at religion, capitalism, and animal husbandry and I was left repeatedly wondering, “Which came first? His conclusions or his 'proofs'?” This book wasn't a waste of time, but it routinely stretched my patience.The brief history of humankind: 150 000 years ago, Homo sapiens emerged as a separate species (and I found it interesting to be reminded that at the time we were just one of at least five or six humanoid animals – including Neanderthals – to be roaming the Earth); a Cognitive Revolution occurred 70 000 years ago (with emerging advanced language and organisational skills); the Agricultural Revolution happened 11 000 years ago; 500 years ago saw the Scientific Revolution; which lead to the Industrial Revolution of 200 years ago; the Information Revolution emerged 50 years ago; which paved the way for today's Biotechnical Revolution (which will no doubt see us Sapiens playing god and creating the amortal posthumans who will replace us). No one knows what prompted the Cognitive Revolution that set us Sapiens on the path to world domination, but Harari shares an interesting theory that it was the need to gossip (in order to create and maintain social groups) that sparked our language growth. When Harari first started talking about the Agricultural Revolution, he made what I thought was a fascinating observation: If the goal of all life is to spread its genes far and wide, if you were to think of the Agricultural Revolution from the viewpoint of wheat, rice and potatoes, “These plants domesticated Homo sapiens, rather than vice versa.” Isn't that a challenging viewpoint? Unfortunately, this observation was just the groundwork for the first of Harari's anti-civilisation positions:
Foragers knew the secrets of nature long before the Agricultural Revolution, since their survival depended on an intimate knowledge of the animals they hunted and the plants they gathered. Rather than heralding a new era of easy living, the Agricultural Revolution left farmers with lives generally more difficult and less satisfying than those of foragers. Hunter-gatherers spent their time in more stimulating and varied ways, and were less in danger of starvation and disease. The Agricultural Revolution certainly enlarged the sum total of food at the disposal of humankind, but the extra food did not translate into a better diet or more leisure. Rather, it translated into population explosions and pampered elites. The average farmer worked harder than the average forager, and got a worse diet in return. The Agricultural Revolution was history's biggest fraud.
Throughout Sapiens, Harari stresses that the switch from hunter-gathering societies to settled farming communities was the beginning of the end for us as a species (he even goes so far as to lament the time we spend cleaning our homes as hours that could be spent frolicking on the Savannah), and if you can't follow along with his Anarcho-primitive line of thinking here, you're pretty much out of luck with finding common ground with the rest of the book. It is also at this point that Harari sets the framework for his second big theme: the widespread dissemination of DNA is not the main purpose of life on Earth (which, unfortunately, sets that business about wheat domesticating humankind on its head), and that happiness is more important than ubiquity; the last rhino roaming free in Africa is more successful as a species than the billion plus cattle confined to factory farms:
It's reasonable to assume, for example, that bulls prefer to spend their days wandering over open prairies in the company of other bulls and cows rather than pulling carts and ploughshares under the yoke of a whip-yielding ape.
Ultimately, Harari spends a lot of time talking about happiness and concludes that we as a species are basically unhappy, and primarily because we are under the thumb of those systems that we've forgotten are imaginary constructs that we ourselves developed: money, credit, and capitalism; religion, and especially “toxic” monotheism; empire, nationalism and xenophobia. Not only have we spread misery to all the other animals on the planet (including probably killing off all the other humanoids), but with the Agricultural Revolution, we have made Sapiens the primary product of factory farming; with our social constructs, we built the cages for the human zoo. And it's all for nothing:
As far as we can tell, from a purely scientific viewpoint, human life has absolutely no meaning...the scientist who says her life is meaningful because she increases the store of human knowledge, the soldier who declares that his life is meaningful because he fights to defend his homeland, and the entrepreneur who finds meaning on building a new company are no less delusional than their medieval counterparts who found meaning in reading scriptures, going on a crusade or building cathedrals.
You either find Harari's conclusions self-evident, in which case you don't need to read Sapiens, or like me, maybe you think there's just a little bit more meaning to human life than that. One more complaint on Harari's writing style: he likes to make exaggerated and definitive statements (along the lines of “There is no God”), and at least three times while writing about the history of human civilisation, he'd make a sweeping generality (there have never been female leaders), and then list a few exceptions (Cleopatra, Elizabeth I) which he then says, “proves the rule”: that's not how that expression works; you can only say your “exceptions prove the rule” when they are not actually exceptions to what you're stating. In the end, I can't buy into the idea that we Sapiens would have been happier if we never made the leap to farming and cities and technology; I don't accept either this book's premise or its conclusions. On the other hand, based on this reading experience, I am still looking forward to receiving my copy of Harari's next book, Homo Deus; I never find it a waste of time to read a paradigm-challenging book like this, even when I'm not persuaded by its point of view."
155,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18940246-sotiris-karaiskos,4,"I had not read this book so far because I thought its content would be things I already knew as human evolution is a topic of great interest to me and I keep track of all developments in it. In general this has been confirmed, although the author has expanded to many areas to make his own narrative of human history. Of course, always the most important is the way the author combines this data, and I can tell that he makes this combination it very interesting way, talking about his own conclusions. I agree with some of these conclusions, I disagree with others, with others I disagree... more strongly but generally the author though he has his views does not try to impose them, preferring to present the different views, allowing the reader to draw his own conclusions. So even though it doesn't offer anything new and unusual, the book does a review of our knowledge of human evolution in a simple and understandable way while giving the reader a lot of food for thought.Δεν είχα διαβάσει αυτό το βιβλίο ως τώρα γιατί νόμιζα ότι το περιεχόμενο του θα ήταν πράγματα που ήδη ήξερα καθώς η ανθρώπινη εξέλιξη είναι ένα θέμα που με ενδιαφέρει ιδιαίτερα και φροντίζω να παρακολουθώ όλες τις εξελίξεις σε αυτό. Σε γενικές γραμμές αυτό επιβεβαιώθηκε αν και ο συγγραφέας επεκτείνεται σε πολύ περισσότερους τομείς για να κάνει τη δική του αφήγηση της ανθρώπινης ιστορίας. Βέβαια το σημαντικότερο είναι ο τρόπος που συνδυάζει αυτά τα δεδομένα ο συγγραφέας και μπορώ να πως κάνει αυτό το συνδυασμό με έναν πολύ ενδιαφέρον τρόπο, μιλώντας για τα δικά σου συμπεράσματα. Με κάποια από αυτά τα συμπεράσματα συμφωνώ, με άλλα διαφωνώ, με άλλα διαφωνώ... περισσότερο έντονα αλλά γενικά ο συγγραφέας αν και έχει τις απόψεις σου δεν προσπαθεί να τις επιβάλει, προτιμώντας να παρουσιάζει τις διαφορετικές οπτικές γωνίες, επιτρέποντας στον αναγνώστη να βγάλει τα δικά του συμπεράσματα. Οπότε αν και δεν προσφέρει κάτι καινούργιο και ασυνήθιστο είναι ένα βιβλίο που κάνει μία ανασκόπηση των γνώσεων μας στην ανθρώπινη εξέλιξη με έναν απλό και κατανοητό τρόπο δίνοντας παράλληλα πολύ τροφή για σκέψη στον αναγνώστη."
156,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50297885-joy-d,3,"Harari tackles the titanic task of summarizing the history of homo sapiens as a species and forecasting the outlook for the future. He covers anthropology, sociology, economics, religions, and ideologies over the ages. The book is structured around three revolutions in human history: Cognitive, Agricultural, and Scientific. Themes running throughout the narrative include human happiness and the “shared myths” that enable our society to function cooperatively. I expected this book to be based on analyzing history and presenting logical conclusions, but Harari makes many sweeping generalizations and speculations based on little evidence. He only scratches the surface of some areas that have had tremendous impact. In fairness, he covers a lot of ground in a relatively short book. Harari is a persuasive writer and I found interesting to contemplate his ideas and opinions. His examination of religion and empire may be controversial. I recommend reading it as social commentary or philosophy. "
157,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76507338-saadia-b-criticonscience,3,"Since humans are born underdeveloped they can be educated and socialized to a far greater extent than any other animal. As per the research done by Harari, the earth was once walked by at least six species of man. Genus Homo's position in the food chain was until quite recently in the middle. In the last 100,000 years with the rise of Homo Sapiens that man jumped to the top of the food chain. That spectacular leap from the middle to the top had enormous consequences. We are full of fears and anxieties over our position which makes us doubly cruel and dangerous. Many historical calamities from deadly wars to ecological catastrophes have resulted from this over hasty jump. Our language is amazingly supple, we can connect a limited number of sounds and signs to produce an infinite number of sentences, each with a distinct meaning. We can thereby ingest, store and communicate a prodigious amount of information about the surrounding world. Any large scale human cooperation - whether a modern state, a medieval church, an ancient city or an archaic tribe - is rooted in common myths that exist only in people's collective imagination. An imagined reality is something that everyone believes in and as long as the communal belief persists, the imagined reality exerts force in the world.Hunter gatherers spent their time in more stimulating and varied ways and were less in danger of starvation and disease. The Agricultural Revolution certainly enlarged the sum of total food at the disposal of humankind but the extra food did no translate into a better diet or more leisure, rather it translated into population explosions and pampered elites. Essence of the Agricultural Revolution: the ability of keep more people alive under worse conditions. Humanity's search for an easier life released immense forces of change that transformed the world in ways nobody envisioned or wanted. A natural order is a stable order in contrast an imagined order is always in danger of collapse because it depends upon myths and myths vanish once people stop believing in them. Imagined orders are inter-subjective, so in order to change them we must simultaneously change the consciousness of billions of people which is not easy. In order to change an existing imagined order we must believe in an alternative imagined order. Writing is a method for storing information through materials signs. Biology is willing to tolerate a very wide spectrum of possibilities. It's culture that obliges people to realize some possibilities while forbidding others. Money is the most universal and most efficient system of trust. What created this trust was a very complex and long-term network of political, social and economic relations. The future empires will not be ruled by a single country or ethnic group, it might be ruled by a multi-ethnic elite held together by common interests and culture. Religion have been the third greater unifier of humankind alongside money and empires. Religion can be defined as a system of human laws that is founded on a belief in superhuman laws. Involved two distinct criteria: 1. Religion is an entire system of laws, rather than an isolated custom or belief2. To be considered a religion, the system of laws must claim to be based on superhuman laws rather than on human decisionsReligion must two further qualities in order to unite under its aegis a large expanse of territory inhabited by disparate groups of human beings:1. It must espouse a universal superhuman order that is true always and everywhere2. It must insist on spreading this belief to everyone. In other words must be universal and missionary Suffering is caused by the behavior patterns of one's own mind. Suffering arises from craving; the only way to be fully liberated from suffering is to be full liberated from craving and the only way to be liberated from craving is to train the mind to experience reality as it is. Religion is a system of human norms and values that is founded on belief in superhuman order. Humanism is a belief that Homo Sapiens has a unique and sacred nature which is fundamentally different from the nature of all other animals and of all other phenomena. Science, industry and military technology intertwined only with the advent of the capitalist system and the Industrial Revolution. Once this relationship was established it quickly transformed the world. Due to their close cooperation with science, empires wielded so much power and changed the world to such an extent that perhaps they cannot be simply labelled as good or evil. They created the world as we know it including the ideologies we use in order to judge them. The real potential of future technologies is to change Homo Sapiens itself, including our emotions and desires and not merely our vehicles and weapons. Time and again massive increases in human power did not necessarily improve the well-being of individual Sapiens and usually caused immense misery to the animals.

It summarizes soooooo much of history, biology, physics, chemistry, sociology, anthropology, geography, into the perfect well organized package of this book. Definitely a re-read!!! Everyone needs to read this book.I can't even begin to write notes on it because the notes ARE the book lmao no sense in taking notes.Random/off the top of my head memories of this book:- We've been through the cognitive revolution to agricultural to scientific to industrial to liberalism/capitalism/communism era's- Most of our recorded history has really only happened in the last few centuries, and after that we know some stuff that happened a few thousand years ago, and before that we only have research and findings that show us some things.- The agricultural revolution was the worst time in Human history because most people were practically slaves farming wheat and they had no vacation, and a very basic wheat diet that left them malnutritioned and dying pre-maturely.- Sapiens wiping out/diluting the Neanderthals- Where we came from and where we went and what our journey was across time- Australia being self-isolated for 10,000 years- When there was no Ice Age and the Sapiens crossed over the low tide into North America and they didn't even know a massive continent existed- Christopher Columbus finding America- Charles Darwin founding evolution and natural selection- Human finding their way to the top of the food chain and conquering all other animals. We get to breed the ultimate farm animals for them to better serve us. We breed the biggest most docile cows. We've shaped cows, chickens, and pigs exactly to what we want. We cannot breed them into something new but if there's existing animals with the traits we desire we breed and evolve it in that direction, we play god.- Early maps of the world- Technological advances- The Roman empire- Greece owing Britain debt- Currency coming into play, the beginning of the stock market- us vs them mentality- religious era, buddhists beliefs, trusting strangers that have similar beliefs or religion united Sapiens into larger groups called empires- Hunter gatherer mentality- How Humans over the world developed differently according to their environment- The impact of the internet (which was unpredictable/unexpected and maybe in the future there will be inconceivable inventions that will reshape our existence)- The future of humans being superhuman gods- Cyborgs- Nanotechnology- Becoming a-mortal by 2050 by finding existly how and why we age and preventing it from happening. Now that we've cured so much disease and causes of death we need to cure aging - Storing your brain on a back up hard drive lol- Uniting minds into groups to share information and memories- Genetic manipulations in animals and sapiens, the ability to create the perfect superhuman."

This book starts with a panoramic chronicle of humanity's earliest offshoots and eventual consolidations. It leaves off where his second book (though the first that I had read) begins: at the point where we start to use technology, genetic modifications, and inorganic accoutrements to diverge from our past and the destiny to which our genes confines us. At times this felt a bit scattered, though I suppose that this is a peril of the genre. But it was very entertaining, provocative, and interesting throughout. As in his other work, Harari is most interesting when he questions our assumptions and vitiates common values and world views. In particular, here, he makes short work of Western ethnocentrism, the hopeful but unsupported concept of a teleology to human purpose, and of our presumed superiority to other life forms. Harari emphasizes, often poignantly, that humans are no stronger, more determined, more noble, more loving, more moral than our co-residents of Earth, the thousands of other types of animals that live alongside of us. The only real differentiators are our intelligence and our ability to cooperate. I think we tend to emphasize our intellectual superiority above all other factors, whether out of vanity, insecurity, or habit. But superior intelligence is the necessary condition, but it is not sufficient for promoting anything close to what we currently call society, progress, technology, etc. It's not especially profound, but I do think it's generally underemphasized that humans' dominance over the planet cannot be attributed to our superior intelligence, or at least not directly. Isolated tribes in the middle of Papuan or Amazonian jungles are just as likely to have the same kernel of intelligence as you or I, but their societies, even if replicated but still atomized across the globe, would hardly be more dominant than any other apex species. Instead, it's our intelligence that facilitates our ability to cooperate, and it's our ability to cooperate that allows us to direct our energies toward making life easier, better, safer, freer, and more numinous. It's only through cooperation that we have been able to do so much, and it's the absence of cooperation--whether in the form of nationalism, war, tragedy of the commons, or other ill--that correlates with stagnation and decline. Certainly something to think about as societies all over the West are becoming more closed off, more selfish and jealous, more prickly and hair-trigger."

Sapiens
 would be the son of Jared Diamond's 
Guns, Germs and Steel
.At first glance, both books seem quite similar. They tell big stories of how man came to be. However Diamond's work focuses on mostly geography to explain why imperialism had its origins in Europe, whereas Hariri's work looks closely into the history of Homo Sapiens, how we came to rule the world (instead of Neanderthals, homo erectus, homo florensis, etc.) and how we developed from hunter-gatherers to farmers to urban dwelling desk workers and maybe in the near future to something genetically designed(?!). My favorite aspect about this book was its structure. Hariri divides the book into 4 big chunks. First, the ""Cognitive Revolution,"" which sees Homo Sapiens turn from one of the many creatures roaming the world into something that can dominate nature, create fire and develop language. This is followed by the ""Agricultural Revolution."" Homo Sapiens begin to come up with fictitious myths in order to cooperate with other Homo Sapiens. The third part of the book focuses on 3 factors; money, religion and imperialism, and how they brought humankind (Homo Sapiens) together. However, Hariri really talks about imperialism in the fourth part of the book, ""The Scientific Revolution."" Imperialism contributed to the funding of scientific progress, which more or less continues to this day. Hariri ends the book with three possible outcomes for the end of Homo Sapiens.I have to admit, even though this was a very compelling and eye-opening read (I did learn a lot of new things), as a Homo Sapiens, I can't help but feel a bit depressed after reading this book. I guess it's due to the fact that the book is very thought-provoking and makes you question your previous assumptions about many aspects in life. Therefore, I do highly recommend this book to anyone interested in a non-fiction work. One can have a lot of discussion based on this book."
162,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4636758-vanessa,3,"Sapiens is a book that I've been hearing about and wanting to read for years. It's quite rare I think that a non-fiction book, especially one on this kind of subject matter, can capture so many people and encourage so many rave reviews. I've never been one for reading historical non-fiction all that much, but my husband finally pushed me to pick this one up. And unfortunately, my feelings were mixed.I have definitely gained a lot of knowledge from reading this book for sure - I was even having a conversation with my husband and a friend of ours about different periods of history and the conquering of countries and holding my own (which is amazing for me considering my husband studied history and has a lot of general historical knowledge). However, I feel like the problem with this book is that it is too far-reaching and covers far too much. Granted, that's what you would expect with a subtitle like A Brief History of Humankind, but I can honestly guarantee that I won't remember the majority of the facts that this book has provided me. It's a complete onslaught of information.I also found that some parts were a lot more interesting for me than others. For example, there is a particular chapter on Capitalism and all things economics and money that bored me to tears. I couldn't wait to get through that because it held no interest for me, and the writing didn't pull me into the subject in the way it had done with other sections. Whereas other parts I was genuinely intrigued by and was trying to discuss further with the people around me.I did enjoy this book for the most part, but I think it was definitely way too over-hyped for me in the end. I suppose watching booktube and reading reviews on the regular will always set you up for failure or disappointment at some point or another. But I'm glad I read it, and am honestly interested to see what Harari's follow-up to this Homo Deus is like - in some ways, the fact that it is meant to deal with the unknown is far more fascinating to me overall."
163,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5924440-girish,5,"“The romantic contrast between modern industry that “destroys nature” and our ancestors who “lived in harmony with nature” is groundless. Long before the Industrial Revolution, Homo sapiens held the record among all organisms for driving the most plant and animal species to their extinctions. We have the dubious distinction of being the deadliest species in the annals of life.” Sapiens is surprisingly a simple read for the amount of punch it packs. What made humans become the alpha species of the planet? What makes the species adapt to the everyday new reality and then set in motion more changes to it's ecosystem? What is the power of culture, religion and money? The book pretty much covers a wide array of topics right from the role of history to cyborgs and artificial intelligence. I had read Jared Diamond's ""Guns Germs and Steel"" last year which was the anthropological handbook with iteration of single idea. This book on the other hand, though similar in counting the tale of humans (even sharing the same anecdotes), explores a multitude of ideas and keeps the chapters engaging. Sometimes I found the author preaching to the reader or treating them like kids with commonplace examples and scenarios to explain the part. This in essence sounded like a teacher's note, but then a good teacher's note is worth something. I loved the explanation of Buddhism vs Individualism, American declaration of independence vs Hamurabi's Code, Women Vs Men and the rising new order. The pairs extend to human genius and human stupidity. This book won't be an award winner since it is more a coherent and edible book of theories (backed by some research) than a research paper published as book. It is not surprising the book is really popular since it captures the human imagination with the biography of our species. "

It may be that a lot of the individual aspects covered in this book have been set out in specialist works elsewhere - I know some of them have - but I haven't previously come across a single work that pulls everything together like this. It's extremely well-written and readable, highly original and for me full of insight. It's also quite provocative; at one point the author comments that he pictures some of his readers squirming in their seats as they read one of the chapters, and I think he is probably right about that - it certainly took me a little while to come to terms with some of the content.The content is so sweeping that it's almost impossible to summarise, but it takes in the whole of human history whilst seeking to identify the main factors that got us from our starting point to now. The last section looks at what might happen to our species in the future. One of the most important concepts in the book is that, ever since humans stopped living in small groups, we have had to construct social order out of ""imagined realities"" and ""common myths"". These are not just religions, but include nations; political creeds; capitalist corporations; hierarchies of class, race and caste; money; laws: notions of human rights; and many others.Of course in any book like this there will be a degree of superficiality, and every reader will have a quibble about some aspect. It also gets a little preachy at times. The author is a Vegan and this comes through in the tone of his comments about the fate of domestic animals. Overall though, this is still worth a five star rating. A very, very, interesting book."

170,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1667021-may-ling,3,"Summary: Wow... hated this one too, though slightly less than his other book Homo Deus. Viscerally negative reaction to his story telling of the facts. Sad thing is that I get why most people would like this book. I happen to disagree with what appears to be biased, grossly manipulated half truths.So to be clear, I am not - as so many others do - criticizing him for oversimplifying. I'm criticizing him on more of a basis of alternative facts. But not in the Trump sense. Like the statement is kind of right. The conclusions are biased. Also, for those that propose that this book is great b/c it makes you think, the only thing it made me think is how sad that with 4+ stars this is just revisionist history in the making. So sad sad sad, and he's such a great writer, better than I will ever be.... sad sad sad....In Part 1: Chapter 2, he makes this huge argument that the life of a hunter gatherer was better than that of the farmer. But that flies in the face of research I did when I was 18 for an anthropologist professor who had unearthed the bones of 3 different groups (they were the same geographic region in Florida across 5000 years on carbon dating). The hunter gatherers had greatest evidence of malnutrition, starvation, etc (this was measured through linear enamel hyperplasias), next was the transition group, and by far less, the group that was pure agri had the lowest number. Life, we concluded, was better as relates to survival and lack of famine or sickness (that’s what causes bad bone growth in teeth). Bad Weather could not explain this difference given the sample size, location, i.e. florida where you can't possibly escape difficult weather over any period, and the time periods encompassed. That’s my evidence for why I think from hunter gatherer to agri, life got better. This research, I personally conducted in 1994 as a neophyte was then expanded upon by others. What I'm saying, is WHERE IS YOUR EVIDENCE, Harari?!? I can't tell by what criteria the citation are saying life was ""better"" on a hunter gatherer diet. He’s explicitly trying to say people had a worse diet. But in what way are you judging diet, cause if it's lifespan, good luck with that. So, in my state of confusion, I got to his notes. He's got 1 citation that you can tell will not answer this question. So I go to the link he lists which is - in theory - suppose to be additional references: https://www.ynharari.com/sapiens-refe... it lists references that still don’t add much more. Quite frankly, given that the list he cites on this reference isn't very long, I'm not sure why it needs to be another link? I mean, a typical Bill Bryson book will have 3-10x the number of references per chapter even with the link. It's so weird! Like, did he do his research after publishing the book? I don't understand. I have actually not seen this in literally any of the books I've read in the last 3 years since I've systematically read the reference section. P1 Chapter 3: He writes:""But these cautious generalizations are about as far as we can go. Any attempt to describe the archaic spirituality [of animism] is highly speculative."" Well, actually not really. For example, Angkor Wat was built to create symbolism to combine animism, Buddism, and hinduism which were all prominent in the area. In other words, it's quite straight forward to separate the symbolism of each. Part of the reason he misses things like this is because he later claims that religion is only used to make one group as better than others. In fact, that's not true, and the kinds of Angkor Wat are some of the earlier examples of this. The builder of Angkor Wat was trying to use symbolism from different religions to stop the fighting. It's the number 1 thing you will learn on any tour of the region. As a result, if you wanted to know what parts are animism, you need only remove the know Buddhist and Hindu symbology. Plus there is some art that comes just before the king who built it (and remains a part of the temples) and the stuff you actually can clearly identified is pretty good stuff. It's not perfect animism from earlier times, but it is WAY more than what he leads you to believe in this chapter. In other words, he describes that the only thing we know of animism is from cave paintings. Just no. And also, no on the idea that religion has only been used by leaders in the manner he describes. Just no. Also, Asian art people will quickly note that both Ghengis Khan and Qianlong used similar techniques to unite people. One might even note some of the blending of religions in Christianity, specifically the Gnostic Christians. This is part of the reason I feel Harari really does have a very particular thing he's attempting to communicate that is just IMO alternative facts. Part 2, Chapter 5 - He talks about the idea that archaic man (not Sapiens) did not revolt (i.e. man before, such as homo erectus). He tries to say that our ability as Sapiens is what made us revolt. Actually, this is pretty well discussed if you go the Anthropology Museums in Berlin. They do an amazing exhibit that describes the fact that there is no reason to revolt, act violently against another group, etc, until we moved to agricultural society. As hunter gatherers on the move storage of goods didn’t make sense. so if Homo erectus is aboriginal, the major need to revolt, ie someone is withholding resources doesn’t exist and Homo Sapien was largely aboriginal until well after the ice age. So the only other thing I can think of that he might be referring to is whether early man had feelings, ie if they revolted just because their leader sucked. Then I'm like, he says he can't prove it. But if you can't prove it b/c there would be no evidence by definition why say it? IT's just your story. He then basis his book on this concept of what Sapiens are vs predecessors. But again, if during hunter gatherer period it would have been unlikely, then what is going on here?P 2, Ch 6 - He talks about the fact that the idea of equality derived from Christianity... kind of yes. But no. Then he says that if we do not believe in god but evolution, that means difference among individuals is what matters. So - for him - that negates the inalienable rights concept. No on two accounts. First, equal politically doesn't mean equal the same in a DNA sense or anatomically. Science shouldn’t therefore even make sense as an argument on philosophical rights. It's not a scientific statement that is being made. Second, even if we force the physical into philosophical, which is not how the field works, btw, John Locke in Essays on Human Understand covers this. That's the point of why Locke, and especially that essay is so controversial. Locke is actually saying that God is awesome and stuff, BUT even God needs you to know him through real knowledge which you need to figure out on your own (not based on God). Locke's kinda saying, hey man, you're not allowed to just say something is true or obvious or innate b/c of God. God doesn't like lazy logic. He concludes a the end of the book that things like inalienable rights relate to a proper framework of knowledge... oh, and God likes that you develop that. That's why the Church was kind of pissed. They - at the time - don't want you to figure out your own thought process related to God. And since Harare’s citation is the US constitution, Locke is super relevant. we know that Locke's teachings are actually core to this document. I don't think that Harari has a leg to stand on when he's thinking the founding forefathers didn't think that one through. That's also why the declaration reads ""We hold these truths to be self-evident"" not ""we hold these truths to be a function of God's will"" [I couldn't finish this review, b/c the e-book had to be returned to the library :(....) But I think what I really docked him stars on is his literal ""White-washing"" of Asian history to fit his paradigm. I mean, it's true, but it's a flawed understanding. Like he describes perfectly things like buddhism and what happened, but his why and what resulted is wrong. Also, his stuff only makes sense if you have no idea about Godel and it's impact on what is meant by data. It's not algo's, btw..... If you ignore all of that stuff, then yeah, he's right, but how can you ignore Godel Escher Bach, if you're going to try to propose Data-ism?I recall as well this section that talks about capitalism. He says that Christopher Columbus (1492, when he sails if you recall) had to get capital from the queen and so it's always been about capitalism. no. First, Columbus lived before capitalism. His need to find resources was not done in the format of capitalism but mercantilism and this is NOT semantics. Big difference. Part of this is he has the wrong definition of capitalism. If you actually read Adam Smith who writes in 1776, instead of all the stuff that is then morphed from people who have not read that work, but are just citing what their Econ prof told them, then you'll see very clearly the difference and why that nuance is highly relevant. You'll also realize that invisible hand and mr. market are not quite the thrust of CapiTalism in its purest form a la Adam Smith. Instead, it's the idea that differs from Machiavelli's The Prince, i.e. that you can actually create abundance by specialization, so you don't need to just subjugate other people and take over their resources. Smith was about the political concept of abundance, not greed. That was his point with specialization. He cares about pricing and there are huge spreadsheets, but he only gets to an idea of things are worth what they’re worth. No need to set price. He doesn’t get more complex..In order to have concept market clearing price, you need a concept of aggregate supply and demand. That doesn't happen until FAR later, late 1800s... I think it's Alfred Mitchell but ... check my section on economics. As a result, he got a lot of the right facts, but his whys are all very contrived. The point is capitalism isn’t at its core about greed but abundance. And his argument that Columbus is just early capitalism demonstrates a lack of understanding of the importance of Smith.Similarly, he's wrong on communism and what it is from a Chinese perspective. It has to do with his failure to understand the poli sci of these concepts well enough. And he's def wrong when he tries to understand the relationship between Buddhism as relates to China, because - and I'm just going say it - he is applying Western thought process to Eastern stuff he knows absolutely nothing about. I'll recheck out the book as I kind of want to make sure I understand what people think (given how many people love it) vs. what I think might just be wrong."

It's flipping marvellous. Absolutely fascinating and very accessible.This stuff should be taught in schools across the world. It's extraordinary - and Yuval Noah Harari has the happy knack of making complex ideas interesting and easy to understand. Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind retells the human story and is organised around four different milestones. About 70,000 years ago, the cognitive revolution kickstarted our ascent to dominance; about 12,000 years ago the agricultural revolution accelerated progress; then followed the long process of unifying mankind and colonising the Earth; most recently, about 500 years ago, the scientific revolution began.This ""progress"" has come at a huge cost to other life forms on our planet: the complete destruction of an extroardinary number of plants and animals and, more recently, modern agriculture’s treatment of animals (one of the worst crimes in our history).Yuval Noah Harari then speculates how current developments in biology might soon lead to the replacement of Homo Sapiens by completely different beings, enjoying godlike qualities and abilities.Whislt some sections are better than others, overall Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind is a thrilling read which thoroughly deserves its acclaim. I'm going to be reading Yuval Noah Harari's other books. 5/5"

Sapiens are, or more accurately were, not they only humans. Did you know that? I didn't. This book will tell you about the connection of Sapiens with other human species that lived since ancient times, and how Sapiens managed to concur the world and surpass their human counterparts until they ceased to exist.Brief: Yes. VERY BRIEF. at the beginning I thought there must be everything that is to know about humans in this book; at least to satisfy my curiosity.There is, as a matter of fact, tons of information, but NOT NEARLY ENOUGH. This glimpse on Sapiens history opened the doors to more and more questions. All those tribes and empires, those religions and ideologies, those concepts and imagined realities: your mind carve to know more.History: The author defines history as the subsequent development of human cultures that came to be after physics shaped the universe and biology weaved the story of all organisms. The history of Homo Sapiens is outlined by three main revolutions:A) The Cognitive Revolution: When Sapiens realized they are different than other species in exploiting the power of ""words"".B) The Agricultural Revolution: When hunter-gatherers settled to become farmers domesticate plants, and equally the plants domesticated them in return. An vital change of human life style.C) The Scientific Revolution: When technology took over the world and the homo sapiens species developed new ideas and evolved in uncountable aspects during an unbelievably short period.A very fascinating tale. Humankind: that's us, again, as we ascended the throne of the humankind race alone, but who says we will be the only ones forever? The book also discusses future possibilities. We might, with the advanced power we possess, be the salvation of nations or quite possibly, the doom. Yuval describes so many theories and ideas, of which I am not sure how much has been proved, or how much I actually understood, but they surely opened my eyes to totally new horizons and with that a hunt for a vague knowledge shall begin.

173,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21843540-safat,5,"It's about time I gave this book a proper review it deserves. The central concept of this book is that human beings depend on myth for its survival. And by myth he doesn't (only) mean religious myths in the scriptures. Myth includes money, country, corporations and about everything else. How the hell money can be a myth? You can buy just about everything with money. But money is only a piece of paper. It has value only because people believe in it. If you are stuck in a lonely island, you can't eat these papers or coins called money and survive. In a objective world, money is no more valuable than a piece of paper. But we don't live in a purely objective world, we live in a 'inter-subjective' world that is our society. Money has value only because everyone shares the belief that money has value. If everyone starts believing today that those pieces of papers are just papers, you won't be able to buy foods with those papers and coins.Think about a corporation. Where does the company called Google exist? Only in some piece of papers. Google isn't a real entity, but a financial one. It doesn't feel pain or hunger, it doesn't get born or dies, except in our beliefs in some documents. We conjure up a company by signing some papers, and we dissolve it in the same way. Where do countries exist? The earth doesn't say this landscape is a country. We imagine some fictional boundaries and conjure up fictional entities called countries. We validate our fictions by some documents we sign. What is not a myth then? Well, laws of physics are not myths. Whether you believe it or not, it affects you. This is a book on anthropology. This book has many other thought provoking features that will make it worth reading. It is one of the rare books that is enlightening and entertaining at the same time. "

I hoped the book would be a good substitute, picked it up, and was promptly daunted by the size of it. That’s unfair to the book, though: it’s actually immensely readable. It treats time as a progression from physics to chemistry to biology to history, through Agricultural and Cognitive Revolutions through to Industrial ones: the story of the universe is at first told in the terms of physics, and then eventually using human eye witness accounts and evidence. It’s a fairly anthropocentric view, narrowing it down to our perspective on the past, but Harari acknowledges that.Harari manages to be fairly even handed in discussing capitalism, communism, ideology, religion, and all those difficult topics. While sometimes I thought I could tell what his opinion on each one was, he was generally fair about the appeal even of ideologies which have failed in practice. It’s a weird mix of pessimism and optimism, really, because Harari mentions the declining rates of violence, the increasing rates of health, but also the flat rate of happiness. The fact that, for all that we do, humans don’t seem to be any happier than they were eight to eight hundred years ago.I enjoyed it, and thought it was a solid and interesting overview of human history, and the potentials for a human future. The readability and clarity of the prose is definitely in its favour.Originally reviewed here."

I do think there are some areas of the book where it's pretty cynical and factual, but I also think there's some fascinating ideas within and I was thinking in detail about topics I had never thought of before, and I liked that. In general, my favourite parts of this were the start and end as the start is very much about the evolution of Man and how we came to dominate over animals etc. The final section is all about modern day and I enjoyed seeing more about how different life is now, and yet how similar the base emotions and human nature is. There's a lot of comparisons between older cultural norms and modern day, and these were fairly interesting to read about.In terms of readability, I think this is not a bad non-fiction. It has some dense areas, but the author is knowledgeable yet approachable in their tone throughout the book. The whole history of the mankind race is documented in brief descriptions, and yet only the most interesting bits are focused in on. It has a lot to cover, but with such a big topic I think the author does a grand job. Overall, I gave this a 3.5*s as it's very likeable and informative, but it's got some dense moments and it's also a bit of a tome. I do think I am interested in the other book focused on the future by this author, but I may take a break before getting that one too. "
176,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5010988-laura,4,"This book gave me a LOT to think about.My biggest takeaway from it is that the world wasn't ready for us, & we weren't ready for the world. As a species, Homo Sapiens may be evolution's greatest success story: we adapted quickly, & we spread globally. Just look at the Americas: within 2000 years of crossing the landbridge from Siberia, humans established communities as far south as Tierra del Fuego, & as far east as Newfoundland. For the sheer feat of that, humans are amazing.But moving at that speed didn't give the ecosystems we encountered time to balance themselves. So the effect was as devastating as it was awesome.Meanwhile, humans haven't adapted to being an apex species - we don't know how to manage our spot in the world. And we are in the unique position of being the first & only species to check our own proliferation. At this point, our growth is as much a danger to ourselves as it is to the rest of the world. That alone would be enough to chew on. But the author stirs in more, raising such topics as: did wheat domesticate us?; are empires as bad as we think?; in the battle between Family & State as main providers of rights & opportunities, women & children thrive when the State is supreme, & men thrive when the Family reigns.You won't agree with everything the author posits, but you will be challenged to think about long-held beliefs in new ways.

Harari's well evidenced and thoroughly researched chapters about the human race are often scathing and as difficult to subjectively accept as they are to objectively dispute. (Apologies for the split infinitives!)Where other writers become enmeshed in justifying positions like those presented by Harari on, for example, religions and ideologies, he presents these as imagined human constructs and moves on to consider their impacts, consequences and implications. He looks at what comprises human happiness - including the all too convincing evidence of its chemical nature - with a scientist's detachment, while never giving the impression that he does not care deeply. His glimpses into the very real and rapidly approaching end of Homo Sapiens are unnerving and fascinating in equal measure. In many ways this work should be compulsory reading for humans.

They met quite recently* (Zuckerberg and Yuval Harari). Truly, they had an interesting conversation. Interesting, I mean, relating to what you can read between the lines. 

As for the book...well, the last page title is interesting enough: ""Afterword: The Animal that became God"" [Shouldn't it be ""The animal that became God""?]. Then it's written: ""SEVENTY THOUSAND YEARS AGO, HOMO sapiens was still an insignificant animal minding its own business in a corner of Africa. (...) Today it stands on the verge of becoming a god..."".WOW.I am looking forward to reading the God part, I mean, ""Homo Deos: A Brief History of Tomorrow"". (Starting in what year?? Yes, man as god.)ONCE UPON A TIME, ""OUR"" SIBLINGS...AND THEN THEY WENT THROUGH SEVERAL REVOLUTIONS...



This is a book about change in humankind. Revolutionary change, over thousands of years on earth. Yuval describes in detail that change, approaching 3 kinds of revolution: the agricultural, the cognitive, and the scientific. But then it's all about evolution starting with ape-like people, a notion still debatable. Yuval looks at those creatures as ""his"" cousins. He uses sometimes biblical terms (Noah's Ark, Adam and Eve, The Flood) but doesn't really develop them. His take on (the Catholic) religion is scornful, to say the least. 

Even ""masculinity"" has evolved in this ""kind of [hu]man"" Yuval speaks about. Take a look at stockings and other items on the next two guys, as proof of evolution...



However, he cannot write about the spiritual [R?] evolution. Despite being sympathetic with meditation and Buddhism he doesn't explain, nevertheless, how a ape-like creature could ever engender a spiritual life, the notion of God and faith,...and such profound, 2,500 years-old writings the likes of Buddhism, for example.

I admired his impartiality while he enticed the reader to go on reading. Don't know what else I could say about it, except that I would like to put this book into the hands of every Homo Sapiens on planet Earth. And then, who knows, maybe we could move on from there. Harari really put things into perspective for me, and although some things I already knew, I didn't even think about connecting the dots until he did. It's amazing to see how humankind got to where it is today, with all its pluses and minuses (more of the latter than of the former, unfortunately).

188,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27798371-richa-bhattarai,4,"Fascinating. The extraordinary story like quality that grips you as if it were a super-interesting novel. I’ve read a lot of content like this, but never one that is arranged so systematically, comprehensively and simply. I’m in love with the style, thoughts, and presentation. I learnt 1001 new things, and recalled 1001 things I’d read already, but had difficulty placing in context. I’m greedy for knowledge, it being the prime goal of my life to learn and know. So it was a treasure trove for me. From ten types if humans to the future involving cyborgs, Harari talks of it all. He focuses mainly on the revolutions - cognitive, agricultural (which he hates), industrial and scientific. In the middle, he covers every possible angle: religion, peace, development, advancement, money, capitalism, feminism, racism (and classicism). It’s all very well written, and impressively knit together. The patience of a superhuman, work of a genius. And I’m glad this book is overrated, else I wouldn’t have heard of it and would have missed the chance to labor through the wonderful 460+ pages. It is extremely intelligent, worthy, and in several places, quite humorous (a kind of dry humor that grows on you).I have two doubts:1. I do not believe everything in the book is correct, or even rational. Yes, Harari gives examples everywhere possible, and is quick to introduce juxtaposed views. But in a work of this scale, there are bound to be aberrations - I felt it acutely when he talked of the Hindu religion, of Atman, of obscure myths thy at do not determine our way of life. I noted this because I know this, so there might be other things I do not know, but which aren’t necessarily relevant or are misrepresented. 2. Like every writer (and human being) Harari has his biases and prejudices. Against the meat industry, dairy industry, against consumerism and agricultural revolution. Founded, unfounded - who knows? He tries to be very, very fair but it does show, and does not perhaps suit a book like this. P.S. I still can’t understand how a person can know or research all of this, and collate in into such a neat, enormously readable format. All my admiration. P.P.S. - While explaining something, Harari always says ‘she’ and ‘her’ and ‘layperson.’ More reason to love. "
189,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/765636-ray,5,"Absolutely one of the most fascinating books I have ever read. Historian Yuval Harari does an incredible job of summing up the history of the human species (homo sapiens to be specific, as he points out there used to be other species of humans) in a very readable way yet provokes the mind like few other books ever have.With an almost alien-sense of objectivity -- although also sharply editorializing at times -- Harari analyzes the driving forces from neolithic times to the agricultural revolution to the Industrial one and the present shifts which may completely change and end humanity. Personally, I think much of the book is a brilliant take on memes. Memes are mentioned briefly, but one could interpret all on religion and myths and, say, our currency system as well as nationalism to be all memetic.Harari can be harsh by saying that our modern ethical and legal systems are all in our imagination and no less meaningless than traditional religions the intelligent like to scoff. Does not the concept of the social contract apply? Yet, his interesting sense of cold calculations and calling spades spades like no other book has before is the point.Most striking of all is debunking many interpretations readers may have had. The agricultural revolution as history's greatest fraud is something to think about. Yet before that our hunter-gatherer ancestors were not 'one with nature' rather they caused mass extinctions everywhere they went. Even modern liberal belief systems are to be questioned. Takes on capitalism, consumerism... Buddhism. That the world of today is actually more peaceful than it has ever been. The concept of individuality as so recent.Of course, the tome wouldn't be complete without mentioning the Singularity by the end. The question is ultimately that of whether history is leading somewhere or if a series of coincidences... sadly it may just be a series of coincidences that turned this strange animal into gods... and that's something I will never know for sure but I highly appreciate Harari's expertise into the thought process.I pretty much want everyone I know to read this book."

In fact, we believe in these stories so willingly, that we devote a huge amount of time to them, and they now form the cornerstone of local and world-wide cooperation: money, economy, religion, ideology, culture, work, consumerism, even the stock exchange, global time zones, or defending values like liberty and equality. What makes this book particularly interesting aren’t just the facts and figures - it’s the author’s ability to challenge the reader, and reveal history in thought-provoking ways. For instance: was the agricultural revolution a good thing? How about Empires? What’s the difference between religion and ideology? Did we cultivate nature or did it domesticate us? What about the capitalist creed? Nuclear weapons? And how and why did Homo Sapiens become the deadliest of the animal kingdom? And, finally, do we know where we want to head in a world where the ‘Gilgamesh project’ is holding fast? —Being mystifyingly hopeless with history, it’s a miracle I made it through this non-fiction book at all. I was very pleasantly surprised: it made for an easy read, with lots of examples, and I kicked myself for not picking it up sooner! Granted the author’s opinions might make readers uncomfortable at times, but that’s all part of the fun with this book.

Today there is a single one left; homo sapiens. In this book, Harari looks at how we rose not only to become the only Homo species but also the dominant creature on the planet. He considers how our genetic makeup is still closely tied to the original hunter-gatherer way of life and how our innovations in farming, civilisation and science have made us all powerful. Modern life has brought us many benefits but there is a darker side; we have enslaved people and wrought pain and misery on countless people throughout history and even now are slaves to the clock and consumerism.It is a broad-brush book as Harari draws on economics, anthropology and palaeontology to complete the history of our species. He also considers our future as humans, looking at the medical advances that could mean we live longer than ever and other technologies like genetic modification that could make some of people life more comfortable. Sadly though, there are flaws. He seems to come up with some daft conclusions, there are sweeping generalisations concerning subjects like the economy whilst there is very little on our effects on the climate. It has immense amounts of detail in some subjects and then rushes through on others, but it is a good stab at a subject with so much history and offers the potential of so much more."

Some theories in this book are debatable, to say the least. With a little bit of research, some arguments can be easily seen as a bit extreme or over-the-top. But again, I didn't mind that at all. It's really interesting to read something different, so I suggest this book to anyone who doesn't actually know too much about this field of studies but who is curious and is looking for a bit of something else.Worth a try at least, there's a reason why this book became so popular.[image error]"

One of the books claims is that we are living in a period of ""pax atomica"" - where peace between states is assured by nuclear weapons, and ""there is at last real peace, not just the absence of war"" (p416). That'll be news to the people of the Ukraine, Palestine, Syria, Iraq, Nigeria, Congo, Uganda, Somalia, north east Burma ... Oh wait, its OK, these are merely _exceptions which prove the rule according to Harari. Who then adduces no evidence to support that claim, or explanation as to how the exceptions prove anything. Earlier he manages to cite Harry Potter in a discussion about education. From page one to the very end, this is trite, uninsightful and really very boring. Quite an achievement, and how it won the accolades quoted on the back cover eludes me."

204,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49170908-alex,2,"DNF @ 45%I tried to get through this book, I really did, but after 2 weeks of having no interest in picking it back up (in fact slugging through chapters and dreading it) I figured that this just wasn't for me. No one is as surprised by this revelation as I am. There are just too many books out there and too little time.Since this is such a popular/best-selling book, and many of my GR friends want to read this, I want to type out my feelings about this one (because I have a lot of them). Many people have recommended this book to me, praising it for its way of getting you to rethink what it means to be human. It seems that the minority of people who didn't really like this book all had about the same criticisms. I agree with most of the 1-3 star reviews.A highly praised nonfiction book about a basic history of humankind? Sign me up- or so I thought. The book started out extremely interesting, going into how humans evolved and a rough timeline between our first ape ancestor to the development of fire and beyond.The book is split into 5 sections, and the first section is the one I found quite fascinating. But then it begins to lose me. After that, Harari's main thesis seems to be that what truly makes humans so special in their ability to develop technology/civilizations so quickly was the fact that we as humans believe in cultural myths and shared intangible ideas. We can come up with ideas about river gods and sun gods, that people on a massive scale can get behind, leading to massive amounts of cooperation. I have no qualm with this theory and I think it makes a lot of sense. Because of our belief in religion, laws, money, corporations etc., humans can get along on an enormous scale and our globalized society can function. A country can reasonably run with 300,000,000 people, whereas without these shared beliefs, getting along with people just based on social rumors and gossip, you can really only have a group of around 200 humans before it becomes a crap shoot. The problem is, I don't find this revelation riveting. Instead of looking into a broad timeline of developments from prehistoric times to the modern day, it seemed like we were just reading about examples of this theory in use. The thing is- I don't think it's that interesting to read about- at least in the broad way that Harari must write. (It is, after all a 400 page book about the entire history of humankind- a feat in itself that I don't think works with regards to what he wants to get across). I stopped reading at the money section, where he goes into how anything can be money, as shells were used in ancient times and in POW camps cigarettes were used (even by people who didn't smoke)- and after all, a dollar bill is just a piece of paper. However why it's so special is because almost every single person on this earth understands and believes in the value of money. The problem is, I already knew that, and I don't need Harari to go on for chapters beating this idea into our heads. Maybe I have a certain understanding of it, being a business school student and already learning about the cigarettes in camps etc. But even if you haven't been exposed to the idea before, it's almost as if he's talking down to you about this amazing revelation when it really is something many people can come to a conclusion about in a short time.Harari sometimes has a bit of a patronizing voice in the book as well. It's not overt, but there's an occasional tinge of it. It almost seems sometimes that he is trying to humble the reader. Personally, I don't have much of an issue with that, especially in the first section because he basically frames hunter-gatherers as not primitive cavemen, but with brains as developed as our modern ones. It really makes you think that about 15,000 years ago, we were still just like us, but leading a vastly different lifestyle. I don't mind this because people should be humbled- it's easy to fall into the trap of thinking of ourselves as superior even to people 200 years ago. While our access to information has changed, and on a global scale obviously we are much better off and technology has increased at an amazing rate, as individuals it's not like we are smarter than individuals way back when. Collectively, we are much more intelligent because of technological innovations, but individually people had the same capacity for knowledge that we have today. Still, the way he talked about his ideas about cultural constructs came off a bit ""holier than thou"" which I don't think a nonfiction book should do.Harari also seems to almost purposely try to say things that are basically, for lack of a better term, hot takes. He brings up a new innovation and basically says how it isn't as good as you think. Although I haven't read the end, I did read plenty of reviews that say how Harari is leading up to a final moment where he says we need to be careful about AI technology yadda yadda. Where haven't I heard that before? He says that the agricultural revolution wasn't as great as we thought it was. He brings up interesting points, but it's almost like he is trying to build up and only say the positive things about a hunter-gatherer lifestyle and then focus on all the negatives of an agricultural lifestyle just to flip what we thought we knew on our heads. It's not that I am not interested in the merits of hunter-gathering, in fact, I'm very interested. But it seems like he's purposely trying to make a hot take instead of fully articulating things. Which I suppose you can't do with so few pages at your disposal. He talks a lot about inequality, which I'm certainly not adverse to, but it's just not what I expected. I also thought that Harari couldn't go into these issues in a meaningful way. Nothing he says is outright wrong, it's just poor execution. I thought that this would be more of a history/biology book, bringing in various theories and ideas, but instead it's more of a book about social constructs and what he coins as ""inter-subjectivity."" It's just not groundbreaking or interesting to me.Perhaps this book improves immensely and I stopped too early, but I doubt it. 2 stars for the first section, and the fact that his ideas are definitely worthy of some attention, just not the attention they are given in this book. I know this is a stupidly long review but I guess it boils down to his book being not particularly poignant or thought-provoking to me. Maybe I'm the one who doesn't get it, as it's clearly very popular."

206,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37309415-aditi-jaiswal,4,"History is always written by the great conquerors. When two great forces collides, the dud is blot out, and the winner writes the history which glorify their own achievements and belittle the subdued opponent but will it account to true record of events? I would rather flinch at it.Sapiens: A brief history of mankind is an attempt to briefly describe the deft exposition of coalition of history, sociology & bit anthropology of Homo Sapiens (wise men).It gives us a concise historical summary of progress of human evolution cobbled together by a string of shrewd exposition of interesting datum.It starts out as a fascinating discussion of emergence and evolution of homo sapiens along with their psychological behavior and genes responsible for those behavior.History of our species can be traced back by a succession of 3 revolutions, The Cognitive, Agricultural & The Scientific revolution respectively.The author did complete justice to the first and third part but the rest parts seems more like sweeping assertions and disembodied explanations of issues raised coupled with many interesting facts and trivias.In the end it was a drag for me to complete this book, because it talks about general things that has been talked about before from time immemorial like Bionic Life and Cyborg engineering. It also talks about possibilities of human endeavors which is not much intellectually challenging. We all have been aware of these questions before.It is an easy and mostly interesting read. The opinions are not biased at all but the facts stated isn’t enough at times. But he beautifully answers the question that may arise in the mind of a reader.The author talks about plethora of issues like torture in animal husbandry, rise in capitalism, religions ( how it is just a semantic exercise), Discovery of ignorance ( we don’t know everything and we could be proven wrong as we gain more knowledge) and less satisfaction in life which are dwarfed by mere sweeping assertions.It gave a detailed record of great events in history that shaped the world ( fell on futile ground as most of them we already know) but it didn’t come across as boring.It talks about imperial vision and delves deeply in explaining what a religion is exactly to many, from liberal, socialist and evolutionary humanism respectively which was imperative.It was a one time read for me because I expected more from Oxford scholar specialising in Medieval History and Military History ( source : Wikipedia) ."
207,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13472185-andrej-karpathy,3,"Sapiens offers a good overview of broad trends that have shaped the human civilization from prehistoric to modern times, but suffers from inconsistent assumptions about its target audience and, due to its scope, an abundance of high-level statements that don’t connect.My chief criticism of the book is that it does seem to address a consistent audience. One minute the book discusses and explains a broad trend (e.g. the empire, or capitalism) and then abruptly dives into very specific examples from history to support its statements (e.g. a briefly alluded to specific battle during the expansion of the British empire). The problem is that as an ordinarily-educated person, I am familiar with the basic ideas such as capitalism so these sections bore me, but I am not at all familiar with the details of specific conflicts or related circumstances. As such, I spent the majority of the book either bored, or confused and overwhelmed with information that was seemingly assumed.Overall, the book often felt as a work of a historian written for other historians, selling and supporting certain historical interpretations that the author believes to be true. Not an attempt to teach the general audience about history.I enjoyed the first part of the book dealing with prehistoric times - these chapters were fun to read, perhaps partly due to my relative lack of knowledge of this era. From there, my enjoyment of this book diminished monotonically until the end, which suddenly features several hours of philosophical musings about the point of life and happiness.If you’re looking to get a basic idea about some broad strokes of our history, you might enjoy the first parts of this book. If you’re, like me, trying to get a better and more concrete sense of what life was like in different times of our history, this book never spends enough time and depth to paint and communicate a coherent picture and you will end up disappointed."
208,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19667916-bjorn,2,"It bugs me how much I end up disliking this book. Initially it's brilliant, taking the history of humanity and flipping it to present Homo Sapiens Sapiens as, if not nothing but, then certainly to a large extent a carrier of memes, myths, genes, and even other species. The idea that we didn't consciously decide to settle down and eat grass for all time but that wheat essentially hijacked us to spread across the globe is an intriguing one, and he takes a long-term view of human history that certainly casts ideas about free will etc into a much dimmer light. It feels a lot like a companion piece to Lasse Berg's 
Dawn Over The Kalahari
 and its sequels, which I loved.But then... he just gets lost. The trouble with a view like this is that he takes it as licence (there's human nature for ya) to apply it to everything, and the latter two thirds of the book basically feel like you're sitting in the back seat of a very talkative cab driver who's Figured It All Out and needs to tell you about it. Blah blah hunter-gatherers, blah blah capitalism, blah blah human rights is a sham, blah blah blah. He makes some interesting points, and I kinda like the irony that a book that starts out trying to say something about Homo Sapiens as a whole ends up saying at least as much about Yuval Harari in particular, but damn this book became a chore quickly."

Why then? What does the book about the history of humankind has to do to achieve full 5 stars? Well, in fact, this book is about something completely else - it's about substantial questions like:* what is 'human' & how homogenic were (/are) the humans (e.g. genom-wise)?* why did human dominate the rest of the fauna on Earth?* why did Europeans dominated the world, not Asians, Middle-Easters?* why did the concept of patriarchy won over matriarchy?* how did the religions develop & what is the difference between religions & other beliefs (e.g. ideologies)?* what were the reasons of differences between the speed of progress and technological (but not only) advancement across the globe?These questions look deceptively simple (frankly I believed to know at least the general answers for all of them), but facts are sometimes incredibly surprising - at some point I've stopped counting my ""oh-shit"" moments while reading this book.Strongly recommended. It's as good as ""Homo Deus"" - every self-aware, mature human should read it (& supposedly learn something out of it)."

I took several other courses after that, but none of them was as profound as it was. Finally I got to listening to the book on which the course is based.This book which was inspired by another magnificent book (Guns, Germs and Steel) asks very big questions and attempts to answer them scientificly.It goes through the full history of humankimd since the advent of evolution to the 21st century to speculations on what the future might hide for our species.It asks questions such as why did this one species called homo sapiens dominate the Earth in such a rapid time? What is the role of ""imagined reality"" in our life? What is money and capitalism and why/how do they work? Are we happier today than our ancestors tens of thousands years ago?The book is just as profiund as the course was and its answers are very strong, yet understandable.

However, I felt that it lacked steam a bit towards the end and became a bit repetitive. Or maybe the book was just less interesting when on more familiar ground.This is definitely not a detached history book where the facts are given and left open to interpretation. The author spends a lot of the book putting forward his own opinions about morality, religion, philosophy, sociology, psychology and many other areas. In some ways this makes the book more enjoyable and relatable but there were times where it came across a bit 'preachy' (We get it, the meat and dairy industry is awful!) and I found him repeating the same arguments over and over.I will definitely give the author credit for tackling so much in a relatively short book and making me put down the book multiple times and say to my partner 'Wow! Did you know?' (He read this book a month ago so generally he did know!) but I don't know if I will be picking up his other books based on the present and the future as the past was what I found compelling here. "

It is easy to read, almost too easy, and at a point it reminded me of a luxurious copy of ""Homosapiens for dummies"". The first half of the book covers the human origins and while it is better than the rest of the book, the author states facts and figures that are highly contentious as if they are set in stone (where people came from, how they evolved etc. - he doesn't leave room for doubt and his statements sound as if he was present during the history of Earth).What really pissed me off was the shallow analysis of capitalism and the evolution/incentives for the development of entrepreneurship in the second half of the book. These are matters that call for an indepth analysis and, mr. Harari, BETTER SOURCES.Having said all that, if you haven't read anything on the evolution of the human being, the book is a good albeit expensive introduction."

After some of the rave reviews and an eager recommendation, I was expecting something dazzling, what I got was outstandingly disappointing.

This book manages to cover so many important themes that help to understand our species, and how big of an impact we have on this planet. As there is so many topics, there are bound to be some that you´re not personally interested in. I´m still extremely happy to have learnt about money and empires, although I don´t really care for them and would have rather read more about other human species or the environment.

This book definitely changed my thinking on some fundamental concepts and made me realize that maybe not everything should be taken for granted. I really loved some of the chapters and kind of wished he would have gone more into detail on them, but all in all, it is a really compact and concise history of Homo sapiens (as well as a few other random topics).Moreover, I feel that anyone who can break down complex ideas and thoughts into simple layman terms as well as construct a compelling story is an amazing writer.

220,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44595752-t,4,"Sapiens is an ambitious book - not all that surprising since it’s meant to be a brief history of humankind, after all. For someone with very little background knowledge on this subject, Sapiens was an engaging, insightful and instructive read.With the first part, focused on the cognitive revolution, Harari was set off to a great start. I find evolution fascinating, and learning about the early days of Sapiens and our long lost cousins had me flying through the pages. The second and third parts were strong as well, with a focus on how societies emerged and thrived, what kind of events played a key role in our becoming what we are today. I liked how Harari also injected a few jabs at humankind as a species, giving this book a bit of a more personal tone.
""If we knew how many species we've already eradicated, we might be more motivated to protect those that still survive.""
That being said, at some point the many exclamation points started to irk me. One thing is engaging, provocative comments, another adding unnecessary exclamation points to what is supposed to be a serious, factual study on human history. Call me a snob, but it felt out of place.As I went on, I started to feel my interest slowly slip away. For such a strong start, I was sorry to admit that I wasn’t as engaged by the time I hit the second half of the book. Not that I didn’t care anymore, but something was missing, and I just can’t quite put my finger on what it was. Maybe it was the fact that Harari seemed to be very critical of some developments or paths taken (often times with reason, as far as I could see), but didn’t offer any alternative or hypothesis as to what could have been done differently or better. Maybe it was the fact that, when talking about “our peaceful times” when compared to thousands of years ago, he forgot half of the developing world in his optimistic musings.
“There is at last real peace, and not just the absence of war. For most polities, there is no plausible scenario leading to full-scale conflict within one year."" 
Look, maybe this has to do with the fact that I come from a country with a running inner conflict of over 50 years, so when someone so easily says that we live in absence of war, I have to double check. And sure, compared to two world wars and the many full-scale wars that preceded them, I guess you could call today’s many conflicts around the world a squabble. And it may very well be that big, powerful countries are more easily kept in check today so they don’t annihilate each other. But the fact that many countries profit from ""smaller"" wars in far away ""meaningless"" countries to this very day should have at least been mentioned.Overall, I did enjoy reading Sapiens and learned a lot along the way, even though it may sound like I liked it a lot less than I did. I guess that after that strong start, I was prepared to declare my undying love for this book from the nearest rooftop. Sure, four stars is still a great rating, but I really thought Sapiens would be added to my list of all time favorites in a beat. Yet, by the time I reached the end, I was rather inclined to chalk it up as an important and very informative book, yes, but I wasn’t looking for any rooftops."
221,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13716226-murtaza,4,"Grand human histories tend to end up being relatively narrow out of simple necessity - the subject is just too broad to engage with in its full scope. This book, however, takes a relatively effective approach by examining human history from the perspective of mankind as a biological phenomenon: Sapiens, the wise. Harari starts off with the history of man as one of many unremarkable animals in the prehistoric wild. Contrary to popular belief, humanity did not proceed sequentially from neanderthals and other related species but coexisted with them for millennia, before they went into extinction. It later spread out of its original home in Africa, outbreeding and replacing its long-forgotten cousins and, eventually, from an inauspicious start, growing to become the apex predator of the entire planet. The last neanderthals vanished roughly 30,000 years ago, and obtain only the faintest historical memory despite our long coexistence with them.The book traces Sapiens history through three major revolutions: the Cognitive, Agricultural and Scientific/Industrial. Humanity's evolution of advanced cognitive abilities and brain capacity (thanks in part to evolutionary energies freed up by its use of fire) enabled it over time to outmaneuver, conquer and gradually enslave the rest of its biological competitors on earth. Harari is a skeptic of the Agricultural revolution, claiming that it came about largely through happenstance (a luxury becoming a burdensome necessity) and over time brought humanity into a state where it existed in greater numbers but with less fitness and happiness. Foragers also had a richer spiritual life than we tend to assume, as pre-agricultural cites like Gobekli Tepe in Turkey attest to. This posited superiority of pre-agricultural life calls into question the idea of biological success, often defined in terms of quality over quantity. Humans live in greater abundance than ever before, but with less quality, as they have less variety in their diets, activities and are in many senses more alienated from one another than from the time they lived in smaller bands (Many human-domesticated animals also have achieved ""success"" thanks to our stewardship but live in a state of historically unprecedented misery, as Harari notes.) Our growth beyond that size also required the invention of ""myths"" or memetic beliefs that organization beyond 150-200 or so individuals always seems to necessitate. These accumulated myths then became the culture that has undergirded our experience on earth, and new myths continue to animate changes in our culture today.The book segues into other discussions relevant to the field of evolutionary biology. What makes Sapiens different from other animals, Harari argues, is that it alone has the ability to imagine things that wholly do not exist. As a result, this has allowed us to invent elaborate fictions that govern our lives (ideologies, corporations, financial instruments) and that have become as real to us as physical reality. Harari also describes modern ideologies such as liberalism and communism as ""religions,"" albeit ones centered upon the deification of man. Our older religions did this as well, but included the external concept of God as a center of worship. The pre-monotheistic and polytheistic historical norm was animism, in which humans perceived themselves as one of many sanctified parts of nature and ""holiness"" was considered a locally accessible phenomenon. Harari notes that monotheism is a difficult thing for humans to digest, and we tend to slip back into older forms of belief (saint veneration, nature veneration, other forms of mysticism) when left unscrutinized. Ironically, mankinds Agricultural revolution-enabled enslavement of the rest of creation has made the view of a human-centered universe, implied in modern religions seem more plausible and natural to us. It was less obvious that Sapiens was the world's central actor when it was just one among many comparably powerful species on the planet.Harari argues convincingly that history is moving in a steady direction towards greater convergence between human beliefs and practices. Before modernity many completely different human ""worlds"" existed on earth at the same time (such as the Tasmanians and Incas). But, in time, local cultures and practices are all being amalgamated into a global median. The forces doing this are money (the universal currency for building human trust), religion and empire. Harari's findings track with those of Robert Wright and others who also see humanity moving in such a direction over history. The book concludes with speculation about humanity's biological future, as technological advancements and genetic modification call into question whether Sapiens will even continue to exist in any resemblance to how it has throughout the rest of its history. None of the gains of the past 30,000 years, in which humanity changed so much, necessitated or involved any single biological evolution on our part. Thanks to technology the future might be very different, as we gain the ability to engineer our biology in a manner similar to what we'd define as ""God-like"" powers. Its hard to judge how speculative or realistic these prognostications are, but they raise interesting philosophical questions nonetheless - particularly the possibility of radical technological class-stratification, where humans can literally engineer inequality for the right price. Harari is unsparing with humanity's accumulated ""myths,"" treating them all as imaginary conceits of an otherwise unremarkable biological species. The book goes down many different alleys that the author finds of interest, including long divergences into Buddhist philosophy and linguistics, but in the end it ties the narrative together reasonably well. The segues and anecdotes are almost always enlightening. The book is written lucidly, accessibly, and *plausibly*, not an easy achievement given the breadth of the subject matter. Whether one agrees with his conclusions or not, this is a fascinating and engaging introduction to evolutionary biology."

There are many very interesting threads. The book starts off with a bang discussing our ancestors Homo Sapiens and the other Homo species. Did you know those of European descent share three percent of DNA with that Neanderthal man? There was also a good and interesting start to the cognitive revolution. The book is easy to follow with its linear timeline. The section on Megatherium was very cool. However the book — in my opinion — doesn’t explore most of its interesting threads very deeply. Also my interest level faded significantly in the last half of the book where I didn’t view the author as much of an expert. I think he has a better grasp of science versus history or history of science.I will keep as a reference book as Harari broaches some interesting threads. There are also some excellent color maps on species migration and the first half of the book is quite good.3.5 stars. I was expecting more of a Jared Diamond quality of narrative. In any event, it is a highly readable book and it is understandable why it is popular."
223,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5539910-abdullah-diab,3,"A very nice book, an eye-opener, I would have given it 5 stars if the author had listed the sources for many things he talked about, and if he had not mixed scientific results and data with his own personal opinions and judgements about stuff that are not scientific at all. A good portion of those opinions were wrong, and show that the author didn't do much research to build those opinions, so I really advise any reader to not take them as true but to seek and find the truth on his own.As a muslim I found many viewpoints that the author included about Muslims, Islam, and Muhammad (pbuh) not to be true, 
I'm only talking here about the ideas about how Muslims think, or how Islam works, or how Muhammad (pbuh) thought, not about any contradictions that some people of religion might have with the evolution or other science
, and these viewpoints showed that the author does not really know much about Islam, or he didn't do his research well and relied on weird sources that are not worthy of trust, and this actually caused a problem for me, I wasn't sure afterwards whether what I'm reading regarding other things is to be trusted or not, is it true or not, it just seems that the author has put so much of his own understanding of things and mixed them with science, and those don't really mix well; for example:For example, the prophet Muhammad (pbuh) began his religious career by condemning his fellow Arabs for living in ignorance of the divine truth. Yet Muhammad (pbuh) himself very quickly began to argue that he knew the full truth, and his followers began calling him ‘the Seal of the Prophets’. Henceforth, there was no need of revelations beyond those given to Muhammad (pbuh).I'm a muslim and I know for certain that Muhammad (pbuh) didn't at all argue that he knew the full truth, on the contrary, he, in many times and many places, asked other people to do the right thing because he doesn't know better, for instance once he was asked a question about farming, and his answer was I don't know, you know your things better than I do. He never claimed to having acquired full knowledge, nor the truth, it is even in the Quran stated that you must seek knowledge and think and look for answers for everything in the universe, and especially for your self, the Quran asks people to look for the intelligent design inside their bodies, and this book is a proof that we haven't yet figured out fully how our bodies work and why, the Quran told Muhammad (pbuh) to ask his companions for their opinion and their ideas, the Quran told Muhammad (pbuh) also to seek the truth and worship the creator until he dies, and thus one cannot by any means claim that Muhammad (pbuh) argued that he knew the full truth, and one cannot claim that Islam didn't urge people to look for answers, and one cannot claim that the Quran says you shall only find answers within the Quran. So if this is one of many ideas that I could argue that the author had wrong, I think that Buddhists might have some ideas too, Christians, Jews, Communists, Marxists, and others too! So be careful when you read this book, don't take those opinions seriously, they might be really spoiled by the author's understanding and personal interpretations. The book has great pieces, very informative, well structured, although I wanted a bit more details about certain eras of the humankind history, but in general it's a very good book.One of the most striking things you might get to know from this book is that Homo sapiens have been harming the Earth and everything that lives on it for a very very long time;Don’t believe tree-huggers who claim that our ancestors lived in harmony with nature. Long before the Industrial Revolution, Homo sapiens held the record among all organisms for driving the most plant and animal species to their extinctions. We have the dubious distinction of being the deadliest species in the annals of biology.Also that agriculture is not as good as you might think it is, it didn't convert us into better people, instead it converted Homo sapiens into miserable beings;The Agricultural Revolution certainly enlarged the sum total of food at the disposal of humankind, but the extra food did not translate into a better diet or more leisure. Rather, it translated into population explosions and pampered elites. The average farmer worked harder than the average forager, and got a worse diet in return. The Agricultural Revolution was history’s biggest fraud.I recommend people to read this book and get some insights on the Homo sapiens history, and to question many things and many aspects of our lives."

Choice quotations from the review:-""Despite all our material comforts, we moderns are not even happier than pre-moderns, Harari suggests — though, tellingly, he reaches this conclusion not by contrasting the reality of modern lives with a classical understanding of happiness as the state achieved by those who live good lives in accord with their nature, but from opinion surveys and the findings of the new “science” of happiness. This reliance on science, or what purports to be science, at the expense of literature, philosophy, or even his own observation, makes Harari’s account of human history nevertheless conventional in a decisive sense. The primacy of science — that is, of the modern physical and biological sciences, and their spillover into the social sciences — is the first article of faith for progressives, however skeptical they may be of pure moral progress. Harari is so committed to a scientific view of human history that he never seems to question whether a method invented to understand and master nature is really suited to understanding fully the nature of man himself, and whether man is the same kind of object as many of the others that science studies.""- nobody is ever made happy by winning the lottery, buying a house, getting a promotion or even finding true love. People are made happy by one thing and one thing only — pleasant sensations in their bodies. A person who just won the lottery or found new love and jumps from joy is not really reacting to the money or the lover. She is reacting to various hormones coursing through her bloodstream, and to the storm of electric signals flashing between different parts of her brain.""This is remarkably stupid. What persons feel and experience is not the same as what the hormones and electric signals in their bodies do, any more than the idea this sentence conveys is the same as the makeup of its black squiggles. Unfortunately, a total eclipse of the human person is central to Harari’s argument, and his book is suffused with such crudely materialistic, mechanistic assertions."""

The agricultural revolution left farmers with lives generally more difficult and less satisfying than those of forgers, Hunter-gatherers spent their time in more stimulating and varied ways and were less in danger of starvation and disease. The Agricultural Revolution certainly enlarged the sum total of food at the disposal of humankind, buy the extra food did not translate into a better diet or more leisure. Rather it translated into population explosion and pampered elites. The average farmer worked harder than the average forager, and got a worse diet in return. The Agricultural Revolution was history’s biggest fraudWho was responsible. Neither kings, nor priests, nor merchants. The culprits were a handful of plant species, including wheat, rice and potatoes …..Ten thousand years ago wheat was just a wild grass, one of many, confined to a small range in the Middle East. Suddenly, within just a few short millennia, it was growing all over the world ………Wheat did it by manipulating Homo Sapiens to its advantage ……..Wheat didn't like rocks and pebbles, so Sapiens broke their backs clearing fields. Wheat didn't like sharing its space, water and nutrients with other plants, so men and women laboured long days weeding under the scorching sun ... Wheat was thirsty, so humans dug irrigation channels ....Moreover the new agricultural tasks demanded to much time that people were forced to settle permanently next to their wheat fields ....We did not domesticate wheat. It domesticated us 
Wikipedia serves as an excellent summary of the book’s main thesis (and sub-theses)https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapiens...Overall an extremely stimulating book.In many ways it resembles Jared Diamond’s wonderful Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies in its historical sweep and bold statements, however it is far less detailed and exhaustive in its evidence than that book. This is both a strength and a weakness – it means that the book covers far more ground and is more readable, but it also means that at time it can come across as superficial and (very unusually for a non-fiction book) the reader is sometimes left wanting more (not less) detail and for the author to spend more time on a topic before moving on to the next topic."
226,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1881113-andrea,4,"Magic Square Challenge 2018 - #5 - Nonfiction BookLooking at my GR friends' reviews I can't help but notice the divisiveness of opinions on Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari. Some love it, and some think it's a generalized and biased work. My personal experience, however, was very positive. You see, I agree with Harari on the viewpoint he often describes - that is the cultural world we live in mostly consists of our self-inflicted imaginary boundaries. The notions of national sovereignty, socioeconomic practices, satisfaction with life, etc. are all constrictions we are willingly participating in. Or I should say, thanks to generations of tradition and crowd psychology, we are now unable to escape even if we wanted to. The author's arguments on imagined order and romanticism influenced consumerism really resonated with me, mostly because they are part of my own philosophy. And that is what I think this book should be marketed as: a philosophical discussion of the author's worldview, rather than an anthropological textbook. I enjoyed the fact that Harari was not afraid to ague for both sides, often describing the good, the bad, and the ugly of the same controversial subject. I too like to play devil's advocate. The pages on negative consequences of agricultural revolution on quality of life and positive impact of imperialism (gasp, how rude for this polite society) were especially thought-provoking. Since the subject has been brought up in several books I've read, including Sapiens, I have to express my complete bewilderment at the fact that the likes of The Gilgamesh Project and Artificial Intelligence research is encouraged and heavily funded as they are currently. I can't imagine how the quest for a-mortality or a far superior, ever-improving intellect can benefit humanity. I don't understand scientists that treat death as something that needs to be cured or eradicated, considering we are already putting too much strain on the planet's resources, or the fact that only the rich elite would be able to afford it, further widening the gap between the haves and have nots. Once again, I think we should ask ourselves, if we can, does it mean we should? I can't wait to see what Harari has to say on the subject in his follow-up Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow."

It is all so wrong.I have a master's degree in biological anthropology and a single introductory class on human evolution and evolutionary theory would have taught Mr. Harari just how inaccurate his book is. Honestly a good final project for a class like that would be to edit the many errors within the book.For starters he would know that there are only two members of the species sapiens. He would have learned that history by definition does not start until permanent records occur not when the precursors of language happened. Tool making started with australopithecines even if that was once the original definition the genus homo. Neandertals (Homo sapiens neandertalensis) started breeding with Sapiens (Homo sapien sapiens- anatomically modern humans) approximately 30-33 thousand years ago and did not go extinct until later. Human ancestors also experienced two cognitive revolutions; the origin of the first is unknown but it lead to their ability to picture images in their mind, draw/paint, generate burial rites and early religious practices, see 3D, which lead to projectile weaponry, increased protein intake, wall and settlement construction, increasingly more complex food preparation techniques, and cultural buffering mechanisms that eventually allowed them to have the largest known habitable zone of any species.If you want to learn about human evolutionary history try reading works by Dr. Clark Spencer Larson or Peter J. Bowler. The Evolution of Human Life History edited by Hawkins and Paine is also a good read."

I liked his style and narration and probably most of the book, however there are certain red flags that made me wonder how much of his conclusions based upon the factual evidence and overall consensus vs his personal bias.You can tell that he definitely have a thing agains agriculture revolution. he claims people became unhappier, more sick, died earlier and had malnutrition because of agriculture. However he turns a blind eye that hunter societies were actually killing those weaker members of the society. If I was to chose between iron deficiency and a blow to my head from an alpha hunter, I think I would chose the first and probably would be happier for it.Another fun anecdote, while giving examples of various conflicts on certain areas he gives bunch of examples from Middle East, but conveniently leaves out Israeli/ Palestinian conflict.Other that that overall it was a good read. I really liked his way of comparing easter and western invasion mindsets. The latter is trying to learn the nature, animals and taking scientific expeditions with them etc (probably to take advantage of those commodities) vs the eastern one just going and invading and taxing the new lands, not bothering to bring animals, learning the ecosystem and such. He was not gratifying western imperialism at all btw, but he points out a major difference which is quite interesting, and I never thought of it before."

Agreed, a lot of it is information most people are probably aware of already, at least in general terms, but for me there was a lot that I just hadn't really thought about in detail, and this book prompted me to do just that.There were some points around the middle of the book where I found my mind was wandering a little, which unfortunately does tend to happen a lot with audiobooks, and I felt some sections could be cut down a little, but overall I found it to be an interesting book.

At last, someone who spells it out without disclaimers or whatever!! The reader has to forget almost everything he thinks he knows, and start anew, with a perspective he never thought about, because he never had the words, the concepts for it, or never associated things properly. There were some obvious things too; but even there, the author is capable of putting words on feelings and impressions that I couldn't name. I also loved that it isn't only about humans, their glory, their triumph, their welfare. It's also (and, in fact, mostly) about our cruelty (against other humans, but also other species, and, of course, animals nowadays), our irresponsability, our miseries, our blindness. How small we seem, how young, how self-centered. I understood everything, it wasn't told in complex and/or incomprehensible words or concepts; if there were, it was explained with examples.

It sparkles debate and it makes you curious about the world and our role in it. I loved all the examples and trivia stuff that were throughout the book.

I’m not sure a book with an aim to summarise human history within 500 pages can be. It is bound to miss some things and gloss over others. There is a lack of objectivity to this that bothers me a little but I’m not sure that can be rectified. So am I faulting it for something it intrinsically cannot avoid? Yes, but if I didn’t mention these things then I too would be doing the thing that I’m condemning this book for.

246,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26055396-sense-of-history,3,"I'm quite excited about this book. Because it's a daring achievement of Harari: the whole world history in almost 400 pages. It's obvious the author had to be very selective, and that's allright, it is precisely that selectivity that makes this work stand out, but it also produces some manifest deficiencies.Harari initially zooms in on the long existence of the homo sapiens as hunter-gatherer and on the transition to agriculture. He has read the most recent studies about it and is intelligent enough to point out the pitfalls: the findings of this prehistoric period are so limited and so multi-interpretable that all conclusions must be approached with extreme caution. Harari does that too, even though he is very uncautious at one point, namely by claiming that homo sapiens attempted a first exit out of Africa 100,000 years ago but was deterred by the Neanderthal people living in what now is ... Israel (Harari lives and works in Israel, shall we forgive him this as a one-time chauvinistic upsurge?). Much worse is that Harari fully contributes to the very fashionable trend to present the living conditions of the hunter-gatherers as idyllic and positively set against the hard work and uncertainties of the first farmers; this view goes back to Rousseau (the noble wild), in recent decades it has been propagated by evolutionary biologists and psychologists, and to some extent this view contains plausible elements; but Harari, - I suspect for educational reasons - exaggerates the contrast so much that his explanation why people, despite everything, switched over to agriculture (growing habits and short-term vision) is rather incredible.A very important and most valuable element throughout the book of Harari is his emphasis on the shared imaginary heritage of man. Harari, of course, builds on Benedict Anderson and his 'imagined communities', but he extends this concept to all possible myths and performances shared by human groups as a basis for collaboration. According to him, this is what makes us truly different from animals and that made possible that humans were able to transcend biological and environmental constraints. He speaks of a 'Cognitive Revolution' that took place around 70,000 years ago, but why and why at that moment is not clear. In fact, Harari with Cognitive Revolution uses a semantic variation on the much more embedded theory of the beginning of 'culture'. In my opinion the word ‘imaginative’ adds too much pejorative meaning, in the sense of fictional, non-existent, random. It even seems that Harari is also aware of this because repeatedly he recalls his argument as to how relative and coincidental existing systems and situations are; and of course they are to a certain extent, but if given too much stress it looks as if every system and situation is incidental and arbitrary, whilst every historian always is conscious that reality is the result of a very complex, chaotic development process. I will come back to that later on.A valuable insight of Harari, on the other hand, is that he is very conscious of how contradictory human behavior and institutions are. Every human being, each culture is full of inconsistencies and contradictions: at the individual level we speak of ‘cognitive dissonance’, for example when a medieval Christian knight adheres to the guideline of charity but at the same time, and without remorse, butchers enemies in a crusade; but it’s also true in modern societies that hold high the principles of equality and liberty, principles that are always in tension with each other. Harari rightly states that these contradictions are not human defects, but on the contrary, they make out the essence of our being, and culture always tries to reconcile these contradictions in an never ending process; this just is the engine of history.Harari adheres to the history view resulting from the recent wave of global/world/big history studies: in human history, over the millennia, there has been an unambiguous growth towards unity, a real globalization that embodies all parts of the Homo sapiens world, even though this globalization is partly covered by an increasing fragmentation and complexity. Harari devotes more than a third of his book to the driving forces behind this globalization: the power of money and trade, the universal religions, the political empires (and the system of imperialism) and market thinking (in its capitalist form). All of these phenomena reduced the diversity of the human species, and allowed (or forced) cooperation that transcends differences. In this section Harari leaves the path of systematic, historical exposition, and limits himself to the big trends, certain unexpected insights, and surprising reversals in the traditional image. For example: he strongly stresses the enormous merit of imperialism and universal religions in the inclusion of peoples in a civilization, in the homogenization of societies, in promoting the process of cultural accumulation and assimilation.Fortunately, Harari adds a warning that this globalization trend is only an interpretation model with hindsight and has no predictive power. He, as a historian, is clearly opposed to determinism (and rightly so), and describes history as a “chaotic system square two”: it is not only unpredictable, but every prediction can be absorbed by it and can send the system in an even more unpredictable direction. I can only support what Harari writes on p 241: “So why study history? Unlike physics or economics, history is not a means for making accurate predictions. We study history not to know the future but to widen our horizons, to understand that our present situation is neither natural nor inevitable, and that we consequently have many more possibilities before us than we imagine.”But then we encounter a troubling issue in this work, because it is recurring regularly: almost every time that Harari describes the big trends of human history, he states that we do not know why this or that occurred or evolved in this or that way, or whether this is positive or not. I understand Harari's caution, but this to me is too cheap and simple, and too easy to get away with. Particularly because he does this almost systematically: in his treatment of the patriarchy (why men have/had such a predominance in history), the question of why the scientific revolution took place in Europe and not elsewhere and why Europe managed to master the whole world, and finally also in his treatment of the question of what constitutes human happiness. Now I know that these are very delicate topics, about which entire libraries have been written and an endless debate goes on. But just stating: “it’s what it is, that’s all we can say”, that's unacceptable to me. The more so, because Harari in some cases, after this ‘statement of impotency’ starts an elaborate presentation, in which he tries to give explanations after all. For example, about the scientific revolution in Europe, the imperialist grip of the West on the world and the all-comprehensive grip of capitalism: according to Harari, the European/Western avowal that we actually know little about the world and reality, and the subsequent urge to know more, to explore or experiment, to conquer and control, all this was a decisive factor for European/Western success. Strangeley he thus contradicts his prior proposition of impotence.That refusal to make clear statements about, for example, imperialism and capitalism is at least quite inconsistent. It leads to the fact that many people in their review of this book, here on Goodreads, are very critical and suspect that Harari has attempted to cover up his actual praise for imperialism and capitalism as engines of history. To add insult to injury Harari in his exposition even blames certain cultures that their lack of curiosity meant their downfall or retardation; he explicitly does this for the Central and South American cultures of Aztec and Inca, but the impression is that this ""parochial outlook"" to him also is relevant in other areas (China/India), and that is quite denigrating. In short, there are some issues with this book. Just to mention one last example: Harari completed this book in 2011. Since then, there have been several developments that set back his striking optimism about globalization: the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Brexit, the election of Trump. Perhaps these events will later appear to be but small wrinkles in an unstoppable process, but it seems to me these are warning signals that nothing is definitive in history (and honestly, I must admit that Harari also warns against this).But despite my criticisms, I highly recommend this book: it's a stimulating read, with many remarkable insights (even though they are not all new or consistent) and with remarkable warnings to our very fragile species, the homo sapiens!"

But then again, what is fact and what is a view or opinion. Reading this, or any other book for that matter, solely on its own would create bias. So I'd suggest reading other nonfiction books that deal with similar topics as well. I still think Factfulness by Hans Rosling is one of the most well-balanced reads that presented views based on numerical facts and personal life experiences. No one could be forced to think one way or another, it is all a culmination of what we've experienced, seen or read, whether by ourselves or through our familial and social circles. On one hand, I'm generally a pessimist who think that humanity is the most dangerous creation on this planet. But if natural selection rings true, then every manner of creation will only seek a singular higher purpose, and that is to survive. Which is what humans have done, for better or for worse."

Where does the history of our species go from here? Is its end upon us? Will we evolve, via our technology, into an entirely new species? Or will we obliterate ourselves before that can happen?Sapiens is an ambitious work, with an ambitious message. Like any great work, it raises more questions than it answers. (And with that said, the most impressive thing about this book is, it answers a hell of a lot of questions!)What is the message? It's a call to action. The sentence that embodies this call, the one that struck me the hardest of any sentence in the book, comes at the very end, capping the discussion of the future of our species. It's an answer to the question of what we want to become.""Most people,"" Harari says, ""prefer not to think about it.""And it's true. Parts of this book are viscerally disconcerting. Particularly the chapters on the question of happiness and the advance of biological and genetic engineering that precede the above statement.I do prefer not to think about it. The future of humanity is a scary topic. The pace of change and the increase in our technological abilities? Sky-high, and accelerating. There's trivially-cheap DNA transcription and replication, stealth nanobots, bionic body modifications controlled by thought, sentient computer programs, the Human Brain Project.Yeah, scary. Why not let the scientists and the politicians worry about it?To see why we need more people to think about it, people like you and me, let's take a look at one of the most controversial arguments Harari makes in Sapiens.Because it turns out that we've already experienced a revolution that forever changed the fate of our species. And it's a revolution that Harari damns as ""history's biggest fraud."" The Agricultural Revolution.""Scholars,"" Harari writes, ""once proclaimed that the Agricultural Revolution was a great leap forward for humanity. They told a tale of progress fueled by human brain power. Evolution gradually produced ever more intelligent people. Eventually, people were so smart that they were able to decipher nature's secrets, enabling them to tame sheep and cultivate wheat. As soon as this happened, they cheerfully abandoned the grueling, dangerous, and often spartan life of hunter-gatherers, settling down to enjoy the pleasant, satiated life of farmers.""We know now that, as Harari says, ""this tale is a fantasy."" But he sets it up thus to go even farther. Whereas many of us simply say, ""well, it's complicated,"" Harari is full of scorn for our transition to farming:""Rather than heralding a new era of easy living, the Agricultural Revolution left farmers with lives generally more difficult and less satisfying than those of foragers. [Editor's note: I would hang a bright blue 'citation needed' tag over this.] Hunter-gatherers spent their time in more stimulating and varied ways, and were less in danger of starvation and disease. The Agricultural Revolution certainly enlarged the sum total of food at the disposal of humankind, but the extra food did not translate into a better diet or more leisure. Rather, it translated into population explosions and pampered elites. The average farmer worked harder than the average forager, and got a worse diet in return. The Agricultural Revolution was history's biggest fraud.""That phrase also serves as the chapter's title. He means it.I'm not delving into whether this view is right, or wrong, or both. Some things I agree with wholeheartedly (for instance, that we didn't cultivate wheat, it cultivated us), and others I have problems with.I don't center the review around this debate because I agree the most with its conclusions. Nor is it necessarily the most engrossing or important argument in a book chock full of them.Instead, I highlight the Agricultural Revolution because it is most relevant today, and specifically for the question above: ""What do we want to become?""Humans did not want to become farmers. We didn't make the decision after careful thought. We didn't have the global civilization we have today. It just sort of happened.And once it happened, and we got addicted to the farming life, there was no going back. We changed forever.Certainly farming did help us attain a ""pleasant, satiated life"" -- at least in the short-term. Are we better off as a species, today, because of agriculture? Judging by the controversy this book chapter and this debate have generated, the answer to that question is hotly contested.But while Harari comes down firmly on the ""no"" side, I think he's making a greater point. A plea, even.We never had a chance to debate the merits of agriculture. But today, with our technology, we can see the future coming. And more importantly, we have a say in it.The future of the Sapiens is at stake in so many ways. We may prefer not to think about it, but we have to. We have to have the debate, and we have to study our history (and read this book!). We have to because if we don't, then nobody will. And we'll be at the mercy of... well, ourselves."

254,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7381993-katia-n,3,"3.5 stars from me.It is a very entertaining and accessible book. It is brief as it states on the cover, but, I would say, it is more about anthropology than the history. I can see the appeal of this book - it explains the evolution of humanity in easy digestible steps with lots of interesting facts. However, I cannot see people, who are seriously interested in modern understanding of historic and political development, being very excited by it. Even I knew the majority of theories in this book already. At the same time, I can see its mass-culture appeal. I compare this to the difference between classic and pop music. Not everyone could appreciate the classic music without being exposed to it since childhood, or proper music education. But pop-music does not require any work to appreciate it - just some good repetitive tune and preferably catchy lyrics. It might be the stepping stone for some of the listeners to the higher level, but equally it might be enjoyed by itself and felt even revelatory sometimes. So this book is the ""pop-music"" of the modern world anthropology. I found the first part of the book about prehistoric societies the most interesting. The path to evolvement of Homo Sapiens as the only specie of its kind reads almost like a thriller. Starting from the agrarian revolution some of Mr Harari's theories appealed to me, and some I did not find sufficiently convincing:- the grain domesticating the humankind and making them more miserable then they've been before. I could see the analogy with the ""selfish genes"" here. But it is much less convincing. The same with the theory that agriculture has lead to the rapid population growth - there are views that the population growth actually has lead to agriculture, not other way around. And how this theory would explain the existence of pastoral tribes which were not involved in constant grain processing? Those nevertheless were quite successful in submission of some settled societies. The emergence of the state is not discussed at all in the book.- ""Without industrialisation of agriculture the urban industrial revolution would never taken place -there would not be enough hands and brains to staff factories and offices."" Really? Some other historians say that peasants were migrating to cities and towns because they did not have enough to eat at the villages. Everything I read before on the subject of the world economic history was stating that industrial revolution took place in the cities and factories while agriculture was dragging much behind with the remainders of pre capitalism arrangements. What appealed to me is the author's theorising on the nature of liberalism, communism and other modern ideologies. I would agree that there is no substantial difference between them and any religion. All of them are based on the core believes which are impossible to prove. The discussion of the capitalism, free markets and their role in the development of modern civilisation was interesting. I learned a few new facts. But overall on a theoretical level it was not revelatory. I did not particularly enjoyed the last part of the book discussing consumerism. It felt a bit like hitting a dead horse. Everyone knows about it. You can pick up a random newspaper, especially on the left, and this type of discussion would be there. The discussion of happiness was more profound. But it deserves much more space, maybe a separate book. It also went a bit in circles from chemical basis of happiness through social, back to chemical. Overall it is an easy read, could be quite thought-provoking, It would give you a few topics to discuss with your friends and colleagues, and the confidence to do it. But do not expect more than quality entertainment out of it. Jared Diamond's books are more profound broadly on the same subject."
255,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21223898-roxana-chiril,0,"Excerpt #1 from ""Rabbitens: A Brief History of Rabbitkind"", by Bunny Noah Hare-ari:Some scholars try to exonerate our species, placing the blame on the vagaries of the climate (the usual scapegoat in such cases). Yet it is hard to believe that Leporide rabbitens was completely innocent. There are three pieces of evidence that weaken the climate alibi, and implicate our ancestors in the overturning of the Australian fauna and geography.[...]Were the Australian extinction and soil degradation an isolated event, we could grant rabbits the benefit of the doubt. But the historical record makes Leporide rabbitens look like an ecological serial killer. How could they cause an ecological disaster? The population appears to have originated with the release of 24 wild rabbits, and within ten years, two million could be shot or trapped annually by humans without having any noticeable effect on the population. It was the fastest spread ever recorded of any mammal anywhere in the world. The upheaval of Australia was probably the first mark that our kind left on the planet. The inevitable conclusion is that Leporide rabbitens has the dubious distinction of being the deadliest species in the annals of biology.I don't even know where to start with Sapiens, really.It's a theory of everything.And the theory says humans are horrid, a disaster on the environment, a disaster to themselves, the worst of the worst. And human evolution happened only because humans are capable of believing in things that aren't really there.The ""things that aren't really there"" are driving me nuts. For Harari, all things that aren't rooted into the material world are fictions of the same sort. God and the Peugeot company are the same, because people believe in them even if they don't exist - well, if he can't see the difference, then he has a strong dose of atheistic miopia, if you ask me. The Peugeot company exists because it's a convention. We made it up and are aware we made it up. We need to refer to businesses somehow, and that's by convention. God, though, is an explanation of the world around us, not a convention. God exists or does not exist regardless of belief - you cannot *convene* God into or out of existence. In a sense, God is akin to science and/or philosophy, not to a code of laws.I suppose Harari is trying to say that humans are capable of creating abstract concepts not rooted in the material world, but he definitely doesn't put it that way.Secondly, about humans being so utterly distructive. I'm not saying humanity *hasn't* had an impact, or that environmental concerns aren't valid, because they are - but Harari loves pressing the guilt pedal. Humans have destroyed from the moment they got somewhere, killing other human species, other animals, changing the world, all that.Well, I have bad news. We're not the only ones killing indiscriminately - my dog used to hunt chickens and kill them for sport, if rabbits ever gain sentience and speech they might talk about how they messed up Australia, and so on. What humans have is an ability to understand and feel worry or guilt over what is going on and what we've done. Normally, that means we can change our behavior and try to do things better, but with Harari, it becomes guilt-porn, a real titillation of just how eeeevil we are compared to everything else.I honestly don't feel a masochistic need to be shamed for what my species did before it was even properly aware of what it was doing, nor do I enjoy seeing logic holes everywhere in my nonfiction. So dnf@page can't-believe-I've-made-it-this-far."

He divides human history into four distinct chronological areas; the Cognitive revolution, the Agricultural revolution, the 'Unification' and the Scientific revolution.The Cognitive revolution was, for me, the most compelling and fascinating area to read about. While I was vaguely aware that there used to be other human species on the planet, I had never read about that era of our history before. Earlier in 2017, I read Bryson's A Short History of Nearly Everything but he neatly skims over pre-history with the quote ""Some tiny bag of chemicals twitched and became animate...four billion years later people began to wonder how it all happened."" (p63) The early chapters of Sapiens fills that gap. The world we inhabited hundreds of thousands of years ago is almost unrecognisable today; different species of humans like the Neaderthals, Homo Rudolfensis, and Denisovans flourished and evolved in different corners of the globe along with countless giant or 'mega' species of animals, birds, plants and insects now long gone from us. Harari points to compelling evidence that Homo Sapiens were to blame for the devastating extinctions of the majority of these other humans and animals.""By 10,000 BC, humans already inhabited the most southern point in America...no other animal had ever moved...so quickly...everywhere using virtually the same genes...when the first Americans marched south...they encountered mammoths and mastodons, rodents the size of bears, herds of horses and camels, oversized lions, and dozens of large species...among them fearsome sabre-tooth cats and giant ground sloths that weighed up to eight tons...within 2,000 years of the Sapiens' arrival, most of these unique species were gone."" pp78-79Sadly, this part of the book is over too quickly. The other areas don't quite live up that first section, but it was still interesting to understand more about how our current homo sapien society evolved, for example, how the abstract concepts of money and religion came to gather so much power, why story-telling is so important to our evolution and why it was the Europeans, rather the inhabitants of other continents, who conquered the Americas and created global empires in the early modern era.The final sections were the hardest to read, for a number of reasons. Harari doesn't hold back on his opinion of the Sapien capacity for violence and destruction; the soullessness of capitalism and consumerism, the horror of the industrial meat industry, and our current energy and climate crisis.Likewise, the book ends on a sombre note. Harari likens modern Homo Sapiens to gods - destructive, powerful and capable of intelligent design - so what does that mean for our future? "

Winston Churchill said “The farther back you can look, the farther forward you are likely to see.” How about looking back 13.5 billion years ago when we were primordial soup? Yuval Noah Harari’s Sapiens takes you on a journey from the beginning of time. Sapiens traces our species through the last 100,000 years and the Cognitive, Agricultural, Scientific, and Industrial Revolutions. Harari speaks of Communism, Capitalism, Democracy, Liberalism, Christianity and Islam etc. as if they are all religions. Brilliant! We all have to believe in some abstract concept such as equality or liberty to get us through the day. Harai demonstrates how even paper money and banking lending regulations are a bit of a sham. But belief in all these myths have fueled growth and progress. Harari argues that storytelling and dreaming is what sets us apart from all the other animals. They have enabled mankind to farm, build the pyramids, chart the globe, defy gravity, and split the atom.After the 100,000 year journey is the Homo sapiens species any happier? Harai says it depends on how you define happiness. All of man’s tremendous advances have come with some dire consequences but the biologist would have to compare the dopamine, serotonin, and oxytocin levels of modern man vs the hunter gather. The answer is we are probably not any happier. If you read Sapiens will you achieve total consciousness? Probably not but Sapiens will broaden your horizons and expand your perspective of man's journey to present day. Plus it will provide you with great stories to bother your coworkers with during coffee breaks and long car rides. You can also highlight key passages to read them to your wife while she is trying to watch HGTV. All of Harai’s theories seem reasonable and are backed up with several examples. More importantly Sapiens is presented in a manner that is upbeat and anything but boring. Have you ever considered buying a ticket to India so you could climb to the top of the mountain to ask the mountain top guru about the meaning of life? You may be able to save yourself a 3000$ plane ticket and spare yourself from eating curry if you go out and buy a copy Harari’s Sapiens. If you do go to India look over the great Carnac's shoulder I’ll bet you find a copy of Sapiens levitating on his book shelf."

That being said, I found Sapiens to be a well-written and extremely interesting read. Harari is clearly a deep and creative thinker, and though reducing the history of humanity to a few hundred pages is an impossibly daunting task for anyone, his writing was logically organized, unfailingly interesting, and now and then intriguingly provocative and opinionated. During his discussion of how early Homo Sapiens eventually edged out other primitive human species, his views on the evolutionary process were sprinkled with the unavoidable ""we don't know"" and ""scientists aren't sure"" observations. But that comes with the territory, and he made a thoughtful case for his views. Also fascinating was his opinion that a hunter-gatherer society was in many ways better off than the ""advanced"" agricultural societies which succeeded them. In short: hunter-gatherers could roam freely to find different varieties of foods, while the farmers who came later were tied down to one location, with land that had to be protected from invaders, and a more limited diet, depending on what crops they could raise, and whether the harvest was successful.One of the fundamental premises of his book is that cultures can only become large, and hold together, when they form around any number of strongly held common beliefs, which can include fictions, or ""myths"" -- As he opines:""The ability to speak about fictions is the most unique feature of Sapiens language...fiction has enabled us not merely to imagine things, but to do so collectively.""At one point in Sapiens, Harari included a detailed discussion of how economies come into being, from simple barter systems to the eventual need for a currency, which then provides a standard of value. Among his many fascinating discussions and ideas, I found his explanation of economics to be particularly clear and outstanding.Sapiens is one of those books where everyone can find something to disagree with, yet it is consistently interesting and thought-provoking. For me, a worthwhile and memorable read!"

I wish it would become part of our school curriculum!Yuval Noah Harari guides us through our kognitive evolution, which happened 70 000 years ago and therefore before the agriculture and scientific revolutions, that follow. Meanwhile it’s written in a way that you could mistake it for a novel. I highly respect the ability of scientists to make complex processes seem easy. “If you can't explain it to a six year old, you don't understand it” as Einstein once said.This book made me think!Harari doesn’t just presents what is known to scientists but constantly raises thought provoking questions. When processes are not fully understood yet, he says so and offers different theories that are discussed, enabling the reader to understand the dispute and provides tools for discussion. This makes it a highly reflective work, encouraging social criticism.My favorite parts of the book are:• the realizations I extract from the early kognitive revolution and our use of language which are separated from later processes - which is a common misconception.• the agriculture revolution and it’s devastatingly negative impact on our life quality, with the sole benefit of dna replication - another big misconception.• the development of our ability to imagine fiction as baseline to the creation of unnatural big communities through religions and thought constructs such as states, laws and similar - something I quite never thought about in this way before and which I experienced as extremely enlightening.All of these points I consider key points to better understand our past, present and future. From our biological needs, to the occurrence of wars and the human condition. It helped me to realize where we show signs of exuberance, vanity and hubris, when thinking about ourselves, because most of us know barely anything about why we are the way we are.I couldn’t recommend it higher, it’s probably one of the most important books I will ever read.

It turned out not to be a good fit for me and I only finished about half before giving up.I was not really learning anything new and when I reached Chapter 5, ""History's Greatest Fraud,"" I became annoyed. The reason is the ""Fraud"" the author was talking about was the Agricultural Revolution. In his opinion this was a terrible thing for humanity because it forced mankind to give up the happy, easy, healthful life of hunter gather in exchange for an awful life as a farmer. To make it worse we then domesticated chickens, sheep, etc. and took away their happy life as well as our own.What made me even more annoyed was the author next explained that it was not a human decision, but rather the wild wheat plants that domesticated us, not the other way around. Basically, this book is a series of musing speculations by the author about how we reached the present day with some actual historical events thrown in.If speculations that we were captured by wild wheat plants against out better judgment and we made the chickens unhappy appeals to you, this could be a good book for you. If you look at the ratings for this book, it is pretty clear that an awful lot of Goodreads members must agree it was terrible for the wheat plants to do that and make both us and the chickens unhappy.Well just a year after discarding this book it was recommended to me by Audible and I bought the audio version, having failed to check my books read.

How did our species succeed in the battle for dominance? Why did our foraging ancestors come together to create cities and kingdoms? How did we come to believe in gods, nations, and human rights; to trust money, books, and laws; and to be enslaved by bureaucracy, timetables, and consumerism?Stop for a second and think about the scope of this book. Yes, the author clearly has done immense research, but it is his ability to weave all that research into a narrative that reads like a fast paced thriller that impresses me. This is narrative non-fiction at its best. The book weaves in anthropology, biology, chemistry, sociology, history, philosophy, politics, religion .... no that's not it, I'm just tired of typing. I was educated, entertained, and had my mind blown by some nugget in almost every chapter. How often can one say that? The audiobook is superbly narrated by Derek Perkins, and I've spent the past month or so immersed in changing my mental maps of the world as I know it.I am not a re-reader, but I have little doubt that I will read this fantastic book again. Highly recommended."

I chose to read this out of respect to Obama,  who recommended this along with 9 others as essential reads. And now, I admire him even more.More than history, this is a discussion of the most interesting and varied concepts like...1. The genus 'Homo' has just one species - 'Sapiens'. why?2. Among sapiens, there exist: religion, money, empires and cooperation. Why not anywhere else?3. How is Capitalism, communism and Christianity are more alike than different?4. The insignificant and smelly Europeans conquered a world ruled by titans like- Qin, Mughals and Astecs. Why?5. Why the world haven't yet seen a 3rd world war?6. What is the nature of and path towards happiness? ...and much much more...Furthermore, the author's narration is remarkably objective. His inclinations -except that to Buddhist philosophy- never seem to influence his writings, which is quite amazing as the subject is one of the most fundamental question that a Sapien brain can think of. Overall, excellent."

The book is subtitled A Brief History of Humankind, and the history portion of the book actually is fairly brief, comprising only about one-third of the book. This was the most interesting portion of the book also. The rest of the book is an interesting presentation by the author on the topics of what it really means to be human as our species experiences the unnatural phenomena of the scientific and industrial revolutions. Finally, the author asks, and attempts to answer the question of what does the future hold for our species.I really enjoyed reading this book. It answered a lot of questions for me and opened my mind up to a lot of topics for future contemplation."

The author is historian indeed, but his way of writing is very journalistic, very selectively zooming in on essential historical periods or on global trends that stand out. Harari frequently is surprising, enlightening and wildly interesting, but sometimes also long-winded, moralistic, and at times a bit simplistic. Especially towards the end, this book is more about the essence of man, about the difficulty to make binding statements on the meaning of history and life, and about the enormous challenges that our species await. In short: absolutely recommended reading, but it has its flaws.A more elaborate review of this book you can find in my History-alias on Goodreads, follow this link https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...

For someone who has great expertise in anthropology, philosophy, history, and economics, the things this book talks about may not seem novel, and it shouldn't. Because, otherwise, you're doing something wrong. For someone who has looked the world in narrow dimensions, like a race horse wearing blinkers, this book could effortlessly blow your mind. For me, this book was consolation. Years and years of rumination has led me to question many things and Yuval, though doesn't have answers for them, proved my questions were valid and relevant, and backed them with examples and anecdotes.

The book is structured using three distinct revolutions in the history of Homo Sapiens and what kind of implications each of these might have had. Sapiens gives the reader a comprehensive set of alternatives that shaped the past and clearly illustrates the different angles of modern research while beautifully bringing these to modern society.Personally, I enjoyed the first parts of the book most, diving deep into the Cognitive Revolution. These were the things supposedly learnt at school, but that got buried deep afterwards. Sapiens is a great read for anyone who just wants to remind themselves on human history and for those who want to ponder the current global developments."

Don't confuse this book as an informative guide on the evolution of our society. This book, with subtle cruelty, mocks at the very reader who gets fooled under the impression of them being on a journey of enlightenment. In this game of life, where all species toggle between the two sides of happiness and suffering, the only winner is no one but the invisible force of Capitalism - which, by the way, plays from both the sides. [This is how most people describe God.] I am confident that the reference to Cynicism with both its original and modern connotation was a deliberate reference to GB Shaw's view - ""The power of accurate observation is often called cynicism by those who don't have it."""

As the scope is so great (it would be impossible to cram a detailed history of humankind into a book) it is of course very light on detail. But it succeeds in that instead of trying to cover every detail, it attempts to draw out major themes and identify key factors that played a part in our development and success, as well taking a more philosophical approach, exploring the consequences of our success and what the future might hold.

Generally, if the book has captured the imagination of millions of readers, this is a good thing, especially in a day and age where peoples' attentions are so incredibly short and distracted by a thousand competing types of information. Any book that covers such big and important concepts as this and can command people's interest deserves respect, regardless of whether you agree or not. Stimulating discourse or making people rethink their assumptions is a great accomplishment. He doesn't need to provide a host of answers to the problems and issues he raises. Criticisms by some readers:1) Some experts in various fields find his arguments and conclusions too glib or sensational and lacking depth, and 2) He in not objective in his analysis, and has an agendaMy opinion:Well, when you are covering all of human history, and focusing on the Cognitive, Agricultural, and Technological Revolutions, you have to paint with a very broad brush. I thought he did a fantastic job of this. I found the discussions of various aspects of this development well-argued, and though I'm no expert in evolutionary biology or economics or linguistics or neural cognition, it seemed to make sense. I also liked his take on how humanity tends to invest so fully into imagined concepts such as religion, money, political and social systems, that they take on a reality that we rarely question. In particular, the shift from polytheistic to monotheistic religions and the resultant lack of tolerance and zeal to exterminate rival views and religions struck me as very much on the money.The shift to global capitalism and greater social and economic interdependence also was well-described, including all the pitfalls this raises in terms of depleting resources, enslaving workers in the service of those with the wealth & capital, and not contributing to happiness nearly as much as claimed. He also is unapologetic in having an agenda, so it seems quite silly to complain the book is biased. Essentially all books, whether about history, politics, economics, biology, or religion, are inherently biased in the sense that the writer has opinions and they form the basis for their argument. How could it be any other way? Now some have specifically said he was being disingenuous by pretending to be objective but sneaking in his biases on various subjects, such as his apparent distrust/dislike for the big monotheistic religions (Judaism, Christianity, Islam) and apparent favoring of less aggressive religions like Buddhism, but he makes it quite clear why he has this opinion, so if you disagree with that there's no problem with that, I'm sure he's not afraid of debating his position. The same goes for his negative view of meat-eating and industrialized farming. Of course it's an agenda - so what? He makes his case, and if you don't agree then you can write a book or paper to refute it. There is also an element of criticism of traditional scholarship and questioning of the world's most deeply-embedded assumptions that it shares with the book that provided inspiration, Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs, and Steel. That was a truly phenomenal work of historical anthropology, taking a totally fresh look at the environmental influences and advantages/disadvantages that shaped the development of different civilizations through history. While I think that book is superior in terms of intellectual rigor and scholarship, I still think Harari's work is a worthy collection of ideas that questions many of our most cherished institutions and beliefs."

Since long intestines and large brains are both massive energy consumers, it's hard to have both. By shortening the intestines and decreasing their energy consumption, cooking inadvertently opened the way to the jumbo brains of Neanderthals and Sapiens.""""According to the ""Interbreeding Theory"", when Sapiens spread into Neanderthal lands, Sapiens bred with Neanderthals until the two populations merged. If this is the case, then today's Eurasians are not pure Sapiens. They are a mixture of Sapiens and Neanderthals."" (page 15)""The opposing view, called the ""Replacement Theory"" tells a very different story — one of incompatibility, revulsion. (...) The two populations remained completely distinct, and when the Neanderthals died out, or were killed off, their genes died with them. According to this view, Sapiens replaced all the previous human populations without merging with them.If that is the case, the lineages of all contemporary human can be traced back, exclusively, to East Africa, 70,000 years ago. We are all 'pure Sapiens'."" (page 16)""Tolerance is not a Sapiens trademark. In modern times, a small difference in our skin colour, dialect or religion has been enough to prompt one group of Sapiens to set about exterminating another group. Would ancient Sapiens have been more tolerant towards an entirely different human species? It may well be that when Sapiens encountered Neanderthals, the result was the first and most significant ethnic-cleansing campaign in history.""""The story of the luxury trap carries with it an important lesson. Humanity's search for an easier life released immense forces of change that transformed the world in ways nobody envisioned or wanted."" (page 99)""Understanding human history in the millennia following the Agricultural Revolution boils down to a single question: how did humans organise themselves in mass-cooperation networks, when they lacked the biological instincts necessary to sustain such networks? The short answer is that humans created imagined orders and devised scripts. These two inventions filled the gaps left by our biological inheritance."" (page 149)""(...) American plantations in places such as Virginia, Haiti and Brazil were plagued by malaria and yellow fever, which had originated in Africa. Africans has acquired over the generations a partial genetic immunity to these diseases, whereas Europeans were totally defenceless and died in droves. It was consequently wiser for a plantation owner to invest his money in an African slave than in a European slave or indentured labourer. Paradoxically, genetic superiority (in terms of immunity) translated into social inferiority: precisely because Africans were fitter in tropical climates than Europeans, they ended up as the salves of European masters. Due to these circumstantial factors, the burgeoning new societies of America were to be divided into a ruling a caste of white Europeans and a subjugated caste of black Africans."" (page 157)""Christians and Muslims who could not agree on religious beliefs, could nevertheless agree on a monetary belief, because whereas religion asks us to believe in something, money ask us to believe that _other people believe in something_."" (page 207)""Money is based on 2 universal principles:a) Universal convertibility: with money as an alchemist, you can turn land into loyalty, justice into health, and violence into knowledge.b) Universal trust: with money as a go-between, any two people can cooperate on any project.""

The imperial steamroller gradually obliterated the unique characteristics of numerous people (such as the Numantians), forging out of them new and much larger groups."" (page 213)""The global empire being forged before our eyes is not governed by any particular state or ethnic group. Much like the Late Roman Empire, it is ruled by a multi-ethnic elite, and is held together by a common culture and common interests.

They must ponder whether to answer the imperial call or to remain loyal to their state and their people. More and more choose the empire.""

Yet, in fact, religion has bee the third great unifier of humankind, alongside money and empires."" (page 234)""The Chinese and Persian did not lack technological inventions such as steam engines (which could be freely copied or bought). They lacked the values, myths, judicial apparatus and sociopolitical structures that took centuries to form and mature in the West and which could not be copied and internalised rapidly. France and the US quickly followed in the Britain's footsteps because the French and Americans already shared the most important British myths and social structures. The Chinese and Persians could not catch up as quickly because the thought and organised their societies differently."" (page 314)""European imperialism was entirely unlike all other imperial projects in history. Previous seekers of empire tended to assume that they already understood the world. Conquest merely utilied and spread _their view_ of the world. The Arabs, to name one example, did not conquer Egypt, Spain or India in order to discover something they did not know. The Romans, Mongols and Aztecs voraciously conquered new lands in search of power and wealth – not of knowledge. In contrast, European imperialists set out to distant shores in the hope of obtaining new knowledge along with new territories."" (page 317)"
286,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19512822-gokul-gr,5,"The greatest story to be told: The story of us. And the author has done it with clarity, in crisp language and in a gripping manner. No wonder Sapiens has received such rave reviews from across the board.The book is separated into 4 distinct parts, starting with the beginning of history, 70,000 years ago ,characterised by revolutions that changed the way humans interacted with her surroundings: Cognitive revolution, Agricultural revolution, Unification of Human kind and the Scientific revolution. Cognitive revolution: Cognitive revolution led to record keeping and collective memory, leading to the beginning of history. That said, history is incomplete in this ear due to limitations in record keeping. The author analyses the various popular theories and presents the more plausible ones. The author discusses the possible reasons of how Homo sapiens, a small group of species that evolved in East Africa became the only surviving species of the Homo genus, inspite of being not the physically strongest. No perfect answers are available regarding how we interacted with our other cousins, like whether it was friendly or hostile, whether they had sex or not. The author also talks about possible political and racial ramifications if this research threw up unexpected answers. The author lies the foundation for collective myth (religion, tribe or any other irrational connection shared by a group that enables co ordination between the groups)Agricultural revolution: The sharp departure from our evolutionary lifestyle to an artificial lifestyle is explored in this part. The author points this as a major reason for the conflicts between our instincts and social norms. The concept of collective myth is further expanded in this part as complex social organisations evolve once humans settle down to farm. As evolutionary success need not mean individual success and happiness, the author raises the very pertinent question as to whether agricultural revolution and the resultant lifestyle made people happier than before. But as these changes were very gradual, people soon forgot they had a different lifestyle. The invention of script led to storage of memory and wisdom and the foundations of huge collective myths that would define the next phase were laid during this period.The unification of mankind: This part deals with further enlargement of the collective myths leading to the creation of universal ideas that unify mankind over geography and cultures. The author explores three of the most prominent of such myths: the myth of the king and the empire, the myth of money and the myth of religion. As these collective myths have a very prominent place in the today's world, I found this part to be the most interesting. We can see the contours of today's world forming up in these chapters. The author demolishes inherent superiority of one myth over the other by showing how chance events led to the domination of one and the elimination of the other. He also talks about formation of various form of identities. This part ends with the present day universal ideas that have defied boundaries like humanism, human rights, feminism and so on.The scientific revolution: This part leads to the modern day world. The author hypothesises the acceptance of ignorance in the European world as the prime driver of this revolution. That also led to a historically insignificant part of the world so far, Europe, to dominate the world in the most convincing manner in the history of humankind. He talks about the growth of science and capitalism and how they mutually reinforced each other. This part helps us to make sense of the happenings of the last 500 years that have shaped the world as we see now. The world has become a far peaceful place as the cost of war has gone up tremendously, while the benefits are virtually none. Victorious armies in the past looted fallen cities for gold and the precious items. But the most precious item in the modern cities are human capital, which cannot be looted.The concluding 2 chapter deal with happiness and the future of Homo sapiens. The question of happiness is an over arching theme through out the book. While the author acknowledges that we cannot go back to older ways of life(former ways cannot support the current population), he ponders whether as an individual, we are happier than before. The approach is not that of an apologetic nostalgia for the 'glorious past' that I personally find revolting, but a critical analysis based on human nature. At the crux is human nature that is still shaped by the millions of years of evolution before the cognitive revolution 70,000 years ago. The author sees the divergence between intrinsic human nature and the requirements needed to sustain the world that we created as the core issue that affects happiness at the individual level. The beautiful book ends with the chapter titled End of Homo Sapiens? Its not about the end of humanity, but possible evolution of the species into super humans. Although 70,000 years is a blink in evolutionary timeline, the progress we have made in medicines, thought and technology may create genetic changes sooner than later. This will throw up ethical questions of the scale not addressed in the history of mankind. The author does a fine job in summarising such a wide and deep subject in a small, accessible book. Sapiens can be a starting point for reading more about the extra ordinary journey of our species in the last 70,000 years. "
287,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68583290-jamie,3,"This is a book about big ideas, and is at its best when it makes readers question their assumptions. We take many things for granted simply because everyone else does too and we have never asked ourselves why. Harari reminded me of Rousseau, who also believed that civilization was a terrible idea, and that before it primitive man had been happier, healthier, and lived in a state of idyllic grace. It is an interesting point of view and a great starting point for asking questions about society, progress, and equality. However, Harari, like Rousseau, is more of a polemicist than a scientist, and his arguments are more assertive than evidence-based.Did hunter-gatherers really have better, more fulfilling lives than the farmers and herders who replaced them? Possibly, and evidence from graves seems to indicate that sedentary living and the close proximity of animals and other humans increased the spread of diseases. Harari claims that the change to agriculture was so gradual that people did not know they were being enslaved to their lands and herds, and so did not recognize what they had given up. Agriculture, however, was clearly the more successful lifestyle, because it allowed people to build up surpluses to see them through the lean times. Surpluses allow for population growth, and eventually a critical mass was reached where villages become towns, town cities, and cities empires, writing was invented to manage administration and taxation, and the world was forever changed.Since Hunter-gatherers could only take along as much as they could physically carry, they were always in danger of starvation. Times of scarcity would quickly have become life threatening, and since they had to keep moving anyone who was too sick or injured to keep up with the group would have been left behind. Compared to that kind of hand to mouth existence agriculture doesn’t seem like such a bad bargain.The book proceeds along these lines, with Harari asserting opinions as if they were established facts. He seems to delight in being contrarian, and sometimes this approach works well, as when it makes readers pause and ask themselves whether they agree or not, and what is the basis for their opinion. Sometimes, however, Harari is just wrong, so wrong the reader is left wondering whether he is just playing the provocateur. For instance, he says that had the Aztecs shown more resolve they could have resisted the Spanish conquest. I suspect Harari has actually read Jared Diamond’s Guns, Germs, and Steel, which addresses this exact point, but he chooses to ignore it. Faced with superior organization and technology, and diseases the New World had no immunity against, the Aztecs had no long term chance of resisting.The most interesting idea Harari raises is what he calls the Cognitive Revolution, which he says happened about 70,000 years ago, in which humans developed the ability to tell stories which became foundational myths that helped form societies. These were the myths of religions, hero-kings, individual responsibility, and social justice. Whatever their original source, once enough people believed them they had a self-sustaining force that helped bind families into clans, clans into tribes, then becoming self-identified “peoples” separate from all those other, no doubt lesser, peoples. In this Harari reminded me of Joseph Campbell’s Myths to Live By, although I thought Cambell’s work was more thoughtfully presented.Ever since the Cognitive Revolution, Sapiens have thus been living in a dual reality. On the one hand, the objective reality of rivers, trees and lions; and on the other hand, the imagined reality of gods, nations and corporations. As times went by, the imagined reality became ever more powerful, so that today the very survival of rivers, trees and lions depends on the grace of imagined entities such as United States and Google.An example of this in modern terms would be money which, however essential it is to life, the more you think about it the stranger it becomes. It is odd enough to consider exchanging physical goods for pieces of paper and bits of metal, but today the idea is abstracted even further. Most of a person’s wealth is just strings of ones and zeros on distant computers. We trust that those digital bits can be converted to physical purchases, but it is all just trust, and trust isn’t exactly something that people have historically been able to rely on.The book ends on a rather strange note, with Harari predicting a techno-future of god-like human-machine amalgamations. He is projecting a future which follows an exponential curve of ever greater technology, and it is one possibility, but it is only his opinion, which the reader is free to share or, laughing, disregard.So, this is an odd book for me. I liked its ability to make me think and to question my assumptions, but I have a natural tendency to be suspicious of proclamations unsupported by evidence, and as I read the book I kept saying, “Yes, but….” Many people loved it, and many hated it (especially, it seems, those who believe in a Divine Providence external to humankind). I think it was worth reading, but I have many reservations about the author’s view of the world."

Writing, money, agriculture, creativity, religion, the almost unilaterally patriarchal structure of human cultures, and all of the usual bread and butter of anthropological studies make an appearance within these pages.As is to be expected, the author is on surer footing the closer to the present age he gets. He makes a very plausible case for the sudden progress the human race has made in recent centuries being caused by the interdependent relationship of European imperialism, science, and capitalism. Much like the three legs of a stool, if one of these had been missing at that crucial juncture in history, the entire enterprise would not have taken off the way it did. It seems evident to me one would be hard pressed to disentangle the three. The book concludes with some short chapters speculating about how society might be shaped by emerging technologies: genetic engineering, transhumanism, de-extinction, and artificial intelligence. Predicting which highways and byways scientific progress will take us down is a notoriously difficult enterprise. Look at the scientific predictions of bygone eras and compare them to the view outside your window; you will probably find yourself amused by how quaint some of them appear now. On the other hand, sometimes they do get it right – that rectangular shape that goes everywhere you go and buzzes and chirps throughout the day is proof. Paradoxically, though one of the prevalent themes throughout the book seemed to be that a lot of our problems are caused by trying to manipulate our environment for our own good, the author seemed to have a rosy view of the future. Indeed, I note he has an upcoming book entitled Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow. Is that the sum of stone age minds and space age technology then?The author is a thorough going naturalist so some of the premises he accepts I do not. Early in the book he writes the following of 'the imagined order,' his catch all title for human societies and culture:'There are no gods in the universe, no nations, no money, no human rights, no laws, and no justice outside the common imagination of human beings.'The assertion is that all of these things are an inter-subjective illusion (something everyone treats as real even though we all know it isn't.) In some cases, a moment of thought will demonstrate that this is an obvious conclusion. Everyone knows that money is just rectangular bits of coloured paper but money is real because we all share the illusion that it is worth something. It is the tacit corporate agreement amongst all people that money has value that allow these bits of paper (or the electronic bits of information that are slowly replacing it) to have worth. If we all (or even a significant portion of us) decided to not participate in the illusion anymore, the illusion would cease to be. Yes, money is a fiction. Everyone knows that. You are going to have to work a little harder if you aver that things like God and morality are also fictions.At least three of the premises in the aforementioned statement I reject. However, I do accept the conclusions he infers from the premises he accepts. For example, if I also did not believe there was a God, I would reach the same conclusion he does: that this notion we have of human rights is an inter-subjective illusion. You certainly cannot derive any such notions from biology. Either you conjure them out of your head or they actually exist independent of biology. In simple terms, the value of other people is either imaginary or it is intrinsic. Of course, none of this proves or disproves that there is a God but it does show that ideas come with (at least this time examined) consequences. Metaphysical quibbles aside, I enjoyed reading it. The author has a knack for elucidating ideas and concepts."

History is not to know the future but to widen the horizons, to understand that our present situation is neither natural nor inevitable, and that we consequently have many more possibility before us than we imagine. Sapiens A brief history of humankind, is not a book, it is a travelogue starting 70,000 years ago, from cave passing through agricultural, scientific revolutions and standing here today, where we can see what we are doing today, and we also know what is right for environment or ourselves and future, but we are so mean, seems like we are enjoying the show and felling someone is going to take care of this planet.Coming to the back I am just thinking continuously after putting this book, should we be scared and enjoy what is happening, or what will be the future, cyborg,Apart from history, I liked the way how the books merges into realm of religion, different cultures, like about In India caste system, Africa, slavery, why British rules India, our eating habits, our conflicts, our sexuality (are all a result of the way our hunter-gatherer minds interact with our current post-industrial environment), our subjective happiness, our habits which has changed from the millennia, Harari also emphasizes the lack of research into the history of happiness, positing that people today are not significantly happier than in past eras. He concludes by considering how modern technology may soon end the species as we know it, as it ushers in genetic editing, immortality and non-organic life: humans have, in Harari's chosen metaphor, become gods, able to create species.It is quite insightful and an enriching experience it is not something which you will read and forget, Iit will leave an effect which can be lifelong too or some weeks.The takeaways which I really like in the bookOn Gossip:""...the most important information that needed to be conveyed was about humans, not about lions and bison."" Our language evolved as a way of gossiping. In other words, It's much more important ""... to know who in their band hates whom, who is sleeping with whom, who is honest and who is a cheat."" Harari lays out this conjecture in such logical terms that it is hard to refute him. It may even provide a framework in which to view today's social media maelstrom as a kind of sorting process. But he doesn't really go there, so I digress.""There are no gods in the universe, no nations, no money, no human rights, no laws, and no justice outside the common imagination of human beings.""Money is the most universal and most efficient system of mutual trust ever devised.Humans are the outcome of blind evolutionary processes who operate without goal or purpose. I personally feel in this book author does not shy away from giving its views on religion or even darkest theories and ideologies that no one has ""dared"" to speak about due to unforeseen political, psychological, social and economic consequences. The problem with me, whatever I book I have read so far, it always ends with some conclusion some tangible statement, but it is quite different It has been left inconclusive which is bit disappointing (It left me again with this question what do we want to want) but having said that, those whose are little bit interested in history of humankind, should definitely pick up this book. At the end I feel we humans are so selfish we have taken this planet for granted, then I got into further argument is this really about planet what about other things…..So I will sign off with 4.5/5 "

I've literally just finished to read the last words of the book and my vision of life and the world is changed forever. There is so much insight on human history and our world history that I cannot describe the content well enough. I highly recommend to watch the author TED talk if you want to have a quick glance at what to expect in the book. This book will change the way you see the world forever I can guarantee you that. I agree with every single conclusion the author has made in each chapter and I guess this is why his work resonated so much with me. Thank you so much for creating this master piece I feel so much more educated, cultured and even more open minded than was before."

Harari is a historian and did a brilliant job in sapiens. The book is a well-organized, nicely engraved, and thoroughly researched.The book begins by discussing different species before Homo sapiens. He then gave a comprehensive account of how Homo sapiens succeeded them. Further, he discussed how homo sapiens comes out from the middle of the food chain then crowning the food chain. What makes homo sapiens superior to all other species? Intellect? Something else? At one-time homo sapiens were hunter-gatherers then suddenly switched to hard labor agriculture? What compelled them to settle on less rewarding and more time-taking stuff? Then the industrial revolution and then finally the age of the informational revolution. He also talks about animals. Why some animals like mammoths got extinct and why some animals like cows are in abundance besides their enormous slaughter? He argued lots of stuff related to DNA, genes. The most important part is the last one which discusses the future of homo sapiens. With such a powerful mind, what will be sapiens accomplishing in the future? Making bird spies? Or they create emotionless, indestructible soldiers? Or some kind of superhumans? The part related to the history of happiness was also thought-provoking. Do all these comforting gadgets really affect our happiness level? Are we happier than our hunter-gatherer forefathers? Harari's way of questioning just really captivates the reader to keep going and wonder about such questions."

Felt like all of my friends finished it already. In the end, mixed feelings. Spoilers ahead.A brief history of humankind will be sparse in 50000 pages, so this 500 page book paints the picture with very wide brush strokes. It's like a version of Google maps in which New York City is just a single pixel. Often you get a rough idea about something interesting and leaves you hanging for more like imperialism and often you are bored with repetitious trivia about capitalism.The book starts with prehistoric times when Homo Sapiens is just another animal in the vast kingdom. The rise of humans from there to the largest ecological disaster is stunning. We managed to eradicate countless species that existed for millennia in just the last 500 years. The environmental pollution we have created already might be impossible to reverse but we continue to do so at an even higher rate. How did an insignificant animal do all that? Harari gives believable but a hypothesis nonetheless as theories about the rise of the modern state, agriculturalism and religion to explain this and connect the dots. There are brief discussions about imperialistic history, the scientific revolution, colonialism, nuclear power and the world wars to tie it all together.There are definitely a bunch of interesting ideas sprinkled all throughout the book. Drawing parallel between the old monotheistic religions like Christianity and Islam to the newer ideas of Capitalism and Communism as 2 sides of the same coin is interesting and the author spends a lot of time trying to really explain it. It could be hard on you if you believe in any of those, but the arguments are compelling. The discussion about the rise of modern animal husbandry is harsh and made me think hard about the consequences of my food habits.The book concludes with notes on the future, which as always is bound to go wrong and I always ignore these predictions. Nobody ever predicted the future in the long term. Everyone likes to fantasise that we will colonise Mars, gene edit to cure cancer and AI ruling the world. It was supposed to happen in 2000, we are waiting 20 years later.In the end, I read through about 90% of the book without learning much or thinking hard about it. I'm probably the wrong audience, I've spent more than half of my adult life thinking about some of the same subjects and there was nothing new in there which I really didn't know. The book filled some tiny gaps, but that's not enough to spend so much time and effort. I've already spent enormous time trying to understand how a tiny Island ruled a quarter of the world and how capitalism works to benefit from this book, but if you are new to any of the topics covered, you might enjoy the book."

Or at least when we invented agriculture. It’s hard to say whether the author is optimistic about our species or not. He has an interesting way of putting his ideas into words. I have to admit that a few concepts and hypothesis have caused me to rethink the way I have perceived some aspects of history. Of course, it’s impossible to fit all of human history in one volume, so Harari focused on what he thought were the main game changers: the Cognitive Revolution, Agricultural Revolution, the unification of humankind and the Scientific Revolution.The author argues that what sets us apart from other animals is our ability to believe in our myths and fantastic stories.In turn, we developed a highly complex way of communicating to share information and trade gossip which strengthens our social bonds. It’s one of our best and worst features because “You could never convince a monkey to give you a banana by promising him limitless bananas after death in monkey heaven.” The part that I especially enjoyed in the books is how the concept of social constructs was explained. Just because something is a product of the social consciousness doesn’t make it any less real. We give something power by believing in it, thus making it very much real, LLCs or genders.The Agricultural Revolution was highly romanticized, the way authors who write about this topic usually do. It reminded me of a novel by Daniel Quinn, Ishmael, in which the author urges readers to go back to our roots in order to save the planet. Since it’s too late for us to go back to frolicking in savannahs, picking berries, I think we’ll just have to think of a way to fix what we messed up. Sapiens are pretty good at messing up things. Slavery, atomic bombs, raping and pillaging are all products of the civilisation, but we are also good at fixing things. We have come this far, making today’s society objectively the best time to be alive in the whole of our history. We’re on brink of something big though, a huge change that will completely revolutionize the way we live and experience. We’re a bunch of genocidal wizards who harness the power of nature for our purposes who are on our way to becoming gods in the next generations. And there’s no doubt that we’ll get there."

Culture, Gender, Religion, Capitalism, Nationalism are the biggest myths ever made, the biggest lies ever told. Most laws, norms, rights and obligations are the result of human imagination, nothing more. This book wins, for settling the debate with wit and sarcasm, once and for all, on some of the most controversial topics of our times.Biology enables men to enjoy sex with one another – some cultures forbid them to realize this possibility. Culture tends to argue that it forbids only that which is unnatural. But from a biological perspective, nothing is unnatural. Whatever is possible is by definition also natural. A truly unnatural behaviour, one that goes against the laws of nature, simply cannot exist, so it would need no prohibition. No culture has ever bothered to forbid men to photosynthesise, women to run faster than the speed of light, or negatively charged electrons to be attracted to each other. We humans, are all fools to spend our lives fighting wars and killing each other in the name of religion, race, caste, sex and money. Some other deep insights in the book are:1.) We humans have the mindset of ancient foragers, which is why we are miserable in today's cities, suppressing our natural urge. 2.) There is no justice in history. History proceeds from one junction to the next, choosing for some mysterious reason to follow first this path, then another. This book also wins, for asking the one question that should have been asked, but no one has ever bothered asking, ""Are we happier?"" After all, happiness is and should be the sole purpose of life, the only thing worth fighting for in life. Were the citizens of Uruk and Babylon happier than their foraging ancestors? Did the discovery of inexhaustible energy resources open before us inexhaustible stores of bliss? If economic growth and self-reliance do not make people happier, what’s the benefit of Capitalism? And here's the thing, a medieval peasant could have been happier than today's investment banker. Happiness lies within.This is the history of you and me. This is the history of us. This book is worth it's weight in gold. "

The true gem is in the way he tells the story. Seeing it from Harari's perspective, one starts to separate themselves from the ideas and conditioning we are programed to go by and starts to look at human lives from a rather detached point of view, following millions of years of living and dying. This point of view did three things for me 1) it made me feel like I was not such a bad human after all, I felt less guilty for not being able to do as much. We have been fighting, screaming, being miserable for eons and the struggle has always been to be better 2) genocides are one of the most reoccurring happenings throughout history, it made me realize the time we live in is actually more peaceful than we give credit for. Many of us have stronger voices and we fight for justice more often than not. We may even be the most naive and do-goodery than we have ever been. 3) the last part of the book contemplates different options for the human race in the future. While we have so much more power, with a high value on personal comfort for our individualist society who believes in the ""you can do it!"" theory molding humans into some kind of perfection, godlike beings, what is it that we really want to do as we reach near perfect through genetic mastery etc.. Harari's question was, ""What is it that we want to want?"" And this has me thinking about my and our cumilitive thoughts, desires and dreams, given all of these might be unique to our time... will a genetically superior human or cyborg, care about such emotions, love, hate and dreams?His next book, ""Homo Deus,"" Human gods takes a little stage at the end of Sapiens...I may take a break before picking up this next book, but I definitely want to understand more behind these last lines of Sapiens, ""Is there anything more dangerous than dissatisfied and irresponsible gods who don't know what they want?"""

The Agricultural Revolution sped it up about 12,000 years ago. The Scientific Revolution, which got under way only 500 years ago, may well end history and start something completely different. This book tells the story of how these three revolutions have affected humans and their fellow organisms.”—page 3WOW! Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, by Yuval Noah Harari is far and away one of the best, most interesting, most insightful, most illuminating, most important books, I’ve ever read; and Professor Harari one of the most brilliant scholars. He gets a fast pass to my pantheon of personal heroes. Not since I read Jared Diamond’s book, Guns, Germs, and Steal: The Fates of Human Societies, more than fifteen years ago, have I been so overwhelmed, and amazed, by a book. And Sapiens is every bit, and probably more so, as challenging and captivating as was GG&S.The history of humankind, as related by Harari, is much, much more than just one damn thing after another. It is evocative. It is provocative. It stirs all kinds of juices. And it is fraught with endless possibilities and improbabilities. The future of sapiens might be brief. The future of the genus Homo might just be even more incredible than its past has been. Or, it might not be at all.Recommendation: Sapiens is a 100% terrific read. Guaranteed to make you smarter, happier, and better looking. Read it soon. It will make your mind ache. Also, watch Professor Harari’s Ted Talk video, Why Humans Run the World, on YouTube.“SEVENTY THOUSAND YEARS AGO, HOMO sapiens was still an insignificant animal minding its own business in a corner of Africa. In the following millennia it transformed itself into the master of the entire planet and the terror of the ecosystem. Today it stands on the verge of becoming a god, poised to acquire not only eternal youth, but also the divine abilities of creation and destruction.”—page 258Kindle edition, 414 pages"
