0,0060988479,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1538729-aaron,1,"""Sitting somewhere between purely mental events and purely sensory ones is this vast sea of life called experience."" (p. 250) And somewhere between the worst of bad popular science writing and New Age pseudo-philosophy lies this horrendous mess. Where to begin? I have so many problems with this book that it's a challenge to put them together in a meaningful and organized fashion. Here's my best shot. First, this book is supposedly intended to be a science book. However, there is not a single footnote in the entire text. There are notes at the end of the book (endnotes), but they are detached from the exact references, only listing the page to which they refer. What is the sense of this? I've never seen a book that does that before. It makes no sense. It's inefficient, inexact, and serves no one. Second, the book varies between third person and first person descriptions. Furthermore, the authors use the first person singular, despite the fact that both Schwartz and Begley are clearly listed as coauthors. Poor taste. I assume Schwartz is the lead author because he references his own work on Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, and because Begley's book Train Your Mind Change Your Brain has a different tone and style. Scientific writers, in good taste, generally refrain from the first person when writing, unless they can pull it off effectively. Schwartz (and Begley) cannot and should not try. Third, the topics and the style of writing are all over the map. Schwartz can't seem to make up his mind what should be the subject of his book, or for that matter even what kind of book he's trying to write. He wanders between trivial anecdotes of his attempts to be recognized by the medical community, blunt criticisms of the dogmatic medical community marginalizing important research on neuroplasticity, long winded explanations of research and legal battles over the Silver Spring monkeys, philosophical perspectives on free will and determinism haphazardly tossed in (without being clearly or meaningfully applied to the issues of the book), and, of course, some quantum physics for good measure. You would think it would be rather difficult to clearly and succinctly tie all these topics together under a single heading; apparently it is, and the task was well beyond the skills of the author. Schwartz doesn't commit himself to exploring any of these issues, and settles for literary name-dropping. Finally, the cover. The title is The Mind & The Brain: Neuroplasticity and the Power of Mental Force. The name sounds impressive, and the cover art looks like a medical illustration of the brain (the scalp with the skin peeled back. This looks like an illustration of the meninges, not the ""brain"" proper (not cortex or brain stem), which makes an odd choice for the cover art. Jeffrey M. Schwartz, M.D., and Sharon Begley are listed as the authors; however, the book is written mostly in the first person singular (""I"") not the first person plural (""we""), which leads me to believe that Schwartz wrote this mostly himself and Begley was tacked on. What exactly was Begley's contribution? Maybe not important, but certainly not clear and certainly poor taste; the first person is generally discouraged from scientific writing, and this book is fine example why. George Gilder provides a one-line review for the cover: ""Stirring... a daring rescue of the concept of the free human will."" This is, of course, to attract attention to the book as an argument for the concept of free will, written in casual pop science language. I bring up all these points because together they all suggest that this is a book aimed at a general audience without much familiarity with neuropsychology or philosophy, but who are concerned and probably anxious about their own freedom and inner conflicts. Basically it's good marketing. "
1,0060988479,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3181491-ella,1,"Badly written, much like my original review. I'm changing it b/c the comments reflect that I did not explain myself well AT ALL. Firstly, I like these authors usually. Secondly, I do believe strongly in neuroplasticity. I work in TBI (traumatic brain injury) and trauma - if I didn't believe in neuroplasticity, I'd have to change fields. Somehow I didn't make that clear. My issue with this book is not that I don't somehow ""believe in"" neuroplasticity, but that I do not think the authors were very clear nor did they do anyone a service by adding a bunch of stuff about ""mental force"" in the early 2000s when they wrote/published this. Everything below is exactly as it was originally (in 2010, when I joined GR, years after reading this book, all of which is out of date now...) except that I've added some underlining, italics, bold & the note at the end. I have tried to pretend it's 2002 as I'm adding these things until the note:To the author ""mental force"" (some of you may have heard this same idea called ""soul"" or ""mind"" or ""free will"" or countless other things people create when we haven't figured it out just yet) is bigger than the possibilities created by the plasticity of our wonderful brains. The authors ignore the very plasticity they mention in their title in favor of their term ""mental force."" There is power in exercising our brains. When we think -- positively or negatively, when we act purposefully or automatically, when we USE our brains, they do -- in fact -- change (add: This is called neuroplasticity or just plain old plasticity.) Ask anyone who has ever had any sort of brain injury. Do it repeatedly and you can even learn things! You can feel differently by thinking differently -- ask your favorite cognitive psychologist. This is nothing new. It's wrapped up in a bow w/ some added nonsense filling the package, but [that added nonsense] is just plain wrong. 
I believe that the actual process works, but I don't believe for a minute that the authors explain why.
NB: I read this book when it was released in the early aughts. It is now 2020, and maybe I should just delete this entire review and the book from my shelves, but I'd rather note that this book is out of date, was written early in the hoopla of neuroplasticity long before now, and that reading it is probably not of value to anyone who wants to be up-to-date or even well-informed on neuroplasticity. Always check the dates on science books - especially popular ones, because the books that are cutting edge right now are not going to be cutting edge (and may be unsupported) in just a few years. "
2,0060988479,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1858836-heather,5,"This book is extremely informative in many aspects of the physical and mental processes of the brain and mind. Although Dr. Schwartz emphasized that the intent of his experiments, understandings and knowledge was to understand obsessive-compulsive disorder in the brain, he includes examples of experiments and findings that reach other scopes of psychology and neurology. Dr. Schwartz devotes a chapter to the basic explanation of the literal topography of the brain itself, touching on different processes of various areas. This was helpful to understand what exactly, can be changed and how it is changed through neuroplasticity. And through neuroplasticity and the power of mental force, the mind, or attention, or awareness can literally CHANGE the physiology of the brain structure itself. In his words, mental force is ""directed, willed mental activity can clearly and systematically alter brain function; that the exertion of willful effort generates a physical force that has the power to change how the brain works and even its physical structure.""Meditation is quickly becoming more popular in today's society. In my own life, I have been encouraged to learn 'mindful meditation' to guide me through the stress of life. When Dr. Schwartz touches on the Buddhist 'bare awareness' concept of meditation, I found an increased understanding to how I may learn to acknowledge feelings, sensations, sounds, perceptions, etc without letting them affect me. I observe them as an outsider, one standing on the sidelines looking upon my own thoughts and feelings without engaging in them. In the chapter Network Remodeling, Dr. Schwartz asks a question that particularly piqued my interest. ""How, then, to apply mindfulness to depression?"". This is one state to which I fall victim too easily--depression. He explains three ways to address this, but the third option impressed me the most. Speaking of 'mindful experience/being ""in this way of thinking about your emotions, you sense feelings, sensations, and thoughts from the perspective of the Impartial Spectator. You regard your thoughts and feelings as passing, ephemeral ""mental events"" rather than as accurate reflections of reality. Instead of reacting to negative thoughts and feelings as ""these are me,"" you come to regard them as ""events in the mind that can be considered and examined"". You recognize that thoughts are not facts...but are instead ""events that come and go through the mind"" pg 248The chapter on The Quantum Brain was difficult for me to grasp in that it was almost completely quantum physics. I was not particularly proficient at classic physics to say the least. Briefly, he explains that if we utilize only classic physics, or materialism, to define the brain/mind, it comes up short. It basically negates the existence of mind or will altogether. One problem with this, is if we don't actually have a will, then we can't take responsibility for our actions because they are only resulting from the neurological processes of the brain. We can see that this would have grave judicial implications. There is no right and wrong. i.e. I can steal my neighbor's car because my brain made me do it. Again, in the words of Dr. Schwartz ""I began lamenting the terrible social consequences of materialism...the moral condition of America...could be laid at the feet of nearly three centuries of materialist ascendance. The reigning belief that the thoughts we think and the choices we make reflect the deterministic workings of neurons and, ultimately subatomic particles seemed to me to have subverted mankind's sense of morality. The view that people are mere machines and that the mind is just another (not particularly special) manifestation of a clockwork physical universe had infiltrated all our thinking whether or not someone knew a synapse from an axon.""pg 257-258Quantum mechanics is based on observation. ""Integral to quantum physics is the fundamental role played by the observer in choosing which of the plenitude of possible realities will leave the realm of the possible and become actual""...""there is no 'is' until an observer makes an observation"" pg 263 He describes the double-slit experiment and the collapse of the wave function in observation: ""Before the observation, the system had a range of possibilities, afterward, it has a single actuality. This is the infamous collapse of the wave function"" pg 269I won't dwell much more on the actual physics explained in this chapter, though Dr. Schwartz does a fabulous job of helping a lay person like me attempt and partially succeed in understanding. My main interest was how all of this physics relates to the mind and brain. His last two chapters are dedicated to free will and to attention. We actually have the will, and ability to experience our own thoughts. These thoughts can be turned into actions, whether it be sensations, reactions to an event, etc. This is completely up to our choices. Before we act, there is a wave of possibilities...we can be angry, we can be hurt, we may cry...if we choose to. We can focus our attention on what we choose to experience. Once we continually choose to think a certain way, it becomes easier and with continual willful attention paid to the chosen thought or experience, the actual physiology of our brain will change. I have heard people say that I can choose to be happy. Well, this is actually true! Although in isolated instances it can be extremely difficult, overall with practice in choosing happiness it will become almost second-nature. After reading this book and learning so much more about how the brain and the mind works for me, I will choose to practice mindfulness, I will choose to acknowledge then release the negative thoughts that result in depression, I will choose to be happier. I feel more in control of my life, in myself. Note: Dr. Jeffrey M. Schwartz will be visiting my city as a guest speaker at the Surgical-Medical Society Conference in May 2014 and I have been honored with this opportunity to hear his wisdom once again."
3,0060988479,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23395276-artur-olczyk,1,"Truthfully, I didn't have intention of writing a review of this book but considering there's something that might safely be called a debate between the book's apologists on the one side and its adversaries on the other side, I thought I might as well write the review. What follows, however, is just a simple advantages/disadvantages recapitulation of the book's claims and its internal structure.Disadvantages(1) With all due respect to Schwartz's treating of OCD patients and to the patients themselves, it's a rather mild mental condition (in terms of its dangerousness to the patient and his environment, and the social impact on the patient) (Seligman et al., 2002), as compared to other mental conditions, such as psychopathy with its instrumental and reactive aggression (Blair, 2006), Autism Spectrum Disorder with its non-understanding of emphatical emotions and severe social apprehension (Baron-Cohen, 1995, 2004, 2013), or schizophrenia with its (plausible) delusions and mental disintegration (Liberman, 2008). The author extrapolates his treatment of the OCD patients and their improvement, and proclaims that the power of attention, and thus the power of mind, reshapes neural circuitry and cortical maps. There are two things fundamentally wrong with his claim. First, it doesn't take the said reshaping (how would it even look like?) to mitigate the OCD symptoms. Through repetitive exercises, the brain can start functioning more adequately (but it doesn't change its internal structure) (Churchland P.S., 1986; Damásio, 1995). Second, extrapolating data (and drawing conclusions from it) is something any scientist should be cautious about due to each mental condition's different causes, epidemiology and management, not to mention healthy population's yet another, individual case.(2a) Mind/body (mind-brain) dualism is a concept that deserves a very careful scrutiny. If true, that is, if the mind and body were distinct and separable entities, any damage to the brain wouldn't affect the mind (which, needless to say, is non-physical). The reality is quite the opposite. Take these two cases as points of reference and further interest. Famously described (Damásio, 2005; Blair, 2006; Stanovich, 2009; Baron-Cohen, 2011) Phineas Gage, who suffered an accident in which an iron rod punctured through his head and damaged much of his brain's left frontal lobe, exhibited mental changes in his behavior after the accident. Another example is of a man, who, due to growing tumors in his brain, exhibited paedophilic tendencies, which vanished after the surgical removal of the tumors (Eagleman, 2015). If the mind-body dualism was true, such physical conditions wouldn't transcend the non-physical nature of the mind.(2b) Another case against the proposed dualism derives from a biological instance of human development. Considering that we begin our existence as purely physical entities and since nothing outside of the physical domain is added later on in the course of our development, then, all in all, we must end up being fully developed physical beings.(2c) Logic (and Occam's razor) dictates that if a phenomenon can be explained by existing referential categories, then adding other categories can be considered superfluous.(3) Repetitive mentions of quantum physics doesn't make a book more scientific. It's been shown that making references to physics or mathematics (in reality, superficially or needlessly) gives a semblance of scholarship (Sokal and Bricmont, 1999) but the same quantum physics produces arguments against Schwartz's claims: any manifestation of a non-physical mind on the brain would entail the violation of physical laws, such as the conservation of energy, since some external source of energy would be responsible for the interaction between the non-physical and the physical.(4) The Mind and the Brain doesn't observe established methodological standards for writing a book/an article. That a scientist considers himself a maverick and tries to unravel some mysteries and semi-revelatory truths before our eyes, doesn't mean he doesn't have to follow certain creeds of scientific research, especially taking into account that he draws from and writes about multiple fields of human knowledge, such as psychology, sensu largo neuroscience, philosophy, ethics and so forth. There are, to be perfectly fair to Schwartz, endnotes at the end of the book, but the phrases there only vaguely refer to certain articles/books he draws his assertions from. If I were to be mean, I'd say Schwartz's blunt references are exactly meant to cause confusion and create ambiguity. Insofar as proper references, which are nowhere to be found in the book, psychology books, for instance, follow methodological standards of putting their sources in brackets right behind a sentence they refer to, e.g. (Schwartz, 2002). Other books (legal, for example, which I'm most familiar with) contain footnotes that make a reference to a particular page of a particular book/article. In this regard, Schwartz's standards are unique, to say the least. There's also an oddity of writing in singular form, which, normally, isn't necessarily desirable, but I'll just blame it on Bagley's apparent minute input; that's also why I refer to the book as Schwartz's only (in this, I just follow his steps).Advantages(1) There are other books out there."
4,0060988479,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3226609-the-angry-lawn-gnome,3,"Take one good, or even very good book. Stick it in a blender with an awful one and set to puree. Well, okay, I'm speaking metaphorically here, so don't do that. But that at least gives an idea of what I thought of this one. The sections of the book related to the author's work with OCD sufferers, his descriptions of similar work on those with Tourette's Syndrome and major depression and his basic narrative of discoveries related to the brain and what has come to be believed related to its flexibility were all superb. The man knows his stuff, knows lots of people who know their stuff and knows how to communicate it all to a general audience, though I must admit I he did lose me for a time in his section on Quantum Mechanics. Unfortunately, that ain't all there is here. And that other stuff is a train wreck, mostl flowing from what I can only call a mission of some sort to disprove Materialism, both scientific and philosophical. First, makes no bones about the fact that what he has learned from Swami Dorito Guacamolejam (or whoever) is at least part of the reason behind this, revealing a rather unfortunate bias. Second, there's even a villain of the piece: Behaviorism. Not that I'm any fan of it, but, eh, he ain't Galileo and they ain't the Inquisition, so his over the top stuff here is just silly. And as best I can tell, his conclusions don't follow from his facts: in other words, Materialism is not disproven. Perhaps in need of modification, but not disproven.I was also more than a tad irritated at his unwillingness to give a straightforward definition of the term ""Mind."" It is in the title, after all. But while there are lengthy discussions of brain physiology and function, the Mind seems to pop in and out of the book, usually only after some experiment or other is described that appears to debunk the commonly held materialist theory of XYZ. He also switches to the term ""Will"" for a while, which is either the same as the mind, a part of the mind or something else that falls outside materialist theory and has little or nothing to do with the mind (or brain), it really isn't clear."
5,0060988479,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"This is an excellent book. I learned how people with severe conditions can sometimes overcome the debilitating effects of stroke, OCD, and so on.Toward the end of the book, the author describes how quantum mechanics may be a key component to volition and free will. But, I am not completely convinced of the connection with quantum mechanics. I understand how the act of observation of an atom can resolve its (previously probabilistic) state. And the analogy between ""observation"" and ""attention"" is striking. But doesn't this just beg the question, what is the mechanism for the mind/brain to show attention to something? "
6,0060988479,http://goodreads.com/user/show/666282-nick,5,"Jeffrey Schwartz has written an impassioned argument for the neuroplasticity of the brain, based on his work with OCD patients and his practice of Buddhism. I have enormous admiration for anyone who brings together Eastern and Western ideas with skill and thoughtfulness, as Schwartz has done here, but when the work creates a genuine breakthrough in treating mental illness, then the originator deserves the highest possible praise. Millions of people suffer tragically from OCD, and the desensitization work of behavioral therapists often borders on the cruel -- and it's only partly effective. Drugs have huge limitations and of course side effects. So Schwartz has given humanity a gift by figuring out how to use the Buddhist concept of mindfulness to help people recognize and ultimately reject OCD thoughts, while at the same time making a larger argument about the plasticity of the brain, and the connection between mind and brain. A path-breaking work. "
7,0060988479,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7839967-mohammed-al-humaikani,5,"Wonderfully written by a highly experienced researcher. Revolutionary thoughts on neuroplasticity that are yet to be fully accepted by the scientific community. The wonderful blend of buddhist philosophy with deep knowledge of neuroscience is what has been established here. The pragmatic four step concept with the critical idea of mental force is highly applicable and strongly scientific to overcome habits that one is willing to change. A beautiful chapter on Free Will and Free Won't that presents wonderful ideas that were highly convincing. His great collaboration with Henry Stapp, the quantum physicist, and their reflections on the ideas of William James is spectacular. A book I highly recommend."
8,0060988479,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7246660-audra,4,"I quite enjoyed this book and its exploration of the relationship between mind, brain and quantum mechanics. It highlights the importance of attention and concentration in, for instance, acquiring a new skill or remapping faulty brain patterns. I would recommend this book as a sequel to ""The Brain that Changes Itself""; it is more technical than the former book and delves deeper into brain structure. I wish that the author had dwelled more on how meditation and buddhism can help in overcoming mental health issues and how it can help rewire our plastic brains. Though in the beginning it sounded as though it would focus more on meditation, there was only a brief overview of this near the end. At times, I also found the book to be a little long winded and repetitive; the author, obviously trying to revolutionize a field and make his argument as strong as possible, quotes supporting data and findings at great length. As a reader, this can get a little tedious. What I did enjoy was the history the author provides of past scientific discoveries and the worldview of materialism that has dominated science -- until now, that is, when mind-brain discoveries are shifting our understanding of the world.For anyone interested in the brain, and more particularly in mind-brain issues, this is a great read."
9,0060988479,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6006000-melanie,2,"This book is all over the place. The ideas are very intriguing and worth thinking about, but the execution is very uneven in quality. Some chapters (such as the one on Schwartz' own OCD-research) are to-the-point and interesting, others (like the last few) bring up fascinating ideas, but do not manage to convince me on either their grounds, workings or implications, while yet others are tangential to the subject at best and very distracting (such as the Silver Spring monkeys chapter).The introduction of quantum mechanics into the neurosciences was cool and has a lot of potential, but the author was not well versed enough in the topic to truly take me in with his arguments. And while I am generally not averse to first-person narration in academic settings, I found it not at all well done in this book. Most of it was either unnecessary or greatly annoying. I think I would have rather read this book in the form of a couple of 30-page, well-edited articles instead of a padded 400-page book."
10,0060988479,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19333702-bethany,4,"This book was fascinating and hopeful. I read the author's other book ""You are Not Your Brain"" and found the tone too cheesy and pop-self-helpish. It also left me with a question about the difference between the mind and the brain. When I found this title, it seemed it would answer my question--and it did. The tone of this book is much more academic, though still intended for lay people. It wanders through the history of experiments that have led neuroscientists to their current understanding of neuroplasticity. It delves into the philosophical debate over the nature of the brain vs. the mind. It ends up in a discussion of quantum physics and how that creates a scientific basis for there being a mind independent of the brain, capable of acting on the brain. All of this has implications for treating OCD and other disorders such as depression and anxiety that are for hopeful."
11,0060988479,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21680009-seth,4,"Schwartz achieves tremendous success in detailing the concept of neuroplasticity and how the mind can act as a ""force"" to effect lasting neurological changes. This empowers the reader as much (and probably more) than any self-help book out there, since he extensively backs his ideas with research article after research article. The brain has the capacity to change itself via attention and conscious effort, effectively challenging the reader to, at the risking of sounding trite, be the change she wishes to see. At the heart of this practice lies the idea of mindfulness. Recognizing one's impulses when they arise as an objective spectator, i.e. exhibiting ""bare"" attention to one's thoughts and desires and considering them nonjudgmentally, forms the foundation of concerted volition. Only by recognizing one's problematic or intrusive impulses/desires can she then shift her focus and attend to more desirable and productive behaviors.However, there was perhaps too much buildup for how little payoff was delivered in the closing chapters. Schwartz's foray of the quantum side of the brain, I think, should have been a more essential feature of this book, given his introduction, but it ends up coming out as a hastily scrawled footnote supposedly solidifying his theories of neuroplasticity. He fails to properly reify this soiree with sufficient precision, resulting in a disappointingly effete exploration of a quantum basis for the mind-brain interface that's more wishful and speculative than convincing and rigorous. Despite the ineffectual quantum sojourn, Schwartz lays his arguments out effortlessly with engaging prose and amusing anecdotes, not to mention elucidating an important moment in the history of animal rights as they pertain to science. Ultimately, after giving it due consideration, I still disagree with his thesis of free will being resurrected by this ""new"" science of volitional neuroplasticity. I maintain it's just as likely that volitional effort arose via evolutionary processes concomitant with the exquisite development of our prefrontal cortices (and hence the executive functions contained therein) which allowed the brain a means of inspecting and subsequently altering its own behavior as a way of adapting to novel environments and stimuli. "
12,0060988479,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42261661-lucas-g,3,"This book took me way longer to finish than is reasonable. That may have contributed to my frustration. But the book is frustrating for many legitimate reasons. It claims to be a book about how the mind, an immaterial substance, influences the brain, a physical substance. But it takes almost 200 pages before the authors really get to that point. Before that, it is just a series of reflections on the history of neuroplasticity research. Also, there are no citations so the curious reader can't easily look deeper when something of interest comes up. While much of the history is interesting, it is tangential to the point. For example, dozens of pages are filled with discussions of legal battles surrounding testing on moneys. Interesting. But not what the readers want. With that said, the key insight of the book is great. Schwartz's research demonstrates how mental activity can cause physical changes in the brain. This has been seen in Schwartz's OCD patients who were able to refrain from giving into compulsions and refocus their thoughts elsewhere, which ultimately created new neural pathways and eliminated the compulsions. If Schwartz is correct, his research deals a serious blow to materialism. Schwartz goes into weird territory, however, when he jumps head first into quantum mechanics. His position is that quantum mechanics, specifically the Quantum Zeno Effect, provides the physical mechanism for the mind interacting with the brain. The proposal is interesting, if not a bit weird. Overall, if you're interested in philosophy of mind or neuroscience, you probably need to read this book. But be judicious. Not all the history is necessary, so perhaps skim over that information"
13,0060988479,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8811289-correen,5,"It kept my attention, introduced me to new ways of thinking (at least for me) and pulled together disciplines in ways I would not have considered, e.g., psychiatry, philosophy and quantum physics.He even relates quantum physics to OCD disorders.I plan to read the book again and am recommending to my more scientifically oriented friends."
14,0060988479,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2825982-marc-dorval,5,"I really enjoyed this book as an additional introduction to neuroplasticity. Throw in some philosophy, quantum physics, and some fascinating history and you have a book that's educational and interesting at the same time."
15,0060988479,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11461255-steve,5,"If you would like to know more about the human brain, I highly recommend this book. I read it a number of years ago after hearing the author interviewed and I have remembered it ever since. Jeffrey M. Schwartz, MD, is a research psychiatrist at UCLA. His descriptions of how the brain is formed will astound you! The stories of how nerves are reclaimed and reused (in the event of a limb amputation, for example) are amazing. Did you know that violinists have a much larger portion of their brain devoted to their fingers? Much of the book is based upon experiments using PET (positron emission tomography) which allows the researchers to see what is occurring chemically in the brain at the same time that the patient is describing it. Ironically, Schwartz himself believes that there is much more to the conscious mind than simply the physical wiring. He uses the Buddhist notion of ""mindfulness"" in explaining what seems to be there and his interpretation I found pretty convincing. He also demonstrates that the idea that our brain is largely complete in youth and rigid after that is untrue and the adaptability of the brain (neuroplasticity) is available throughout our lives. Very hopeful and optimistic though some of the animal experiments may make some people squirm."
16,0060988479,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7511563-duchess-nimue,5,"The Mind and The Brain is a book that discusses how those two are separate. It talks how The Mind is more then chemical reactions in The Brain, and how the science grew to the the understanding of this.Neuroplasticity is defined as an ability of neurons to create new links between nerves, which can happen with the use of mental force. Author places a substantial importance on attention, for without it, our successes would be much smaller.Dr. Schwartz talks about his technique for treating people with OCD, and how similar techniques, developed by other like-minded people, turned up to have a great track record in treating people that suffered a stroke, or people with dyslexia, or depression. More than talking about those techniques, Schwartz talks about how people got to those ideas, he takes us on a ride through the history of neuroscientific science, it's scientific research, and introduces us to quantum physics.

And then I ended up with a little bit of this:So, yes. Super interesting read if you'd like to understand why and how attention or the ""mental force"" of your mind can actually change the brain's structure."

A seemingly 'easy' philosophical issue: is there a duality between mind and brain doesn't seem so simple to neuroscientist. Do mental forces affect the brain by altering wave functions causing us to act differently? The authors exhaustively explore this and other issues as it pertains to amputees, individuals with brain traumas as well as OCD patients.

Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to form new neural connections. I’ve become interested in this topic as a way to cope with migraine but also as a way to fight brain diseases (eg Alzheimer, dementia) because the ability to make new brain connections and create new circuitry is one way to not be stuck when old wiring breaks down.Through the author’s work with OCD patients, he found that self-directed neuroplasticity is real, and it takes a lot of effort (mental force). This book takes us on his personal journey as he tries to find the science behind why this works and the people he met along the way. I enjoyed reading about the success of helping dyslexic children, who knew it would stem from a hearing issue??This book provided background to the different scientific theories throughout history, but I can’t recall any of the scientist names nor their theories now, only in vague terms of materialism, behaviourism...philosophy and free will, it’s hard to not cover these areas when talking about the mind and the brain. I’ll have to research these another time. There were very in-depth chapters in regards to the mechanics of the brain itself. Again, very interesting, but challenging to keep up at times, having had only studied first year psych in university. I was listening to this at x1.5 speed, but slowed it down to x1.25 when it started talking about quantum physics and quantum mechanics. Over. My. Head. The areas that interested me the most was the practical applications to help those who suffer from OCD, depression, dyslexia, Tourettes and stroke. I found myself sharing these anecdotes with my husband. It was interesting to find out that the Silver Spring Monkeys experiment brought about PETA.The anecdote of the concert pianist who practiced for hours a day and lost the ability to play the piano was fascinating. The concept that neurons that fire together, wire together, meant that her excessive piano playing resulted in her brain grouping fingers together, making her unable to play singular notes. She was able to re-train her brain to separate the sensory input for each finger.Key take-aways* Cells that fire together, wire together.* ATTENTION is important for neuroplasticity.* Internal mental states can shape the structure and hence the function of the brain.* Areas you dedicate attention to in your life, take up a greater portion of your brain.* Intention governs attention.* Exercise helps with the ability to acquire memory (due to increased blood flow to the brain).* Thoughts are not facts  important for those with suffering from OCD, anxiety, depression"

I have mixed feelings with this book, as it started off as one of those which has potential to be a good book, but ended up being the one which I had to stop before the last chapter. The science what the authors present is questionable, and the counterarguments what they line up are weak. One example:""...this intervening thing called 'the feeling of mental effort', they might argue, is mere side effect with no casual power of its own. But this sort of reasoning is inconsistent with evolutionary theory. The felt experience of willful effort would have no survival value if it didn't actually do something...""Well, that is just simple not true. Consciousness just as easily be a spandrel (which has no value but as a consequence of the evolution of different things.

Supposing that the 'mind' or 'soul' has anything to do with the physical world also sounds a bit spooky and unproven. The OCD example what they discuss in the book just as well can be explained with behaviorism or neuroplasticity induced by other brain areas being active. Why? Because they are told to do so. No mentioning that anyone has ever done it without instruction or anything like that. I also look at the content with a suspicion eye, as the authors are mentioned as being religious and somehow the conclusion tries to brings back a non material soul into the neuroscience. On the other hand though, I learnt a lot about OCD and Tourette's and their clinical treatment, and I personally liked the detour to the Silver Spring Monkeys (even though it didn't fit as much as the authors might have thought).

He seems like a bit of a hippy and believes mindfulness from the Buddha doctrine offered a radically new approach to OCD treatment. This led to a regimen called the ""Four Steps"". Relabel, Reattribute, Refocus and Revalue. Basically a way to distract your brain with focusing your attention on better behaviors. At the time (late 80's) the approach to treat OCD was abrasive and just plain cruel. For example, if you were a person who needs to wash your hands every ten minutes they would ask you wipe your hands all over a public toilet seat to ""help"" overcome your fears. OKaaaay?! Allegedly they had a very high success rate. Dr. Schwartz believed the results were fake news! He knew there was a better way. As more research discovered the brain was more malleable than originally thought and Dr. Schwartz had to look into what was coined Neuroplasticity. He knew if the compulsive brain could be distracted with better behaviors then the brain could change itself mentally and down to the neuron level, physically. And he was right.

Whenever we give an order to our believer, the mind lives in its own separate world without overcoming the idea. Logic is two different aspects of mind. Sometimes we also think about what the conscious and subconscious mind have to do with each other, but this thinking is a contradiction. In spite of the failure of the conscious mind, our subconscious mind can repulse everything that the worldly attendants present before us. In reality, the mind has a different existence of its own, it is so powerful that it does not need to be ordered.Personally, I have realized this myself that the power of the mind is ready to overcome all challenges. A very good example of this is Persistence yoga. Based on mythological beliefs in our Indian culture, it is believed that cure of incurable diseases is also possible with the power of mind. Not only this, by persistence yoga we can also achieve what science today calls impossible. From this book also we get to know the strength of mind and mind.

What makes the book great is the depth to which he pushes the argument, the evidence he assembles to support it, and the clarity with which it's expressed.Also valuable is the discussion of neuroplasticity.

 A groundbreaking work of science that confirms, for the first time, the independent existence of the mind–and demonstrates the possibilities for human control over the workings of the brain.
Conventional science has long held the position that 'the mind' is merely an illusion, a side effect of electrochemical activity in the physical brain. Now in paperback, Dr Jeffrey Schwartz and Sharon Begley's groundbreaking work, The Mind and the Brain, argues exactly the opposite: that the mind has a life of its own.Dr Schwartz, a leading researcher in brain dysfunctions, and Wall Street Journal science columnist Sharon Begley demonstrate that the human mind is an independent entity that can shape and control the functioning of the physical brain. Their work has its basis in our emerging understanding of adult neuroplasticity–the brain's ability to be rewired not just in childhood, but throughout life, a trait only recently established by neuroscientists. 
Through decades of work treating patients with obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), Schwartz made an extraordinary finding: while following the therapy he developed, his patients were effecting significant and lasting changes in their own neural pathways. It was a scientific first: by actively focusing their attention away from negative behaviors and toward more positive ones, Schwartz's patients were using their minds to reshape their brains–and discovering a thrilling new dimension to the concept of neuroplasticity. 
The Mind and the Brain follows Schwartz as he investigates this newly discovered power, which he calls self–directed neuroplasticity or, more simply, mental force. It describes his work with noted physicist Henry Stapp and connects the concept of 'mental force' with the ancient practice of mindfulness in Buddhist tradition. And it points to potential new applications that could transform the treatment of almost every variety of neurological dysfunction, from dyslexia to stroke–and could lead to new strategies to help us harness our mental powers. Yet as wondrous as these implications are, perhaps even more important is the philosophical dimension of Schwartz's work. For the existence of mental force offers convincing scientific evidence of human free will, and thus of man's inherent capacity for moral choice. 
   From Publishers Weekly 
  Schwartz (A Return to Innocence), a UCLA psychiatrist and expert on treating patients with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), teams up with Begley, a Wall Street Journal science columnist, to explore the mind/brain dichotomy and to discuss the science behind new treatments being developed for a host of brain dysfunctions. Building on the work presented in Schwartz's first book, Brain Lock, the authors begin by demonstrating that OCD patients are capable of rechanneling compulsive urges into more socially acceptable activities and that, by doing so, they actually alter their brains' neuronal circuitry. By presenting a wide array of animal and human experiments, Schwartz and Begley show that similar neuroplasticity is possible in stroke victims, often leading to a return of function previously thought impossible. The medical results and treatments they summarize are exciting and deserve widespread attention. In a chapter entitled ""Free Will and Free Won't,"" the authors turn to the philosophical, examining the implications neuroplasticity might have on the differences between mind and brain; they also discourse on the existence of free will. Unfortunately, their integration of quantum mechanics and Buddhism into a search for a mechanism to explain the patterns scientists have been discovering is too superficial to fully engage readers. Nonetheless, a great deal in this book is sure to motivate discussion and more research.Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc. 
   From Booklist 
  Schwartz's undergraduate major was philosophy, and that interest as well as Buddhism has broadened his outlook and makes this book potentially attractive to more readers than those habitually interested in ""brain science."" Psychiatrist Schwartz pioneered the use of positron-emission tomography in studying obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The behaviorists' therapeutic use of the often-harsh exposure and prevention method with OCD struck Schwartz as brutal and unproductive. Searching for a new approach, he gradually developed the four-step method that he and science writer Begley thoroughly describe here. Employing the Buddhist idea of willful mindfulness, Schwartz and his colleagues enjoyed considerable research and clinical success. A long, informal collaboration with physicist Henry Stapp enabled Schwartz to overcome the problem of free will and moral action, and one of his major achievements was proving the neuroplasticity of the adult brain, thanks to which the formation of new transmission routes coincides with that of new neurons. Schwartz and Begley bring to life the thinking and work of many original investigators in a book that thoughtful readers will enjoy. William BeattyCopyright © American Library Association.

It contains a well developed analysis of the history of OCD, and stroke therapy and its relation to neuroplasticity. It could be written and understood very well with or without invoking a discussion of free will. The author then enters the realm of quantum mechanics. His ignorance in the field could be disregarded if he did not misrepresent the field so wildly. He tries to use quantum mechanics to propose the existence of a mind force which he has invented. It lacks any scientific rigor, he grasps at straws. I was disappointed because much of this book is well worth reading. I would have likely given the book 5 stars if he did not make such uneducated references to quantum theory."
45,0060988479,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30541335-jimmy-ele,5,"Nonwithstanding my lapse of attention ironically induced by this book at page 323 at the precise chapter entitled ""Attention Must Be Paid"" I have decided to give this book a 5 star rating. Once I mustered up the willpower and attended to the rest of the book using the power of Mental Force I was able to induce a change in the plasticity of my brain, and my boredom dissipated in the same way a photon's momentum would, should a person decide to try and pin down its position. Many controversial subjects dealing with the relationship between mind and matter as well as quantum physics are examined. Not only are these subjects examined, but Jeffrey backs up his statements with actual scientific experiments which give his proposal a sturdy backbone, and a sturdy backbone is definitely needed in order to withstand the sure barrage of materialistic sciences proponents blows. Some of the experimentation that had to go down in order for these findings to become known are of a very animal offensive nature, and a big part of the book is dedicated to explaining the details of the rise of PETA. The trial of the man responsible as well as his justifications are all treated in an objective manner showing both sides of the story. Long story short, I'm so glad I wasn't one of those Silver Spring Monkeys and I'm glad that even though the experimentation yielded positive results, there is an organization dedicated to protecting the rights of these creatures. Many people of the scientific community will probably dismiss this book as ""hokey"" ""new age"" stuff, and Jeffrey doesn't necessarily care as is evidenced by his constant quoting of the Buddah. However, being a person who loves to entertain different ideas no matter how ""hokey"" they may seem, I found this book to be very well researched and backed by substantial scientific evidence especially in the subject of Quantum Physics and OCD studies. I highly recommend it to all of my friends and would encourage anyone who has experienced a lack of will lately or the intrusion of unwanted thoughts to give it a read. Knowing that there is a problem is the first step and then willfully attending to that problem by the techniques elaborated upon in this book could help many people suffering from some of the diseases written about in this book."
46,0060988479,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5900498-michael-johnston,4,"I was fascinated by this book. From neurology to quantum physics to existential philosophy, the author covers enormous territory in pursuit of an interesting idea - that the mind exists as a force of nature independent of the the brain. Scientific determinists have long argued that the chemical and synapitic make-up of the brain determines who we are. That all of our behaviors and beliefs are essentially pre-determined by the chemical and synaptic make-up of the brain. Schwartz rebels against this deterministic view and produces a step-by-step refutation based on research in several scientific fields but most prominantly from his work with OCD patients in which he was successful in retraining the behavior and remapping the brain. He notes that research in the last 20 years has provided overwhelming evidence of brain neuroplasicty (essentially the ability of the brain to alter it's own physical make-up over time based on experience). Going a step further he higlights that concerted mental effort that has the ability to physically alter brain physiololgy. For example, there was an experiment conducted with two sets of volunteers in which one was told to repeatedly practice a smiple five finger piano exercise and the other was told to only think about practicing the same exercise. The result? Not only did the repeated practice rewire the motor cortex of the brain, but thinking about the exercise had the same degree of impact on cortical remapping. In other words, mental effort altered the physical make-up of the brain.Beyond traditional neuroanatomy, however, Schwartz also seeks in quantum mechanics an explanation for how something non-physical like the mind can affect something physical. While the correllation here seems less definitive, there is ample room for quantum mechanical explations to provide the basis for his general thesis. I admit that there were times, when his theories developed a neo-religious tone, that he sounded a little nutty. However, ultimately the book is a tour deforce of theory refuting the Cartesion divide between mind and brain. I strongly recommend it for those interested in physchology, neuroanatomy or existential philosophy."
47,0060988479,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26821349-john-hewlett,2,"On the whole I have to say this book sucked. I am willing to give credit where credit is due in that it offers a really good overview of the history surrounding the idea of neuroplasticity. It recounts the studies and experiments performed by the major players in what was by the end of the last century representative of a massive paradigm shift within the neuroscience and neurobiological communities - namely that adult brains are not immutable and cortical remapping in response to physiological insults (strokes, hemispherectomies, etc) is a fact rather than wishful thinking and covered the additional fact that the adult human brain does indeed form new neurons based on research by Fred Gage at the Salk Institute. But that's where my praise stops. In the mid-2000's I attended a lecture by Pasko Rakic, MD, PhD. Dorys McConnell Duberg Professor of Neuroscience and Professor of Neurology at Yale University. He was responsible for describing the proliferation of neural stem cells from the subventicular area of the human brain. It would be difficult to find a man with a more distinguished career in 20th century neuroscience - he is perhaps the biggest skeptics of adult neurogenesis meanfully contributing to repair etc. The ""Mind and the Brain"" ended up being in support of psuedoscience and a half cocked idea of reviving some form of cartesian dualism, thinly masked by scientific jargon that, not surprisingly involved the language of quantum mechanics. I found the mechanisms discussed for making the case for ""self-directed change"" and ""free-will"" unconvincing at the very best. It wasn't science, it was philosophy, a respectable discipline in its own right but conjecture shouldn't be passed off as legitimate science and here we are well over a decade following the publication of this book, and the ideas put forth in the last three chapters have not born much fruit. Everything was going fine until about chapter 8 when Schwartz decides to go off the rails on a crazy train, hard."

The fact that Schwartz has signed the Discovery Institute's ""A Scientific Dissent from Darwinism"" hasn't really impeded my ability to listen to him with an impartial ear. BUT, I'm thus far unconvinced by the solidity of his central theses or original ideas, which attempt to argue for mind/brain dualism and free-will (which, btw, is the notion of free-will dependant on belief in ""mind"" as separate entity from brain?) and which from what I can tell so far are:1. Because he's treated OCD patients successfully by a combo of behavior and thinking changes (i.e. telling patients to think differently about what's happening when they get the urge to do the bad behavior) where strict behavioralists have failed (i.e. just force person not to do behavior and they'll eventually form new habits) there must be something called ""mind,"" i.e. something other than a physical brain state that is having a causal effect on brain state and behavior.Seems like a jump to me without really explaining how this proves the existence of ""mind."" Like - who can say that the brain itself just underwent random changes and mind is still just a shadow of the brain changes and not really its own thing? 2. Because experiences change the brain, i.e. neuroplasticity exists, so does ""mind"" ... he hasn't actually gotten to this argument yet where I am in the book but I think he's heading there, and while there was a time when I jumped to this conclusion myself, I can now see how naive it is. Just because the brain changes based on interaction with the environment has nothing to do with whether mind or free will exist. I think..."

Personally it was quite a pleasure to hear Schwartz opposing the materialistic, deterministic and behaviorist view point which are still orthodoxy in the cult of scientific naturalism. But yeah, a lot of the book is the history of brain science and how a couple of folks accidentally stumbled upon how neuroplasticity still happens in the adult brain. Now what is amazing is how these findings utterly enraged the scientific community, for assumptions didn't allow for any changes in the brain. it seems way to much of the scientific community takes the ""To hell with truth! Don't confuse me with the facts, I have my mind made up!"" stance, for they fought against it, like scientist today oppose intelligent design. This just confirmed to me all the more that the common talk about the scientific community being so open minded and always pursuing truth no matter where it leads, is a bunch of B.S. the the discovery of Neuroplasticity and the power of mental force has brought so much good to the world, but those who proposed it to begin with were practically crucified. Whats more it is interesting that the ones who stumbled upon it were not educated by the current paradigm, so they were actually open to the scientific findings from their experiments.

The descriptions of psychology are interesting and the narrative he creates out of our intellectual movement from a kind of behavioralist rigid idea of the brain to our contemporary understanding both of neuroplasticity and the mind are compelling. At the same time, I found the idea of using quantum physics to be productive, though not in the way Schwartz intended. He makes a good argument for a non-deterministic view of the brain (contrary to, say, Daniel Dennett) based on the simple nondeterministic view of the universe. But then he shifts into a kind of ""dualism post the discovery of Buddhism in the West"" that never properly explains, for example, WHY the idea of the mind as emergent is impossible. His insistence on the mind as such and on keeping the Cartesian boundaries he claims to knock down was just unsatisfying, more so because the idea of quantum indeterminacy as the answer to free Will was actually really cool. Long story short, he mistakes the ideology with which he makes sense of the phenomenological world as an accurate explanation for those experiences, but fails to provide enough evidence for this reader, at least, to believe that said ideology is a response to the data rather than to the author's own theology.

As we think and direct our thoughts we can change the brain, thus plasticity.A lot of physics as well and neurology. Briefly and in my feeble reaction as the brain is falling into its wonted custom of chasing compulsions to therapeutically wash hands many times to satisfy our thoughts we can redirect our thinking to do gardening (his example) so that the brain nerve networkredirects and changes neural connections (with more thoughts of doing A the brain gets tuned to the thought and the wiring in favor of doing A so doing A thoughts are reinforced.), i. e with more use those nerves get more emphatically wired. The brain . . . the organ through which the ind finds expression and through which it acts in the world. p. 365Mind we now see, has the power to alter biological matter s\ignificantly; that three pound lump of gelatinous ooze within our skull is truly the mind's brain. p 369. . . Wm. James recognized the array of things we can attend to (so if we are thinking about how nice it would be to wash our hands compulsively, we aren't [can't attend] thinking about gardening. . . p. 369Volitional effort is effort of attention per James. p 370It is the life we lead that creates the brain we have. p.373"

It discuses, neuroplasticity, most specifically the use of directed thinking to change the chemical structure of the brain. Dr. Schwartz goes into detail his Four Steps method for treatment of OCD, which pulls heavily from Buddhist meditation. This book was very informational, with a strong emphasis on the specific science involved, but was not jargon-heavy, and could be followed by an interested reader. It gives great background on the history and development of Neuroscience. It is also quite broad, touching on topics from Buddhism, Philosophy, Quantum Physics, learning disorders, the beginnings of PETA and the first scientist ever charged with animal cruelty. As I said, the scope of the book is vast. Dr. Schwartz comes down quite hard on the scientific community and materlism, as pertains to science in particular, as the a fundamental problem in modern society.Neuroplasticity itself is a relatively new idea in the science community, and one that isn't always embraced, but Schwartz does well to explain the details and background of this fascinating development. The ramifications of neuroplasticity are vast, and will not be fully understood for quite some time. "
54,0060988479,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1448125-jim,4,"The flaws in this book are many. The primary author, Schwartz, is self-obsessed, whether describing his own research or simply describing his Mercedes and land holdings. He also wanders off topic for most of a chapter, recounting the controversy with PETA about the treatment of lab monkeys (not the point of the book, but it is an interesting chapter). He makes up misleading new terminology (like “mental force”), and summarizes decades of physics far less effectively than many who have popularized physics before him. He attempts to unite neuroplasticity research, quantum mechanics, the philosophy of William James, and the teachings of Buddhism and his efforts not surprisingly are doomed to disappoint experts in each of these fields, yet, in the end, I admired the effort. The main point of the book, to describe current research in brain plasticity and to demonstrate that the practice of mindfulness to treat illness, is both fascinating and immediately useful. If you just want to read about mindfulness practice, it might be easier to just read Pema Chodron or Thich Nhat Hanh. But if you think that those practices don't apply to treating stroke victims, dyslexia, OCD and other mental illnesses, or, even just tinnitus, this book may convince you otherwise. "
55,0060988479,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26211610-tim-jin,3,"While interesting and fascinating, ""The Mind and the Brain"" was just hard to digest because it was written in a way to be very technical and you need the necessary vocabulary to understand the authors. It's almost too technical for someone to pickup from the coffee table and read. You might take a glance and put it down because it might not interest you unless you are a brain surgeon or want to know more about OCD and how it affects the brain. I just wished that the authors would had gone more in depth and studied more on physical disabilities, such as Cerebral Palsy and the brain. Cerebral Palsy happens when there is a lack of oxygen to the brain and damaged that portion. I have CP and my brain allows me to type with my feet, as I write this review, but other people with the same disability doesn't have the same abilities like myself. I hope that some day, these authors will do a study on disabilities and the brain and publish their findings. The authors covered almost everything that is possible on this human organ that is so hard to understand, but they left out involuntary motor skills that is caused by trauma to the brain."
56,0060988479,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11579452-smorgan,2,"A moderately interesting book about the neurophysiological changes that accompany psychiatric treatment for OCD, combined with a ghastly and absolutely illogical appeal to quantum physics for the existence of free will.I read this shortly after having read. 'The Brain that Changes Itself'. In some ways, I preferred parts of this book because rather than being based on single case studies, this book seemed to present summaries of results from larger studies. Thus, I expect the more evidence-supported claims in this book will hold up better than those in Doige'a book. Changes in activity in the frontal regions of the brain through successful treatment of OCD is really interesting. However, to claim from ""successful psychiatric treatment changes brain function"" that ""free will exists"" is logically flawed (at least in the way the arguments are made in this book, such as they are).Any successful treatment of any psychiatric disorder necessarily entails change to brain function: that is where behavior comes from (even if you include secondary effects of hormonal systems elsewhere in the body)."
57,0060988479,http://goodreads.com/user/show/638423-landin,4,"Great book. Didnt give it 5 stars for 2 reasons 1. it is unnecessarily cerebral and difficult to get through. Author is too wordy and wont connect to most people and even some with a general understanding of psychology or science. It's that nerdy. 2. It lacked wholeness. For something with such a scientific tone it ended up as being nearly stream of conciousness. The original argument and original study never came full circle. Despite these things, it was right up MY alley. Simply, I am PERSONALLY interested in this stuff. It also supported things I have long suspected as true, it touched on other topics that interest me and as a result steered me into the next direction. The most important thing was that it made me think, and that I can take away something from it, and it was the catalyst to my next pursuit. To be able to say that about any experience, book, movie, song, etc. is rare in a lifetime. 5 stars on that front, i just wish the author would have made it a little more universally readable."
58,0060988479,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2511977-mark-derderian,4,"Contains a good introductory overview of the history of the philosophy of mind and some related contemporary issues in philosophy as well as some interesting speculative explorations of the relationship of theoretical physics to consciousness to brain structure. Since it is written by a psychiatrist with an obvious interest in the actual functioning of human beings and a knowledge of brain anatomy and physiology that adds to its scope beyond the more theoretical issues involved. However, I think most professional philosophers would find the book a little crude and naive and most psychiatrists would not find the arguments for changing the entire framework of psychology compelling. I enjoyed the book because of its emphasis on the brain's structure and the idea of neuroplasticity, of ideas and beliefs and changes in consciousness as such changing the very structure of the brain, is intriguing. I think this book is pointing to some very important truths about the human mind in an introductory way. "
59,0060988479,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8259482-renah,4,"This book is just PACKED with serious implications about a number of topics. Let's just say that, if this guy is on the right track with his ideas about how paying conscious attention to specific thoughts, stimuli, etc., can actually affect the physical structure and circuitry of the brain, there are some tremendously important conclusions to be drawn about how the mind, consciousness, and the brain (and even the physical world outside the body) are related. Not to mention the conclusions that can be drawn about materialistic and existentialist philosophy! I'm not a huge fan of his dwelling on Buddhist philosophy-- it's relevant and clearly pushed him to explore the topic, but it doesn't add a lot to his theory. Not particularly well-written (a bit hard to follow the thread of his ideas, possibly because I took a 9-month break from reading it when I got to the middle....), and I would really like to see some current research on the topic, but this book was VERY much worth reading."
