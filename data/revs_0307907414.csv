0,0307907414,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11881042-amy-raby,5,"Best nonfiction book I've read in 2013. I've read Dawkins, Diamond, and Pinker, so I know a fair bit on this subject for a layperson, but this book had a lot of fascinating material I'd never been exposed to before. This book goes into great detail about our evolutionary ancestors, including why and how we developed the physical features we did, such as our efficient way of walking, our ability to run great distances without overheating, and our unique ability to throw objects with power and accuracy.The second half of the book discusses ""mismatch diseases"" -- problems caused by our evolutionary makeup having some incompatibilities with our current environment. Many of the usual suspects are discussed here, like heart disease and obesity and type 2 diabetes, but there is also discussion of nearsightedness, impacted wisdom teeth, flat feet, and back problems. Some of the greatest challenges our species faces are addressed in this book with wisdom and good sense. "
1,0307907414,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3897817-morgan-blackledge,5,"Crucial Read!The Story of the Human Body is Dr. Daniel Lieberman's plain spoken but powerful account of how the rise of bipedalism, the shift to a non-fruit-based diet, the advent of hunting and gathering, the rise of agriculture, the industrial revolution and the high tech revolution all shaped the key adaptations that typify the modern human body.If you've ever wondered why modern humans are such a sickly and chunky bunch, Lieberman's got a pretty satisfying answer for you. ""we didn't evolve to be healthy, but instead we were selected to have as many offspring as possible under diverse, challenging conditions. As a consequence, we never evolved to make rational choices about what to eat or how to exercise in conditions of abundance and comfort"".Lieberman's argument (in a nut shell) is that Humans evolved in an environment that necessitated eating as much as possible in order to build up fat reserves, so that we could either work our asses off to get more food, or lay low during the times when no food was available, all the while pumping out a steady stream of lil papooses. We evolved to be able to stalk and kill wild game in the 100 degree heat, drag that shit back to camp, and start all over again the next time you get hungry. So now fast forward to 2015, when you can take your air conditioned car to the Carls Jr. drive in and get a 3500 calorie meal for seven dollars that took a 350 calorie expenditure to earn. From this perspective it's pretty obvious that we are metabolically mismatched for our current environment. This has lead to what Lieberman terms ""mismatch diseases"" i.e. diseases that occur simply because our body is not adapted to our world of cushy excess. Mismatch diseases occur due to:1. a surfeit of energy (eating too much).-obesity -diabetes 2. under use (not exercising enough).-osteoporosis -lower back pain Lieberman argues that we often treat the symptoms of these issues and ignore the causes, leading to a state of what he terms ""dysevoloution"", a state of affairs in which disadvantageous traits are nurtured and conserved. In other words, the proper interventions for obesity, diabetes, osteoporosis and chronic lower back pain are behavioral interventions that target the cause of these issues e.g. eating less and exercising more. Lieberman is not naive about what it will realistically take to change our behaviors though. To the contrary, he's well aware of how hard it is, mostly due to millions of years of evolutionary conditioning. However, it's not hopeless, and the last few chapters propose possible interventions.Lieberman's summary argument is; if culture got us in to this mess, than culture can get us out of it. In Lieberman's opinion, the best interventions for mismatch diseases are public health policies that assist us in making better choices. Lieberman joins the likes of Sunstein and Thaler (Nudge) in his endorsement for Libertarian (soft) Paternalism. Libertarian paternalism refers to social policies designed to help people who behave irrationally (against their better interests), while interfering only minimally with people who behave rationally.One obvious example being the laws that regulate cigarette smoking. We tax the crap out of cigarettes in order to dissuade people from smoking. But we don't make it illegal for adults to smoke, provided they don't do it near people who would prefer to not die of lung cancer.Lieberman proposes similar ""nudges"" to inhibit consumption of junk food and encourage exercise.If you're not already convinced, you're just going to have to trust me on this one. This is the users manual for the modern human. Everyone should be equipped with this information. Skip it at your own risk.Five Stars!"
2,0307907414,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3368368-elissa,2,"I was excited to read this book based on a favorable review in the New York Times. I studied human evolution in college so I have a high level of familiarity with the subject matter. I started the book eagerly and found the first two sections regarding biological and cultural evolution to be interesting, if repetitive. But the final section seemed to be a massive repetition of the author's theories. I had a hard time reading to the end and basically skimmed the final third.On a substantive note, it bothered me how negative much of the book seems. I cannot change the fact that I was born a modern human in the 20th Century and have access to all of modern life's conveniences. At the end the author seems optimistic for the future but throughout the rest of the book, he seems sorry that we aren't all still living as hunter-gatherers. It bothers me when anthropologists idealize that way of life as better or more valuable than our own. I cannot recommend this book to anyone with a working knowledge of human evolution. You will be bored and disappointed."
3,0307907414,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18944510-mario-tomic,5,Had a great time with the audiobook version! The book was so interesting I went through the whole thing in 3 days. The book explains how the human body evolved over millions of years. It goes into some of the incredible adaptations we've gained to survive on this planet and those that we've lost in the modern age. Highly recommended!
4,0307907414,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4796031-armin-books,5,"It should be stated from the outset that this is not a 'self-help' book, but it definitely does raise awareness of some aspects of our modern lives which are silently and steadily harming us. Lieberman recognized the root of many of the common chronic non-infectious diseases to be evolutionary in nature, specifically ‘evolutionary mismatches’. He persuasively argues that our bodies which are molded and shaped by the adaptive force of natural selection over millions of years are no match for the abrupt changes brought about by our rapid cultural evolution. Think of reading these very words. Evolutionary speaking, it is really weird that a bipedal primate spends hours upon hours seating on a chair, and fixating her eyes on a monotonous black and white pattern. This is just one of many examples of how so much of our mundane activities are in fact quite bizarre, given what we know about human evolution. Undoubtedly, the propensity for adaptive behaviour is one of the hallmarks of our species. It has given us a tremendous selective edge to be creative and resourceful in manipulating our environment to our benefit. Lieberman doesn’t deny this fact. However, he believes the extent of which we have changed our environment over just few centuries, or indeed the last few decades is unprecedented by any prior technological innovation. In other words, even though we are a highly resilient and adaptable species, maybe this time, the changes are just too much.What’s the solution? Throwing away all the comfy technological advances and returning back to the good ol' hunting and gathering? Certainly not! That would be foolish. But, also treating our bodies as if they have changed profoundly since the time we were hunter gatherers is foolish. To be sure, we have changed since then, as it’s evident in some local populations that can break down lactose right into adulthood. Unfortunately, evolution has not had enough time to deal with many accelerated novel cultural changes. Think of the copious amount of sugar, abundant processed foods, comfortable sneakers, eyeglasses, elevators, cars, chairs, air conditioning, and super markets. We are living our lives in an unnaturally prolonged positive energy balance. Meaning, we eat more, while doing less. The author is nothing if not unambitious! Even after we are armed with all these knowledge, we still want that damn donut, don’t we?! Experiments repeatedly reveal that children and adults instinctively prefer foods that we evolved to crave (sweet, starchy, salty and fatty). Also, factors like advertising and peer pressure strongly affect our decisions. The last chapter’s focus is on this problem. What do we do with this knowledge? How do we change things for the better? The author recommends changing the environment itself as the most effectual solution. Humans sometimes need to be encouraged and even obliged to act in their own best interest. Take, for example, smoking. Of course adults have free will, but in the recent decades we have finally recognized it as a public health issue. For example, we have regulations prohibiting sale to minors. The same kind of logic can be applied to the food industry and maybe even to physical education. In the end, we can’t eliminate all the risk factors and live completely tuned in to our evolutionary heritage. Even if we did, evolution’s job is not to keep us in maximum health anyway. We probably should find a middle ground between living an austere simple life of our ancestors, and a soft indulgent technically enhanced life."
5,0307907414,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2547702-gretchen-rubin,0,"I was surprised (and relieved) by what a great read this book was. I knew I'd be interested in the subject, but I thought that getting through the chapters might be a bit of a slog. Nope, a great reading experience. I bought another book by Lieberman, in fact."
6,0307907414,http://goodreads.com/user/show/927546-rachel-williams,5,"This book makes a decisive case that making informed decisions about diet and lifestyle is only possible through the lens of evolutionary history. If you want to know where your body comes from, you need to understand its evolutionary history. Why do humans stand and walk on two legs? Why are we weak compared to other animals? Why are our legs and feet shaped the way they are? Why does our spine have a special S-curve? All of these questions can only be answered through an understanding of evolution.Now ask, why do people suffer from obesity, type-2 diabetes, tooth decay, metabolic syndrome, flat feet, nearsightedness, lower back pain, and sleep disorders? Daniel Lieberman argues that these questions can only be fully answered by understanding the evolutionary history of our species. Thus, Lieberman argues these ""disease of affluence"" are examples of a ""mismatch disease"" i.e. a disease that is primarily caused by our bodies not being sufficiently adapted to novel gene-environment contexts. We know they're mismatch diseases primarily because they used to be rare and are almost unheard of in hunter-gatherer populations. Lieberman argues that all of these diseases are in some sense a result of cultural evolution speeding ahead of natural evolution with the result that have humans manufactured a comfy and satisfying environment that is paradoxically unhealthy. It turns out that surrounding ourselves with unlimited sources of junk food is a bad idea because humans are programmed to crave food with dense amounts of fat, sugar, starch, and salt.Lieberman is no luddite, and certainly doesn't advocate a return to the caves and giving up on modern science and technology. His position is more nuanced than many of the extreme black and white positions out there, as befitting the complexity of gene-environment interaction. In many senses, the agricultural and industrial revolutions have propelled humans to new heights of health and longevity, with modern science curing diseases and fixing people better than ever before. At the same time, we are living longer but spending many of those years suffering from chronic, preventable diseases. The paradox of the modern world is reduced mortality but greater morbidity i.e. living longer, but spending more of those years with an illness of some sort. Lieberman argues that too often the incentives of modern medicine aim at fixing symptoms but not the underlying structural causes: the toxically comfortable environments we built for ourselves. "
7,0307907414,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17309926-jasmine,5,This is one of the best non-fiction books I read. Highly recommended if you are interested in evolutionary history and how our modern life style often creates mismatches. 
8,0307907414,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4943518-denise,5,"This is hands down one of the best books I have EVER read. It was first recommended to me by a highly respected individual in the fitness industry who owns and runs his own spine clinic as well as teaches science based fitness workshops across the country. Unexpectedly my ""Genetic and Evolutionary Principles of Health"" class had it as assigned reading (for obvious reasons) and not only did I get to finally read this amazing book, but also participate in in-depth discussions about the ideas presented.Daniel Lieberman is a master at coherently guiding the readers through this sometimes dense material. The beginning focuses on what evolution is and how evolution has influenced the development of our species. It takes a more anthropological view at first, going through our ancient ancestors and why certain adaptations were naturally selected for (the answer is almost always 'Climate Change'). From there he talks about both the agricultural revolution and the industrial revolution and how that has changes the way evolution impacts our bodies, lives and communities. Lastly, he takes a more medical approach talking about our modern society and the ""mismatch diseases"" that have arises due to our poorly adapted bodies in these rapidly changing environments. From back pain, plantar fasciitis, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, allergies, running injuries, osteoporosis, obesity, and more...he talks about it all! I have been eager to find a book to recommend to my personal training clients so they can understand their bodies and the dysfunction that arises because of their modern behavior, and this hit the nail on the head. He literally pulled the words right out of my mouth and I often found myself reading later chapters and thinking ""Thats exactly what I was telling so and so last week!!"". He is no alarmist with how we as a society approach our ""mismatch diseases"". Instead he explains the science behind it all in easy to follow sections. He gives just enough information for you to understand the complexity of the interactions, but holds off on enough scientific jargon that the average reader would easily find their way through. Only the last chapter is dedicated to the ""Okay, so now what?"" feeling most people have about our current healthcare environment. Even there he presents rational arguments and predicts your line of reasoning to help guide you to his primary message. That we as a society need to start thinking of our healthcare, governments, communities, and personal habits from an evolutionary perspective. "
9,0307907414,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5813283-rohini,5,"Reading in the time of Corona. The timing of finally getting to read this book is just perfect. I first picked it up way back in 2014 and couldn't get through it due to the natural selection pressure from the environment of an evolving academic career (using the same tone of the author here ;)). Of course, in the meantime, I read a couple of novels to balance the time I gave to reading information-dense subject related scientific articles. I picked it up again and finished it in 2 weeks!Daniel E. Lieberman starts by walking through our body design, how we evolved from apes, and what the recent archaeological discoveries have added to our understanding of a 6 million-year-old process. The first section of the book talks about the biomechanics of bipedalism that allowed us to wander in search of a varied diet and better lifestyle amidst climate shifts- all of which helped or were triggered as a result of our increase in brain size/volume. For the last couple of centuries, starting with the industrial revolution, improvements in food processing, and breakthroughs in disease biology/medicine, we have come a long way in adapting to anything that environment brings on to counter our lives. This led to a general increase in the human life span but unfortunately, our bodies hadn't yet completely adapted to aging. If only we had the DNA repair mechanisms of a bacteria, the mutability of a virus, slow metabolic rates of turtles, or generally a great oxidative damage attenuation mechanism that enabled us to live longer without any undesirable consequences. Prof Lieberman talks in detail about the 'mismatch disorders' that arise due to this unnatural prolongation of our lives. We have yet to decode the basis of diseases linked to aging such as Cancer, Metabolic disorders, autoimmune conditions, etc. And finally, he talks about something that I happened to grow a parallel interest for the last 3 years- Fitness (a lot on Running- which was a pleasant surprise), and Nutrition. All is not lost. Now, that is a very optimistic denouement for this time capsule of a book. As a researcher who spent the last 1.5 decades trying to understand human genetics and disease biology, I gained a lot of insight from this book. Thank you, Prof. Lieberman!"
10,0307907414,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6243880-gary-beauregard-bottomley,2,"I loved the first half of this book. It's hard to find a good book on human evolution. The author steps you through the evolutionary development of man from 2.3 million years ago to 250 thousand years ago and does this part of the book as good as or better than any other book on the topic. He principally looks at why the homo species decided to walk upright and become bipedal and considers the relative advantages and the disadvantages that this brought. It's hard to find good books on that topic. I never grow tired about learning about Neanderthals, Denisovans and early man. He actually develops a theory that our evolution and development is best thought of in terms of calorie (energy) consumption and usage a pretty good theory at that.At near the midway part of the book, the author says that he used to stop his lectures on human evolution at 40 thousand years ago. I wish he stopped the book at that point, but, unfortunately, he did not.He states that the agricultural and industrial revolution are the worst things that ever happened to us and he seems to mean it. (He quotes Jared Diamond to that effect, but Diamond might say that but doesn't dwell on that in his much better books than this one). The author tells the listener that modern hunter gatherer groups live longer and with less pain when you factor out tobacco and alcohol. All the negative things the author says about our diet and exercise (lack thereof) is true, but we are learning and we are moving ahead and adapting culturally.I'm a rational optimist. Humans are dynamic and we are learning as we progress and we just don't stand still as more data becomes available to us. The author is right, adult onset diabetes (Type II) is a scourge for out bodies, but we are changing are behaviors and we are learning from our past mistakes. "
11,0307907414,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13993602-karl,3,"Here's one of my favorite quotes: ""Like it or not, we are slightly fat, furless, bipedal primates who crave sugar, salt, fat, and starch, but we are still adapted to eating a diverse diet of fibrous fruits and vegetables, nuts, seeds, tubers, and lean meat. We enjoy rest and relaxation, but our bodies are still those of endurance athletes evolved to walk many miles a day and often run, as well as dig, climb and carry."" This goes on, but I think you can get a good idea of the idea he's trying to get across. I would agree that many details of the theme are repeated, but that points to the simplicity of the core idea. Many of us are not living as our bodies are evolved to be lived in."
12,0307907414,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3831795-nelson-zagalo,4,"As the title implies, “The Story...”, serves as a light introduction to the subject of the evolutionary body we humans possess. The writing is highly accessible, able to produce an informed idea of the past, present and possible futures for our bodies and us. As with other academic books for non-academics, treating vast subjects in introductory manner, it can fall short for people with great interest in the topic that have already read other books. In this case, I’m not a specialist in the domain, but having read previously various books from Richard Dawkins, Jared Diamond, Steven Pinker or Denis Dutton made me feel like reading nothing new.Anyhow, Daniel Lieberman is a well know professor at Harvard, with a strong research record on evolution and the human body, which per se makes this book a must read. Even if not reading complete new arguments, we’re reading them from the source, which is not only more authentic but ensuring. As we know, evolutionary biology has always been seen with a cast of doubt, mainly because it’s very difficult to empirically demonstrate the facts, however Lieberman does a really great job in supporting with theoretical evidence all the current theories.The most relevant for me in the book was its second part, which Lieberman dedicates to the discussion of human body diseases, presenting them mainly as problems of ""mismatch” between the body evolution and the cultural production of life conditions, as food, automation, clothes, etc. Not being surprising, is great food for thought, mainly about our daily lives and the happiness values we seem to use as goals and creed."
13,0307907414,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1679719-jenn,5,Wonderful exploration of the physical and cultural evolution. A must read for anyone who owns a body.
14,0307907414,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6572750-laura-siegel,5,"A fascinating account of our diets, our bodies, our lifestyles from an evolutionary perspective. According to the author our bodies have not evolved to handle the high amounts of sugar we eat, the sedentary lives we live, the lack of sleep we get, and the general stress we put our body under. As a result we see relatively new diseases escalating - cardio-vascular disease, type 2 diabetes, osteoporosis, breast and colon cancer, auto-immune diseases, depression. These diseases were not found in early man and began to appear with the farming and industrial revolution. The author feels that if medicine looks at these diseases from an evolutionary perspective we might prevent more diseases rather then treat them. This author has a unique way of reinforcing the information so it does not seem redundant, technical or boring. The reader of this audiobook is excellent."
15,0307907414,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22392990-eoin-flynn,5,"One of the most fascinating books I've ever had the pleasure to read. Absolutely jam-packed with interesting facts. I know modern life is killing me, as is the fact that the western world worships at the alter of capitalism (which is very good, but for very few), but this book puts genetic and medical metrics around precisely how. This empowers one to avoid it. It also provides scientific info of more mundane use, around health, diet and fitness.All of this is packaged in quite pleasant writing and occasional moments of levity.It is a science book, so don't go in expecting light reading, but if you're willing to put in the effort this is very rewarding. Some books I've read have changed how I live - Population 10 billion by Danny Dorling for example - this was one of those. Really fantastic. Highly recommended."
16,0307907414,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935491-tanja-berg,4,"This is a book of how the human body became ... well... human, as opposed to ape-like. Thus it doesn't dwell too much on organs, except for the brain. It's more about how we developed arched feet, long legs, big butts (in comparison to say, chimpanzees), why we are predisposed to be fat and such things. When the author is done with this, he moves on to ""mismatch"" diseases, the result of our bodies not fitting to its current environment. Typical mismatch diseases are flat feet, being short-sighted and diabetes 2. Fun, interesting and easy to read."
17,0307907414,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38639669-elspeth,5,"Fascinating book! Daniel Lieberman, a professor of human evolutionary biology at Harvard, is not only an expert on this topic, but this book was a pleasure to read. Lieberman states at the outset that his account of human evolution is written with an eye towards what this means for human health today. In other words, his aim at the end of the book is to address the question: How did the evolutionary pressures of our ancestors influence the form and function of our bodies in contemporary society? In the first part of the book, Lieberman explores the “nuts and bolts” of human evolution, focusing on the transition from chimpanzee-like apes, to early bipedal hominids, to bigger brained Homo Erectus, and finally modern Homo sapiens. The second part of the book is about how the advent of agriculture altered human health, for both better and worse. Here Lieberman documents how the transition from hunter-gatherer to agricultural life was a boon for our species, allowing populations to explode and civilization to develop, but interestingly, the fossil evidence reveals that hunter gathers were often taller, healthier, and longer-lived than early farmers. While serving as the seedbed of human civilization, agriculture also created Malthusian conditions for mass famine and disease—as populations exponentially increased, towns formed with people crowded in close proximity to one another, and entire populations became dependent on a small set of staple crops. Lieberman doesn’t present the rise of new health problems as a critique of civilization. Rather, it’s a trade-off. Hunter-gatherers didn’t have an easy or bucolic existence (sorry Rousseau), but civilization brought with it many new ills like famine, disease, and other maladies associated with over population, poor sanitation, decreased activity, and a less fibrous or diversified diets. (For instance, hunter-gathers rarely suffered from cavities, which became a serious problem with the advent of agriculture.) Nonetheless, technological innovation and civilization brought many benefits, which in turn allowed our species to multiply and settle all corners of the Earth. The third part of the book is about how “cultural evolution” has outpaced “biological evolution,” resulting in what Lieberman calls ""mismatch diseases"" and ""dysevolution."" Although we have succeeded in curing the worst diseases of the past (i.e. small pox, measles, the plague, etc), we are now suffering at alarming rates from serious conditions that were rare among our ancestors. While our bodies mainly evolved to meet demands placed on hunter-gatherers, today we enjoy the amenities of 21st century society. This includes using elevators and cars rather than walking, eating fast food as opposed to hunting and gathering (or even harvesting) our own calories, working at office desks instead of spending our days more actively, having fewer children and nursing them for shorter periods of time, and so on. As a result of “cultural evolution” our daily lives are arguably much more “comfortable,” but our bodies have a tendency to become overweight, our teeth get cavities, type 2 diabetes is prevalent, cardiovascular problems have increased, myopia is a norm, breast and ovarian cancer skyrocketed, and our muscles in our feet and back have become weak. That’s what Lieberman means by the term “mismatch disease”: Something uncommon among our early ancestors, but has become a widespread malady as a result of our technological and cultural “progress.” Lieberman’s solution to this “dysevolution” is not to return to our primitive past, but rather to universalize healthcare, improve medicine, and reform education about health. Paralleling Rousseau (but without idealizing the past), the end of the book reminds me of a throw back to the progressive era. Lieberman bemoans how difficult it would be for the government to compel people to exercise regularly, eat healthier diets (more veggies, lean meats, whole grains; less sugar and simple starches), abolish smoking and over drinking, and get proper healthcare. To his credit, Lieberman doesn’t suggest that we become cavepeople again, or celebrate returning to a Paleolithic lifestyle, but he argues that we need to take steps to reduce these “mismatch” maladies. An interesting book!"
18,0307907414,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8351117-justin-powell,5,"What an amazing and wonderful book! Lieberman weaves together our evolutionary history and its influences on our modern day life. Dealing primarily with the negative aspects, he shows that much of our modern environment enables bad behavior or poor choices that leads to the many ailments of affluence. Part one is a crash course on our evolutionary history from apes to modern day genus Homo. Part two goes through the following agriculture and industrial revolutions that not only changed us for better or for worse, but also set the groundwork for the environment we currently occupy. Not only has the natural environment been changed, but so has our cultural environment been changed. The third and final part is on how we learn to cope with these mismatch diseases and where to go from here. I'm very impressed that the book didn't fall a part as many science for a popular audience books tend to do. Though anti-government fundamentalists might find some of his recommendations and thoughts on solving the problems to be petrifying, I would say most will find them reasonable and commonsense. The need for collective action both on the individual level (for those most informed or possessing the right information) and on the group level via government nudges is something he lands upon at the end, but doesn't unpack too much. Regardless, an acceptance that the government already does influence our diets via subsidizing farmers ""to grow so much corn that gets turned into high fructose corn syrup, corn-fed beef, and other unhealthy food"" would be a big step. I thought it great he brings this up in part three. This will NOT bring about an overnight improvement upon your health. It WILL however potentially enlighten many who opt to read it and digest the authors thoughts. Taking into account our evolved history is the first step to living healthier lives in the present. "
19,0307907414,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,4, This book explores Human evolution especially in regards to the body in the last million years. It explores how we developed our upright walking posture which is in so many ways detrimental to movement. It explores the development of our teeth as we switched from a low energy high fiber diet to which takes up so much time for primates to get necessary calories to a more selective high protien high sugar diet. It explores evolution since the invention of agriculture and argues that we haven't really stopped evolving in this period. A good book on the development of other less looked at parts of the body.
20,0307907414,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9133042-rebecca,5,"Very persuasive arguments. I don't agree with everything (YOU ARE NOT GOING TO TAKE MY CARBS FROM ME) and at times seems a little worshipful of the hunter-gatherer lifestyle, but from a scientific point of view it's hard to refute the argument he puts forward regarding many of the illnesses that are suddenly so prevalent today."
21,0307907414,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3363047-karel-baloun,4,"Harvard evolutionary biologist decides to summarize most important life knowledge into a practical book on lifestyle, perhaps shall we say loquaciously, using many many too many words.Two key messages:1/ The human body hasn’t evolved/optimized to make you happy or live a long time. Rather simply to make a lot of babies that survive and have babies.2/ The human body has evolved for a different environment, so is mismatched to current high calorie, low movement lifestyles.Lieberman (2004) seems to have been a major source and inspiration for McDougall’s Born to Run (2009), which delightfully demonstrates how basic research can inspire lifestyle and social change.“We often say ‘you are what you eat’, but evolutionary logic dictates that sometimes ‘you are what you’d rather not eat’” (p54) Evolution is driven most strongly by mass deaths in times of struggle, of those who are not adapted, to distinguish them from those with different traits who can survive. Author estimates that 80%+ of recent mutations are maladaptive, just waiting for population crash,… that’s somehow sad.Specifically with respect to the ag/industrial revolutions and modernity, the mid/latter 200pgs of conversation added almost no new knowledge for me, and calculating the caloric needs of assembly-line workers seems to totally miss the health impacts. The entire second half of the book could be replaced with a short article about type two diabetes, sugar and factory food. Notably, his own data on p224 screams sodium potassium imbalance, yet the topic is completely missing.Out of fairness to the author, this may have been brand new thinking in 2013, but here in 2018 it is covered far better by Robert Lustig, Elizabeth Blackmore and many others.I approve of the authors call for a “libertarian paternalism” on p361: “the sensible role of government is to help one another make choices that we would rationally judge to be in our own self interest… Government has the right and even duty to knowledge or sometimes push us to behave rationally while preserving our rate is still behave irrationally if we so choose.” This is followed with an argument for sugar and fast food taxes, unless we want to pay for everybody’s obesity.As cultural evolution has become more a vastly more powerful and quickly changing driver of human change, he fails to at all discuss whether culture is becoming maladaptive. Are we becoming collectively worse? Cultures develop independently from genes: e.g. science started in europe, but any gene set can fully participate in the culture.He also doesn’t consider easily accessible demographic trends, such as that India, Asia and Africa will have 9 of 10 new babies in next 30 years… so those genes are winning in the modern world? Wealth seems to correlate with fewer kids.. so is it maladaptive, even though having fewer kids is essential to stopping climate crisis? Many such practically significant topics never appeared."
22,0307907414,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,5,"Deep, detailed, wise, and very much worth whileThe first part of the book is about human evolution from apes to Homo sapiens with a lot of interesting information about hominins (AKA hominids) and how we became bipedal and developed language and culture. The second part is about how the rise of agriculture and then the industrial revolution changed the health of our bodies for better and for worse. The third part is about how to cope with what Lieberman calls “mismatch diseases” and “dysevolution.”Lieberman’s style is surprisingly readable considering that he has written scores of articles for peer-reviewed journals. There is some repetition (some of it on the same page!) but most of it is didactic because Lieberman is a teacher and he wants us to understand the great environmental and cultural changes that have taken place in the last 50,000 years or so since we became behaviorally modern humans. He is an expert on the human body, especially the head and the feet. Known as “the barefoot professor” at Harvard where he is the head of the Department of Human Evolutionary Biology, Lieberman is at the pinnacle of his profession and so what he writes about the human body and the environment is highly significant.To give us as much information as possible, Lieberman begins in Part I with the Australopithecus apes and examines how they got around on two legs as they gradually evolved into the various archaic humans and finally into Homo sapiens. This early part of the book, about one-third of the total, gives the reader a good, contemporary understanding of the various early hominids such as Homo erectus, Homo neanderthalensis, Homo rudolfensis, etc. and how their bodies and habits differed from one another and from Homo sapiens. For example he notes how humans were better at throwing spears and rocks than apes and Neanderthals and how this ability (among other talents) helped humans to survive while the Neanderthal did not.The beginning of Part II is about the discovery and growth of agriculture and animal husbandry and how that caused an explosion in human populations while bringing about new hardships and diseases. He calls this “The Fruits and Follies of Becoming Farmers.” On page 181 he quotes Jared Diamond who claimed that farming was the “worse mistake in the history of the human race.” Chapter 9 of Part II examines how the industrial revolution brought about new diseases, hardships, challenges and the beginning of hitherto undreamed of riches for humans and of course the real beginning of the massive pollution that is threatening the planet.Part III is about chronic disease and other ailments of the modern world and how to cope in an environment radically different from the paleolithic one in which we evolved. It is here that Lieberman elucidates his concept of mismatch disease and dysevolution. The former refers to diseases of too much energy (over eating) and not enough physical activity that leads to obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, etc. that is epidemic in developed countries. The latter (dyevolution) is the phenomenon by which we address the symptoms of these chronic ailments instead of the causes thereby perpetuating the diseases.An important point that Lieberman makes in the introduction and repeats elsewhere is that “many human adaptations did not necessarily evolve to promote physical or mental well-being.” They evolved to “promote relative reproductive success (fitness).” (p. 13) On page 167 he expresses it this way: “we sometimes get sick because natural selection favors fertility over health, meaning we didn’t necessarily evolve to be healthy.” (!) This means that the tendency to get diseases like obesity and type 2 diabetes, and even Alzheimer’s—diseases that do not reduce reproductive success until it becomes a moot point as we grow older—are mostly not selected against. The evolutionary mechanism that fashioned us simply turns a blind eye to diseases that mainly affect us after the prime reproductive years of our lives.Another important point is that because humans evolved to be hunter-gatherers we are consequently optimally adapted to the way of life of a hunter-gatherer. This strongly suggests that (and is the main thrust of Lieberman’s contention) we are NOT optimally adapted to either life in the big city or life on the farm. It may surprise some readers to learn that humans took a step backward in terms of easy living when we began to rely primarily on farming for subsistence. Lieberman refers to studies that show that not only did the instance of infectious disease increase as we became dependent on farming, but we actually got shorter in stature. We became more subject to a feast and famine way of life that led to more pain and suffering than hunter and gatherers experienced.Lieberman dismisses several of the explanations for why we became bipedal, such as seeing over tall grasses, freeing our forelimbs for carrying things, etc. He believes that climate change from forested land to savannahs “spurred selection for bipedalism in order to improve early hominins’ ability to acquire fallback foods…when fruit was not available.” (See the section entitled “Why Be a Biped” in Chapter 2, “Understanding Apes.”) “Fallback foods” are roots, tubers, animals like turtles, etc. The salient point is that being bipedal allowed the early apes to cover larger amounts of ground in search of food, whereas tree-dwelling apes could not because knuckle walking is not nearly as efficient as walking upright on two legs.Among the wealth of insights that Lieberman makes about being human is this one about cooperation. “..[H]unter-gatherers are highly egalitarian and they place great stock in reciprocity…. In their “highly cooperative world…not sharing and being uncooperative can mean the difference between life and death. Group cooperation has probably been fundamental to the hunter-gatherer way of life for more than two million years.” (pp. 75-76)There’s a lot of information about nutrition, physical activity and lifestyle choices beginning in Chapter 10 “The Vicious Circle of Too Much.” On a point of much contention among nutritionists Lieberman concludes: “Insulin thus makes you fatter, regardless of whether the fat comes from eating carbohydrates or fat.” (See the entire argument in the section “How and Why We Are Getting Fatter?”)As a means of fighting the mismatch diseases of obesity, type 2 diabetes, etc. Lieberman introduces in Chapter 13, “The Survival of the Fitter,” the idea of “soft paternalism” by which he means governmental intervention to help discourage or tax unhealthy consumption of sodas and other highly processed junk foods. I’m not sure how I feel about this idea but I know many people would oppose it. What Lieberman does not present as a way to lessen human suffering is legal and assisted suicide.One last quote: “If there is any one most useful lesson to learn from our species’ rich and complex evolutionary history, it is that culture does not allow us to transcend our biology.” (p. 366)—Dennis Littrell, author of “Understanding Evolution and Ourselves”"

25,0307907414,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6064-chassy-cleland,2,"Lieberman develops an interesting argument about the intertwinement of food and the evolution of early humans. The writing is engaging and thought-provoking. However, it is wise to pay attention to the way Lieberman supports his statements. He frequently engages in unsupported speculation and rarely details the point of view of other scientists. If the book ended here, I would rate it 3 or 4 stars, as I nonetheless enjoyed the read and introduced me to some new perspectives.As the book continues from an account of the intertwinement of food and evolution, it shifts to a polemic about the ills of contemporary culture. Again, it is wise to pay attention to the way Lieberman supports his statements. He repeatedly turns to bucolic hunter-gatherer lifestyles as the basis of that which is most healthy for our bodies. This is often driven by the perceived ideals of that theorized lifestyle, rather than a solidly evidence-based approach. To sum up my concerns, the flaw in this book is that it makes too heavy a use of what should be rather than what is. Suggestions for improving our health need not turn to pre-agrarian lifestyles, as we today have a much greater knowledge of what makes us perform and what makes us sick. Lieberman focuses too much on the former and falls into the trap "
26,0307907414,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3260895-stuart,0,"The Story of the Human Body reads like a series of lectures for a college class. There are straight ahead facts mixed with occasional jokes and analogies along the way. This isn't the deepest or best written piece of science writing, but it does cover a decent amount of interesting ground. Lieberman is best when talking about human evolution, which makes sense because that's what he studies. He's good about crediting others for their research and it's also refreshing that he admits to what isn't known and what can't be known because of the limited fossil record available.For me, the last third of the book - about the present day state of humans - seems like an add on requested by the publisher. Lieberman opines about diet and fitness and gets more than a bit kvetchy about what we eat and how we exercise. There is a nearly relentless focus on the negative in those chapters - you'd barely know that most Western lives have been dramatically improved by the changes brought on by modern diet, work and medicine - and I think they are best skipped.All in all, this is a useful overview, but not particularly artful in its implementation. If you like straight ahead, nerdy looks at science, you'll find The Story of the Human Body worth a read."

An excellent, well-cited breakdown of key developments in the evolution of hominids to Homo sapiens. The last half deals with how these traits are at loggerheads with today's environment. I had several eureka-like moments reading this. I give apparent fads like barefoot running or ""paleo"" dieting more credence after the read. The crux of the argument is that many common lifestyle-related diseases of modern life are evolutionary mismatches. If we modify our lifestyles to not run counter to our biology, we might improve our health and quality of life. Compelling."

The result is ""The story of human body"". It is a very well written, beautifully presented and thoroughly researched book. At times information dense and challenging, it is never too complex for the reader. I thought that perhaps sometimes it could be more engaging, but I enjoyed it tremendously nonetheless.

39,0307907414,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16834771-zuzanna,5,"The Story of the Human Body is a book that should be read by every single person on earth. There is nothing more motivating towards exercise and health than the realisation of how much bad we are doing to ourselves by avoiding physical activity, and how wrong we are about the way we are living our lives. This book does that exactly. The impact our choices make on the ongoing evolution of humans is clearly portrayed in a way to emphasize the importance of change. Simply speaking, we will continue to get fatter, lazier and sicker if we don’t modify our daily activities to become more physically challenging, as well as fixing our diets to ones we can obtain actual nutrients from.I deeply appreciated the insight of the first part of the book, chapters 2-6, due to the extensive explanation of the evolution of human race.  There was so much I didn’t know that the book taught me, such as the existence of Homo Floresiensis – a dwarf version of Homo species living on island of Flores who were ‘driven by natural selection to become small-brained and small-statured in order to cope with lack of food’.  The comprehensive descriptions of our species’ early evolution sheds a very bright light on why we are the way we are now, and why we keep getting worse. The epidemic of mismatch diseases in the last few generations is raising the mortality rate due to illnesses such as CVD and diabetes which could be prevented if we just changed the way we eat and how much physical activity we obtain during the day. In this book, D. Lieberman talks about the comfort of our lives and how it has damaged our physical abilities and has limited our performances in many ways. Due to our acclimatization to convenience and luxury, we have lost – or are losing- many physical traits that have made our lives easier, but the lack of them may contribute to pain, and many mismatch diseases. This realization, if only it could become apparent, could reduce – or maybe even treat or prevent- a lot of pain that the majority of population is in.This is an extremely eye-opening book, especially to anyone who has the slightest interest in the human body, evolution or health. But it would have a strong effect on anyone reading it, leaving the reader in a motivated state to improve their lives. If only this book was a mandatory read, I believe we would have a chance of living in a (somewhat) healthier world.Despite being a scientific book, it is not a difficult read. I believe anyone with basic biology knowledge would have no trouble understanding the concept. "
40,0307907414,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45592686-marian,5,"We are not adapted to be so idle, so well-fed, or so clean. Lieberman's presentation is clear, concise, accessible, and essential information for all of us. The latter two-thirds of the book is most essential, so if paleo-archaeology is not your interest, hang in there! I found it all very sound and well-elucidated. If you are a physician or nurse or school teacher or public policy-maker, here is the song you need to sing. The current generation of school children are not expected to live as long as their parents. Our aging generation is sickened and crippled by inactive brains and bodies. Our economy does not punish the gun owners, cigarette buyers, latte-drinkers, processed food munchers, and fast food polluters. If money motivates, the health lottery must be our agenda. Government policies must favor prevention and discourage the actions that drive health, happiness, and societal wellness away. How can we redesign buildings to increase activity in mentally stimulating ways? How can we design school curricula to promote eye health, bone health, AND brain health? How can we reward health promotion and disease prevention? On Audible, the narration is friendly, parental, and comforting. Presidents, Principals, City Managers, and parents all can benefit from this book IF you hear the lessons and apply improvements in a deliberate and healthy habit-minded way. Thank you, Dr. Lieberman."
41,0307907414,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3045589-jamie-mcquiggan,4,"This book took a while but I really enjoyed the writing and the style. Lieberman basically started at the beginning of our evolution and painted a clear picture of how we got here, why our bodies are the way they are, and why certain diseases impact us. It was really, really fascinating. Basically, we aren't meant for this world, our big brains have created an environment that our bodies aren't suited for. We naturally crave sugar and fat which will cause us to get sick. It's all kinds of interesting and frustrating. If anything, my takeaway is that a deeper understanding of why I do certain things - why I crave certain foods or why I prefer sitting to standing or driving over walking or wearing shoes over being barefoot - are totally natural in my environment, but also not what my body was meant to do. Not that we have to totally buck cultural and societal norms, but it has certainly given me a lot to think about."
42,0307907414,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63421053-nico-van-straalen,2,"I was disappointed by this book. It is not so much about the human body itself, but more about health and disease in modern times, viewed as a ""mismatches"" between our acquired evolutionary adaptations and our modern lifestyle. This overly well-known story is repeated uncritically, however, the ""thrifty gene"" hypothesis, implying that humans are exquisitely adapted (by natural selection) to gain weight and store fat, receives little support from genetic analysis. By page 179 you think Lieberman has made his point, but the book continues for another 188 pages."
43,0307907414,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5979619-boudewijn,5,"What a refreshing book this is, it opened a whole new world for me.

The whole book made me fall in one discovery after another and decisively earns my first 5-star rating in 2018."
44,0307907414,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65677816-fabian,5,Proper science book on nutrition if there ever was one.

There is no firmer fundament advice about nutrition can stand on then mother nature.The advice itself might be the same as you grandmothers which again proves it’s validity for bullshit doesn’t get passed on from generations by word of mouth.This book also proves Talebs „Antifragility“ idea as absolutely applicable to our bodys.Highly recommend this book!

54,0307907414,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,2,"Focusing on medicine as an enabler is just special pleading.The book's thesis is this logical fallacy write large.In the beginning, Lieberman asks tantalizing questions in line with the paleo-diet. The correct answer to each of these leading questions is a firm ""no"", but he ends the book without ever answering them! This sort of leaves it up to the reader to read between the lines, instead of calling out paleo-diet for the utter nonsense that it is.I take away big points for this missed opportunity. I find it irresponsible of Lieberman to skirt the issue, when he clearly knows better. He seems to have avoided confronting wrong ideas for fear of drawing criticism. That's called cowardice.All that aside, this is a decent science book. It covers hominid evolution and metabolism, both in enough detail that I can say I learned something new.Lieberman's thesis is that certain non-infectious diseases which have become epidemic, such as obesity, diabetes, myopia, and flat feet, result from a mismatch between the modern environment and our genes, which are adapted to a very different environment. He calls this the Mismatch Hypothesis. This reminds me of another book, Survival of the Sickest.Taking the Mismatch Hypothesis one step further, Lieberman introduces the idea of Dysevolution, his term for when a mismatch diseases become more prevalent due to our response to the disease. Specifically, when we treat the symptoms of some diseases, we worsen the cause. For example, he claims that arch support in shoes worsens flat feet, reading glasses worsen myopia, etc. I suppose he also thinks crutches worsen walking difficulties?He also calls type 2 diabetes a disease of Dysevolution. His rationale is that by treating the symptoms of diabetes, we enable diabetics to continue eat a sugary diet and eschew exercise, which worsens the cause. Really, it is improper to blame the life-saving drugs for the worsening of insulin resistance. Therein lies the special pleading, as it would make more sense to blame the availability of unhealthy foods, and the person's choice not to exercise, etc.Lieberman makes some good suggestions, though, like encouraging kids to chew gum, which can help the jaw bone grow to its full potential, leaving room for the wisdom teeth. I'm skeptical that this would work very well, but it seems at least a worthy hypothesis for scientific investigation."
55,0307907414,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1429082-daniel-solera,5,"I had seen Daniel Lieberman interview on the topic of running. He was a guest on The Colbert Report and his advocacy of barefoot running had caught the Chris McDougall's attention during the fever-pitch days of Born to Run. So it was merely inevitable that I read his loving story of the human body, which details the evolutionary roots for almost everything we do today and why some of those activities are actually deleterious to our existence.This book asks a multitude of questions, and they are all answered by making connections to our evolutionary past. He asks big questions like, why are we upright? to smaller, more specific inquiries about why we get asthma. But every question, no matter how self-evident, has a very complex and rich history written in our DNA. In addition to meticulously explaining how we got where we are, Lieberman spends a great deal of time on mismatch diseases, or negative issues that we now have to deal with as a modern society that our hunter gatherer ancestors might not have suffered.For example, we evolved to store excess calories as fat. Given that our next meal was never guaranteed, it was extremely beneficial for our species to store food for leaner days, or even seasons. However, since we can now eat whatever we want at any time (and a heavy steak, a hearty pasta meal or even a brownie skillet aren't luxuries), our species is facing a worldwide public health crisis. Our predilection for sugar is making our teeth rot faster than our paleolithic ancestors, as many ancient fossils indicate, and our increasing life expectancy now pits us against diseases that were extremely rare 200,000 years ago.For anyone wanting to understand the breathtaking complexity of the human body and its wondrous history, this book is a must. Here are some fascinating tidbits: chimps spend half their day chewing because of the rough foods in their diet, Lieberman and the famed Jared Diamond both agree that farming was an enormous mistake for our species, modern comfort is a burden for our long-term health, myopia is a very new condition, and we are the only species on the planet that can die from eating something too large."
56,0307907414,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3532236-charlie,5,"The Story of the Human Body is a magisterial synthesis of evolutionary biology, medical history, and public health. The central theme of the book is the recent proliferation of ""mismatch diseases,"" health problems that stem from modern humans using their bodies in ways contrary to how evolutionary adaptation favors. To make his case, Lieberman spends the first half of the book tracing the story of the human body from its obscure origins in the distant past to its present state. The second half examines specific changes in the environment and the human body caused by cultural changes, along with the mismatch diseases these changes have spurred. Lieberman is both a skilled writer and an eminent scientist. He does not shy away from thorough explanations, but he has a knack for getting them across to non-specialists. I was astounded by the significance that arises from small details--the length or curve of a bone, the rate of a metabolic process, the duration of a stimulus. Significance is what keeps readers from getting lost in or bored by the many details of this challenging yet engaging book.At the outset, I was somewhat skeptical of Lieberman's claim that evolutionary biology can make significant contributions to public health. After all, if we know how the body works now, does it matter how or why it came to act that way? I now believe that it does. The narrative explains why some of our most persistent problems, such as obesity and back pain, are so difficult to eliminate. It also raises questions as to whether certain approaches to these problems will be effective in the long term. It may allow us to predict and prevent mismatch diseases, which will only continue to accumulate as cultural evolution outpaces natural selection. Note: This is not a personal health book or a manual of any kind. "
57,0307907414,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2490942-david,3,"This book gives a good summation of the evolution of the human body, but then goes on discuss how what was adaptive in our evolution as hunter/gatherers is now mismatched with our present modern environment. We weren’t built to sit for long hours at a desk, stare at a computer, eat massive quantities of processed food and drink volumes of high fructose corn syrup. As a result, we live comfortably and long, but are weak and fat. “Consider any individual at any period of his life, and you will always find him preoccupied with fresh plans to increase his comfort.” (Alexis de Tocqueville) Couple of interesting tidbits:*Hunter/gatherers are “persistence hunters”, not able to run faster than their prey, but able to travel long distances for long periods, wearing down the prey and eventually dispatching the overheated and exhausted animal. This endurance, along with our capacity to run, dissipate heat by sweating, and to make tools, gave us a successful advantage. *Hyperbolic Discounting—we habitually measure costs and benefits more highly in the near term than in the future. As a result, we tolerate and take pleasure in potentially harmful things because they enhance our lives now, more than what we judge to be their eventual costs or risk.* For every hour sitting at a desk, you expend about 20 fewer calories than if you were to stand, because you are no longer tensing muscles in your legs, back, and shoulders as you support and shift your weight. Standing for 8 hours a day instead of sitting is equivalent to about a 20 minute walk. Over years, the energetic difference between sitting and standing is staggering.

There are many sloppy factual errors: ""By full term, a pregnant human mother's weight increases by as much as 15 pounds.""And there is so much repetition that the book became unreadable. At least 8 times in the first 100 pages we are told that chimpanzees spend half the day chewing. And there is so much repetition that the book became unreadable. For example: Page 80: ""When sweat evaporates, it cools the skin, and thus the blood below"" Page 84: ""When the sweat evaporates, it cools the skin, the blood beneath, and then the entire body.""I already knew that the first time you told me!!Stick to Dawkins and Diamond"

Lieberman, a professor of evolutionary biology, runs through 6 million years of human development. It explains much about the current human predicament of ""mismatch"" diseases and disorders which he traces to the fact that our bodies are built for activity and scarcity while modern society and technology deliver overabundance and la-z-boys. The result of this mismatch is remarkably bad in terms of health. Despite our amazingly costly modern medical infrastructure, our children may be less health even than we are, because of terrible diet and lack of exercise. there are remarkable details here that fascinated me. Unfortunately, I wanted Lieberman to go even further with his bold thinking, to explore the greater issue hiding behind his topic. if humans have spent the past 6 million years in a struggle to optimize their environment to support ever increasing populations, are we actually capable of making an attitudinal shift to valuing the sustainability of our planet over our own quest for comfort? the answer to this question is just a bit more important than the question that he does explore- because really, isn't our survival as a species even more critical than the level of health enjoyed by the members of our species? Extinction would be worse than many of us having shortened lives, right? "
