0,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-x,5,"""Every living thing has at least one parasite that lives inside it or on it. Many, like leopard frogs and humans, have many more. There’s a parrot in Mexico with thirty different species of mites on its feathers alone. And the parasites themselves have parasites, and some of those parasites have parasites of their own. Scientists have no idea just how many species of parasites there are, but they do know one dazzling thing: parasites make up the majority of species on Earth. According to one estimate, parasites may outnumber free-living species four to one. In other words, the study of life is, for the most part, parasitology.""There's really not a lot more to say after that is there? Well, a bit. The author who is a wonderful writer and injects his own personality into this heavy, scientific book, is not without humour. He tells a story of having been set up on a blind date, and telling the lady all about his great enthusiasm for parasites. The date progressed no further!He really is enamoured of these nasty little creatures, especially it seems, the ones that live in us. He finds great beauty in their body forms. I personally find them exceedingly ugly and if they were big, would be nightmarish in the manner of cockroaches. Only worse.The book was hard to read, I kept having to reread parts because I have no academic background in science, but in the end I understood everything. The previous book to this I read was She Has Her Mother's Laugh: The Powers, Perversions, and Potential of Heredity which was even harder and more technical but even more rewarding (a 10 star book). My next one is going to be the same author's book on viruses, A Planet of Viruses. I really like books that teach me something and enlarge my world view, especially when they are as well written as these."
1,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/870755-dan-schwent,3,"Parasite Rex is about parasites and the history of parasitology. Nature is pretty gross. That's about the only way I can think of o describe this book.Let me tell you, there are some crazy creatures out there. I'm going to gloss over the hundreds of thousands of species of tapeworms and parasitic wasps and go to the really crazy ones. Like Cymothoa exigua, a crustacean that replaces a fish's tongue, or Sacculina, a barnacle-like parasite that uses a crab like a puppet. And that's just the tip of the disgusting iceberg.Did you know parasites influence the behavior of their hosts in any number of ways? Like putting heir host in danger in order to perpetuate their life cycle? Crazy stuff.It's not all great, though. It could have used more pictures and the writing stye could be a little more accessible. Still, it's an informative read and made me wonder why we aren't all riddled with parasites."
2,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6257531-caroline,5,"This book is disgusting almost beyond words. For instance there are 5,000 species of tape worm, and the one we associate with human beings can grow inside us, in our intestines, to be 60 feet long. And that is just the beginning of the disgustingness! Ewwwwww! On the other hand the book is utterly fascinating, and it illustrates with stunning clarity some of the endless conceits and machinations of nature. I am tempted to say ""intelligence"" of nature, because this level complexity and dove-tailing of species seems almost too miraculous to have happened on its own, but this is just Darwinian jiggery pokery at its best. Zimmer is an excellent writer too, and most of the book is hugely readable. I don't think it gets off to a good start though, it seemed a bit scatty and all-over-the place to begin with, but hang in there, as rest of it is brilliant. Highly, highly recommended.Herewith some photographs illustrating parasite horribleness. (view spoiler)[Hookworms live inside 1.3 billion people. They use their powerful teeth to lacerate a patch of the intestinal wall and drink blood from the wound.Parasites often choose very particular – and peculiar – places to live. This crustacean invades a fish’s mouth, devours its tongue, and takes the tongue’s place. It then acts like a tongue; the fish can use it to grip and swallow prey.Once a parasite has used up its host, in needs to escape . Herewith a fungus emerging from an ant.Another exit...here a worm-like parasite called a nematomorph escapes its cricket host. (hide spoiler)]And herewith some (fairly copious) notes I have taken for my own interest; mostly just verbatim extracts from the book. (view spoiler)[Common parasites:Trypanosoma bruceigambiense – causes sleeping sicknessOnchocerca Volvulus – causes scratching to the point it can be fatal, or blindness (known as river blindness).Tambura guinea worms- two foot long creatures that escape their (human) host by punching a blister through the leg and crawling out in the course of a few days.Filarial worms – Cause elephantitus, which can make a scrotum swell up until it can fill a wheelbarrow. The can also create monstrously swollen legs or breasts. 120 million people are infected with filarial worms.Taenia solium - Tapeworms - These are a parasitic animal. They usually come to humans via pigs. They can be harmless or fatal, depending upon where they settle, e.g., they can cause inflammation of the brain and trigger epileptic seizures if they settles there. The can cause death, by the immune system trying to fight off such a huge target.Blood flukes – These are unusual in that they manage to flourish in the vast majority of their hosts whilst only causing them very little trouble. 200 million people have schistosmiasis, the disease caused by blood flukes.Acaris Lumbric Oides (roundworm) 1.4 billion people carry this in their intestinesWhipworm – 1 billion people carry thisHookworm – 1.3 billion people carry this Trypanosome – 20 million people have this. It causes Chagas Disease. This is a parasite with a limited geography.Plasmodium – This causes malariaLeishmania Brasiliensis – Causes epundia – the parasite chews away at the soft tissue of the head until its victim is faceless.Toxoplasma – this is associated with cats and rats. Perhaps the most common parasite on earth. Many people have it but their immune systems keep it in check. It affects people with low immune systems – eg babies inside their mothers’ wombs, and people with HIV/AIDS. In 1990 an expensive drug was brought onto the market which helped AIDS sufferers – but many cannot afford it. The end of this disease is very unpleasant.No vaccinations for parasitesOne sign of the sophistication of these parasites – the protozoa, flukes, tapeworms and other eukaryotes – is the fact there is no vaccine for them, while there are many vaccines for viruses and bacteria.Bigger parasitesCuckoosSome butterflies (who trick ants into raising their caterpillars)Parasitic wasps The Amazon RiverThe tapeworm that lives in stingrays in the Amazon show how the river once flowed backward. They are more closely related to tapeworms living in the Pacific than in the Atlantic ocean.Galls on plantsThese are shelters for insect parasites. Hundreds of different insect species live in galls. They can form on flowers, twigs, stems or leaves. The galls are formed by the plants themselves, yet they are the work of the parasitesDarwin and Chagas DiseaseDarwin suffered in most of his adult life with fatigue, dizzy spealls, vomiting and heart trouble. Some have suggested he had Chagas disease. This is caused by Trypanosoma Cruzi, closely related to to Trypanosoma Brucei, the cause of sleeping sickness. T. Cruzi slowly wrecks parts of the nervous system. It is spread by the Benchuca, a biting insect of South America, and Darwin was bitten by one as he was travelling the world on the HMS Beagle. SexIt may be that parasites were the cause of sex in mammals. In the primordial soup things that wanted to reproduce simply divided themselves in half. Even today, bacteria simply divide themselves, as do many single-celled eukaryotes. Many plants and animals have the ability to reproduce themselves quite comfortably alone.Several biologists, including the Oxford University biologist William Hamilton have argued that when hosts are faced with parasites, sex can be a better strategy for fighting them than cloning. With sex, the genes get shuffled around, which makes it much harder for parasites to chase their hosts e.g., if amoebae reproduce sexually they no longer come in distinct strains, and it becomes harder for the parasites to get a lock on them. It is also seen clearly in bees, as demonstrated by Paul Schmid-Hempel, a Swiss biologist. The offspring of queen bees with high diversity DNA are much more powerful against parasites than those with low diversity DNA. Animals groomingWe often think of cats as ultra-clean animals, in fact they are grooming to remove parasites. When we see gazelles grooming themselves this is not in response to any particular scratch, rather they clean themselves according to a clock-like schedule because parasites are so relentless. Grooming cuts into the time an animal needs to eat and guard against attacks from predators. The top impala of a herd for instance ends up being riddled with ticks. Six times more than the females – because he is too busy staying vigilant against male challengers to groom himself for parasites.Some of the parasites that attack mammals include lice, fleas, ticks, botflies, screwworms and warbleflies. Animals and insects go to extreme lengths to protect themselvesagainst parasitesLeaf-rolling caterpillars for instance attract parasites via the odour of their droppings. They therefore project their droppings like missiles, and they land 2 feet away from the caterpillar.Some researchers have suggested that mammals that make long migrations, such as caribou and wildebeest, plot their course in part to avoid parasite-thick spots along the route.Our fight against parasitesThe antibody we all carry as mammals which helps us fight parasites is immunoglobulin E(IgE). IgE is rare in the USA and the few other parts of the world that are now free of intestinal worms, blood flukes and the like – but the rest of humanity (plus other mammals of course) carry a heavy load of flukes, worms and IgE.Sickle Cell Anaemia1 in 400 African Americans have it. It usually kills people by the time they are 30. The only reason this sometimes defective beta chain gene stays in such high circulation is that it’s a defence against malaria. Other disorders that are the result of the body trying to fight off malaria – ovalocytosis and thalassemia. Why are parasitic diseases so often overlooked1) They happen to the poorest people in the poorest countries.2) Many of these parasites aren’t fatal, but the effects of chronic infestations with parasites are still devastating – leaving people listless and undernourished. Parasites like hookworm and whipworm make it hard for children to learn in school; all it takes is a dose of anti-whipworm medicine to make some slow children bright again.America’s history with parasitesThere used to be malaria in the US, and many people in the south were affected with hookworm. 25% of pork used to carry Trichinella in the 1930s.But all of that has changed. The US no longer has to be worried about these parasites, but not because anyone invented a magic bullet. Instead they’ve been overwhelmed by the slow, dogged work of public health campaigns, of building outhouses, of inspecting food, of treating infections to break the cycles that parasites had taken for thousands of generations before.Parasites that are currently being attacked/treated by public health workers in the worldGuinea worm. This was stopped in Pakistan altogether in 1993, and numbers are falling elsewhere. It’s conceivable that in a few years it will be wiped out.Onchocerca volvulus (the worm that causes river blindness)This has a partial cure with the drug Ivermectin, which kills the baby worms – the ones that do the most damage. The pharmalogical colossus Merk has donated as much Ivermectin as will be necessary to cure the world of river blindness.Filiarial worms (the worm that causes elephantiasis).It has recently been found that Ivermectin also works against filiarial worms.But, but, but…..it may be that we need parasites!Eradicating parasites may create new diseases. There was no record of Crohn’s Disease or Colitis in the US before the 1930s. In poorer countries these diseases are virtually unheard of. In Japan and Korea – two countries that have gone from poverty to wealth quickly – there are now epidemics of Crohn’s Disease and Colitis. Some scientists think the spread of these diseases was caused by the eradication of intestinal worms. Even farm animals are starting to get bowl diseases since being treated with anti-worm medicines like Ivermectin.Parasitologists have found that intestinal worms can nudge the immune system from a poison-sprouting, cell-engulfing frenzy to a gentler sort of attack. In this mellower mood, the immune system can still keep bacteria and viruses in check, but the parasitic worms live unmolested. This arrangements benefits the host (the human) well. When parasitic worms are abundant it would be dangerous to attack them over and over again. But then, in an evolutionary blink, a few hundred million people lost their parasites. Without their soothing influence, some people now swing too far the other way, their immune systems unable to stop attacking their own bodies.In 1997 scientists at the University of Iowa put this idea into startling practice. They picked out 7 people with Ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s Disease who had got no relief from conventional treatments. They fed them eggs from an intestinal worm that wouldn’t cause any disease of its own in a human gut. Within a couple of weeks the eggs had hatched, the larvae had grown, and 6 out of the 7 people went into complete remission. (Note: and here is a current update on the use of parasites with these diseases....http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helminth...)Crohn’s Disease and Colitis are not the only problems caused by a lack of parasites. Allergies may well be another issue. 20% of the population in industrialized countries suffer from allergies….but elsewhere they are hard to find. Neil Lynch did a study in Venezuala.People from upper class homes with running water and toilets:43% had allerties – only 10% of these people had a light infection fromIntestinal worms.Poor peole:22% had allergies. 20% had an infestation of intestinal worms.Indians who lived in the rainforest:None of them had allergies. 88% were infested with parasites.Without parasitic worms exerting their influence over our immune system, it may be prone to overreacting to things like harmless bits of cat dander and mould.Perhaps some day, along with polio vaccines children will get parasite proteins, so their immune systems will be trained not to fly out of control.Parasites and biological controlParasites can be used to control crop pests e.g., cassava, a staple crop feeding many people in Africa, was affected by a virulent strain of mealybug. In 1979 this was studied by the Swiss scientist Hans Herren, an entomologist. Eventually he tracked down a parasitic wasp in Paraguay, able to attack these mealybugs. They were dropped from aeroplanes over affected areas. The operation cost $30 million, but about 200 million people were at risk from losing their staple food crop, and this was avoided.But parasites introduced into new habitats can cause disasters e.g., the forests of Hawaii are filled with alien parasites brought in to destroy insect pests; but they have also affected the moths that birds eat, so the bird population of Hawaii is declining. (Note: of course it has become popular nowadays to use parasites in our gardens....http://groworganic.com/organic-garden...)

3,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4743119-oleksandr-zholud,5,"Wow, what a book!This is a non-fic that can change your world picture. When I started it, I expected more or less average run of the mill collection of stories about parasites. However, this is so much more!The book starts with initial theories of parasites: people observed them thru the centuries but they posed a problem: never found (in their final form) outside the body, are they an integral part of an organism or invaders? Why there is nothing in Genesis on them? After Darwin’s evolution theory took hold, parasites fared not much better: To Darwin, life was not a ladder rising up to the angels but a tree, bursting upward with all the diversity of the species on Earth alive today and long past, all rooted in a common ancestry. And parasites, instead of develop, actually lose developed functions. One influential voice for these ideas belonged to the British zoologist Ray Lankester, who wrote “Degeneration: A Chapter in Darwinism.”, where virulently attacked species that not only stopped rising but actually surrendered some of their accomplishments. They degenerated, their bodies simplifying as they accommodated themselves to an easier life. They were the sine qua non of degenerates, whether they were animals or single-celled protozoa that had given up a free life. This critic quickly spilled over to social activism, were everyone, from communists to Nazis started accusing their opponents of parasitism, a practice present even today.However, parasites aren’t that simple. They manage to fool immune systems better than the best of our drugs. Blood-drinkers often keep their point of contact clean and inject anti-coagulants, but don’t let the whole body bleed. For each species there are estimated four species that parasitize on it, all extremely narrow specialists.Many books on parasites stress the “Ew” factor, but not this one. It shows that there is a whole world often disregarded by ‘classical’ biologist. Say, usually wolf-moose relation is usually viewed as predators keeping a herd of prey healthy by weeding out the slowest ones. In truth, wolves are the final hosts for one of the smallest tapeworms in the world, Echinococcus granulosus. It doesn’t cause its final host much harm, but its eggs can be vastly vicious. They are eaten by herbivores such as moose, where they slowly transform themselves into cysts. One of the tapeworm’s favorite sites for forming its cyst is the lungs. As a result, when wolves sweep down on a herd of moose, they’re more likely to pick out the slow, wheezing one and kill it. The result is that the tapeworm brings the wolf to the moose so that it can get into the wolf. The thinning of the herd is an illusion, not the service of the predator but the side effect of a tapeworm traveling through its life.Parasites are paramount part of the environment. To disregard them, assuming healthy elements in modelling the eco-system brings wrong results.Also, there is a common sense that given time parasites might evolve into a new species better adapted to a new host. If they did, they would be amply rewarded by natural selection for any mutation that caused less harm to their new host. After all, if their host died off, the parasites would die with it. In truth, familarity could breed contempt. Natural selection favors genes that can get themselves replicated more often than others. Obviously, a gene that makes a parasite instantly fatal to its host won’t go very far in this world. Yet, a parasite that is too well mannered won’t have any more success. Because it takes almost nothing from its host, it won’t have enough energy to reproduce itself and will come to the same evolutionary dead end. The harshness with which a parasite treats its host—what biologists call virulence—contains a trade-off.A great eye opener!"
4,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1200578-emily,5,"I know. I'm weird. But really, this is something that anyone could pick up and read and understand. Again, if you've ever thought about going vegetarian, this book will make you do it. It's basically a collection of case studies of parasites, how they work, what exactly they do, how they evolved, but it's all put together in an easy to read narrative so that you really don't feel like you're reading a text book (which you aren't - some of the descriptions imply that one celled parasitic organisms are capable conscious choice, false, but the idea of what's happening comes across easier)."
5,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/845917-ian,5,"One of the best non-fiction books I've read in years. I could not put it down. At a party recently, I found myself surrounded by PhD level marine biologists who were hanging on my every word as I described some of the parasites listed in the book. My favorite is the one that eats the tongue of a fish and then positions itself in the fish's mouth as a replacement tongue, only taking whatever food it needs and then helping the fish to swallow the rest to keep it alive. Some of the parasites have only been described and understood in the last 5-6 years, and yet this class of organism makes up a significant fraction of the Earth's biosphere. The author takes the reader through their evolution, biology, and ecology in an engaging, easy to read and digest form.Highly recommended."
6,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44110461-esme,4,"Ive always loved being creeped out, and I gravitate to things/animals that most people find revolting - I've had pet spiders in the past and I currently have two snakes (Julius Squeezer and Aphrobitey).So, naturally a book dedicated to parasites was something I wanted to pick up.It was surprisingly narrative, and he told several stories of his life, some of which pulled on your heart strings. The book opens with a story when he was visiting a hospital full of kids suffering from ""sleeping sickness"" which can be fatal, and causes extreme duress.Sleeping sickness is caused by the Tsetse fly which drinks your blood and can leave you infested Trypanosomes. Once the infection reaches your brain the situation becomes desperate - one of the few medicines that will work is 20% arsenic, and its so potent it eats through standard IV tubes, and specialized teflon tubes have to be ordered. The treatment is painful and some patients have to be strapped to their beds.The book goes into a menagerie of horrors. Theres something called Onchocerca Volvulus aka River Blindess that not only causes you to go blind, but once the worms get into your skin (so mosquitos can get infected and in turn infect others) - people have been known to scratch themselves to death! Fuck.Up to 60% of certain tribes living along the river over the age of 40 have gone blind.Here's a sentence I didnt like reading, ""Most human beings have one or more parasites living on them or in them. 1.4 billion people have roundworm. 1 billion have whipworm. 1/3 Europeans are infected with Toxoplasma Gondii which main host is a cat."" Fuck, I have a cat. *glares at Pokey*Back before we understood what parasites were, scientists and doctors didnt even recognize them as animals, they actually thought that parasites spontaneously arose in the human body as a symptom of an illness, not the cause of the illness itself. The logic being that was that internal organs aren't exposed to animals or external causes of illness, so how could these things possibly get inside the heart, liver or lungs? They must be byproducts of the body!A particularily brutal experiment was carried out in Germany (not hitler), where a scientist involuntarily infected convicted inmates with parasites, feeding them meat known to be infected without telling them. After their execution they were dissected and found to have parasites, thus proving that you can contract parasites through digestion, and they werent a byproduct of illness made from the body. Eureka!Trichinella is a type of worm that you initially ingest through food (mostly). Once the worm infects a cell it divides into a multicelled worm and bursts through the gut wall and into the capilliary system. From there it imbeds itself into the muscle tissue of the host, and turns the surrounding tissue into a softer jelly like substance effectively turning the muscle tissue into a parasite placenta. Revolting. You could theoretically have hundreds of these cysts in your muscle tissue before you start feeling the symptoms. They can even get into your brain.Trichinella is most commonly found in pork products and this is the strongest case against bacon Ive heard.OH DEAR GOD THERE ARE PICTURES. A BOT FLY LAID EGGS ON A BOYS HEAD. IT BURROWED THROUGH HIS SKULL AND INTO HIS BRAIN. IT KILLED HIM BY EATING A HUGE PORTION OF HIS BRAIN. WHY AM I STILL LOOKING AT THIS?!Parasites eluded study for a long time not just because the majority are extremely small - but also because of their highly complex life cycles, often requiring 2 or more hosts of different species to complete its cycle. Its not uncommon for a parasite to travel through half a dozen hosts through its life cycle, and often during this life cycle its physical appearance changes. It's taken decades of research to match adult stage parasites with their larval counterparts.Along with the different kinds of human parasites this book touches on a ton of different types of animal and plant parasites. I dont know if I wanted to know there are 5 thousand species of tapeworms, but I do now. I also now know that they don't have any mouths or guts. They absorb their food exclusivly through their skin, which is why they are so flat - maximizing surface area.... they can also grow over 80 ft long. To put that in perspective, thats several school busses long.While many parasites actually do a good job at not killing the host, and just causing minor inconviences... or castration and mind control.... the battle between catepillars and wasps is brutal and lethal. The pictures included made me squirm. It doesnt help that the author is decent at creating visuals, ""she jabs a long hollow dagger through one of the holes, and through it squirts hundreds of eggs"". I think hes doing this on purpose.This is a very well written book, full of details and experiences the author has gone through. Hes traveled the world from the Amazon, to Africa and both sides of the USA studying parasites and their life cycles.No background in science is required, this is easily accessible to the general public with very little jargon."
7,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2747498-arun-divakar,5,"An organism (human or otherwise) that tends to live off another is what we refer to in simple terms as a parasite. It is a name which has been subjected to scathing criticism and/or rib tickling humor according to circumstances when it does pop up. But keeping these light hearted anecdotes aside how much would it affect you if science were to tell you that there is a parasite that can castrate you ? Yet another can convert your gender as it begins colonizing you ? These are topics typically left to the sci-fi authors or to the horror genre but Carl Zimmer in this thought provoking book tells us that such creatures do exist in nature. There are even more shudder inducing characters at play in nature whose behavior makes us rethink the plots of Jack Finney or Robert Heinlein and their body snatcher tales.Parasite Rex is an in-depth view of the life and times of the parasite. The narrative does not restrict itself to parasites that plague humans alone but to those that are rampant in nature with regards to other flora and fauna. The initial set of chapters are extremely high on the 'yuck' factor. But then as we are talking about creatures that inhabit the most undreamed of places, the details tend to get a little icky. To put it mildly, the initial parts are nothing short of a gorefest in terms of the graphic details. If you peel away these layers of aversion then beneath it all you get to observe one of nature's finest survivors. It is a creature that began its existence even before the first life form walked on Earth. A creature that has withstood climate changes, natural and man made disasters and cutting edge medical developments. In all probability they will still be alive when we are long gone from this planet. An extremely hardy survivor and a tough opponent to best ! Zimmer also explains with proven examples why it is equally important to have parasites if nature is to maintain a healthy balance in the system. I felt my incredulity and disgust make way for a grudging respect to this organism by the time the book was done and that is a mark of a very good book !Carl Zimmer's prose is simple, direct and distilled down to the very basic elements which do a world of difference in terms of understanding the subject at hand. He avoids jargon even when talking about complex topics like immunology or parasitology. A convincing case indeed for one of nature's most overlooked set of organisms !Recommended."
8,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5522229-alex,5,"Parasites amount to the majority in all species but are much less known than freestanding species are. This book, packed with information, helps reduce the ignorance by a large degree. Many revealed mysteries are truly amazing. One might say, ""These disgusting creatures are actually so 'smart'!"" Here is an example: a parasitic wasp, Cotesia congregata, lays eggs in the tobacco hornworms. To help her children fight the immune system of the host, which would otherwise mummify them, she delivers the eggs packaged with viruses, which, like in AIDS, will control the host DNA to produce proteins that destroy the immune system. This package is already amazing, but where does the wasp get the viruses? Nowhere other than her own DNA! There are pieces of genes scattered, but only in the female adult wasp, and only in certain cells of the ovary, these pieces are cut out of the DNA and sewn together as awakened viral DNA and reproduced with protein shells, to ship out with the eggs. Mind-boggling!Some other miracles are: worms “telling” their host fly where, when, and how to die so that they can propagate most effectively, or controlling host mice to increase the chance to meet cats so that they can migrate to the latter, similarly even host humans are influenced to behave more dangerously to themselves, although not to the degree of throwing themselves to the lions…An excellent book for any curious reader."
9,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2439711-seanan,5,"I love science; I love diseases; I love weird science. This book was essentially written for me, and has provided me with a way of starting the study of parasites. Yay!If you don't like science, don't like gross things, and don't like thinking about what might already be living inside your body, this really isn't the book for you. It's just going to make you sad, and there are books that wouldn't make you sad (and which include less viscera)."
10,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24115945-minhhai,5,"You will be stunned, I'm sure! This great piece of work will change your view on, well, virtually everything.Parasitism is a complex and prevailing life form on Earth. Before reading this book, I used to think of parasites as simple, passive, useless and even harmful creatures. Carl Zimmer pointed out that I was totally wrong about them. To start with, parasites are not simple. In fact, their life cycles are very complicated, circulating through different hosts and changing their appearances and functions accordingly. Second, they are not passive. To be able to enjoy life inside another organism, parasites need to cheat the host's immune system, find a good place to mature and lay eggs, and they can even somehow control the host to do them some favors.The book is a summary of tens of years of parasitology research. Each piece of information is the result of many years of hard work. I was impressed by the way the author combined those discoveries together into elegant stories: how malaria attacks and spreads, how Toxoplasma makes infected rats to be easy targets to cats, how chimpanzees free themselves from worms, history of parasites and how it relates to that of free-living animals, etc.The last one third of the book is dedicated to emphasizing the role of parasites in evolution, society and ecosystem. Although not so exciting and shocking as previous parts, this part depicts an overall picture of parasitism. Parasites are not supposed to cause troubles but they really play essential roles in shaping the Tree of Life, animals' behaviors and help to balance the ecosystem. Without understanding parasites, humans had made big mistakes by eradicating crucial parasites or bringing alien parasites to new lands.This book is a somewhat scary but beautiful story about parasitism."
11,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9246169-wanda,4,"Sometimes the truth is stranger (and creepier) than fiction. Its certainly the case with parasites. Just thinking about having another creature living inside of me makes me feel a bit squidgee, but that's the way that humanity evolved. Those of us with good medical attention and cleanly living accommodations are very lucky. Yet another reason to be thankful that I won the lottery and was born in North America. One interesting theory, which only gets 2 or 3 pages, is that our autoimmune diseases are a result of being parasite-free. The thought is that our bodies evolved in concert with intestinal worms and the worms held the secret to calming down our immune systems. Zimmer claims that Krohn's and colitis don't occur in societies where there is a high rate of intestinal parasites. Even allergies, apparently, are the immune system's over-reaction and are much less likely to occur in parasite-carrying people. This calls for some research--I'm sure I heard something about this on CBC Radio as well (people infecting themselves with certain parasites to obtain relief from autoimmune diseases). Creepy or not, this kind of treatment may be in our future."
12,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/548376-andrea,5,"""The wise learn many things from their enemies."" This quote by Aristophanes used in the book summarizes why you should read it. Parasites are so adept at hiding, changing and defending themselves that there are no vaccines that work against them. They are also incredibly ferocious-looking under a microscope with horns and fangs and barbs of all shapes. I found this book fascinating in the way it followed these little guys around. They go through multiple metamorphoses and follow quite a complicated path from egg to adult. I also learned a lot about the human immune system as it tries and fails in the fight against these pests. I loved the ending which in a few pages summed up everything poignantly. I highly recommend this book. If you don't want to read it, then go listen to Radio Lab's fascinating story called Parasites of three points made in the book which aired Sep 25, 2009.

13,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935491-tanja-berg,4,"Not that long ago parasites were considered evolutionary degenerates. Low-life, lazy creatures unable to fend for themselves in the ""real"" world, living off a host. That was before. These days, scientists have come to realize that many parasites in fact are incredibly sophistacted and are able to manipulate their hosts' behavior. Scary, scary thought. For example toxoplasma a parasite that has rats as its first host and cats as its second: it makes the rats lose its fear of cat urine and open spaces. Sometimes toxoplasma accidentally end up in humans. It doesn't do us any real harm, but it can also make us bolder and more risk-prone. Hm. Women with toxoplasma become ""warmer and more outgoing"". This is just one of many examples. There are other entirely different creatures that manipulate its host so that it can spread the furthest afield. So rather than being evolutionary degenerates, they are masters of manipulation. In creatures that can reproduce both asexually and sexually, if there are lots of parasites, the latter is preferred because it diversifies the genes and makes it more difficult for parasites to take a hold of the next generation. Of course it's a case of the ""Red Queen"" - the parasites will also develop new strategies. This was an absolutely fascinating read. Before picking it up, I thought parasites downright abhorrent. Particularly cringe-worthy are the differents sorts of wasps that use tarantulas or caterpillars as living banquets for their offspring. Not that's it's any less disgusting, but I do appreciate how the wasps manage to suppress the immune system so that their eggs can hatch. The larvae then make sure to leave the main organs of the host intact, so that it is kept alive until they have had the time to mature. Oh yuck. Makes me think of a particularly loathsome scene in Michael Crichton's last book, ""Micro"", in which one of the poor sods who gets shrunk is visited by such a wasp. Anyway, anyone fascinated by evolutionary biology and living creatures in general will surely enjoy ""Parasite Rex"" despite its occassionally cringe-worthy content."

Behind the discoveries of some major vaccines they are, paradoxically, also able to fool very complex immune systems, sometimes even hijacking them against their poor victims. Microscopic but absolutely fascinating, they change our look upon life -we own them, for instance, some ground-breaking theories from the selfish gene to the Red Queen. Lethal and of an extreme virulence, they also help to maintain some ecosystems... In a word, parasites (yes! parasites!) are the real kings of the Earth and, after having for too long a bad press, it was about time to pay them our due respect! Carl Zimmer has done just that here in a brilliant book which is, honestly, breath-taking. Telling the epic tales of the invisible world, 'Parasite Rex' became in fact one my top favourite read ever! Imagine, like Russian dolls we ourselves are vast ecosystems that are part of another ecosystem. Here's a terrifying yet enthralling vision but which is the key rendering this book absolutely superb: more that leading us into a microscopic world and its weird inhabitants, it humbles us by offering a new look upon nature. Fascinating, if you are even slightly interested in biology you MUST read this one. It is fascinating from beginning to end. A marvel of pop science. "

I wanted to give the highest mark to if not a life-changing but at least to an eye-opening or mindset-shifting book. I knew some at the moment and counted on meeting more soon. However that was not a case. Such encounters are few and far between. Thus i revised my policy and started awarding 5 stars to very good books I enjoyed, but which otherwise didn't shake me to the core.This time I'm happy to declare that in this book I met a genuine 5 star tome. My views on biology, evolution, life on Earth and its purpose are given quite a stir. I won't disclose much of book's content, but just a quick remark/guess: the author talks about parasites and domesticated animals, but he barely mentions our regular pets - cats and dogs - in this context. And not for nothing, I think...otherwise some people would have started looking at them with very, very different eyes :)"

Did I really want to read a book describing the disgusting things a parasite can do to my body? But then Carl Zimmer took it from the close to home sickness parasites can inflict on a human body to a fascinating journey into the world of parasites - what they are, where they come from, where we find them, how they evolved and adapt to their chosen niche, the fine balance between getting the most out of their host without tipping the scales and killing it outright, the role they play in keeping populations in check and in keeping ecosystems healthy."

19,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2014250-tim-martin,5,"_Parasite Rex_ by Carl Zimmer is a fascinating, well written, and very informative look at the strange world of parasites. Though I was worried that the book might carry a high ""gross"" factor (and in truth some things were a bit disturbing), my concerns soon evaporated as I became intrigued by these incredibly interesting and important organisms.Early in the book we learn just how diverse a group parasites are. Most people when they hear parasites mentioned might picture tapeworms or perhaps something out of a science fiction/horror movie, but in reality parasites include protozoa, nematodes, fungi, wasps, flies, crustaceans, some species of plants, even bacteria and viruses (which Zimmer writes for some reason are not often thought of as being parasites, though that is indeed what they are). Many parasites are highly specialized (such as a species of nematode that lives only on the Achilles tendon of a particular species of deer or worms that subdivide the human eye - retina, orbit, chamber - into different niches for different species) and often are extremely common on a given animal (one parrot species from Mexico was documented to have thirty species of mites living on its feathers; one duck was found to have fourteen parasitic worm species, each in its own particular section of the intestine, numbering 22,000 individuals all told). Parasites can include ""social parasites"" like the cuckoo, which gets other bird species to raise its young. According to some researchers, parasites may outnumber free-living species by as much as four to one.Zimmer covered much of the history of the study of parasites. In ancient and medieval times their presence in animals was confusing. The existence of so many different worms, flukes, and other creatures in fish and other organisms people examined lead to ideas of spontaneous generation, an idea considered heretical by the Church as only God could create life. Well into the nineteenth century parasitology was more of a ""loose federation than an actual science,"" as veterinarians struggled against livestock parasites, entomologists analyzed some species of insects, and specialists in tropical medicine repeatedly failed in their efforts to develop vaccines and drugs to treat parasites (Zimmer discussed at length why vaccines are generally quite ineffective against eukaryotic or non-bacterial/non-viral parasites).Additionally, many historically have regarded parasites as being degenerate, devolved organisms. Some, such as nineteenth century British zoologist Ray Lankester, were positively horrified by parasites, appalled by organisms such as the barnacle _Sacculina carcini_, an animal that upon an adulthood found a crab, lost its legs, tail, and mouth, and gained all future nourishment from its host. Even when they didn't hate parasites personally, many researchers seemed to believe that parasites were largely irrelevant, not figuring into such things as say ecological studies.In fact, Zimmer showed in the book that parasites are highly evolved and very capable organisms. Different parasitic copepods are specially adapted to cling to the differing scales of each particular species of fish that they infest. _Trichinella_ is a multicellular animal (a nematode) that lives inside a single cell, so adept at making a home in its host body that it is a ""viral animal;"" not only disabling a host's genes but manipulating them to help construct an ideal home. The root-knot nematodes of the genus _Meloidognye_ do much the same thing, changing the structures of the plant cells they inhabit by tampering with the host's DNA to build their homes. Some types of parasitic wasps are able to inject something akin to a virus to rework the DNA of the caterpillars they implant their eggs in. The extensive coverage of the on-going wars between immune systems and parasites was more than enough to dispel any thoughts that parasites were somehow degenerate; parasites are able to avoid, distract, and even manipulate the immune system to repel other parasites or disperse their offspring.My favorite thing about the book was Zimmer's excellent coverage of the often bizarre lifestyles of parasites. Many parasites are able to manipulate their host's bodies in amazing ways. Many types effectively neuter their host, using resources that their host would have used to develop eggs instead to feed the parasites. One parasite of crabs (_Sacculina_) is even able to fool the host into treating its eggs as if they were the crab's, not the parasites. Zimmer discussed the ecological role of these spayed hosts at length as these evolutionary non-productive hosts compete with other members of their species that do reproduce.Even more interesting, some parasites are able to change the behavior of their hosts; some parasites use more than one host species, with one or more intermediate hosts serving for a time as a home. When the parasite is ready to move to the next stage of host, it modifies its behavior so that the host gets eaten. One of several examples he provided was a tapeworm species that uses a beetle as an intermediate host before reaching its final host, rats; when ready to enter a rat the tapeworm makes the beetle sluggish, less conscientious about concealment, even turns off its only defense, glands that can produce a foul-tasting chemical.A number of parasites unfortunately plague humankind and these are covered as well. Trypanosomes (a protozoa species) for instance cause sleeping sickness, an illness spread by the tsetse fly in Africa, an ailment that plagues cattle and humans in a wide swath of the continent (another species of trypanosome causes Chagas disease in South America, a disease that may have afflicted Charles Darwin).Parasites can also be beneficial, useful in controlling introduced pest species (many introduced insects can only be controlled by importing their parasites) and possibly even having a positive role in developing medicines to prevent rejection of transplanted organs, prevent blood clots, and eliminate Crohn's disease, colitis, and possibly allergies.Diverse and highly adaptable, parasites were fascinating to read about and Zimmer did an excellent job in covering them in terms of biology, ecology, medicine, history, culture, even as treated by Hollywood."
20,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1052384-nicholas,3,"Awesomely disgusting. Fun read, not particularly difficult. Make some important points.Parasites might have been the defining factor in the direction evolution took us.One cool thing was the idea of cyclic generations. Instead of each generation being the same as the previous they would cycle through three or four different ""creatures"" before returning to the start. Weird.Another cool idea. Speciation through parasitation. There's your divided environment.Quotes:""The problem comes down to the fact that scientists at the beginning of this century thought they had everything figured our. They knew how diseases were caused and how to treat some of them; they knew how life evolved. They didn't respect the depth of their ignorance.""""For six years he floated in this dead-end existence, but he found that it game him the freedom to search for answers that other scientists thought were unreachable. ""I had nothing to lose,"" Sukhdeo says. ""I could do anything I wanted, and I had no future.""""""Unable to waste energy on building eggs or testes, on finding a mate, or on raising young, a host becomes, genetically speaking, a zombie: one of the undead serving a master.""""Lafferty set his student Kimo Morris to establish whether or not the flukes affected the killifish. Lafferty gathered up forty-two fish, brought them into the lab, and dumped them into a seventy-five-gallon aquarium. Morris gazed at the fish for days. He would pick out one and stare at it for half an hour, recording every move it made. When he was done, he'd scoop the fish out and dissect it to see whether its brain was caked with parasites or not. And then he'd meditate on another killifish.""""But why would birds pick so many sick fish when they were virtually guaranteeing themselves an intestinal parasite? The flukes do take a toll on the birds, but a relatively small one. It's in the parasite's interest, after all, for the bird to be healthy enough to fly, so that it can carry the fluke to other salt marshes that it can colonize. If the bird scrupulously avoided infected killifish, it might stay healthy, but it would also go hungry. The parasites make so much food available to it that their benefits far outweigh their costs.""""The harshness with which a parasite treats its host - what biologists cal virulence - contains a trade-off. On one hand, the parasite wants to make use of as much of its host as possible, but on the other hand, it wants its host to stay alive. The balancing point between these conflicts is the optimal virulence for a parasite. And often, that optimal virulence is quite vicious.""""The males and females make copies of their genes and join them together to from their offspring's DNA, and as the genes combine, they get shuffled around. As a result, the offspring isn't a carbon copy of one of its parents but a new jumble of tier genes. Now the parasites have a much harder time chasing their hosts. Because the genes of the sexual amoebae mix, they no longer come in distinct strains, and it because harder for parasites to get lock on them. The Red Queen still takes sexual organisms for an endless run, but their offspring may have less of a chance of getting infected.""""It's now becoming clear that parasites may have pushed their hosts to become more diverse as well. Parasites don't attack an entire species in the same way. The parasites in a particular region can specialize on that population of hosts, adapting to that local set of host genes. The hosts evolve in response - but only the hosts in that region, not the species as a whole. This local struggle has produced some of the fasted cases of evolution ever documented - whether they be yucca moths and the flower where they lay their eggs, snails and their flukes, or flax and fungi. And as these populations of hosts fight off their dedicated parasites, they become genetically distinct from the rest of their species.""""Wolbachia genetically isolates the infected host from the uninfected ones. A newly born host will be the offspring of either Wolbachia-carrying parents or two healthy ones. It won't be a healthy-unhealthy hybrid. By setting up this reproductive wall, the parasite may be able to set the stage for a new species to form."""
21,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4258012-adam,5,"I don't know why, but I find parasites interesting. However, I wasn't exactly looking for a book on this particular subject; rather I merely stumbled upon it. When I go to the book store I typically peruse my favorite sections, one of which is science. On the shelf I came across the title ""Parasite Rex""... so I picked it up ""King Parasite...huh."" Then I made the mistake of reading the back of the book and found out what it was about. I had to buy this book immediately! I'm always reading, so I had to finish up a couple other books before I could start reading this one, so I waited patiently in eager anticipation. I'll usually read two or three books at a time, and when I finally got freed up, I started this book. I didn't read another book until I finished this. It is one of the most engrossing scientific books I have in my collection. Carl Zimmer is actually a phenomenal writer. I'm not a scientist, but I enjoy reading about it and it's written in a manner just about anyone should be able to understand. It's like a science report that flows, but doesn't sound overly scientific, yet it's still science! Parasite Rex doesn't just deal with one specific parasite, like the title might suggest, rather it's a veritable tour of the parasitic world. The reader finds themselves enthralled with each creature. It really changes your perspective on the world as a whole, realizing that the major importance of sex is so that we can vary up our genetic code to better defend against such parasites. It also makes you realize that for all intents and purposes the fetuses of mammals would also be parasites as well because they force the mother to change her chemical reactions to support the fetus. Also the mother treats the fetus initially as a threat to her system. I personally found all this very fascinating and made me realize that perhaps Agent Smith in the Matrix, when he assessed the human race as a virus, probably should have identified them as a parasite. The book is also terrifying in some regards because there are parts where it explains where parasites go wrong. Parasites are essentially programmed to thrive in specific locations in your body (or some other creatures). So a parasite that gets lodged in your brain, but it's supposed to be in your stomach could end up killing the host. Or screw up which species it attaches itself to. From what I gathered, the parasites main focus isn't to kill the host, but to feed off of the host's life, so when a parasite is in the wrong spot it executes its program, but it ends up having terrifying affects on the host. In the end this was a phenomenal read and I can't recommend this enough. In fact I will probably read this a second time because when I read it the first time through I read it pretty quickly. One other thing this book made me not want to do is visit any location that's in the central area of the earth, such as the Amazon. Considering there have been 2,500 different parasites identified in one small location. Carl Zimmer is seriously the kind of writer we need in science to help transfer complex knowledge to the lay population."
22,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/930821-kate,4,"Fascinating book about the world of parasites! I became interested in parasites when I read Peeps by Scott Westerfeld, which started every chapter with a description of a different parasite. But I had no idea the huge effect they had on our lives today (for instance we may develop things like allergies because humans in american society are largely free of parasites). I learned a lot and I really liked the conversational style of the book. I wish there was an updated edition so that I could feel more current about my parasite knowledge!Let me introduce you to the guinea worm…It begins its innocuous life as a larva floating in fresh water. Until it is eaten by microscopic crustacean (copepod) where it matures into adolescence. Then some thirsty human, maybe you, comes by and drinks from water full of these microscopic crustaceans and delivers a shot of guinea worm straight to the gut. Guinea worms love our gut. To them, your stomach an intestines are like a fancy restaurant with dim lighting and violin music. After a female guinea worm mates with a male she takes a swift turn and heads for the meaty, artery filled leg where she sets up shop, growing up to 30 inches long...when she is ready to give birth to her larva she begins to work her way out...causing a blister on the leg (this is oh so very painful). When the blister bursts and the leg is submerged in water (she planned this all out you see), she pokes her head out and releases her larva into the water to start the cycle all over again! Once she shows her face, you will want to rip her right out of your leg...but beware, tear off her head and her body will die...while still in your leg...so instead of acting drastically, you must wrap her around a stick, and everyday turn the stick a little at a time...slowly, over the course of several days you remove the guinea worm from your leg. What your are left with is a worm wrapped around a stick, which is where we get the medical caduceus!Parasites are fascinating, and they are all around us. They impact our environments, our pets and ourselves (often without us even knowing they are there). This book will give you a fascinating and slightly terrifying introduction to our tiny friends and their hosts. "
23,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5876605-kam-yung-soh,5,"A fantastic book about parasites: how they live, how they invade hosts (including us) how they affect the environment and possibly, how we could use them to help the environment and our health.The book starts by looking at the history of how parasites were seen by us. Dismissed as 'degenerate' organisms for much of history, is it only now that we are learning how sophisticated and advanced parasites really are.The book then covers how parasites invade their hosts, showing that by sensing the environment and reacting appropriately, parasites can get into the hosts bodies and find their way to the correct places to feed, reproduce and create eggs. Zimmer then shows that while hosts' immune system can usually deal with bacteria and viruses, parasites have their own methods of evading detection or even subverting the hosts' immune system for their own ends.But subserving the hosts' immune system isn't the end of the story. The book shows that parasites can do more than that, by turning the hosts into 'zombies': unable to reproduce and acting to serve the parasites. From altering their behaviour to make their hosts more visible to predators (who serve as the next host for the parasites), Zimmer shows that parasites have a major impact on the ecosystems of the world by making food easier to find.The book next looks at the evolutionary history of parasites for, like the hosts, parasites evolve, either to evade changes in hosts immune system, or to exploit new hosts. And the evolutionary history of parasites is very complicated indeed. And it may appear that the evolution of parasites may have driven the evolution of hosts, forcing them to constantly evolve to evade the parasites and, possibly, even driving the evolution of sex.Finally, the book looks at the parasites that target us (directly or accidentally), showing how parasites have been the cause of must pain and suffering for humanity. Yet, in the end, we may need the parasites help if we are to save what is left of the environment and to improve our health.If you are interested in parasites, or even if you are not but wish to know more about the natural world, this is definitely a book to read."
24,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/699202-tom,4,"Carl Zimmer's outside-the-box Parasite Rex offers this reliable testament to evolution without design: a species of parasitic fluke enters its animal host by, like most, getting itself eaten and transported, through natural means, to the host's gut. This is precisely where the fluke wants to be. Once there, however, it burrows free and takes a tremendously circuitous passage through the host's bloodstream in order to get right back where it started, and, there, in the intestines, the parasite lives out the rest of its life. It does this not because an intelligent designer created it so, but because when the first of its species invaded the ancestor of the extant host, the fluke did not enter through the mouth, but through broken skin in the host's stomach. Once inside, then, the fluke relied on the bloodstream to carry it to the intestinal tract. But why it originally entered through the stomach is the arresting part: the animal host had not yet evolved legs long enough to keep its stomach outside the fluke's natural reach as it waded through water. Words will almost escape you to read Zimmer's description of this evolutionary holdover instead of mine.Chiefly, according to Zimmer, parasites have been influencing the path of evolution since the first single-celled organism got itself commandeered by a bacterium over three billion years ago, so much so that, because a host relies on variability in its species as a mode of defense against them, parasites may even be responsible for the invention of sex. Zimmer's thoughts on this premise, and others, are well-reasoned and sometimes brilliant. Well worth reading."
25,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8783847-ginger-bensman,5,"Parasite Rex: Inside the Bizarre World of Nature’s Most Dangerous Creatures is truly a paradigm changing book. I had a few settled and simplistic assumptions about parasites when I began reading Zimmer’s book—that parasites on the whole were dangerous and disgusting tagalong creatures (woe be the animal that ends up as the host of a parasite), that, if allowed to survive, parasites invariably suck the life out of their host, and finally, that the world would be a better place if parasites were entirely eliminated. The book gives some vivid examples of parasitic organisms (Trichinella spiralis—tapeworms, plasmodium—the parasite that causes malaria, parasitic wasps—Copidosoma, and others, just as fascinating) and charts a course through human theory, thought, and modern scientific observation. I came away with a new respect for our parasitic brethren. These organisms and animals have complex lives, are inventive and adaptive. They have shaped evolution in fundamental ways (thanks to parasites we are sexual beings—yes, really!). some parasites must change host species depending on the phase of their lifecycle. Parasites are wily and sophisticated, able to survive, even thrive, and sometimes make peace with their host’s immune systems. In fact, many parasites tailor their host’s behavior to enhance their own lives and survival. I came away understanding that these are magnificent organisms essential to the web of life on earth. Humans are only beginning to discover and appreciate them."
26,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2148446-don-fox,5,"This is a great book. It is very well researched, the science is thorough and well explained, and the writing in other respects is first-rate. What's more, the topic is utterly fascinating. There's certainly no danger you'll fall asleep reading, though there is a real danger you'll have nightmares once you do.Most amazing of all, however, is that this is actually an important book, such that if you are not at least somewhat conversant with its contents then you simply can't properly lay claim to a well-rounded grasp of biology, no matter how many PhD's you have. Parasitic species outnumber free living species by a very wide margin, they exert profound evolutionary pressure, they interact with their hosts in endlessly bizarre and convoluted ways, and they are ubiquitous, infecting virtually every living thing, including each other. Any description of any organism that does not also account for its common parasites and their effects is significantly incomplete.This book is a highly entertaining creep show, for sure, and one you're unlikely ever to forget. But it is also a great deal more than that. Brilliant."
27,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32324-clara,4,"Parasitology adds a mind-blowing dimension to ecology. For every free-living species, there are potentially 20 parasites that live within that species' biome (a given parasite will likely have multiple hosts over different life stages), and their symbiosis plays a crucial factor in the health of that biome. Although Parasite Rex initially takes a tone of parasite bashing (it's tempting to see them as an enemy), the real gems come in the final two chapters, when Zimmer explores how certain modern diseases may owe their prevalence to the decline of certain parasites that co-evolved with our immune systems; and the discussion of how invasive species may have advantages conferred not so much from native species' inability to compete, but from an absence of parasites that keep invading species in check in their native habitats. The presence -- and prevalence -- of parasites may confer positive effects on ecosystems, and their disappearance can have deleterious effects on their one-time hosts."
28,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4820006-alexis,5,"This book was totally eye-opening and made me newly appreciate parasites, both as drivers of evolution and as champions of bizarre niches. Did you know that the majority of the world's species are parasites? Or that having parasites greatly reduces your chances of having allergies and/or asthma? Or that some parasites can effectively take over their hosts minds, making them zombie organisms that move and make decisions based on the needs and wants of their parasite controllers?Carl Zimmer is a fantastic writer: colorful, imaginative, and humorous. He explains science in a way that I think is very accessible and interesting to non-scientists. If you're unsure of whether you'd like this book, listen to Zimmer being interviewed on the Radiolab podcast about parasites (http://www.radiolab.org/2009/sep/07/ )***Hmm...

29,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1343613-alex,4,"Another informative and entertaining read from Carl Zimmer. I occasionally found the book to be slightly disorganized, seeming at times like it was more stream of consciousness than carefully outlined. But this was rare and minor. A greater quibble I had with it was some statement of fact, that, as a scientist, I felt must surely have some points of equivocation. Zimmer's strength is in making science straightforward and easily understood, but in reality science rarely is actually this way. So it left me feeling like the complexity and possibly more interesting aspects of the story were left out in the interest of presenting as fact certain aspects of the wide world of parasitology. The greatest thing to be learned from this book? The recognition that parasites have, and like always will, be the kinds of the animal kingdom, rather than so many hangers-on."

So, watch out internet, Rusty may be posting several reviews over the next few weeks (by which, I mean, essentially, a blog post where I talk about whatever I want to, and at some point may or may not mention the book being reviewed). I think I may have mentioned my kid coming to visit me here. It was an awesome time. What I didn’t mention is that he has a habit of doing risky things and usually turning out okay in the end. Turns out, he had a plan of riding his motorcycle from his place in the southern US to the airport in New York to catch his flight (and later return), because, presumably, the flights were nominally cheaper. Most people that knew and cared for him advised him that this plan was somewhere between ‘monumental stupidity’ and ‘ill-conceived.’ But like many twentysomething men, the world was full of idiots and he was doing it anyway. Anyhow, he missed his flight here, as he was too busy shivering on the side of the interstate about 600 miles south of the airport when it took off. He racked up some motel costs as he called the airlines and made arrangements to fly out of the nearest airport and rebook his flight to Bermuda. But you know what? He made it. He said it was a lesson learned and an experience he’s glad he had. Satisfied that that was about as close as I’ll ever get to a ‘you were right’ sort of thing, my question about his return was simple: Is the return flight to NY? Or to the airport where your motorcycle is? Needless to say, hilarity ensued. Another round of rebooking, extra fees, and longer transit times followed. He couldn’t get to the airport his motorcycle was at because her return flight was through a different airline that did not service that airport. So he had to go to another city, get someone to take him via car up to his bike, then proceed to fix it (his thoughts on his bike: I’m not sure how the rear wheel didn’t fall off as I drove) and then make his way back home. Of course, there was a second round of historically bad weather and another bike breakdown with more shivering on the side of the highway. He ended up having to get someone to come get him because he simply couldn’t make it the last hundred miles or so. The costs of his plan were in the ballpark of a thousand dollars more than if he’d simply flown straight from his local airport. And he was forced to ask friends and family for favors during the holidays. But on the plus side, he cataloged the whole trip, videoing almost every waking moment, so I’m hoping for a Trains, Planes, and Automobiles type of film to come out of the whole ordeal. And then there was this book, which was about a jillion times more terrifying to me than thinking about my kid and his death wish. While this book has nothing at all to do with anything I’ve previously typed, it does connect for me because it makes it clear that life on this planet is a large scale war for survival and that we live in a sea of parasites that will eat your brain, your organs, your flesh, and make you dream of a quick death. They may change how you think, how you live, and how you act – only to benefit them – and make you believe it’s a great idea that you’re living your life based on what they need. Nightmares. All the world is a nightmare. Regardless, I feel I have to point out that this is the longest I have EVER wanted to read a book before I actually set down to read. I read a pre-release excerpt from it in Discover Magazine in what I think was the very late 90’s (could have been early 2000’s) and really wanted to give it a try then. It ended up taking me 20 years to finally get around to it. So, wow. Time flies."
33,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2072674-aj-payne,4,"I find parasites fascinating. Freaky and disturbing, but fascinating. Especially the ones that hijack living creatures to go against their instincts to do things solely to help the parasites. I've always been fascinated by the viruses and bacterias that, for example, force you to sneeze to expel them into new hosts, or force you to have diarrhea to get them back into the water supply. This book wasn't about viruses and bacteria, but about the bigger parasites that all living things live with.And it was super interesting. Zimmer is adept at taking scientific things and making them easy to understand for the lay reader while not getting too bogged down in the details. In this book he describes the history of parasitology, some of the freakiest things parasites do, and what the health of parasites means for the health of the earth. All of it well done and really interesting. Almost makes you want to run off back to school to become a parasitologist. Almost. "

The author jumped from topic to topic but it suited my attention span and in the end he showed the interconnection of the stories he told. And yes, I am indeed calling different ways parasites can infect other living beings as stories because the author had a very prosaic style of writing.

He describes how they affect certain species specifically and how parasites can end up altering entire ecosystems. He doesn’t touch on parasites in humans a whole lot (although the little he explains was interesting) but I found the rest of the book to be fascinating. Especially the last chapter, where Zimmer explains that as bad as most parasites are, they’re so ingrained and evolved that some species do worse without them. Highly recommend this if you enjoy reading biology or science!"

I thought it would be a list of various parasites and how they live, (similar to his other book, Planet of Viruses,) but this book actually deals more with parasites as a group.

53,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,5,"Ugh, yuck and yike!The prevalence of parasites in the earth's ecosystems is perhaps the worst of the dirty little secrets of life. According to science journalist Carl Zimmer, the majority of animal species are parasitic (p. 187). Bambi and Mickey Mouse had 'em, the sparrows outside your window are riddled with them, and you and I have them. What you'll read about here is how creatures insinuate themselves into other creatures and take control of them; how, for example, a wasp inserts its eggs into a caterpillar and how the larva eat the caterpillar's flesh, and other equally ghastly processes. The result is a view of life without rose colored glasses or any cute Disney characters.I had a dream one night before going to the dentist. I dreamed that there were scores of little white noodles like spaghetti coming out of my gums and tongue when I pressed them. Initially I thought this was a dream of the grooming instinct. But after reading Carl Zimmer's creepy but utterly fascinating book, I believe this primeval dream may have been a dream of parasites.In a sense this is the scariest book I have ever read. I had to put it aside twice because the horror depicted on its pages was affecting my usually buoyant state of mind. Make no mistake about it, however objectively we may try to view our fellow creatures, it is impossible (at least for me) to see parasites as anything other than ugly and despicable. (I'm working on it, however.)But Zimmer has an important purpose in writing this book aside from scaring us. He makes it clear that we cannot understand how an ecology works without understanding the role parasites play in that ecology. For example on page 111 we have wolves choosing to attack a moose that is slow and wheezing, a moose riddled with tapeworms, tapeworms seeking their final host, the wolf! The wolves are led to choose the infected moose perhaps by a scent in the moose's breath, created by the tapeworms. ""The thinning of the herd is an illusion, not the service of the predator but the side effect of a tapeworm traveling through its life.""In Chapter 3, ""The Thirty Years' War,"" Zimmer shows how the immune system fights against parasites. It is an excellent exposition on how the immune system works, and one of the highlights of the book. In the chapter ""Evolution from Within,"" we see parasites as a driving force in evolution. The idea that sexuality began as a way to fight disease, the so-called ""Red Queen"" hypothesis is presented. Zimmer shows how being different instead of a clone of the mother (asexual reproduction) can lead to characteristics that foil parasites. There are sixteen pages of glossy photos of parasites, several showing the grotesque heads of tapeworms in intimate detail. There are photos of a crustacean parasite that invades a fish's mouth, eats its tongue and then takes the place of the tongue.A question that might be asked is, what is a parasite? Certainly in biology a parasite is different than a symbiont, which is distinguished from a predator, etc. Zimmer gives Richard Dawkins's definition that ""Parasitism is any arrangement in which one set of DNA is replicated with the help of--and at the expense of--another set of DNA"" (p. 126). By this definition perhaps humans are parasites on Planet Gaia. Zimmer suggests as much on page 245 adding that ""There's no shame in being a parasite...But we are clumsy in the parasitic way of life."" He explains that expert parasites do no more harm than is necessary. ""If Gaia had an immune system, it might be disease and famine"" to keep ""an exploding species from taking over the world. But we have dodged these safeguards with medicines and toilets and other safeguards...""Zimmer ends the book on a rather cheery note: parasites as the canary in the coal mine. He argues that parasites are not only an indication of ecological health (plenty of parasites suggests a healthy ecosystem; a drop in their numbers suggests trouble, perhaps from pollution), but are vital to the ecology by keeping animal populations in check (pp. 241-243). He also gives some idea of how parasites might benefit us more directly, such as a fungus that invades insects as ""the source of cyclosporin, an important antibiotic"" or the use of blood-clotting molecules produced by hookworms as blood thinners in surgery (p. 238). Although there have been failures in the use of parasites to control insect populations, and Zimmer recounts two or three, there is also the story of how a parasitic wasp imported from South America saved the African cassava crop from mealybugs (pp. 220-228).As others have noted, reading this book will forever change the way you view the natural world, and might make you cancel that trip to the tropics. --Dennis Littrell, author of “The World Is Not as We Think It Is”"
54,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6093453-colin,4,"This is an oldie but a goodie.Parasite Rex is a broad overview, not just of its titular subject, but also of the ways that the notion of the parasite is evolving, and how it should be understood by people. It traces the genealogy of the study of parasitism from the origins of the word in Greek all the way to the 19th century disdain of such creatures as degenerate life forms and evolutionary dead ends that depend utterly upon their host and gave rise to the moral stigma associated with being called a parasite.Zimmer's project is to demonstrate just how complex and well-adapted parasites are as lifeforms, and the ways in which they play an important part in balancing their various ecosystems. Of course, the term parasite is a broad one; it can range from anything from a single celled organism to a large animal like a cuckoo that lays its eggs in the nests of other birds.Parasites are, to put it simply, organisms that are adapted to survive and reproduce at the partial expense of other creatures. Their playground is not the savannahs, hills and jungles of your typical animal, but the bodies of other organisms. In that respect they are as beautifully adapted to these environments as the gazelle is to the Serengeti.The bodies of organisms are treacherous places that have evolved immune responses to foreign invaders. In that respect, parasites are resourceful creatures that constantly innovate (via evolutionary adaptations) creative responses to thrive amidst it, ranging from hiding in plain sight within red blood cells, or constantly changing forms so that T-cells can't keep track of them.Having infested their hapless hosts, parasites need to ensure they are able to propagate to the next stage of their life cycles. And it is in this where parasites get much of their well-deserved reputation as nature's horrors - employing all sorts of creative but ghoulish ways to make their hosts serve their ends - from Sacculina turning male crabs into hapless castrated zombies, to toxoplasma gondii making rats more reckless to ensure they are eaten by cats, hence allowing the parasite to settle into its true feline home. Sometimes these adaptations allow the host to live relatively normal lives, albeit as unwitting Typhoid Marys; in other cases, the death of the host is the prerequisite of the flowering of the parasite into its succeeding life stage.But despite these macabre innovations, Carl Zimmer gives parasites their due as vital players in the diversity of life. Parasites may have played a role in accelerating the evolution of sexual reproduction, energy intensive as it might be, as a means of allowing animals to generate enough species diversity to throw off the pernicious effects of parasites.And parasites play a bigger role in ecosystems than might first appear. Consider the relationship between a predator and prey. The usual narrative is that predators keep populations in check and increase the health of the herd, because usually the weakest prey is the meal of the predator. But perhaps this salutary vision is just an illusion, and it is the parasite that weakens the host to allow it to be captured by the predator, which is its next presumptive host. Parasites, though ghoulish at times, may be the signifiers of healthy, robust ecosystems.Even human evolution has been shaped in large part because of the existence of parasites. We've evolved various responses to common parasites, so much so that in our modern industrialised society, the eradication of such parasites has indirectly led to the rise in new autoimmune diseases such as colitis, as well as an increase in allergies.Zimmer writes in a dense but approachable style, peppering the narrative with interesting stories and examples of parasites and their behaviors, painting an erudite picture of how we should think about the broader role that parasites play in the web of life. Written in the early 2000s as it is, perhaps some of the facts and hypotheses described have been validated or disproven, but ultimately, Parasite Rex still remains a comprehensive and engaging starter guide on how we should think about parasites.I give this: 4 out of 5 guinea worms"
55,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60074558-xander,3,"This book is superbly written: easy to follow, emphasizing the biology behind parasites withot getting too technical and mixing in some pieces of journalism (interviews with experts) with a scientific story. But enough about the book and its style: the content of the book is what it's all about. Zimmer describes how parasites make up most of the existing (and possibly extinct) forms of life on earth. But not only that, parasites are also an indication of the health of entire ecosystems: in natural habitats where parasites thrive in hosts, the ecology is a healthy balance, with the parasites keeping a check on the number of hosts, which in turn leads to a natural check on things like overgrazing and exhaustion of resources. Zimmer details this 'main' story with lots of examples of parasites. After reading this, a reader will be more aware of the importance of parasites for life itself, the impact of parasites on evolution (arms races, immune systems, etc.) and the complex life cycles of parasites - some species take different forms, living in different hosts, before reproducing and dying off (e.g. there are species of lancet flukes that take over the neural systems of ants, driving the ants up grass leaves, waiting to be eating by cattle, after which the fluke lays its eggs inside the intestines of a cow; the eggs get transported through the digestive canal and entire the nature through cow dung, after which the eggs hatch and find new ants to control and start a new life cycle - simply amazing!).The only moment of nuisance came at the last two pages (bummer...), where Zimmer compares the human race to a parasite, living of the totality of ecosystems on earth. The only difference between us and 'normal' parasites, according to Zimmer, is that we are an amateurish species of parasite: not keeping track of the condition of our host ('Gaia') and thereby exterminating ourselves. Apart from the issues about the ambiguous predictions of climate change and loss of biodiversity (especially their impact on humanity), the comparison is in another way misleading. There's only one earth; there's no species of Gaia's. This might sound like an argument some obscure armchair philosopher would concoct, but really it is a crucial one. By comparing humanity to parasites, Zimmer might give the impression that humanity can adapt to changes in the immune system of its host (earth), but the changes in earthly ecosystems (amongst other things) happen much faster than mankind's ability to procreate and thereby adapt. Not to mention the immense suffering of the people that are naturally 'weeded' out in this transitions Something we should not forget when trying to live within the natural boundaries of our little planet. (I guess in general it's a safe rule of thumb not to compare people with parasites at all).But I shouldn't end this review on such a boring note; I really enjoyed this book and apart from the last 2 pages I was (positively) amazed by the lively content - something I didn't expect before opening the book. An this is for a large part due to Zimmer's way of writing and his choices of the material. Well done Zimmer! (I guess it's only fair that Zimmer got a parasite named after himself, as he writes in the new epilogue: the Acanthobotrium zimmeri, a tapeworm living inside a newly discovered whip ray)."
56,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2915426-tippy-jackson,5,"Wow. Just wow. To begin, the first chapter is about defining a parasite and bemoaning the lack of parasite research and scientists. I found it boring and inconclusive. I kept pushing because I figured like most scientific writing once they get the definitions out of the way the good stuff comes. Seriously, that is exactly what happened. Don't give up on this book! It gets better and better as it goes. This book is well organized and split into clear section. In one of my favorites, it describes some of the absolutely astonishing ways parasites avoid being expelled from animals (including sometimes humans)by immune systems. The trickery! A body is a seriously hostile environment and the way these parasites will use their hosts own systems against them or keeps changing their skin so the host immune system doesn't recognize it. It's positively brilliant! They can hijack our own mechanisms to hide from us. It's crazy.There is another section on chemical mind control. I would have thought it would be my favorite, but all of the examples were ones I've already known. Still, parasites altering host behavior or turning hosts into zombies will never not be interesting. Then the author goes into details of parasite evolution, followed by how parasites shape the evolution of their hosts. Some of the experiments he mentions are very convincing and some of the ideas he shares are still in speculation and hypothesis phases, but all are really fascinating. Among my favorites are the development of allergies and human intestinal diseases that may have arisen from the current lack of parasites that our body has adapted to and the evolution of sex as a means of reproduction. He also briefly writes about how chimps may be self-medicating against parasites and he describes a few of the behavioral adaptations that have developed to avoid parasites (i.e. caterpillar poop canons. Lastly, he beautifully writes about the parasites' role in the world and their ecosystems as well as the importance of parasites to the balance of nature. Although always intrigued by them, I've never thought about how important they really are. They are! I swear! We need parasites! And I have never come across an argument for the parasites' place on this planet that is so convincing. He also provides decent reasoning for using parasites as indicator species. And gives the best description of the red queen hypothesis I have ever heard or read.A couple of the specifics I found interesting:page 181:""When a plant is attacked by a parasite, it defends itself with its own version of an immune system by creating poisonous chemicals that the parasite eats as it chews on the plant. But it also fights by sending out cries for help. When a caterpillar bites a leaf, the plant can sense it-a feeling not carried by nerves but felt nevertheless. And in response, the plant makes a particular kind of molecule that wafts into the air. The odor is like perfume for parasitic wasps; as they fly around searching for a host they are powerfully lured by the plant's smell. They follow it to the wounded leaf and find the caterpillar there, and they inject it with eggs. These conversations between plants and wasps are not only timely but precise. Somehow the plant can sense exactly which species of caterpillar is dining on it and spray the appropriate molecule into the air. A parasitic wasp will respond only if the plant lets it know that its own species of host sits on a leaf."" I've also heard of a spider that uses a chemical lure to attract moths and can determine what moths are in the area and choose the correspondingly appropriate chemical. But a plant??? Amazing.page 188-189:""Another way parasites might be able to create a new species is by mucking up the sex lives of their hosts. A bacterium called Wolbachia lives in 15 percent of all insects on Earth as well as many other invertebrates. It lives within its host's cells, and the only way it can infect a new host is by colonizing a female's eggs. When the egg that Wolbachia lives inside becomes fertilized and grows into an adult, it grows up with a case of Wolbachia infection. There's a downside to this way of life: if Wolbachia should grow up in a male it faces a dead end, because there are no eggs for it to infect. As a result, Wolbachia has taken control of its hosts' sex lives. In many of its host species, it tampers with the sperm of infected males so that they can successfully mate only with Wolbachia-carrying females. If on of these infected males should try to mate with a healthy female, all of their offspring will die. Wolbachia uses a different strategy in some species of wasps: normally these insects are born as males and females, which reproduce sexually, but when Wolbachia infects them, the wasps become female-only, able to mother only more females. By turning its hosts all female, the bacteria gives itself that many more hosts. In both these cases, Wolbachia genetically isolates the infected hosts from the uninfected ones. A newly born host will be the offspring of either Wolbachia-carrying parents or two healthy ones. It won't be a healthy-unhealthy hybrid. by setting up this reproductive wall, the parasite may be able to set the stage for a new species to form. Wolbachia is only the best-known parasite out of many to tamper with their hosts' sex lives, so this may turn out to be a common way new species form."" page 238:""Most medicines trace their genealogy to some natural compound in some organism, be it penicillin from a fungus or digitalis from foxglove. Only in the past few years have scientists begun to work their way through the parasite's pharmocopeia. Cordyceps, a fungus that invades insects and sprouts flowerlike stalks out of its body, is the source of cyclosporin, an important antibiotic. hookworms produce molecules that clasp perfectly with clotting factors in human blood, and biotechnology companies are putting them through trials as blood thinners for surgery. Ticks can also tamper with out blood to make their drinking easier, using chemicals that not only solve clots but reduce inflammation and kill bacteria that try to enter a wound. There are other parasitic tricks that still await an explanation. Blood flukes can steal substances out of our own blood to camouflage themselves from the immune system, but no one has figured out how they do it. If scientists did, they might be able to apply their discover to transplanted organs. A doctor might be able to pump a patient's blood through a donor lung and essentially turn it into a gigantic protected fluke. That could spare patients from the dangers of immune-suppressing drugs. And these are only a few parasites; who knows what sorts of chemicals the millions of other have evolved?""Overall, I would say that having at least some science background, particularly that of the immune system and evolution, will significantly increase your reading pleasure of this book. I feel like he tries to explain complicated biology and only partially succeeds, so if you already know what he's getting at then this will be more interesting. If that description fits you, I would highly recommend this book. It is awesome.BTW, for some shameless self-promotion, if you like reading about animals, check out my blog on wildlife at http://backyardzoologist.wordpress.com/"
57,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1879990-adam,5,"I love parasites so much I'm trying to write a fantasy novel about them. They're the most fascinating thing in nature in so many ways. I also loved Carl Zimmer's book She Has Her Mother's Laugh. I was guaranteed to love this and I did. I was obviously up to speed on a lot of the broad-strokes material here, but it never felt like it was wasting my time. A particular peril in books about gross or otherwise taboo subjects is that the author spends so much time talking about the attitudes they assume the audience brings in with them that they barely say anything meaningful about the subject. All the books about rats I've read have that issue. But Zimmer is genuinely curious and knows how to share the curiosity and insight of scientists past and present, and he wastes no time doing anything else. There are tons of wonderful new stories and ideas here, from the Kuchenmeister experiments to the simple semiotics of fluke navigation within the body to the obvious and elegant but somehow novel-to-me idea that humans are a parasite within the global ecosystem and find things to learn from other parasites in balancing that pursuit. The only disappointment really is that this feels massively too short. There's a part in the epilogue, written for the second edition, where Zimmer tells this story about how he learned about jewel wasps acting as parasitoids of cockroaches. And he even says, just as I as thinking the same thing, ""how did I write a whole book about parasites and never learn about this?"" Especially odd considering he does quote Darwin on Ichneumon wasps, and there's a whole section on biocontrol wasps. There are huge realms of parasitology that never come up. I had expected this to be twice as long as it is and cover twice as much and I guess that might not be a fair thing to dock a star (so I guess I won't) for but it just feels really short? Kleptoparasitism doesn't come, or inquilines, or strepsiptera. I would have loved to get Zimmer's more skeptical take on the parasite theory of politics, too. "
58,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19861338-erin-pallott,5,"If you read this, you might come away thinking that parasites are the most important organisms on the planet. I was already a big fan of them, but this book just solidified that. Carl Zimmer is a very popular science writer, and this book is a good example why. Here he gives a great introduction to parasitism and the field of parasitology through everyone's favourite method: the grizzly and gruesome details.This book provides great explanations of how the most deadly parasitic diseases have been so successful, as well as giving examples of lesser known examples that you might see in that one nature documentary (or your nightmares).Zimmer does a great job explaining the concepts of parasitism and showing their place in the bigger picture by expanding into the fields of evolution, medicine and history.Some of the more negative reviews have expressed that parts of this book are hard to read and aren't very accessibly to people who aren't in scientific fields. I would have to disagree and I think this book was written with a wide audience in mind. It is written very clearly (with a handy, long glossary at the back) and provides a lot of great analogies to explain scientific concepts in a way most people should understand. To make this book easier, it would either have to be much longer with lessons in basic biology between each chapter, or have some sections cut out entirely. As this is a scientific book, it shouldn't be a surprise if you do come across words that you have to Google or find some parts confusing. That is just part of science and if you knew it already, you wouldn't need to read the book. I could recommend this book to many people, whether they're someone who already knows some parasitology and wants to gain more knowledge on the subject, or someone that just wants to learn a bunch of cool gross facts to share with their friends and family at the dinner table."
59,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89613608-islomjon,4,"What are the true drivers of evolution? There are multiple answers for this held from various scientists. They consider that drivers are viruses, bacteria, humans, parasites, etc. Each one of them may give us competent arguments for it and they might be true. Yet parasites seem to hurt their hosts most: they give nothing and leave devastating outcomes from their presence, and the same time they lead us to evolve.Carl Zimmer in his book argues that parasites (no matter single celled or multi-cellular organisms) must be why there is an evolution. Furthermore, he masterfully described the micro world that we encounter every day, parasites that kill people, animals and plants. It was wonderful to note how parasites are masters in their metabolism, reproduction and maturing. They seemed more interesting than viruses. Yet they are living organisms and have a little automated orders to survive whatever it takes.However, there are parts that Zimmer had not discussed. For example, the clue of symbiosis that may play a crucial role in host and parasite connection, and perhaps parasites' unique genetics."

62,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4153215-rusty,4,"I’m going to try to get a little closer to current by the end of the year on my reviews. So, watch out internet, Rusty may be posting several reviews over the next few weeks (by which, I mean, essentially, a blog post where I talk about whatever I want to, and at some point may or may not mention the book being reviewed). I think I may have mentioned my kid coming to visit me here. It was an awesome time. What I didn’t mention is that he has a habit of doing risky things and usually turning out okay in the end. Turns out, he had a plan of riding his motorcycle from his place in the southern US to the airport in New York to catch his flight (and later return), because, presumably, the flights were nominally cheaper. Most people that knew and cared for him advised him that this plan was somewhere between ‘monumental stupidity’ and ‘ill-conceived.’ But like many twentysomething men, the world was full of idiots and he was doing it anyway. Anyhow, he missed his flight here, as he was too busy shivering on the side of the interstate about 600 miles south of the airport when it took off. He racked up some motel costs as he called the airlines and made arrangements to fly out of the nearest airport and rebook his flight to Bermuda. But you know what? He made it. He said it was a lesson learned and an experience he’s glad he had. Satisfied that that was about as close as I’ll ever get to a ‘you were right’ sort of thing, my question about his return was simple: Is the return flight to NY? Or to the airport where your motorcycle is? Needless to say, hilarity ensued. Another round of rebooking, extra fees, and longer transit times followed. He couldn’t get to the airport his motorcycle was at because her return flight was through a different airline that did not service that airport. So he had to go to another city, get someone to take him via car up to his bike, then proceed to fix it (his thoughts on his bike: I’m not sure how the rear wheel didn’t fall off as I drove) and then make his way back home. Of course, there was a second round of historically bad weather and another bike breakdown with more shivering on the side of the highway. He ended up having to get someone to come get him because he simply couldn’t make it the last hundred miles or so. The costs of his plan were in the ballpark of a thousand dollars more than if he’d simply flown straight from his local airport. And he was forced to ask friends and family for favors during the holidays. But on the plus side, he cataloged the whole trip, videoing almost every waking moment, so I’m hoping for a Trains, Planes, and Automobiles type of film to come out of the whole ordeal. And then there was this book, which was about a jillion times more terrifying to me than thinking about my kid and his death wish. While this book has nothing at all to do with anything I’ve previously typed, it does connect for me because it makes it clear that life on this planet is a large scale war for survival and that we live in a sea of parasites that will eat your brain, your organs, your flesh, and make you dream of a quick death. They may change how you think, how you live, and how you act – only to benefit them – and make you believe it’s a great idea that you’re living your life based on what they need. Nightmares. All the world is a nightmare. Regardless, I feel I have to point out that this is the longest I have EVER wanted to read a book before I actually set down to read. I read a pre-release excerpt from it in Discover Magazine in what I think was the very late 90’s (could have been early 2000’s) and really wanted to give it a try then. It ended up taking me 20 years to finally get around to it. So, wow. Time flies."
63,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2072674-aj-payne,4,"I find parasites fascinating. Freaky and disturbing, but fascinating. Especially the ones that hijack living creatures to go against their instincts to do things solely to help the parasites. I've always been fascinated by the viruses and bacterias that, for example, force you to sneeze to expel them into new hosts, or force you to have diarrhea to get them back into the water supply. This book wasn't about viruses and bacteria, but about the bigger parasites that all living things live with.And it was super interesting. Zimmer is adept at taking scientific things and making them easy to understand for the lay reader while not getting too bogged down in the details. In this book he describes the history of parasitology, some of the freakiest things parasites do, and what the health of parasites means for the health of the earth. All of it well done and really interesting. Almost makes you want to run off back to school to become a parasitologist. Almost. "

The author jumped from topic to topic but it suited my attention span and in the end he showed the interconnection of the stories he told. And yes, I am indeed calling different ways parasites can infect other living beings as stories because the author had a very prosaic style of writing.

He doesn’t touch on parasites in humans a whole lot (although the little he explains was interesting) but I found the rest of the book to be fascinating.

83,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,5,"Ugh, yuck and yike!The prevalence of parasites in the earth's ecosystems is perhaps the worst of the dirty little secrets of life. According to science journalist Carl Zimmer, the majority of animal species are parasitic (p. 187). Bambi and Mickey Mouse had 'em, the sparrows outside your window are riddled with them, and you and I have them. What you'll read about here is how creatures insinuate themselves into other creatures and take control of them; how, for example, a wasp inserts its eggs into a caterpillar and how the larva eat the caterpillar's flesh, and other equally ghastly processes. The result is a view of life without rose colored glasses or any cute Disney characters.I had a dream one night before going to the dentist. I dreamed that there were scores of little white noodles like spaghetti coming out of my gums and tongue when I pressed them. Initially I thought this was a dream of the grooming instinct. But after reading Carl Zimmer's creepy but utterly fascinating book, I believe this primeval dream may have been a dream of parasites.In a sense this is the scariest book I have ever read. I had to put it aside twice because the horror depicted on its pages was affecting my usually buoyant state of mind. Make no mistake about it, however objectively we may try to view our fellow creatures, it is impossible (at least for me) to see parasites as anything other than ugly and despicable. (I'm working on it, however.)But Zimmer has an important purpose in writing this book aside from scaring us. He makes it clear that we cannot understand how an ecology works without understanding the role parasites play in that ecology. For example on page 111 we have wolves choosing to attack a moose that is slow and wheezing, a moose riddled with tapeworms, tapeworms seeking their final host, the wolf! The wolves are led to choose the infected moose perhaps by a scent in the moose's breath, created by the tapeworms. ""The thinning of the herd is an illusion, not the service of the predator but the side effect of a tapeworm traveling through its life.""In Chapter 3, ""The Thirty Years' War,"" Zimmer shows how the immune system fights against parasites. It is an excellent exposition on how the immune system works, and one of the highlights of the book. In the chapter ""Evolution from Within,"" we see parasites as a driving force in evolution. The idea that sexuality began as a way to fight disease, the so-called ""Red Queen"" hypothesis is presented. Zimmer shows how being different instead of a clone of the mother (asexual reproduction) can lead to characteristics that foil parasites. There are sixteen pages of glossy photos of parasites, several showing the grotesque heads of tapeworms in intimate detail. There are photos of a crustacean parasite that invades a fish's mouth, eats its tongue and then takes the place of the tongue.A question that might be asked is, what is a parasite? Certainly in biology a parasite is different than a symbiont, which is distinguished from a predator, etc. Zimmer gives Richard Dawkins's definition that ""Parasitism is any arrangement in which one set of DNA is replicated with the help of--and at the expense of--another set of DNA"" (p. 126). By this definition perhaps humans are parasites on Planet Gaia. Zimmer suggests as much on page 245 adding that ""There's no shame in being a parasite...But we are clumsy in the parasitic way of life."" He explains that expert parasites do no more harm than is necessary. ""If Gaia had an immune system, it might be disease and famine"" to keep ""an exploding species from taking over the world. But we have dodged these safeguards with medicines and toilets and other safeguards...""Zimmer ends the book on a rather cheery note: parasites as the canary in the coal mine. He argues that parasites are not only an indication of ecological health (plenty of parasites suggests a healthy ecosystem; a drop in their numbers suggests trouble, perhaps from pollution), but are vital to the ecology by keeping animal populations in check (pp. 241-243). He also gives some idea of how parasites might benefit us more directly, such as a fungus that invades insects as ""the source of cyclosporin, an important antibiotic"" or the use of blood-clotting molecules produced by hookworms as blood thinners in surgery (p. 238). Although there have been failures in the use of parasites to control insect populations, and Zimmer recounts two or three, there is also the story of how a parasitic wasp imported from South America saved the African cassava crop from mealybugs (pp. 220-228).As others have noted, reading this book will forever change the way you view the natural world, and might make you cancel that trip to the tropics. --Dennis Littrell, author of “The World Is Not as We Think It Is”"
84,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6093453-colin,4,"This is an oldie but a goodie.Parasite Rex is a broad overview, not just of its titular subject, but also of the ways that the notion of the parasite is evolving, and how it should be understood by people. It traces the genealogy of the study of parasitism from the origins of the word in Greek all the way to the 19th century disdain of such creatures as degenerate life forms and evolutionary dead ends that depend utterly upon their host and gave rise to the moral stigma associated with being called a parasite.Zimmer's project is to demonstrate just how complex and well-adapted parasites are as lifeforms, and the ways in which they play an important part in balancing their various ecosystems. Of course, the term parasite is a broad one; it can range from anything from a single celled organism to a large animal like a cuckoo that lays its eggs in the nests of other birds.Parasites are, to put it simply, organisms that are adapted to survive and reproduce at the partial expense of other creatures. Their playground is not the savannahs, hills and jungles of your typical animal, but the bodies of other organisms. In that respect they are as beautifully adapted to these environments as the gazelle is to the Serengeti.The bodies of organisms are treacherous places that have evolved immune responses to foreign invaders. In that respect, parasites are resourceful creatures that constantly innovate (via evolutionary adaptations) creative responses to thrive amidst it, ranging from hiding in plain sight within red blood cells, or constantly changing forms so that T-cells can't keep track of them.Having infested their hapless hosts, parasites need to ensure they are able to propagate to the next stage of their life cycles. And it is in this where parasites get much of their well-deserved reputation as nature's horrors - employing all sorts of creative but ghoulish ways to make their hosts serve their ends - from Sacculina turning male crabs into hapless castrated zombies, to toxoplasma gondii making rats more reckless to ensure they are eaten by cats, hence allowing the parasite to settle into its true feline home. Sometimes these adaptations allow the host to live relatively normal lives, albeit as unwitting Typhoid Marys; in other cases, the death of the host is the prerequisite of the flowering of the parasite into its succeeding life stage.But despite these macabre innovations, Carl Zimmer gives parasites their due as vital players in the diversity of life. Parasites may have played a role in accelerating the evolution of sexual reproduction, energy intensive as it might be, as a means of allowing animals to generate enough species diversity to throw off the pernicious effects of parasites.And parasites play a bigger role in ecosystems than might first appear. Consider the relationship between a predator and prey. The usual narrative is that predators keep populations in check and increase the health of the herd, because usually the weakest prey is the meal of the predator. But perhaps this salutary vision is just an illusion, and it is the parasite that weakens the host to allow it to be captured by the predator, which is its next presumptive host. Parasites, though ghoulish at times, may be the signifiers of healthy, robust ecosystems.Even human evolution has been shaped in large part because of the existence of parasites. We've evolved various responses to common parasites, so much so that in our modern industrialised society, the eradication of such parasites has indirectly led to the rise in new autoimmune diseases such as colitis, as well as an increase in allergies.Zimmer writes in a dense but approachable style, peppering the narrative with interesting stories and examples of parasites and their behaviors, painting an erudite picture of how we should think about the broader role that parasites play in the web of life. Written in the early 2000s as it is, perhaps some of the facts and hypotheses described have been validated or disproven, but ultimately, Parasite Rex still remains a comprehensive and engaging starter guide on how we should think about parasites.I give this: 4 out of 5 guinea worms"
85,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60074558-xander,3,"This book is superbly written: easy to follow, emphasizing the biology behind parasites withot getting too technical and mixing in some pieces of journalism (interviews with experts) with a scientific story. But enough about the book and its style: the content of the book is what it's all about. Zimmer describes how parasites make up most of the existing (and possibly extinct) forms of life on earth. But not only that, parasites are also an indication of the health of entire ecosystems: in natural habitats where parasites thrive in hosts, the ecology is a healthy balance, with the parasites keeping a check on the number of hosts, which in turn leads to a natural check on things like overgrazing and exhaustion of resources. Zimmer details this 'main' story with lots of examples of parasites. After reading this, a reader will be more aware of the importance of parasites for life itself, the impact of parasites on evolution (arms races, immune systems, etc.) and the complex life cycles of parasites - some species take different forms, living in different hosts, before reproducing and dying off (e.g. there are species of lancet flukes that take over the neural systems of ants, driving the ants up grass leaves, waiting to be eating by cattle, after which the fluke lays its eggs inside the intestines of a cow; the eggs get transported through the digestive canal and entire the nature through cow dung, after which the eggs hatch and find new ants to control and start a new life cycle - simply amazing!).The only moment of nuisance came at the last two pages (bummer...), where Zimmer compares the human race to a parasite, living of the totality of ecosystems on earth. The only difference between us and 'normal' parasites, according to Zimmer, is that we are an amateurish species of parasite: not keeping track of the condition of our host ('Gaia') and thereby exterminating ourselves. Apart from the issues about the ambiguous predictions of climate change and loss of biodiversity (especially their impact on humanity), the comparison is in another way misleading. There's only one earth; there's no species of Gaia's. This might sound like an argument some obscure armchair philosopher would concoct, but really it is a crucial one. By comparing humanity to parasites, Zimmer might give the impression that humanity can adapt to changes in the immune system of its host (earth), but the changes in earthly ecosystems (amongst other things) happen much faster than mankind's ability to procreate and thereby adapt. Not to mention the immense suffering of the people that are naturally 'weeded' out in this transitions Something we should not forget when trying to live within the natural boundaries of our little planet. (I guess in general it's a safe rule of thumb not to compare people with parasites at all).But I shouldn't end this review on such a boring note; I really enjoyed this book and apart from the last 2 pages I was (positively) amazed by the lively content - something I didn't expect before opening the book. An this is for a large part due to Zimmer's way of writing and his choices of the material. Well done Zimmer! (I guess it's only fair that Zimmer got a parasite named after himself, as he writes in the new epilogue: the Acanthobotrium zimmeri, a tapeworm living inside a newly discovered whip ray)."
86,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2915426-tippy-jackson,5,"Wow. Just wow. To begin, the first chapter is about defining a parasite and bemoaning the lack of parasite research and scientists. I found it boring and inconclusive. I kept pushing because I figured like most scientific writing once they get the definitions out of the way the good stuff comes. Seriously, that is exactly what happened. Don't give up on this book! It gets better and better as it goes. This book is well organized and split into clear section. In one of my favorites, it describes some of the absolutely astonishing ways parasites avoid being expelled from animals (including sometimes humans)by immune systems. The trickery! A body is a seriously hostile environment and the way these parasites will use their hosts own systems against them or keeps changing their skin so the host immune system doesn't recognize it. It's positively brilliant! They can hijack our own mechanisms to hide from us. It's crazy.There is another section on chemical mind control. I would have thought it would be my favorite, but all of the examples were ones I've already known. Still, parasites altering host behavior or turning hosts into zombies will never not be interesting. Then the author goes into details of parasite evolution, followed by how parasites shape the evolution of their hosts. Some of the experiments he mentions are very convincing and some of the ideas he shares are still in speculation and hypothesis phases, but all are really fascinating. Among my favorites are the development of allergies and human intestinal diseases that may have arisen from the current lack of parasites that our body has adapted to and the evolution of sex as a means of reproduction. He also briefly writes about how chimps may be self-medicating against parasites and he describes a few of the behavioral adaptations that have developed to avoid parasites (i.e. caterpillar poop canons. Lastly, he beautifully writes about the parasites' role in the world and their ecosystems as well as the importance of parasites to the balance of nature. Although always intrigued by them, I've never thought about how important they really are. They are! I swear! We need parasites! And I have never come across an argument for the parasites' place on this planet that is so convincing. He also provides decent reasoning for using parasites as indicator species. And gives the best description of the red queen hypothesis I have ever heard or read.A couple of the specifics I found interesting:page 181:""When a plant is attacked by a parasite, it defends itself with its own version of an immune system by creating poisonous chemicals that the parasite eats as it chews on the plant. But it also fights by sending out cries for help. When a caterpillar bites a leaf, the plant can sense it-a feeling not carried by nerves but felt nevertheless. And in response, the plant makes a particular kind of molecule that wafts into the air. The odor is like perfume for parasitic wasps; as they fly around searching for a host they are powerfully lured by the plant's smell. They follow it to the wounded leaf and find the caterpillar there, and they inject it with eggs. These conversations between plants and wasps are not only timely but precise. Somehow the plant can sense exactly which species of caterpillar is dining on it and spray the appropriate molecule into the air. A parasitic wasp will respond only if the plant lets it know that its own species of host sits on a leaf."" I've also heard of a spider that uses a chemical lure to attract moths and can determine what moths are in the area and choose the correspondingly appropriate chemical. But a plant??? Amazing.page 188-189:""Another way parasites might be able to create a new species is by mucking up the sex lives of their hosts. A bacterium called Wolbachia lives in 15 percent of all insects on Earth as well as many other invertebrates. It lives within its host's cells, and the only way it can infect a new host is by colonizing a female's eggs. When the egg that Wolbachia lives inside becomes fertilized and grows into an adult, it grows up with a case of Wolbachia infection. There's a downside to this way of life: if Wolbachia should grow up in a male it faces a dead end, because there are no eggs for it to infect. As a result, Wolbachia has taken control of its hosts' sex lives. In many of its host species, it tampers with the sperm of infected males so that they can successfully mate only with Wolbachia-carrying females. If on of these infected males should try to mate with a healthy female, all of their offspring will die. Wolbachia uses a different strategy in some species of wasps: normally these insects are born as males and females, which reproduce sexually, but when Wolbachia infects them, the wasps become female-only, able to mother only more females. By turning its hosts all female, the bacteria gives itself that many more hosts. In both these cases, Wolbachia genetically isolates the infected hosts from the uninfected ones. A newly born host will be the offspring of either Wolbachia-carrying parents or two healthy ones. It won't be a healthy-unhealthy hybrid. by setting up this reproductive wall, the parasite may be able to set the stage for a new species to form. Wolbachia is only the best-known parasite out of many to tamper with their hosts' sex lives, so this may turn out to be a common way new species form."" page 238:""Most medicines trace their genealogy to some natural compound in some organism, be it penicillin from a fungus or digitalis from foxglove. Only in the past few years have scientists begun to work their way through the parasite's pharmocopeia. Cordyceps, a fungus that invades insects and sprouts flowerlike stalks out of its body, is the source of cyclosporin, an important antibiotic. hookworms produce molecules that clasp perfectly with clotting factors in human blood, and biotechnology companies are putting them through trials as blood thinners for surgery. Ticks can also tamper with out blood to make their drinking easier, using chemicals that not only solve clots but reduce inflammation and kill bacteria that try to enter a wound. There are other parasitic tricks that still await an explanation. Blood flukes can steal substances out of our own blood to camouflage themselves from the immune system, but no one has figured out how they do it. If scientists did, they might be able to apply their discover to transplanted organs. A doctor might be able to pump a patient's blood through a donor lung and essentially turn it into a gigantic protected fluke. That could spare patients from the dangers of immune-suppressing drugs. And these are only a few parasites; who knows what sorts of chemicals the millions of other have evolved?""Overall, I would say that having at least some science background, particularly that of the immune system and evolution, will significantly increase your reading pleasure of this book. I feel like he tries to explain complicated biology and only partially succeeds, so if you already know what he's getting at then this will be more interesting. If that description fits you, I would highly recommend this book. It is awesome.BTW, for some shameless self-promotion, if you like reading about animals, check out my blog on wildlife at http://backyardzoologist.wordpress.com/"
87,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1879990-adam,5,"I love parasites so much I'm trying to write a fantasy novel about them. They're the most fascinating thing in nature in so many ways. I also loved Carl Zimmer's book She Has Her Mother's Laugh. I was guaranteed to love this and I did. I was obviously up to speed on a lot of the broad-strokes material here, but it never felt like it was wasting my time. A particular peril in books about gross or otherwise taboo subjects is that the author spends so much time talking about the attitudes they assume the audience brings in with them that they barely say anything meaningful about the subject. All the books about rats I've read have that issue. But Zimmer is genuinely curious and knows how to share the curiosity and insight of scientists past and present, and he wastes no time doing anything else. There are tons of wonderful new stories and ideas here, from the Kuchenmeister experiments to the simple semiotics of fluke navigation within the body to the obvious and elegant but somehow novel-to-me idea that humans are a parasite within the global ecosystem and find things to learn from other parasites in balancing that pursuit. The only disappointment really is that this feels massively too short. There's a part in the epilogue, written for the second edition, where Zimmer tells this story about how he learned about jewel wasps acting as parasitoids of cockroaches. And he even says, just as I as thinking the same thing, ""how did I write a whole book about parasites and never learn about this?"" Especially odd considering he does quote Darwin on Ichneumon wasps, and there's a whole section on biocontrol wasps. There are huge realms of parasitology that never come up. I had expected this to be twice as long as it is and cover twice as much and I guess that might not be a fair thing to dock a star (so I guess I won't) for but it just feels really short? Kleptoparasitism doesn't come, or inquilines, or strepsiptera. I would have loved to get Zimmer's more skeptical take on the parasite theory of politics, too. "
88,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19861338-erin-pallott,5,"If you read this, you might come away thinking that parasites are the most important organisms on the planet. I was already a big fan of them, but this book just solidified that. Carl Zimmer is a very popular science writer, and this book is a good example why. Here he gives a great introduction to parasitism and the field of parasitology through everyone's favourite method: the grizzly and gruesome details.This book provides great explanations of how the most deadly parasitic diseases have been so successful, as well as giving examples of lesser known examples that you might see in that one nature documentary (or your nightmares).Zimmer does a great job explaining the concepts of parasitism and showing their place in the bigger picture by expanding into the fields of evolution, medicine and history.Some of the more negative reviews have expressed that parts of this book are hard to read and aren't very accessibly to people who aren't in scientific fields. I would have to disagree and I think this book was written with a wide audience in mind. It is written very clearly (with a handy, long glossary at the back) and provides a lot of great analogies to explain scientific concepts in a way most people should understand. To make this book easier, it would either have to be much longer with lessons in basic biology between each chapter, or have some sections cut out entirely. As this is a scientific book, it shouldn't be a surprise if you do come across words that you have to Google or find some parts confusing. That is just part of science and if you knew it already, you wouldn't need to read the book. I could recommend this book to many people, whether they're someone who already knows some parasitology and wants to gain more knowledge on the subject, or someone that just wants to learn a bunch of cool gross facts to share with their friends and family at the dinner table."
89,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89613608-islomjon,4,"What are the true drivers of evolution? There are multiple answers for this held from various scientists. They consider that drivers are viruses, bacteria, humans, parasites, etc. Each one of them may give us competent arguments for it and they might be true. Yet parasites seem to hurt their hosts most: they give nothing and leave devastating outcomes from their presence, and the same time they lead us to evolve.Carl Zimmer in his book argues that parasites (no matter single celled or multi-cellular organisms) must be why there is an evolution. Furthermore, he masterfully described the micro world that we encounter every day, parasites that kill people, animals and plants. It was wonderful to note how parasites are masters in their metabolism, reproduction and maturing. They seemed more interesting than viruses. Yet they are living organisms and have a little automated orders to survive whatever it takes.However, there are parts that Zimmer had not discussed. For example, the clue of symbiosis that may play a crucial role in host and parasite connection, and perhaps parasites' unique genetics."

92,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4153215-rusty,4,"I’m going to try to get a little closer to current by the end of the year on my reviews. So, watch out internet, Rusty may be posting several reviews over the next few weeks (by which, I mean, essentially, a blog post where I talk about whatever I want to, and at some point may or may not mention the book being reviewed). I think I may have mentioned my kid coming to visit me here. It was an awesome time. What I didn’t mention is that he has a habit of doing risky things and usually turning out okay in the end. Turns out, he had a plan of riding his motorcycle from his place in the southern US to the airport in New York to catch his flight (and later return), because, presumably, the flights were nominally cheaper. Most people that knew and cared for him advised him that this plan was somewhere between ‘monumental stupidity’ and ‘ill-conceived.’ But like many twentysomething men, the world was full of idiots and he was doing it anyway. Anyhow, he missed his flight here, as he was too busy shivering on the side of the interstate about 600 miles south of the airport when it took off. He racked up some motel costs as he called the airlines and made arrangements to fly out of the nearest airport and rebook his flight to Bermuda. But you know what? He made it. He said it was a lesson learned and an experience he’s glad he had. Satisfied that that was about as close as I’ll ever get to a ‘you were right’ sort of thing, my question about his return was simple: Is the return flight to NY? Or to the airport where your motorcycle is? Needless to say, hilarity ensued. Another round of rebooking, extra fees, and longer transit times followed. He couldn’t get to the airport his motorcycle was at because her return flight was through a different airline that did not service that airport. So he had to go to another city, get someone to take him via car up to his bike, then proceed to fix it (his thoughts on his bike: I’m not sure how the rear wheel didn’t fall off as I drove) and then make his way back home. Of course, there was a second round of historically bad weather and another bike breakdown with more shivering on the side of the highway. He ended up having to get someone to come get him because he simply couldn’t make it the last hundred miles or so. The costs of his plan were in the ballpark of a thousand dollars more than if he’d simply flown straight from his local airport. And he was forced to ask friends and family for favors during the holidays. But on the plus side, he cataloged the whole trip, videoing almost every waking moment, so I’m hoping for a Trains, Planes, and Automobiles type of film to come out of the whole ordeal. And then there was this book, which was about a jillion times more terrifying to me than thinking about my kid and his death wish. While this book has nothing at all to do with anything I’ve previously typed, it does connect for me because it makes it clear that life on this planet is a large scale war for survival and that we live in a sea of parasites that will eat your brain, your organs, your flesh, and make you dream of a quick death. They may change how you think, how you live, and how you act – only to benefit them – and make you believe it’s a great idea that you’re living your life based on what they need. Nightmares. All the world is a nightmare. Regardless, I feel I have to point out that this is the longest I have EVER wanted to read a book before I actually set down to read. I read a pre-release excerpt from it in Discover Magazine in what I think was the very late 90’s (could have been early 2000’s) and really wanted to give it a try then. It ended up taking me 20 years to finally get around to it. So, wow. Time flies."
93,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2072674-aj-payne,4,"I find parasites fascinating. Freaky and disturbing, but fascinating. Especially the ones that hijack living creatures to go against their instincts to do things solely to help the parasites. I've always been fascinated by the viruses and bacterias that, for example, force you to sneeze to expel them into new hosts, or force you to have diarrhea to get them back into the water supply. This book wasn't about viruses and bacteria, but about the bigger parasites that all living things live with.And it was super interesting. Zimmer is adept at taking scientific things and making them easy to understand for the lay reader while not getting too bogged down in the details. In this book he describes the history of parasitology, some of the freakiest things parasites do, and what the health of parasites means for the health of the earth. All of it well done and really interesting. Almost makes you want to run off back to school to become a parasitologist. Almost. "

The author jumped from topic to topic but it suited my attention span and in the end he showed the interconnection of the stories he told. And yes, I am indeed calling different ways parasites can infect other living beings as stories because the author had a very prosaic style of writing.

He doesn’t touch on parasites in humans a whole lot (although the little he explains was interesting) but I found the rest of the book to be fascinating. Especially the last chapter, where Zimmer explains that as bad as most parasites are, they’re so ingrained and evolved that some species do worse without them.

I thought it would be a list of various parasites and how they live, (similar to his other book, Planet of Viruses,) but this book actually deals more with parasites as a group. The author leaves you with a profound appreciation for how complicated parasites are, and for how big of an impact they have had on our lives.

113,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,5,"Ugh, yuck and yike!The prevalence of parasites in the earth's ecosystems is perhaps the worst of the dirty little secrets of life. According to science journalist Carl Zimmer, the majority of animal species are parasitic (p. 187). Bambi and Mickey Mouse had 'em, the sparrows outside your window are riddled with them, and you and I have them. What you'll read about here is how creatures insinuate themselves into other creatures and take control of them; how, for example, a wasp inserts its eggs into a caterpillar and how the larva eat the caterpillar's flesh, and other equally ghastly processes. The result is a view of life without rose colored glasses or any cute Disney characters.I had a dream one night before going to the dentist. I dreamed that there were scores of little white noodles like spaghetti coming out of my gums and tongue when I pressed them. Initially I thought this was a dream of the grooming instinct. But after reading Carl Zimmer's creepy but utterly fascinating book, I believe this primeval dream may have been a dream of parasites.In a sense this is the scariest book I have ever read. I had to put it aside twice because the horror depicted on its pages was affecting my usually buoyant state of mind. Make no mistake about it, however objectively we may try to view our fellow creatures, it is impossible (at least for me) to see parasites as anything other than ugly and despicable. (I'm working on it, however.)But Zimmer has an important purpose in writing this book aside from scaring us. He makes it clear that we cannot understand how an ecology works without understanding the role parasites play in that ecology. For example on page 111 we have wolves choosing to attack a moose that is slow and wheezing, a moose riddled with tapeworms, tapeworms seeking their final host, the wolf! The wolves are led to choose the infected moose perhaps by a scent in the moose's breath, created by the tapeworms. ""The thinning of the herd is an illusion, not the service of the predator but the side effect of a tapeworm traveling through its life.""In Chapter 3, ""The Thirty Years' War,"" Zimmer shows how the immune system fights against parasites. It is an excellent exposition on how the immune system works, and one of the highlights of the book. In the chapter ""Evolution from Within,"" we see parasites as a driving force in evolution. The idea that sexuality began as a way to fight disease, the so-called ""Red Queen"" hypothesis is presented. Zimmer shows how being different instead of a clone of the mother (asexual reproduction) can lead to characteristics that foil parasites. There are sixteen pages of glossy photos of parasites, several showing the grotesque heads of tapeworms in intimate detail. There are photos of a crustacean parasite that invades a fish's mouth, eats its tongue and then takes the place of the tongue.A question that might be asked is, what is a parasite? Certainly in biology a parasite is different than a symbiont, which is distinguished from a predator, etc. Zimmer gives Richard Dawkins's definition that ""Parasitism is any arrangement in which one set of DNA is replicated with the help of--and at the expense of--another set of DNA"" (p. 126). By this definition perhaps humans are parasites on Planet Gaia. Zimmer suggests as much on page 245 adding that ""There's no shame in being a parasite...But we are clumsy in the parasitic way of life."" He explains that expert parasites do no more harm than is necessary. ""If Gaia had an immune system, it might be disease and famine"" to keep ""an exploding species from taking over the world. But we have dodged these safeguards with medicines and toilets and other safeguards...""Zimmer ends the book on a rather cheery note: parasites as the canary in the coal mine. He argues that parasites are not only an indication of ecological health (plenty of parasites suggests a healthy ecosystem; a drop in their numbers suggests trouble, perhaps from pollution), but are vital to the ecology by keeping animal populations in check (pp. 241-243). He also gives some idea of how parasites might benefit us more directly, such as a fungus that invades insects as ""the source of cyclosporin, an important antibiotic"" or the use of blood-clotting molecules produced by hookworms as blood thinners in surgery (p. 238). Although there have been failures in the use of parasites to control insect populations, and Zimmer recounts two or three, there is also the story of how a parasitic wasp imported from South America saved the African cassava crop from mealybugs (pp. 220-228).As others have noted, reading this book will forever change the way you view the natural world, and might make you cancel that trip to the tropics. --Dennis Littrell, author of “The World Is Not as We Think It Is”"
114,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6093453-colin,4,"This is an oldie but a goodie.Parasite Rex is a broad overview, not just of its titular subject, but also of the ways that the notion of the parasite is evolving, and how it should be understood by people. It traces the genealogy of the study of parasitism from the origins of the word in Greek all the way to the 19th century disdain of such creatures as degenerate life forms and evolutionary dead ends that depend utterly upon their host and gave rise to the moral stigma associated with being called a parasite.Zimmer's project is to demonstrate just how complex and well-adapted parasites are as lifeforms, and the ways in which they play an important part in balancing their various ecosystems. Of course, the term parasite is a broad one; it can range from anything from a single celled organism to a large animal like a cuckoo that lays its eggs in the nests of other birds.Parasites are, to put it simply, organisms that are adapted to survive and reproduce at the partial expense of other creatures. Their playground is not the savannahs, hills and jungles of your typical animal, but the bodies of other organisms. In that respect they are as beautifully adapted to these environments as the gazelle is to the Serengeti.The bodies of organisms are treacherous places that have evolved immune responses to foreign invaders. In that respect, parasites are resourceful creatures that constantly innovate (via evolutionary adaptations) creative responses to thrive amidst it, ranging from hiding in plain sight within red blood cells, or constantly changing forms so that T-cells can't keep track of them.Having infested their hapless hosts, parasites need to ensure they are able to propagate to the next stage of their life cycles. And it is in this where parasites get much of their well-deserved reputation as nature's horrors - employing all sorts of creative but ghoulish ways to make their hosts serve their ends - from Sacculina turning male crabs into hapless castrated zombies, to toxoplasma gondii making rats more reckless to ensure they are eaten by cats, hence allowing the parasite to settle into its true feline home. Sometimes these adaptations allow the host to live relatively normal lives, albeit as unwitting Typhoid Marys; in other cases, the death of the host is the prerequisite of the flowering of the parasite into its succeeding life stage.But despite these macabre innovations, Carl Zimmer gives parasites their due as vital players in the diversity of life. Parasites may have played a role in accelerating the evolution of sexual reproduction, energy intensive as it might be, as a means of allowing animals to generate enough species diversity to throw off the pernicious effects of parasites.And parasites play a bigger role in ecosystems than might first appear. Consider the relationship between a predator and prey. The usual narrative is that predators keep populations in check and increase the health of the herd, because usually the weakest prey is the meal of the predator. But perhaps this salutary vision is just an illusion, and it is the parasite that weakens the host to allow it to be captured by the predator, which is its next presumptive host. Parasites, though ghoulish at times, may be the signifiers of healthy, robust ecosystems.Even human evolution has been shaped in large part because of the existence of parasites. We've evolved various responses to common parasites, so much so that in our modern industrialised society, the eradication of such parasites has indirectly led to the rise in new autoimmune diseases such as colitis, as well as an increase in allergies.Zimmer writes in a dense but approachable style, peppering the narrative with interesting stories and examples of parasites and their behaviors, painting an erudite picture of how we should think about the broader role that parasites play in the web of life. Written in the early 2000s as it is, perhaps some of the facts and hypotheses described have been validated or disproven, but ultimately, Parasite Rex still remains a comprehensive and engaging starter guide on how we should think about parasites.I give this: 4 out of 5 guinea worms"
115,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60074558-xander,3,"This book is superbly written: easy to follow, emphasizing the biology behind parasites withot getting too technical and mixing in some pieces of journalism (interviews with experts) with a scientific story. But enough about the book and its style: the content of the book is what it's all about. Zimmer describes how parasites make up most of the existing (and possibly extinct) forms of life on earth. But not only that, parasites are also an indication of the health of entire ecosystems: in natural habitats where parasites thrive in hosts, the ecology is a healthy balance, with the parasites keeping a check on the number of hosts, which in turn leads to a natural check on things like overgrazing and exhaustion of resources. Zimmer details this 'main' story with lots of examples of parasites. After reading this, a reader will be more aware of the importance of parasites for life itself, the impact of parasites on evolution (arms races, immune systems, etc.) and the complex life cycles of parasites - some species take different forms, living in different hosts, before reproducing and dying off (e.g. there are species of lancet flukes that take over the neural systems of ants, driving the ants up grass leaves, waiting to be eating by cattle, after which the fluke lays its eggs inside the intestines of a cow; the eggs get transported through the digestive canal and entire the nature through cow dung, after which the eggs hatch and find new ants to control and start a new life cycle - simply amazing!).The only moment of nuisance came at the last two pages (bummer...), where Zimmer compares the human race to a parasite, living of the totality of ecosystems on earth. The only difference between us and 'normal' parasites, according to Zimmer, is that we are an amateurish species of parasite: not keeping track of the condition of our host ('Gaia') and thereby exterminating ourselves. Apart from the issues about the ambiguous predictions of climate change and loss of biodiversity (especially their impact on humanity), the comparison is in another way misleading. There's only one earth; there's no species of Gaia's. This might sound like an argument some obscure armchair philosopher would concoct, but really it is a crucial one. By comparing humanity to parasites, Zimmer might give the impression that humanity can adapt to changes in the immune system of its host (earth), but the changes in earthly ecosystems (amongst other things) happen much faster than mankind's ability to procreate and thereby adapt. Not to mention the immense suffering of the people that are naturally 'weeded' out in this transitions Something we should not forget when trying to live within the natural boundaries of our little planet. (I guess in general it's a safe rule of thumb not to compare people with parasites at all).But I shouldn't end this review on such a boring note; I really enjoyed this book and apart from the last 2 pages I was (positively) amazed by the lively content - something I didn't expect before opening the book. An this is for a large part due to Zimmer's way of writing and his choices of the material. Well done Zimmer! (I guess it's only fair that Zimmer got a parasite named after himself, as he writes in the new epilogue: the Acanthobotrium zimmeri, a tapeworm living inside a newly discovered whip ray)."
116,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2915426-tippy-jackson,5,"Wow. Just wow. To begin, the first chapter is about defining a parasite and bemoaning the lack of parasite research and scientists. I found it boring and inconclusive. I kept pushing because I figured like most scientific writing once they get the definitions out of the way the good stuff comes. Seriously, that is exactly what happened. Don't give up on this book! It gets better and better as it goes. This book is well organized and split into clear section. In one of my favorites, it describes some of the absolutely astonishing ways parasites avoid being expelled from animals (including sometimes humans)by immune systems. The trickery! A body is a seriously hostile environment and the way these parasites will use their hosts own systems against them or keeps changing their skin so the host immune system doesn't recognize it. It's positively brilliant! They can hijack our own mechanisms to hide from us. It's crazy.There is another section on chemical mind control. I would have thought it would be my favorite, but all of the examples were ones I've already known. Still, parasites altering host behavior or turning hosts into zombies will never not be interesting. Then the author goes into details of parasite evolution, followed by how parasites shape the evolution of their hosts. Some of the experiments he mentions are very convincing and some of the ideas he shares are still in speculation and hypothesis phases, but all are really fascinating. Among my favorites are the development of allergies and human intestinal diseases that may have arisen from the current lack of parasites that our body has adapted to and the evolution of sex as a means of reproduction. He also briefly writes about how chimps may be self-medicating against parasites and he describes a few of the behavioral adaptations that have developed to avoid parasites (i.e. caterpillar poop canons. Lastly, he beautifully writes about the parasites' role in the world and their ecosystems as well as the importance of parasites to the balance of nature. Although always intrigued by them, I've never thought about how important they really are. They are! I swear! We need parasites! And I have never come across an argument for the parasites' place on this planet that is so convincing. He also provides decent reasoning for using parasites as indicator species. And gives the best description of the red queen hypothesis I have ever heard or read.A couple of the specifics I found interesting:page 181:""When a plant is attacked by a parasite, it defends itself with its own version of an immune system by creating poisonous chemicals that the parasite eats as it chews on the plant. But it also fights by sending out cries for help. When a caterpillar bites a leaf, the plant can sense it-a feeling not carried by nerves but felt nevertheless. And in response, the plant makes a particular kind of molecule that wafts into the air. The odor is like perfume for parasitic wasps; as they fly around searching for a host they are powerfully lured by the plant's smell. They follow it to the wounded leaf and find the caterpillar there, and they inject it with eggs. These conversations between plants and wasps are not only timely but precise. Somehow the plant can sense exactly which species of caterpillar is dining on it and spray the appropriate molecule into the air. A parasitic wasp will respond only if the plant lets it know that its own species of host sits on a leaf."" I've also heard of a spider that uses a chemical lure to attract moths and can determine what moths are in the area and choose the correspondingly appropriate chemical. But a plant??? Amazing.page 188-189:""Another way parasites might be able to create a new species is by mucking up the sex lives of their hosts. A bacterium called Wolbachia lives in 15 percent of all insects on Earth as well as many other invertebrates. It lives within its host's cells, and the only way it can infect a new host is by colonizing a female's eggs. When the egg that Wolbachia lives inside becomes fertilized and grows into an adult, it grows up with a case of Wolbachia infection. There's a downside to this way of life: if Wolbachia should grow up in a male it faces a dead end, because there are no eggs for it to infect. As a result, Wolbachia has taken control of its hosts' sex lives. In many of its host species, it tampers with the sperm of infected males so that they can successfully mate only with Wolbachia-carrying females. If on of these infected males should try to mate with a healthy female, all of their offspring will die. Wolbachia uses a different strategy in some species of wasps: normally these insects are born as males and females, which reproduce sexually, but when Wolbachia infects them, the wasps become female-only, able to mother only more females. By turning its hosts all female, the bacteria gives itself that many more hosts. In both these cases, Wolbachia genetically isolates the infected hosts from the uninfected ones. A newly born host will be the offspring of either Wolbachia-carrying parents or two healthy ones. It won't be a healthy-unhealthy hybrid. by setting up this reproductive wall, the parasite may be able to set the stage for a new species to form. Wolbachia is only the best-known parasite out of many to tamper with their hosts' sex lives, so this may turn out to be a common way new species form."" page 238:""Most medicines trace their genealogy to some natural compound in some organism, be it penicillin from a fungus or digitalis from foxglove. Only in the past few years have scientists begun to work their way through the parasite's pharmocopeia. Cordyceps, a fungus that invades insects and sprouts flowerlike stalks out of its body, is the source of cyclosporin, an important antibiotic. hookworms produce molecules that clasp perfectly with clotting factors in human blood, and biotechnology companies are putting them through trials as blood thinners for surgery. Ticks can also tamper with out blood to make their drinking easier, using chemicals that not only solve clots but reduce inflammation and kill bacteria that try to enter a wound. There are other parasitic tricks that still await an explanation. Blood flukes can steal substances out of our own blood to camouflage themselves from the immune system, but no one has figured out how they do it. If scientists did, they might be able to apply their discover to transplanted organs. A doctor might be able to pump a patient's blood through a donor lung and essentially turn it into a gigantic protected fluke. That could spare patients from the dangers of immune-suppressing drugs. And these are only a few parasites; who knows what sorts of chemicals the millions of other have evolved?""Overall, I would say that having at least some science background, particularly that of the immune system and evolution, will significantly increase your reading pleasure of this book. I feel like he tries to explain complicated biology and only partially succeeds, so if you already know what he's getting at then this will be more interesting. If that description fits you, I would highly recommend this book. It is awesome.BTW, for some shameless self-promotion, if you like reading about animals, check out my blog on wildlife at http://backyardzoologist.wordpress.com/"
117,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1879990-adam,5,"I love parasites so much I'm trying to write a fantasy novel about them. They're the most fascinating thing in nature in so many ways. I also loved Carl Zimmer's book She Has Her Mother's Laugh. I was guaranteed to love this and I did. I was obviously up to speed on a lot of the broad-strokes material here, but it never felt like it was wasting my time. A particular peril in books about gross or otherwise taboo subjects is that the author spends so much time talking about the attitudes they assume the audience brings in with them that they barely say anything meaningful about the subject. All the books about rats I've read have that issue. But Zimmer is genuinely curious and knows how to share the curiosity and insight of scientists past and present, and he wastes no time doing anything else. There are tons of wonderful new stories and ideas here, from the Kuchenmeister experiments to the simple semiotics of fluke navigation within the body to the obvious and elegant but somehow novel-to-me idea that humans are a parasite within the global ecosystem and find things to learn from other parasites in balancing that pursuit. The only disappointment really is that this feels massively too short. There's a part in the epilogue, written for the second edition, where Zimmer tells this story about how he learned about jewel wasps acting as parasitoids of cockroaches. And he even says, just as I as thinking the same thing, ""how did I write a whole book about parasites and never learn about this?"" Especially odd considering he does quote Darwin on Ichneumon wasps, and there's a whole section on biocontrol wasps. There are huge realms of parasitology that never come up. I had expected this to be twice as long as it is and cover twice as much and I guess that might not be a fair thing to dock a star (so I guess I won't) for but it just feels really short? Kleptoparasitism doesn't come, or inquilines, or strepsiptera. I would have loved to get Zimmer's more skeptical take on the parasite theory of politics, too. "
118,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19861338-erin-pallott,5,"If you read this, you might come away thinking that parasites are the most important organisms on the planet. I was already a big fan of them, but this book just solidified that. Carl Zimmer is a very popular science writer, and this book is a good example why. Here he gives a great introduction to parasitism and the field of parasitology through everyone's favourite method: the grizzly and gruesome details.This book provides great explanations of how the most deadly parasitic diseases have been so successful, as well as giving examples of lesser known examples that you might see in that one nature documentary (or your nightmares).Zimmer does a great job explaining the concepts of parasitism and showing their place in the bigger picture by expanding into the fields of evolution, medicine and history.Some of the more negative reviews have expressed that parts of this book are hard to read and aren't very accessibly to people who aren't in scientific fields. I would have to disagree and I think this book was written with a wide audience in mind. It is written very clearly (with a handy, long glossary at the back) and provides a lot of great analogies to explain scientific concepts in a way most people should understand. To make this book easier, it would either have to be much longer with lessons in basic biology between each chapter, or have some sections cut out entirely. As this is a scientific book, it shouldn't be a surprise if you do come across words that you have to Google or find some parts confusing. That is just part of science and if you knew it already, you wouldn't need to read the book. I could recommend this book to many people, whether they're someone who already knows some parasitology and wants to gain more knowledge on the subject, or someone that just wants to learn a bunch of cool gross facts to share with their friends and family at the dinner table."
119,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89613608-islomjon,4,"What are the true drivers of evolution? There are multiple answers for this held from various scientists. They consider that drivers are viruses, bacteria, humans, parasites, etc. Each one of them may give us competent arguments for it and they might be true. Yet parasites seem to hurt their hosts most: they give nothing and leave devastating outcomes from their presence, and the same time they lead us to evolve.Carl Zimmer in his book argues that parasites (no matter single celled or multi-cellular organisms) must be why there is an evolution. Furthermore, he masterfully described the micro world that we encounter every day, parasites that kill people, animals and plants. It was wonderful to note how parasites are masters in their metabolism, reproduction and maturing. They seemed more interesting than viruses. Yet they are living organisms and have a little automated orders to survive whatever it takes.However, there are parts that Zimmer had not discussed. For example, the clue of symbiosis that may play a crucial role in host and parasite connection, and perhaps parasites' unique genetics."

122,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4153215-rusty,4,"I’m going to try to get a little closer to current by the end of the year on my reviews. So, watch out internet, Rusty may be posting several reviews over the next few weeks (by which, I mean, essentially, a blog post where I talk about whatever I want to, and at some point may or may not mention the book being reviewed). I think I may have mentioned my kid coming to visit me here. It was an awesome time. What I didn’t mention is that he has a habit of doing risky things and usually turning out okay in the end. Turns out, he had a plan of riding his motorcycle from his place in the southern US to the airport in New York to catch his flight (and later return), because, presumably, the flights were nominally cheaper. Most people that knew and cared for him advised him that this plan was somewhere between ‘monumental stupidity’ and ‘ill-conceived.’ But like many twentysomething men, the world was full of idiots and he was doing it anyway. Anyhow, he missed his flight here, as he was too busy shivering on the side of the interstate about 600 miles south of the airport when it took off. He racked up some motel costs as he called the airlines and made arrangements to fly out of the nearest airport and rebook his flight to Bermuda. But you know what? He made it. He said it was a lesson learned and an experience he’s glad he had. Satisfied that that was about as close as I’ll ever get to a ‘you were right’ sort of thing, my question about his return was simple: Is the return flight to NY? Or to the airport where your motorcycle is? Needless to say, hilarity ensued. Another round of rebooking, extra fees, and longer transit times followed. He couldn’t get to the airport his motorcycle was at because her return flight was through a different airline that did not service that airport. So he had to go to another city, get someone to take him via car up to his bike, then proceed to fix it (his thoughts on his bike: I’m not sure how the rear wheel didn’t fall off as I drove) and then make his way back home. Of course, there was a second round of historically bad weather and another bike breakdown with more shivering on the side of the highway. He ended up having to get someone to come get him because he simply couldn’t make it the last hundred miles or so. The costs of his plan were in the ballpark of a thousand dollars more than if he’d simply flown straight from his local airport. And he was forced to ask friends and family for favors during the holidays. But on the plus side, he cataloged the whole trip, videoing almost every waking moment, so I’m hoping for a Trains, Planes, and Automobiles type of film to come out of the whole ordeal. And then there was this book, which was about a jillion times more terrifying to me than thinking about my kid and his death wish. While this book has nothing at all to do with anything I’ve previously typed, it does connect for me because it makes it clear that life on this planet is a large scale war for survival and that we live in a sea of parasites that will eat your brain, your organs, your flesh, and make you dream of a quick death. They may change how you think, how you live, and how you act – only to benefit them – and make you believe it’s a great idea that you’re living your life based on what they need. Nightmares. All the world is a nightmare. Regardless, I feel I have to point out that this is the longest I have EVER wanted to read a book before I actually set down to read. I read a pre-release excerpt from it in Discover Magazine in what I think was the very late 90’s (could have been early 2000’s) and really wanted to give it a try then. It ended up taking me 20 years to finally get around to it. So, wow. Time flies."
123,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2072674-aj-payne,4,"I find parasites fascinating. Freaky and disturbing, but fascinating. Especially the ones that hijack living creatures to go against their instincts to do things solely to help the parasites. I've always been fascinated by the viruses and bacterias that, for example, force you to sneeze to expel them into new hosts, or force you to have diarrhea to get them back into the water supply. This book wasn't about viruses and bacteria, but about the bigger parasites that all living things live with.And it was super interesting. Zimmer is adept at taking scientific things and making them easy to understand for the lay reader while not getting too bogged down in the details. In this book he describes the history of parasitology, some of the freakiest things parasites do, and what the health of parasites means for the health of the earth. All of it well done and really interesting. Almost makes you want to run off back to school to become a parasitologist. Almost. "

The author jumped from topic to topic but it suited my attention span and in the end he showed the interconnection of the stories he told. And yes, I am indeed calling different ways parasites can infect other living beings as stories because the author had a very prosaic style of writing. If you're interested in random kinda gross biological facts I recommend this book."

Zimmer shares examples of various parasites, their behaviors and how they evolved into master manipulators. He describes how they affect certain species specifically and how parasites can end up altering entire ecosystems. He doesn’t touch on parasites in humans a whole lot (although the little he explains was interesting) but I found the rest of the book to be fascinating. Especially the last chapter, where Zimmer explains that as bad as most parasites are, they’re so ingrained and evolved that some species do worse without them. Highly recommend this if you enjoy reading biology or science!"

It wasn't what I was expecting, but I really enjoyed it. I thought it would be a list of various parasites and how they live, (similar to his other book, Planet of Viruses,) but this book actually deals more with parasites as a group. The author leaves you with a profound appreciation for how complicated parasites are, and for how big of an impact they have had on our lives.

Beyond the creep factor, there is much here to think about. For example, does a healthy ecosystem actually depend on parasites to thrive? How much of evolution occurs in the partnership between parasite and host? The human animal lives in a web of connections— most of which we try very hard to ignore. Yet the health of an ecosystem may actually depend on the balance between parasites and host. "

This book does a great job of showing us the world of parasites. Even though parasites are simple creatures they are very effective at what they do. Many parasites redirect or control the behavior the the host they are infecting. Even human behavior is controlled when the human is infected with particular parasites. This is a surprisingly thought provoking book. Definitely worth reading!

143,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,5,"Ugh, yuck and yike!The prevalence of parasites in the earth's ecosystems is perhaps the worst of the dirty little secrets of life. According to science journalist Carl Zimmer, the majority of animal species are parasitic (p. 187). Bambi and Mickey Mouse had 'em, the sparrows outside your window are riddled with them, and you and I have them. What you'll read about here is how creatures insinuate themselves into other creatures and take control of them; how, for example, a wasp inserts its eggs into a caterpillar and how the larva eat the caterpillar's flesh, and other equally ghastly processes. The result is a view of life without rose colored glasses or any cute Disney characters.I had a dream one night before going to the dentist. I dreamed that there were scores of little white noodles like spaghetti coming out of my gums and tongue when I pressed them. Initially I thought this was a dream of the grooming instinct. But after reading Carl Zimmer's creepy but utterly fascinating book, I believe this primeval dream may have been a dream of parasites.In a sense this is the scariest book I have ever read. I had to put it aside twice because the horror depicted on its pages was affecting my usually buoyant state of mind. Make no mistake about it, however objectively we may try to view our fellow creatures, it is impossible (at least for me) to see parasites as anything other than ugly and despicable. (I'm working on it, however.)But Zimmer has an important purpose in writing this book aside from scaring us. He makes it clear that we cannot understand how an ecology works without understanding the role parasites play in that ecology. For example on page 111 we have wolves choosing to attack a moose that is slow and wheezing, a moose riddled with tapeworms, tapeworms seeking their final host, the wolf! The wolves are led to choose the infected moose perhaps by a scent in the moose's breath, created by the tapeworms. ""The thinning of the herd is an illusion, not the service of the predator but the side effect of a tapeworm traveling through its life.""In Chapter 3, ""The Thirty Years' War,"" Zimmer shows how the immune system fights against parasites. It is an excellent exposition on how the immune system works, and one of the highlights of the book. In the chapter ""Evolution from Within,"" we see parasites as a driving force in evolution. The idea that sexuality began as a way to fight disease, the so-called ""Red Queen"" hypothesis is presented. Zimmer shows how being different instead of a clone of the mother (asexual reproduction) can lead to characteristics that foil parasites. There are sixteen pages of glossy photos of parasites, several showing the grotesque heads of tapeworms in intimate detail. There are photos of a crustacean parasite that invades a fish's mouth, eats its tongue and then takes the place of the tongue.A question that might be asked is, what is a parasite? Certainly in biology a parasite is different than a symbiont, which is distinguished from a predator, etc. Zimmer gives Richard Dawkins's definition that ""Parasitism is any arrangement in which one set of DNA is replicated with the help of--and at the expense of--another set of DNA"" (p. 126). By this definition perhaps humans are parasites on Planet Gaia. Zimmer suggests as much on page 245 adding that ""There's no shame in being a parasite...But we are clumsy in the parasitic way of life."" He explains that expert parasites do no more harm than is necessary. ""If Gaia had an immune system, it might be disease and famine"" to keep ""an exploding species from taking over the world. But we have dodged these safeguards with medicines and toilets and other safeguards...""Zimmer ends the book on a rather cheery note: parasites as the canary in the coal mine. He argues that parasites are not only an indication of ecological health (plenty of parasites suggests a healthy ecosystem; a drop in their numbers suggests trouble, perhaps from pollution), but are vital to the ecology by keeping animal populations in check (pp. 241-243). He also gives some idea of how parasites might benefit us more directly, such as a fungus that invades insects as ""the source of cyclosporin, an important antibiotic"" or the use of blood-clotting molecules produced by hookworms as blood thinners in surgery (p. 238). Although there have been failures in the use of parasites to control insect populations, and Zimmer recounts two or three, there is also the story of how a parasitic wasp imported from South America saved the African cassava crop from mealybugs (pp. 220-228).As others have noted, reading this book will forever change the way you view the natural world, and might make you cancel that trip to the tropics. --Dennis Littrell, author of “The World Is Not as We Think It Is”"
144,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6093453-colin,4,"This is an oldie but a goodie.Parasite Rex is a broad overview, not just of its titular subject, but also of the ways that the notion of the parasite is evolving, and how it should be understood by people. It traces the genealogy of the study of parasitism from the origins of the word in Greek all the way to the 19th century disdain of such creatures as degenerate life forms and evolutionary dead ends that depend utterly upon their host and gave rise to the moral stigma associated with being called a parasite.Zimmer's project is to demonstrate just how complex and well-adapted parasites are as lifeforms, and the ways in which they play an important part in balancing their various ecosystems. Of course, the term parasite is a broad one; it can range from anything from a single celled organism to a large animal like a cuckoo that lays its eggs in the nests of other birds.Parasites are, to put it simply, organisms that are adapted to survive and reproduce at the partial expense of other creatures. Their playground is not the savannahs, hills and jungles of your typical animal, but the bodies of other organisms. In that respect they are as beautifully adapted to these environments as the gazelle is to the Serengeti.The bodies of organisms are treacherous places that have evolved immune responses to foreign invaders. In that respect, parasites are resourceful creatures that constantly innovate (via evolutionary adaptations) creative responses to thrive amidst it, ranging from hiding in plain sight within red blood cells, or constantly changing forms so that T-cells can't keep track of them.Having infested their hapless hosts, parasites need to ensure they are able to propagate to the next stage of their life cycles. And it is in this where parasites get much of their well-deserved reputation as nature's horrors - employing all sorts of creative but ghoulish ways to make their hosts serve their ends - from Sacculina turning male crabs into hapless castrated zombies, to toxoplasma gondii making rats more reckless to ensure they are eaten by cats, hence allowing the parasite to settle into its true feline home. Sometimes these adaptations allow the host to live relatively normal lives, albeit as unwitting Typhoid Marys; in other cases, the death of the host is the prerequisite of the flowering of the parasite into its succeeding life stage.But despite these macabre innovations, Carl Zimmer gives parasites their due as vital players in the diversity of life. Parasites may have played a role in accelerating the evolution of sexual reproduction, energy intensive as it might be, as a means of allowing animals to generate enough species diversity to throw off the pernicious effects of parasites.And parasites play a bigger role in ecosystems than might first appear. Consider the relationship between a predator and prey. The usual narrative is that predators keep populations in check and increase the health of the herd, because usually the weakest prey is the meal of the predator. But perhaps this salutary vision is just an illusion, and it is the parasite that weakens the host to allow it to be captured by the predator, which is its next presumptive host. Parasites, though ghoulish at times, may be the signifiers of healthy, robust ecosystems.Even human evolution has been shaped in large part because of the existence of parasites. We've evolved various responses to common parasites, so much so that in our modern industrialised society, the eradication of such parasites has indirectly led to the rise in new autoimmune diseases such as colitis, as well as an increase in allergies.Zimmer writes in a dense but approachable style, peppering the narrative with interesting stories and examples of parasites and their behaviors, painting an erudite picture of how we should think about the broader role that parasites play in the web of life. Written in the early 2000s as it is, perhaps some of the facts and hypotheses described have been validated or disproven, but ultimately, Parasite Rex still remains a comprehensive and engaging starter guide on how we should think about parasites.I give this: 4 out of 5 guinea worms"
145,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60074558-xander,3,"This book is superbly written: easy to follow, emphasizing the biology behind parasites withot getting too technical and mixing in some pieces of journalism (interviews with experts) with a scientific story. But enough about the book and its style: the content of the book is what it's all about. Zimmer describes how parasites make up most of the existing (and possibly extinct) forms of life on earth. But not only that, parasites are also an indication of the health of entire ecosystems: in natural habitats where parasites thrive in hosts, the ecology is a healthy balance, with the parasites keeping a check on the number of hosts, which in turn leads to a natural check on things like overgrazing and exhaustion of resources. Zimmer details this 'main' story with lots of examples of parasites. After reading this, a reader will be more aware of the importance of parasites for life itself, the impact of parasites on evolution (arms races, immune systems, etc.) and the complex life cycles of parasites - some species take different forms, living in different hosts, before reproducing and dying off (e.g. there are species of lancet flukes that take over the neural systems of ants, driving the ants up grass leaves, waiting to be eating by cattle, after which the fluke lays its eggs inside the intestines of a cow; the eggs get transported through the digestive canal and entire the nature through cow dung, after which the eggs hatch and find new ants to control and start a new life cycle - simply amazing!).The only moment of nuisance came at the last two pages (bummer...), where Zimmer compares the human race to a parasite, living of the totality of ecosystems on earth. The only difference between us and 'normal' parasites, according to Zimmer, is that we are an amateurish species of parasite: not keeping track of the condition of our host ('Gaia') and thereby exterminating ourselves. Apart from the issues about the ambiguous predictions of climate change and loss of biodiversity (especially their impact on humanity), the comparison is in another way misleading. There's only one earth; there's no species of Gaia's. This might sound like an argument some obscure armchair philosopher would concoct, but really it is a crucial one. By comparing humanity to parasites, Zimmer might give the impression that humanity can adapt to changes in the immune system of its host (earth), but the changes in earthly ecosystems (amongst other things) happen much faster than mankind's ability to procreate and thereby adapt. Not to mention the immense suffering of the people that are naturally 'weeded' out in this transitions Something we should not forget when trying to live within the natural boundaries of our little planet. (I guess in general it's a safe rule of thumb not to compare people with parasites at all).But I shouldn't end this review on such a boring note; I really enjoyed this book and apart from the last 2 pages I was (positively) amazed by the lively content - something I didn't expect before opening the book. An this is for a large part due to Zimmer's way of writing and his choices of the material. Well done Zimmer! (I guess it's only fair that Zimmer got a parasite named after himself, as he writes in the new epilogue: the Acanthobotrium zimmeri, a tapeworm living inside a newly discovered whip ray)."
146,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2915426-tippy-jackson,5,"Wow. Just wow. To begin, the first chapter is about defining a parasite and bemoaning the lack of parasite research and scientists. I found it boring and inconclusive. I kept pushing because I figured like most scientific writing once they get the definitions out of the way the good stuff comes. Seriously, that is exactly what happened. Don't give up on this book! It gets better and better as it goes. This book is well organized and split into clear section. In one of my favorites, it describes some of the absolutely astonishing ways parasites avoid being expelled from animals (including sometimes humans)by immune systems. The trickery! A body is a seriously hostile environment and the way these parasites will use their hosts own systems against them or keeps changing their skin so the host immune system doesn't recognize it. It's positively brilliant! They can hijack our own mechanisms to hide from us. It's crazy.There is another section on chemical mind control. I would have thought it would be my favorite, but all of the examples were ones I've already known. Still, parasites altering host behavior or turning hosts into zombies will never not be interesting. Then the author goes into details of parasite evolution, followed by how parasites shape the evolution of their hosts. Some of the experiments he mentions are very convincing and some of the ideas he shares are still in speculation and hypothesis phases, but all are really fascinating. Among my favorites are the development of allergies and human intestinal diseases that may have arisen from the current lack of parasites that our body has adapted to and the evolution of sex as a means of reproduction. He also briefly writes about how chimps may be self-medicating against parasites and he describes a few of the behavioral adaptations that have developed to avoid parasites (i.e. caterpillar poop canons. Lastly, he beautifully writes about the parasites' role in the world and their ecosystems as well as the importance of parasites to the balance of nature. Although always intrigued by them, I've never thought about how important they really are. They are! I swear! We need parasites! And I have never come across an argument for the parasites' place on this planet that is so convincing. He also provides decent reasoning for using parasites as indicator species. And gives the best description of the red queen hypothesis I have ever heard or read.A couple of the specifics I found interesting:page 181:""When a plant is attacked by a parasite, it defends itself with its own version of an immune system by creating poisonous chemicals that the parasite eats as it chews on the plant. But it also fights by sending out cries for help. When a caterpillar bites a leaf, the plant can sense it-a feeling not carried by nerves but felt nevertheless. And in response, the plant makes a particular kind of molecule that wafts into the air. The odor is like perfume for parasitic wasps; as they fly around searching for a host they are powerfully lured by the plant's smell. They follow it to the wounded leaf and find the caterpillar there, and they inject it with eggs. These conversations between plants and wasps are not only timely but precise. Somehow the plant can sense exactly which species of caterpillar is dining on it and spray the appropriate molecule into the air. A parasitic wasp will respond only if the plant lets it know that its own species of host sits on a leaf."" I've also heard of a spider that uses a chemical lure to attract moths and can determine what moths are in the area and choose the correspondingly appropriate chemical. But a plant??? Amazing.page 188-189:""Another way parasites might be able to create a new species is by mucking up the sex lives of their hosts. A bacterium called Wolbachia lives in 15 percent of all insects on Earth as well as many other invertebrates. It lives within its host's cells, and the only way it can infect a new host is by colonizing a female's eggs. When the egg that Wolbachia lives inside becomes fertilized and grows into an adult, it grows up with a case of Wolbachia infection. There's a downside to this way of life: if Wolbachia should grow up in a male it faces a dead end, because there are no eggs for it to infect. As a result, Wolbachia has taken control of its hosts' sex lives. In many of its host species, it tampers with the sperm of infected males so that they can successfully mate only with Wolbachia-carrying females. If on of these infected males should try to mate with a healthy female, all of their offspring will die. Wolbachia uses a different strategy in some species of wasps: normally these insects are born as males and females, which reproduce sexually, but when Wolbachia infects them, the wasps become female-only, able to mother only more females. By turning its hosts all female, the bacteria gives itself that many more hosts. In both these cases, Wolbachia genetically isolates the infected hosts from the uninfected ones. A newly born host will be the offspring of either Wolbachia-carrying parents or two healthy ones. It won't be a healthy-unhealthy hybrid. by setting up this reproductive wall, the parasite may be able to set the stage for a new species to form. Wolbachia is only the best-known parasite out of many to tamper with their hosts' sex lives, so this may turn out to be a common way new species form."" page 238:""Most medicines trace their genealogy to some natural compound in some organism, be it penicillin from a fungus or digitalis from foxglove. Only in the past few years have scientists begun to work their way through the parasite's pharmocopeia. Cordyceps, a fungus that invades insects and sprouts flowerlike stalks out of its body, is the source of cyclosporin, an important antibiotic. hookworms produce molecules that clasp perfectly with clotting factors in human blood, and biotechnology companies are putting them through trials as blood thinners for surgery. Ticks can also tamper with out blood to make their drinking easier, using chemicals that not only solve clots but reduce inflammation and kill bacteria that try to enter a wound. There are other parasitic tricks that still await an explanation. Blood flukes can steal substances out of our own blood to camouflage themselves from the immune system, but no one has figured out how they do it. If scientists did, they might be able to apply their discover to transplanted organs. A doctor might be able to pump a patient's blood through a donor lung and essentially turn it into a gigantic protected fluke. That could spare patients from the dangers of immune-suppressing drugs. And these are only a few parasites; who knows what sorts of chemicals the millions of other have evolved?""Overall, I would say that having at least some science background, particularly that of the immune system and evolution, will significantly increase your reading pleasure of this book. I feel like he tries to explain complicated biology and only partially succeeds, so if you already know what he's getting at then this will be more interesting. If that description fits you, I would highly recommend this book. It is awesome.BTW, for some shameless self-promotion, if you like reading about animals, check out my blog on wildlife at http://backyardzoologist.wordpress.com/"
147,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1879990-adam,5,"I love parasites so much I'm trying to write a fantasy novel about them. They're the most fascinating thing in nature in so many ways. I also loved Carl Zimmer's book She Has Her Mother's Laugh. I was guaranteed to love this and I did. I was obviously up to speed on a lot of the broad-strokes material here, but it never felt like it was wasting my time. A particular peril in books about gross or otherwise taboo subjects is that the author spends so much time talking about the attitudes they assume the audience brings in with them that they barely say anything meaningful about the subject. All the books about rats I've read have that issue. But Zimmer is genuinely curious and knows how to share the curiosity and insight of scientists past and present, and he wastes no time doing anything else. There are tons of wonderful new stories and ideas here, from the Kuchenmeister experiments to the simple semiotics of fluke navigation within the body to the obvious and elegant but somehow novel-to-me idea that humans are a parasite within the global ecosystem and find things to learn from other parasites in balancing that pursuit. The only disappointment really is that this feels massively too short. There's a part in the epilogue, written for the second edition, where Zimmer tells this story about how he learned about jewel wasps acting as parasitoids of cockroaches. And he even says, just as I as thinking the same thing, ""how did I write a whole book about parasites and never learn about this?"" Especially odd considering he does quote Darwin on Ichneumon wasps, and there's a whole section on biocontrol wasps. There are huge realms of parasitology that never come up. I had expected this to be twice as long as it is and cover twice as much and I guess that might not be a fair thing to dock a star (so I guess I won't) for but it just feels really short? Kleptoparasitism doesn't come, or inquilines, or strepsiptera. I would have loved to get Zimmer's more skeptical take on the parasite theory of politics, too. "
148,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19861338-erin-pallott,5,"If you read this, you might come away thinking that parasites are the most important organisms on the planet. I was already a big fan of them, but this book just solidified that. Carl Zimmer is a very popular science writer, and this book is a good example why. Here he gives a great introduction to parasitism and the field of parasitology through everyone's favourite method: the grizzly and gruesome details.This book provides great explanations of how the most deadly parasitic diseases have been so successful, as well as giving examples of lesser known examples that you might see in that one nature documentary (or your nightmares).Zimmer does a great job explaining the concepts of parasitism and showing their place in the bigger picture by expanding into the fields of evolution, medicine and history.Some of the more negative reviews have expressed that parts of this book are hard to read and aren't very accessibly to people who aren't in scientific fields. I would have to disagree and I think this book was written with a wide audience in mind. It is written very clearly (with a handy, long glossary at the back) and provides a lot of great analogies to explain scientific concepts in a way most people should understand. To make this book easier, it would either have to be much longer with lessons in basic biology between each chapter, or have some sections cut out entirely. As this is a scientific book, it shouldn't be a surprise if you do come across words that you have to Google or find some parts confusing. That is just part of science and if you knew it already, you wouldn't need to read the book. I could recommend this book to many people, whether they're someone who already knows some parasitology and wants to gain more knowledge on the subject, or someone that just wants to learn a bunch of cool gross facts to share with their friends and family at the dinner table."
149,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89613608-islomjon,4,"What are the true drivers of evolution? There are multiple answers for this held from various scientists. They consider that drivers are viruses, bacteria, humans, parasites, etc. Each one of them may give us competent arguments for it and they might be true. Yet parasites seem to hurt their hosts most: they give nothing and leave devastating outcomes from their presence, and the same time they lead us to evolve.Carl Zimmer in his book argues that parasites (no matter single celled or multi-cellular organisms) must be why there is an evolution. Furthermore, he masterfully described the micro world that we encounter every day, parasites that kill people, animals and plants. It was wonderful to note how parasites are masters in their metabolism, reproduction and maturing. They seemed more interesting than viruses. Yet they are living organisms and have a little automated orders to survive whatever it takes.However, there are parts that Zimmer had not discussed. For example, the clue of symbiosis that may play a crucial role in host and parasite connection, and perhaps parasites' unique genetics."

152,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4153215-rusty,4,"I’m going to try to get a little closer to current by the end of the year on my reviews. So, watch out internet, Rusty may be posting several reviews over the next few weeks (by which, I mean, essentially, a blog post where I talk about whatever I want to, and at some point may or may not mention the book being reviewed). I think I may have mentioned my kid coming to visit me here. It was an awesome time. What I didn’t mention is that he has a habit of doing risky things and usually turning out okay in the end. Turns out, he had a plan of riding his motorcycle from his place in the southern US to the airport in New York to catch his flight (and later return), because, presumably, the flights were nominally cheaper. Most people that knew and cared for him advised him that this plan was somewhere between ‘monumental stupidity’ and ‘ill-conceived.’ But like many twentysomething men, the world was full of idiots and he was doing it anyway. Anyhow, he missed his flight here, as he was too busy shivering on the side of the interstate about 600 miles south of the airport when it took off. He racked up some motel costs as he called the airlines and made arrangements to fly out of the nearest airport and rebook his flight to Bermuda. But you know what? He made it. He said it was a lesson learned and an experience he’s glad he had. Satisfied that that was about as close as I’ll ever get to a ‘you were right’ sort of thing, my question about his return was simple: Is the return flight to NY? Or to the airport where your motorcycle is? Needless to say, hilarity ensued. Another round of rebooking, extra fees, and longer transit times followed. He couldn’t get to the airport his motorcycle was at because her return flight was through a different airline that did not service that airport. So he had to go to another city, get someone to take him via car up to his bike, then proceed to fix it (his thoughts on his bike: I’m not sure how the rear wheel didn’t fall off as I drove) and then make his way back home. Of course, there was a second round of historically bad weather and another bike breakdown with more shivering on the side of the highway. He ended up having to get someone to come get him because he simply couldn’t make it the last hundred miles or so. The costs of his plan were in the ballpark of a thousand dollars more than if he’d simply flown straight from his local airport. And he was forced to ask friends and family for favors during the holidays. But on the plus side, he cataloged the whole trip, videoing almost every waking moment, so I’m hoping for a Trains, Planes, and Automobiles type of film to come out of the whole ordeal. And then there was this book, which was about a jillion times more terrifying to me than thinking about my kid and his death wish. While this book has nothing at all to do with anything I’ve previously typed, it does connect for me because it makes it clear that life on this planet is a large scale war for survival and that we live in a sea of parasites that will eat your brain, your organs, your flesh, and make you dream of a quick death. They may change how you think, how you live, and how you act – only to benefit them – and make you believe it’s a great idea that you’re living your life based on what they need. Nightmares. All the world is a nightmare. Regardless, I feel I have to point out that this is the longest I have EVER wanted to read a book before I actually set down to read. I read a pre-release excerpt from it in Discover Magazine in what I think was the very late 90’s (could have been early 2000’s) and really wanted to give it a try then. It ended up taking me 20 years to finally get around to it. So, wow. Time flies."
153,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2072674-aj-payne,4,"I find parasites fascinating. Freaky and disturbing, but fascinating. Especially the ones that hijack living creatures to go against their instincts to do things solely to help the parasites. I've always been fascinated by the viruses and bacterias that, for example, force you to sneeze to expel them into new hosts, or force you to have diarrhea to get them back into the water supply. This book wasn't about viruses and bacteria, but about the bigger parasites that all living things live with.And it was super interesting. Zimmer is adept at taking scientific things and making them easy to understand for the lay reader while not getting too bogged down in the details. In this book he describes the history of parasitology, some of the freakiest things parasites do, and what the health of parasites means for the health of the earth. All of it well done and really interesting. Almost makes you want to run off back to school to become a parasitologist. Almost. "

The author jumped from topic to topic but it suited my attention span and in the end he showed the interconnection of the stories he told. And yes, I am indeed calling different ways parasites can infect other living beings as stories because the author had a very prosaic style of writing. If you're interested in random kinda gross biological facts I recommend this book."

He describes how they affect certain species specifically and how parasites can end up altering entire ecosystems. He doesn’t touch on parasites in humans a whole lot (although the little he explains was interesting) but I found the rest of the book to be fascinating. Especially the last chapter, where Zimmer explains that as bad as most parasites are, they’re so ingrained and evolved that some species do worse without them. Highly recommend this if you enjoy reading biology or science!"

It wasn't what I was expecting, but I really enjoyed it. I thought it would be a list of various parasites and how they live, (similar to his other book, Planet of Viruses,) but this book actually deals more with parasites as a group. The author leaves you with a profound appreciation for how complicated parasites are, and for how big of an impact they have had on our lives.

Beyond the creep factor, there is much here to think about. For example, does a healthy ecosystem actually depend on parasites to thrive? How much of evolution occurs in the partnership between parasite and host? The human animal lives in a web of connections— most of which we try very hard to ignore. Yet the health of an ecosystem may actually depend on the balance between parasites and host. "

This book does a great job of showing us the world of parasites. Even though parasites are simple creatures they are very effective at what they do. Many parasites redirect or control the behavior the the host they are infecting. Even human behavior is controlled when the human is infected with particular parasites.

173,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,5,"Ugh, yuck and yike!The prevalence of parasites in the earth's ecosystems is perhaps the worst of the dirty little secrets of life. According to science journalist Carl Zimmer, the majority of animal species are parasitic (p. 187). Bambi and Mickey Mouse had 'em, the sparrows outside your window are riddled with them, and you and I have them. What you'll read about here is how creatures insinuate themselves into other creatures and take control of them; how, for example, a wasp inserts its eggs into a caterpillar and how the larva eat the caterpillar's flesh, and other equally ghastly processes. The result is a view of life without rose colored glasses or any cute Disney characters.I had a dream one night before going to the dentist. I dreamed that there were scores of little white noodles like spaghetti coming out of my gums and tongue when I pressed them. Initially I thought this was a dream of the grooming instinct. But after reading Carl Zimmer's creepy but utterly fascinating book, I believe this primeval dream may have been a dream of parasites.In a sense this is the scariest book I have ever read. I had to put it aside twice because the horror depicted on its pages was affecting my usually buoyant state of mind. Make no mistake about it, however objectively we may try to view our fellow creatures, it is impossible (at least for me) to see parasites as anything other than ugly and despicable. (I'm working on it, however.)But Zimmer has an important purpose in writing this book aside from scaring us. He makes it clear that we cannot understand how an ecology works without understanding the role parasites play in that ecology. For example on page 111 we have wolves choosing to attack a moose that is slow and wheezing, a moose riddled with tapeworms, tapeworms seeking their final host, the wolf! The wolves are led to choose the infected moose perhaps by a scent in the moose's breath, created by the tapeworms. ""The thinning of the herd is an illusion, not the service of the predator but the side effect of a tapeworm traveling through its life.""In Chapter 3, ""The Thirty Years' War,"" Zimmer shows how the immune system fights against parasites. It is an excellent exposition on how the immune system works, and one of the highlights of the book. In the chapter ""Evolution from Within,"" we see parasites as a driving force in evolution. The idea that sexuality began as a way to fight disease, the so-called ""Red Queen"" hypothesis is presented. Zimmer shows how being different instead of a clone of the mother (asexual reproduction) can lead to characteristics that foil parasites. There are sixteen pages of glossy photos of parasites, several showing the grotesque heads of tapeworms in intimate detail. There are photos of a crustacean parasite that invades a fish's mouth, eats its tongue and then takes the place of the tongue.A question that might be asked is, what is a parasite? Certainly in biology a parasite is different than a symbiont, which is distinguished from a predator, etc. Zimmer gives Richard Dawkins's definition that ""Parasitism is any arrangement in which one set of DNA is replicated with the help of--and at the expense of--another set of DNA"" (p. 126). By this definition perhaps humans are parasites on Planet Gaia. Zimmer suggests as much on page 245 adding that ""There's no shame in being a parasite...But we are clumsy in the parasitic way of life."" He explains that expert parasites do no more harm than is necessary. ""If Gaia had an immune system, it might be disease and famine"" to keep ""an exploding species from taking over the world. But we have dodged these safeguards with medicines and toilets and other safeguards...""Zimmer ends the book on a rather cheery note: parasites as the canary in the coal mine. He argues that parasites are not only an indication of ecological health (plenty of parasites suggests a healthy ecosystem; a drop in their numbers suggests trouble, perhaps from pollution), but are vital to the ecology by keeping animal populations in check (pp. 241-243). He also gives some idea of how parasites might benefit us more directly, such as a fungus that invades insects as ""the source of cyclosporin, an important antibiotic"" or the use of blood-clotting molecules produced by hookworms as blood thinners in surgery (p. 238). Although there have been failures in the use of parasites to control insect populations, and Zimmer recounts two or three, there is also the story of how a parasitic wasp imported from South America saved the African cassava crop from mealybugs (pp. 220-228).As others have noted, reading this book will forever change the way you view the natural world, and might make you cancel that trip to the tropics. --Dennis Littrell, author of “The World Is Not as We Think It Is”"
174,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6093453-colin,4,"This is an oldie but a goodie.Parasite Rex is a broad overview, not just of its titular subject, but also of the ways that the notion of the parasite is evolving, and how it should be understood by people. It traces the genealogy of the study of parasitism from the origins of the word in Greek all the way to the 19th century disdain of such creatures as degenerate life forms and evolutionary dead ends that depend utterly upon their host and gave rise to the moral stigma associated with being called a parasite.Zimmer's project is to demonstrate just how complex and well-adapted parasites are as lifeforms, and the ways in which they play an important part in balancing their various ecosystems. Of course, the term parasite is a broad one; it can range from anything from a single celled organism to a large animal like a cuckoo that lays its eggs in the nests of other birds.Parasites are, to put it simply, organisms that are adapted to survive and reproduce at the partial expense of other creatures. Their playground is not the savannahs, hills and jungles of your typical animal, but the bodies of other organisms. In that respect they are as beautifully adapted to these environments as the gazelle is to the Serengeti.The bodies of organisms are treacherous places that have evolved immune responses to foreign invaders. In that respect, parasites are resourceful creatures that constantly innovate (via evolutionary adaptations) creative responses to thrive amidst it, ranging from hiding in plain sight within red blood cells, or constantly changing forms so that T-cells can't keep track of them.Having infested their hapless hosts, parasites need to ensure they are able to propagate to the next stage of their life cycles. And it is in this where parasites get much of their well-deserved reputation as nature's horrors - employing all sorts of creative but ghoulish ways to make their hosts serve their ends - from Sacculina turning male crabs into hapless castrated zombies, to toxoplasma gondii making rats more reckless to ensure they are eaten by cats, hence allowing the parasite to settle into its true feline home. Sometimes these adaptations allow the host to live relatively normal lives, albeit as unwitting Typhoid Marys; in other cases, the death of the host is the prerequisite of the flowering of the parasite into its succeeding life stage.But despite these macabre innovations, Carl Zimmer gives parasites their due as vital players in the diversity of life. Parasites may have played a role in accelerating the evolution of sexual reproduction, energy intensive as it might be, as a means of allowing animals to generate enough species diversity to throw off the pernicious effects of parasites.And parasites play a bigger role in ecosystems than might first appear. Consider the relationship between a predator and prey. The usual narrative is that predators keep populations in check and increase the health of the herd, because usually the weakest prey is the meal of the predator. But perhaps this salutary vision is just an illusion, and it is the parasite that weakens the host to allow it to be captured by the predator, which is its next presumptive host. Parasites, though ghoulish at times, may be the signifiers of healthy, robust ecosystems.Even human evolution has been shaped in large part because of the existence of parasites. We've evolved various responses to common parasites, so much so that in our modern industrialised society, the eradication of such parasites has indirectly led to the rise in new autoimmune diseases such as colitis, as well as an increase in allergies.Zimmer writes in a dense but approachable style, peppering the narrative with interesting stories and examples of parasites and their behaviors, painting an erudite picture of how we should think about the broader role that parasites play in the web of life. Written in the early 2000s as it is, perhaps some of the facts and hypotheses described have been validated or disproven, but ultimately, Parasite Rex still remains a comprehensive and engaging starter guide on how we should think about parasites.I give this: 4 out of 5 guinea worms"
175,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60074558-xander,3,"This book is superbly written: easy to follow, emphasizing the biology behind parasites withot getting too technical and mixing in some pieces of journalism (interviews with experts) with a scientific story. But enough about the book and its style: the content of the book is what it's all about. Zimmer describes how parasites make up most of the existing (and possibly extinct) forms of life on earth. But not only that, parasites are also an indication of the health of entire ecosystems: in natural habitats where parasites thrive in hosts, the ecology is a healthy balance, with the parasites keeping a check on the number of hosts, which in turn leads to a natural check on things like overgrazing and exhaustion of resources. Zimmer details this 'main' story with lots of examples of parasites. After reading this, a reader will be more aware of the importance of parasites for life itself, the impact of parasites on evolution (arms races, immune systems, etc.) and the complex life cycles of parasites - some species take different forms, living in different hosts, before reproducing and dying off (e.g. there are species of lancet flukes that take over the neural systems of ants, driving the ants up grass leaves, waiting to be eating by cattle, after which the fluke lays its eggs inside the intestines of a cow; the eggs get transported through the digestive canal and entire the nature through cow dung, after which the eggs hatch and find new ants to control and start a new life cycle - simply amazing!).The only moment of nuisance came at the last two pages (bummer...), where Zimmer compares the human race to a parasite, living of the totality of ecosystems on earth. The only difference between us and 'normal' parasites, according to Zimmer, is that we are an amateurish species of parasite: not keeping track of the condition of our host ('Gaia') and thereby exterminating ourselves. Apart from the issues about the ambiguous predictions of climate change and loss of biodiversity (especially their impact on humanity), the comparison is in another way misleading. There's only one earth; there's no species of Gaia's. This might sound like an argument some obscure armchair philosopher would concoct, but really it is a crucial one. By comparing humanity to parasites, Zimmer might give the impression that humanity can adapt to changes in the immune system of its host (earth), but the changes in earthly ecosystems (amongst other things) happen much faster than mankind's ability to procreate and thereby adapt. Not to mention the immense suffering of the people that are naturally 'weeded' out in this transitions Something we should not forget when trying to live within the natural boundaries of our little planet. (I guess in general it's a safe rule of thumb not to compare people with parasites at all).But I shouldn't end this review on such a boring note; I really enjoyed this book and apart from the last 2 pages I was (positively) amazed by the lively content - something I didn't expect before opening the book. An this is for a large part due to Zimmer's way of writing and his choices of the material. Well done Zimmer! (I guess it's only fair that Zimmer got a parasite named after himself, as he writes in the new epilogue: the Acanthobotrium zimmeri, a tapeworm living inside a newly discovered whip ray)."
176,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2915426-tippy-jackson,5,"Wow. Just wow. To begin, the first chapter is about defining a parasite and bemoaning the lack of parasite research and scientists. I found it boring and inconclusive. I kept pushing because I figured like most scientific writing once they get the definitions out of the way the good stuff comes. Seriously, that is exactly what happened. Don't give up on this book! It gets better and better as it goes. This book is well organized and split into clear section. In one of my favorites, it describes some of the absolutely astonishing ways parasites avoid being expelled from animals (including sometimes humans)by immune systems. The trickery! A body is a seriously hostile environment and the way these parasites will use their hosts own systems against them or keeps changing their skin so the host immune system doesn't recognize it. It's positively brilliant! They can hijack our own mechanisms to hide from us. It's crazy.There is another section on chemical mind control. I would have thought it would be my favorite, but all of the examples were ones I've already known. Still, parasites altering host behavior or turning hosts into zombies will never not be interesting. Then the author goes into details of parasite evolution, followed by how parasites shape the evolution of their hosts. Some of the experiments he mentions are very convincing and some of the ideas he shares are still in speculation and hypothesis phases, but all are really fascinating. Among my favorites are the development of allergies and human intestinal diseases that may have arisen from the current lack of parasites that our body has adapted to and the evolution of sex as a means of reproduction. He also briefly writes about how chimps may be self-medicating against parasites and he describes a few of the behavioral adaptations that have developed to avoid parasites (i.e. caterpillar poop canons. Lastly, he beautifully writes about the parasites' role in the world and their ecosystems as well as the importance of parasites to the balance of nature. Although always intrigued by them, I've never thought about how important they really are. They are! I swear! We need parasites! And I have never come across an argument for the parasites' place on this planet that is so convincing. He also provides decent reasoning for using parasites as indicator species. And gives the best description of the red queen hypothesis I have ever heard or read.A couple of the specifics I found interesting:page 181:""When a plant is attacked by a parasite, it defends itself with its own version of an immune system by creating poisonous chemicals that the parasite eats as it chews on the plant. But it also fights by sending out cries for help. When a caterpillar bites a leaf, the plant can sense it-a feeling not carried by nerves but felt nevertheless. And in response, the plant makes a particular kind of molecule that wafts into the air. The odor is like perfume for parasitic wasps; as they fly around searching for a host they are powerfully lured by the plant's smell. They follow it to the wounded leaf and find the caterpillar there, and they inject it with eggs. These conversations between plants and wasps are not only timely but precise. Somehow the plant can sense exactly which species of caterpillar is dining on it and spray the appropriate molecule into the air. A parasitic wasp will respond only if the plant lets it know that its own species of host sits on a leaf."" I've also heard of a spider that uses a chemical lure to attract moths and can determine what moths are in the area and choose the correspondingly appropriate chemical. But a plant??? Amazing.page 188-189:""Another way parasites might be able to create a new species is by mucking up the sex lives of their hosts. A bacterium called Wolbachia lives in 15 percent of all insects on Earth as well as many other invertebrates. It lives within its host's cells, and the only way it can infect a new host is by colonizing a female's eggs. When the egg that Wolbachia lives inside becomes fertilized and grows into an adult, it grows up with a case of Wolbachia infection. There's a downside to this way of life: if Wolbachia should grow up in a male it faces a dead end, because there are no eggs for it to infect. As a result, Wolbachia has taken control of its hosts' sex lives. In many of its host species, it tampers with the sperm of infected males so that they can successfully mate only with Wolbachia-carrying females. If on of these infected males should try to mate with a healthy female, all of their offspring will die. Wolbachia uses a different strategy in some species of wasps: normally these insects are born as males and females, which reproduce sexually, but when Wolbachia infects them, the wasps become female-only, able to mother only more females. By turning its hosts all female, the bacteria gives itself that many more hosts. In both these cases, Wolbachia genetically isolates the infected hosts from the uninfected ones. A newly born host will be the offspring of either Wolbachia-carrying parents or two healthy ones. It won't be a healthy-unhealthy hybrid. by setting up this reproductive wall, the parasite may be able to set the stage for a new species to form. Wolbachia is only the best-known parasite out of many to tamper with their hosts' sex lives, so this may turn out to be a common way new species form."" page 238:""Most medicines trace their genealogy to some natural compound in some organism, be it penicillin from a fungus or digitalis from foxglove. Only in the past few years have scientists begun to work their way through the parasite's pharmocopeia. Cordyceps, a fungus that invades insects and sprouts flowerlike stalks out of its body, is the source of cyclosporin, an important antibiotic. hookworms produce molecules that clasp perfectly with clotting factors in human blood, and biotechnology companies are putting them through trials as blood thinners for surgery. Ticks can also tamper with out blood to make their drinking easier, using chemicals that not only solve clots but reduce inflammation and kill bacteria that try to enter a wound. There are other parasitic tricks that still await an explanation. Blood flukes can steal substances out of our own blood to camouflage themselves from the immune system, but no one has figured out how they do it. If scientists did, they might be able to apply their discover to transplanted organs. A doctor might be able to pump a patient's blood through a donor lung and essentially turn it into a gigantic protected fluke. That could spare patients from the dangers of immune-suppressing drugs. And these are only a few parasites; who knows what sorts of chemicals the millions of other have evolved?""Overall, I would say that having at least some science background, particularly that of the immune system and evolution, will significantly increase your reading pleasure of this book. I feel like he tries to explain complicated biology and only partially succeeds, so if you already know what he's getting at then this will be more interesting. If that description fits you, I would highly recommend this book. It is awesome.BTW, for some shameless self-promotion, if you like reading about animals, check out my blog on wildlife at http://backyardzoologist.wordpress.com/"
177,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1879990-adam,5,"I love parasites so much I'm trying to write a fantasy novel about them. They're the most fascinating thing in nature in so many ways. I also loved Carl Zimmer's book She Has Her Mother's Laugh. I was guaranteed to love this and I did. I was obviously up to speed on a lot of the broad-strokes material here, but it never felt like it was wasting my time. A particular peril in books about gross or otherwise taboo subjects is that the author spends so much time talking about the attitudes they assume the audience brings in with them that they barely say anything meaningful about the subject. All the books about rats I've read have that issue. But Zimmer is genuinely curious and knows how to share the curiosity and insight of scientists past and present, and he wastes no time doing anything else. There are tons of wonderful new stories and ideas here, from the Kuchenmeister experiments to the simple semiotics of fluke navigation within the body to the obvious and elegant but somehow novel-to-me idea that humans are a parasite within the global ecosystem and find things to learn from other parasites in balancing that pursuit. The only disappointment really is that this feels massively too short. There's a part in the epilogue, written for the second edition, where Zimmer tells this story about how he learned about jewel wasps acting as parasitoids of cockroaches. And he even says, just as I as thinking the same thing, ""how did I write a whole book about parasites and never learn about this?"" Especially odd considering he does quote Darwin on Ichneumon wasps, and there's a whole section on biocontrol wasps. There are huge realms of parasitology that never come up. I had expected this to be twice as long as it is and cover twice as much and I guess that might not be a fair thing to dock a star (so I guess I won't) for but it just feels really short? Kleptoparasitism doesn't come, or inquilines, or strepsiptera. I would have loved to get Zimmer's more skeptical take on the parasite theory of politics, too. "
178,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19861338-erin-pallott,5,"If you read this, you might come away thinking that parasites are the most important organisms on the planet. I was already a big fan of them, but this book just solidified that. Carl Zimmer is a very popular science writer, and this book is a good example why. Here he gives a great introduction to parasitism and the field of parasitology through everyone's favourite method: the grizzly and gruesome details.This book provides great explanations of how the most deadly parasitic diseases have been so successful, as well as giving examples of lesser known examples that you might see in that one nature documentary (or your nightmares).Zimmer does a great job explaining the concepts of parasitism and showing their place in the bigger picture by expanding into the fields of evolution, medicine and history.Some of the more negative reviews have expressed that parts of this book are hard to read and aren't very accessibly to people who aren't in scientific fields. I would have to disagree and I think this book was written with a wide audience in mind. It is written very clearly (with a handy, long glossary at the back) and provides a lot of great analogies to explain scientific concepts in a way most people should understand. To make this book easier, it would either have to be much longer with lessons in basic biology between each chapter, or have some sections cut out entirely. As this is a scientific book, it shouldn't be a surprise if you do come across words that you have to Google or find some parts confusing. That is just part of science and if you knew it already, you wouldn't need to read the book. I could recommend this book to many people, whether they're someone who already knows some parasitology and wants to gain more knowledge on the subject, or someone that just wants to learn a bunch of cool gross facts to share with their friends and family at the dinner table."
179,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89613608-islomjon,4,"What are the true drivers of evolution? There are multiple answers for this held from various scientists. They consider that drivers are viruses, bacteria, humans, parasites, etc. Each one of them may give us competent arguments for it and they might be true. Yet parasites seem to hurt their hosts most: they give nothing and leave devastating outcomes from their presence, and the same time they lead us to evolve.Carl Zimmer in his book argues that parasites (no matter single celled or multi-cellular organisms) must be why there is an evolution. Furthermore, he masterfully described the micro world that we encounter every day, parasites that kill people, animals and plants. It was wonderful to note how parasites are masters in their metabolism, reproduction and maturing. They seemed more interesting than viruses. Yet they are living organisms and have a little automated orders to survive whatever it takes.However, there are parts that Zimmer had not discussed. For example, the clue of symbiosis that may play a crucial role in host and parasite connection, and perhaps parasites' unique genetics."

182,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4153215-rusty,4,"I’m going to try to get a little closer to current by the end of the year on my reviews. So, watch out internet, Rusty may be posting several reviews over the next few weeks (by which, I mean, essentially, a blog post where I talk about whatever I want to, and at some point may or may not mention the book being reviewed). I think I may have mentioned my kid coming to visit me here. It was an awesome time. What I didn’t mention is that he has a habit of doing risky things and usually turning out okay in the end. Turns out, he had a plan of riding his motorcycle from his place in the southern US to the airport in New York to catch his flight (and later return), because, presumably, the flights were nominally cheaper. Most people that knew and cared for him advised him that this plan was somewhere between ‘monumental stupidity’ and ‘ill-conceived.’ But like many twentysomething men, the world was full of idiots and he was doing it anyway. Anyhow, he missed his flight here, as he was too busy shivering on the side of the interstate about 600 miles south of the airport when it took off. He racked up some motel costs as he called the airlines and made arrangements to fly out of the nearest airport and rebook his flight to Bermuda. But you know what? He made it. He said it was a lesson learned and an experience he’s glad he had. Satisfied that that was about as close as I’ll ever get to a ‘you were right’ sort of thing, my question about his return was simple: Is the return flight to NY? Or to the airport where your motorcycle is? Needless to say, hilarity ensued. Another round of rebooking, extra fees, and longer transit times followed. He couldn’t get to the airport his motorcycle was at because her return flight was through a different airline that did not service that airport. So he had to go to another city, get someone to take him via car up to his bike, then proceed to fix it (his thoughts on his bike: I’m not sure how the rear wheel didn’t fall off as I drove) and then make his way back home. Of course, there was a second round of historically bad weather and another bike breakdown with more shivering on the side of the highway. He ended up having to get someone to come get him because he simply couldn’t make it the last hundred miles or so. The costs of his plan were in the ballpark of a thousand dollars more than if he’d simply flown straight from his local airport. And he was forced to ask friends and family for favors during the holidays. But on the plus side, he cataloged the whole trip, videoing almost every waking moment, so I’m hoping for a Trains, Planes, and Automobiles type of film to come out of the whole ordeal. And then there was this book, which was about a jillion times more terrifying to me than thinking about my kid and his death wish. While this book has nothing at all to do with anything I’ve previously typed, it does connect for me because it makes it clear that life on this planet is a large scale war for survival and that we live in a sea of parasites that will eat your brain, your organs, your flesh, and make you dream of a quick death. They may change how you think, how you live, and how you act – only to benefit them – and make you believe it’s a great idea that you’re living your life based on what they need. Nightmares. All the world is a nightmare. Regardless, I feel I have to point out that this is the longest I have EVER wanted to read a book before I actually set down to read. I read a pre-release excerpt from it in Discover Magazine in what I think was the very late 90’s (could have been early 2000’s) and really wanted to give it a try then. It ended up taking me 20 years to finally get around to it. So, wow. Time flies."
183,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2072674-aj-payne,4,"I find parasites fascinating. Freaky and disturbing, but fascinating. Especially the ones that hijack living creatures to go against their instincts to do things solely to help the parasites. I've always been fascinated by the viruses and bacterias that, for example, force you to sneeze to expel them into new hosts, or force you to have diarrhea to get them back into the water supply. This book wasn't about viruses and bacteria, but about the bigger parasites that all living things live with.And it was super interesting. Zimmer is adept at taking scientific things and making them easy to understand for the lay reader while not getting too bogged down in the details. In this book he describes the history of parasitology, some of the freakiest things parasites do, and what the health of parasites means for the health of the earth. All of it well done and really interesting. Almost makes you want to run off back to school to become a parasitologist. Almost. "

The author jumped from topic to topic but it suited my attention span and in the end he showed the interconnection of the stories he told. And yes, I am indeed calling different ways parasites can infect other living beings as stories because the author had a very prosaic style of writing. If you're interested in random kinda gross biological facts I recommend this book."

He describes how they affect certain species specifically and how parasites can end up altering entire ecosystems. He doesn’t touch on parasites in humans a whole lot (although the little he explains was interesting) but I found the rest of the book to be fascinating. Especially the last chapter, where Zimmer explains that as bad as most parasites are, they’re so ingrained and evolved that some species do worse without them.

I thought it would be a list of various parasites and how they live, (similar to his other book, Planet of Viruses,) but this book actually deals more with parasites as a group. The author leaves you with a profound appreciation for how complicated parasites are, and for how big of an impact they have had on our lives.

203,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,5,"Ugh, yuck and yike!The prevalence of parasites in the earth's ecosystems is perhaps the worst of the dirty little secrets of life. According to science journalist Carl Zimmer, the majority of animal species are parasitic (p. 187). Bambi and Mickey Mouse had 'em, the sparrows outside your window are riddled with them, and you and I have them. What you'll read about here is how creatures insinuate themselves into other creatures and take control of them; how, for example, a wasp inserts its eggs into a caterpillar and how the larva eat the caterpillar's flesh, and other equally ghastly processes. The result is a view of life without rose colored glasses or any cute Disney characters.I had a dream one night before going to the dentist. I dreamed that there were scores of little white noodles like spaghetti coming out of my gums and tongue when I pressed them. Initially I thought this was a dream of the grooming instinct. But after reading Carl Zimmer's creepy but utterly fascinating book, I believe this primeval dream may have been a dream of parasites.In a sense this is the scariest book I have ever read. I had to put it aside twice because the horror depicted on its pages was affecting my usually buoyant state of mind. Make no mistake about it, however objectively we may try to view our fellow creatures, it is impossible (at least for me) to see parasites as anything other than ugly and despicable. (I'm working on it, however.)But Zimmer has an important purpose in writing this book aside from scaring us. He makes it clear that we cannot understand how an ecology works without understanding the role parasites play in that ecology. For example on page 111 we have wolves choosing to attack a moose that is slow and wheezing, a moose riddled with tapeworms, tapeworms seeking their final host, the wolf! The wolves are led to choose the infected moose perhaps by a scent in the moose's breath, created by the tapeworms. ""The thinning of the herd is an illusion, not the service of the predator but the side effect of a tapeworm traveling through its life.""In Chapter 3, ""The Thirty Years' War,"" Zimmer shows how the immune system fights against parasites. It is an excellent exposition on how the immune system works, and one of the highlights of the book. In the chapter ""Evolution from Within,"" we see parasites as a driving force in evolution. The idea that sexuality began as a way to fight disease, the so-called ""Red Queen"" hypothesis is presented. Zimmer shows how being different instead of a clone of the mother (asexual reproduction) can lead to characteristics that foil parasites. There are sixteen pages of glossy photos of parasites, several showing the grotesque heads of tapeworms in intimate detail. There are photos of a crustacean parasite that invades a fish's mouth, eats its tongue and then takes the place of the tongue.A question that might be asked is, what is a parasite? Certainly in biology a parasite is different than a symbiont, which is distinguished from a predator, etc. Zimmer gives Richard Dawkins's definition that ""Parasitism is any arrangement in which one set of DNA is replicated with the help of--and at the expense of--another set of DNA"" (p. 126). By this definition perhaps humans are parasites on Planet Gaia. Zimmer suggests as much on page 245 adding that ""There's no shame in being a parasite...But we are clumsy in the parasitic way of life."" He explains that expert parasites do no more harm than is necessary. ""If Gaia had an immune system, it might be disease and famine"" to keep ""an exploding species from taking over the world. But we have dodged these safeguards with medicines and toilets and other safeguards...""Zimmer ends the book on a rather cheery note: parasites as the canary in the coal mine. He argues that parasites are not only an indication of ecological health (plenty of parasites suggests a healthy ecosystem; a drop in their numbers suggests trouble, perhaps from pollution), but are vital to the ecology by keeping animal populations in check (pp. 241-243). He also gives some idea of how parasites might benefit us more directly, such as a fungus that invades insects as ""the source of cyclosporin, an important antibiotic"" or the use of blood-clotting molecules produced by hookworms as blood thinners in surgery (p. 238). Although there have been failures in the use of parasites to control insect populations, and Zimmer recounts two or three, there is also the story of how a parasitic wasp imported from South America saved the African cassava crop from mealybugs (pp. 220-228).As others have noted, reading this book will forever change the way you view the natural world, and might make you cancel that trip to the tropics. --Dennis Littrell, author of “The World Is Not as We Think It Is”"
204,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6093453-colin,4,"This is an oldie but a goodie.Parasite Rex is a broad overview, not just of its titular subject, but also of the ways that the notion of the parasite is evolving, and how it should be understood by people. It traces the genealogy of the study of parasitism from the origins of the word in Greek all the way to the 19th century disdain of such creatures as degenerate life forms and evolutionary dead ends that depend utterly upon their host and gave rise to the moral stigma associated with being called a parasite.Zimmer's project is to demonstrate just how complex and well-adapted parasites are as lifeforms, and the ways in which they play an important part in balancing their various ecosystems. Of course, the term parasite is a broad one; it can range from anything from a single celled organism to a large animal like a cuckoo that lays its eggs in the nests of other birds.Parasites are, to put it simply, organisms that are adapted to survive and reproduce at the partial expense of other creatures. Their playground is not the savannahs, hills and jungles of your typical animal, but the bodies of other organisms. In that respect they are as beautifully adapted to these environments as the gazelle is to the Serengeti.The bodies of organisms are treacherous places that have evolved immune responses to foreign invaders. In that respect, parasites are resourceful creatures that constantly innovate (via evolutionary adaptations) creative responses to thrive amidst it, ranging from hiding in plain sight within red blood cells, or constantly changing forms so that T-cells can't keep track of them.Having infested their hapless hosts, parasites need to ensure they are able to propagate to the next stage of their life cycles. And it is in this where parasites get much of their well-deserved reputation as nature's horrors - employing all sorts of creative but ghoulish ways to make their hosts serve their ends - from Sacculina turning male crabs into hapless castrated zombies, to toxoplasma gondii making rats more reckless to ensure they are eaten by cats, hence allowing the parasite to settle into its true feline home. Sometimes these adaptations allow the host to live relatively normal lives, albeit as unwitting Typhoid Marys; in other cases, the death of the host is the prerequisite of the flowering of the parasite into its succeeding life stage.But despite these macabre innovations, Carl Zimmer gives parasites their due as vital players in the diversity of life. Parasites may have played a role in accelerating the evolution of sexual reproduction, energy intensive as it might be, as a means of allowing animals to generate enough species diversity to throw off the pernicious effects of parasites.And parasites play a bigger role in ecosystems than might first appear. Consider the relationship between a predator and prey. The usual narrative is that predators keep populations in check and increase the health of the herd, because usually the weakest prey is the meal of the predator. But perhaps this salutary vision is just an illusion, and it is the parasite that weakens the host to allow it to be captured by the predator, which is its next presumptive host. Parasites, though ghoulish at times, may be the signifiers of healthy, robust ecosystems.Even human evolution has been shaped in large part because of the existence of parasites. We've evolved various responses to common parasites, so much so that in our modern industrialised society, the eradication of such parasites has indirectly led to the rise in new autoimmune diseases such as colitis, as well as an increase in allergies.Zimmer writes in a dense but approachable style, peppering the narrative with interesting stories and examples of parasites and their behaviors, painting an erudite picture of how we should think about the broader role that parasites play in the web of life. Written in the early 2000s as it is, perhaps some of the facts and hypotheses described have been validated or disproven, but ultimately, Parasite Rex still remains a comprehensive and engaging starter guide on how we should think about parasites.I give this: 4 out of 5 guinea worms"
205,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60074558-xander,3,"This book is superbly written: easy to follow, emphasizing the biology behind parasites withot getting too technical and mixing in some pieces of journalism (interviews with experts) with a scientific story. But enough about the book and its style: the content of the book is what it's all about. Zimmer describes how parasites make up most of the existing (and possibly extinct) forms of life on earth. But not only that, parasites are also an indication of the health of entire ecosystems: in natural habitats where parasites thrive in hosts, the ecology is a healthy balance, with the parasites keeping a check on the number of hosts, which in turn leads to a natural check on things like overgrazing and exhaustion of resources. Zimmer details this 'main' story with lots of examples of parasites. After reading this, a reader will be more aware of the importance of parasites for life itself, the impact of parasites on evolution (arms races, immune systems, etc.) and the complex life cycles of parasites - some species take different forms, living in different hosts, before reproducing and dying off (e.g. there are species of lancet flukes that take over the neural systems of ants, driving the ants up grass leaves, waiting to be eating by cattle, after which the fluke lays its eggs inside the intestines of a cow; the eggs get transported through the digestive canal and entire the nature through cow dung, after which the eggs hatch and find new ants to control and start a new life cycle - simply amazing!).The only moment of nuisance came at the last two pages (bummer...), where Zimmer compares the human race to a parasite, living of the totality of ecosystems on earth. The only difference between us and 'normal' parasites, according to Zimmer, is that we are an amateurish species of parasite: not keeping track of the condition of our host ('Gaia') and thereby exterminating ourselves. Apart from the issues about the ambiguous predictions of climate change and loss of biodiversity (especially their impact on humanity), the comparison is in another way misleading. There's only one earth; there's no species of Gaia's. This might sound like an argument some obscure armchair philosopher would concoct, but really it is a crucial one. By comparing humanity to parasites, Zimmer might give the impression that humanity can adapt to changes in the immune system of its host (earth), but the changes in earthly ecosystems (amongst other things) happen much faster than mankind's ability to procreate and thereby adapt. Not to mention the immense suffering of the people that are naturally 'weeded' out in this transitions Something we should not forget when trying to live within the natural boundaries of our little planet. (I guess in general it's a safe rule of thumb not to compare people with parasites at all).But I shouldn't end this review on such a boring note; I really enjoyed this book and apart from the last 2 pages I was (positively) amazed by the lively content - something I didn't expect before opening the book. An this is for a large part due to Zimmer's way of writing and his choices of the material. Well done Zimmer! (I guess it's only fair that Zimmer got a parasite named after himself, as he writes in the new epilogue: the Acanthobotrium zimmeri, a tapeworm living inside a newly discovered whip ray)."
206,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2915426-tippy-jackson,5,"Wow. Just wow. To begin, the first chapter is about defining a parasite and bemoaning the lack of parasite research and scientists. I found it boring and inconclusive. I kept pushing because I figured like most scientific writing once they get the definitions out of the way the good stuff comes. Seriously, that is exactly what happened. Don't give up on this book! It gets better and better as it goes. This book is well organized and split into clear section. In one of my favorites, it describes some of the absolutely astonishing ways parasites avoid being expelled from animals (including sometimes humans)by immune systems. The trickery! A body is a seriously hostile environment and the way these parasites will use their hosts own systems against them or keeps changing their skin so the host immune system doesn't recognize it. It's positively brilliant! They can hijack our own mechanisms to hide from us. It's crazy.There is another section on chemical mind control. I would have thought it would be my favorite, but all of the examples were ones I've already known. Still, parasites altering host behavior or turning hosts into zombies will never not be interesting. Then the author goes into details of parasite evolution, followed by how parasites shape the evolution of their hosts. Some of the experiments he mentions are very convincing and some of the ideas he shares are still in speculation and hypothesis phases, but all are really fascinating. Among my favorites are the development of allergies and human intestinal diseases that may have arisen from the current lack of parasites that our body has adapted to and the evolution of sex as a means of reproduction. He also briefly writes about how chimps may be self-medicating against parasites and he describes a few of the behavioral adaptations that have developed to avoid parasites (i.e. caterpillar poop canons. Lastly, he beautifully writes about the parasites' role in the world and their ecosystems as well as the importance of parasites to the balance of nature. Although always intrigued by them, I've never thought about how important they really are. They are! I swear! We need parasites! And I have never come across an argument for the parasites' place on this planet that is so convincing. He also provides decent reasoning for using parasites as indicator species. And gives the best description of the red queen hypothesis I have ever heard or read.A couple of the specifics I found interesting:page 181:""When a plant is attacked by a parasite, it defends itself with its own version of an immune system by creating poisonous chemicals that the parasite eats as it chews on the plant. But it also fights by sending out cries for help. When a caterpillar bites a leaf, the plant can sense it-a feeling not carried by nerves but felt nevertheless. And in response, the plant makes a particular kind of molecule that wafts into the air. The odor is like perfume for parasitic wasps; as they fly around searching for a host they are powerfully lured by the plant's smell. They follow it to the wounded leaf and find the caterpillar there, and they inject it with eggs. These conversations between plants and wasps are not only timely but precise. Somehow the plant can sense exactly which species of caterpillar is dining on it and spray the appropriate molecule into the air. A parasitic wasp will respond only if the plant lets it know that its own species of host sits on a leaf."" I've also heard of a spider that uses a chemical lure to attract moths and can determine what moths are in the area and choose the correspondingly appropriate chemical. But a plant??? Amazing.page 188-189:""Another way parasites might be able to create a new species is by mucking up the sex lives of their hosts. A bacterium called Wolbachia lives in 15 percent of all insects on Earth as well as many other invertebrates. It lives within its host's cells, and the only way it can infect a new host is by colonizing a female's eggs. When the egg that Wolbachia lives inside becomes fertilized and grows into an adult, it grows up with a case of Wolbachia infection. There's a downside to this way of life: if Wolbachia should grow up in a male it faces a dead end, because there are no eggs for it to infect. As a result, Wolbachia has taken control of its hosts' sex lives. In many of its host species, it tampers with the sperm of infected males so that they can successfully mate only with Wolbachia-carrying females. If on of these infected males should try to mate with a healthy female, all of their offspring will die. Wolbachia uses a different strategy in some species of wasps: normally these insects are born as males and females, which reproduce sexually, but when Wolbachia infects them, the wasps become female-only, able to mother only more females. By turning its hosts all female, the bacteria gives itself that many more hosts. In both these cases, Wolbachia genetically isolates the infected hosts from the uninfected ones. A newly born host will be the offspring of either Wolbachia-carrying parents or two healthy ones. It won't be a healthy-unhealthy hybrid. by setting up this reproductive wall, the parasite may be able to set the stage for a new species to form. Wolbachia is only the best-known parasite out of many to tamper with their hosts' sex lives, so this may turn out to be a common way new species form."" page 238:""Most medicines trace their genealogy to some natural compound in some organism, be it penicillin from a fungus or digitalis from foxglove. Only in the past few years have scientists begun to work their way through the parasite's pharmocopeia. Cordyceps, a fungus that invades insects and sprouts flowerlike stalks out of its body, is the source of cyclosporin, an important antibiotic. hookworms produce molecules that clasp perfectly with clotting factors in human blood, and biotechnology companies are putting them through trials as blood thinners for surgery. Ticks can also tamper with out blood to make their drinking easier, using chemicals that not only solve clots but reduce inflammation and kill bacteria that try to enter a wound. There are other parasitic tricks that still await an explanation. Blood flukes can steal substances out of our own blood to camouflage themselves from the immune system, but no one has figured out how they do it. If scientists did, they might be able to apply their discover to transplanted organs. A doctor might be able to pump a patient's blood through a donor lung and essentially turn it into a gigantic protected fluke. That could spare patients from the dangers of immune-suppressing drugs. And these are only a few parasites; who knows what sorts of chemicals the millions of other have evolved?""Overall, I would say that having at least some science background, particularly that of the immune system and evolution, will significantly increase your reading pleasure of this book. I feel like he tries to explain complicated biology and only partially succeeds, so if you already know what he's getting at then this will be more interesting. If that description fits you, I would highly recommend this book. It is awesome.BTW, for some shameless self-promotion, if you like reading about animals, check out my blog on wildlife at http://backyardzoologist.wordpress.com/"
207,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1879990-adam,5,"I love parasites so much I'm trying to write a fantasy novel about them. They're the most fascinating thing in nature in so many ways. I also loved Carl Zimmer's book She Has Her Mother's Laugh. I was guaranteed to love this and I did. I was obviously up to speed on a lot of the broad-strokes material here, but it never felt like it was wasting my time. A particular peril in books about gross or otherwise taboo subjects is that the author spends so much time talking about the attitudes they assume the audience brings in with them that they barely say anything meaningful about the subject. All the books about rats I've read have that issue. But Zimmer is genuinely curious and knows how to share the curiosity and insight of scientists past and present, and he wastes no time doing anything else. There are tons of wonderful new stories and ideas here, from the Kuchenmeister experiments to the simple semiotics of fluke navigation within the body to the obvious and elegant but somehow novel-to-me idea that humans are a parasite within the global ecosystem and find things to learn from other parasites in balancing that pursuit. The only disappointment really is that this feels massively too short. There's a part in the epilogue, written for the second edition, where Zimmer tells this story about how he learned about jewel wasps acting as parasitoids of cockroaches. And he even says, just as I as thinking the same thing, ""how did I write a whole book about parasites and never learn about this?"" Especially odd considering he does quote Darwin on Ichneumon wasps, and there's a whole section on biocontrol wasps. There are huge realms of parasitology that never come up. I had expected this to be twice as long as it is and cover twice as much and I guess that might not be a fair thing to dock a star (so I guess I won't) for but it just feels really short? Kleptoparasitism doesn't come, or inquilines, or strepsiptera. I would have loved to get Zimmer's more skeptical take on the parasite theory of politics, too. "
208,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19861338-erin-pallott,5,"If you read this, you might come away thinking that parasites are the most important organisms on the planet. I was already a big fan of them, but this book just solidified that. Carl Zimmer is a very popular science writer, and this book is a good example why. Here he gives a great introduction to parasitism and the field of parasitology through everyone's favourite method: the grizzly and gruesome details.This book provides great explanations of how the most deadly parasitic diseases have been so successful, as well as giving examples of lesser known examples that you might see in that one nature documentary (or your nightmares).Zimmer does a great job explaining the concepts of parasitism and showing their place in the bigger picture by expanding into the fields of evolution, medicine and history.Some of the more negative reviews have expressed that parts of this book are hard to read and aren't very accessibly to people who aren't in scientific fields. I would have to disagree and I think this book was written with a wide audience in mind. It is written very clearly (with a handy, long glossary at the back) and provides a lot of great analogies to explain scientific concepts in a way most people should understand. To make this book easier, it would either have to be much longer with lessons in basic biology between each chapter, or have some sections cut out entirely. As this is a scientific book, it shouldn't be a surprise if you do come across words that you have to Google or find some parts confusing. That is just part of science and if you knew it already, you wouldn't need to read the book. I could recommend this book to many people, whether they're someone who already knows some parasitology and wants to gain more knowledge on the subject, or someone that just wants to learn a bunch of cool gross facts to share with their friends and family at the dinner table."
209,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89613608-islomjon,4,"What are the true drivers of evolution? There are multiple answers for this held from various scientists. They consider that drivers are viruses, bacteria, humans, parasites, etc. Each one of them may give us competent arguments for it and they might be true. Yet parasites seem to hurt their hosts most: they give nothing and leave devastating outcomes from their presence, and the same time they lead us to evolve.Carl Zimmer in his book argues that parasites (no matter single celled or multi-cellular organisms) must be why there is an evolution. Furthermore, he masterfully described the micro world that we encounter every day, parasites that kill people, animals and plants. It was wonderful to note how parasites are masters in their metabolism, reproduction and maturing. They seemed more interesting than viruses. Yet they are living organisms and have a little automated orders to survive whatever it takes.However, there are parts that Zimmer had not discussed. For example, the clue of symbiosis that may play a crucial role in host and parasite connection, and perhaps parasites' unique genetics."

212,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4153215-rusty,4,"I’m going to try to get a little closer to current by the end of the year on my reviews. So, watch out internet, Rusty may be posting several reviews over the next few weeks (by which, I mean, essentially, a blog post where I talk about whatever I want to, and at some point may or may not mention the book being reviewed). I think I may have mentioned my kid coming to visit me here. It was an awesome time. What I didn’t mention is that he has a habit of doing risky things and usually turning out okay in the end. Turns out, he had a plan of riding his motorcycle from his place in the southern US to the airport in New York to catch his flight (and later return), because, presumably, the flights were nominally cheaper. Most people that knew and cared for him advised him that this plan was somewhere between ‘monumental stupidity’ and ‘ill-conceived.’ But like many twentysomething men, the world was full of idiots and he was doing it anyway. Anyhow, he missed his flight here, as he was too busy shivering on the side of the interstate about 600 miles south of the airport when it took off. He racked up some motel costs as he called the airlines and made arrangements to fly out of the nearest airport and rebook his flight to Bermuda. But you know what? He made it. He said it was a lesson learned and an experience he’s glad he had. Satisfied that that was about as close as I’ll ever get to a ‘you were right’ sort of thing, my question about his return was simple: Is the return flight to NY? Or to the airport where your motorcycle is? Needless to say, hilarity ensued. Another round of rebooking, extra fees, and longer transit times followed. He couldn’t get to the airport his motorcycle was at because her return flight was through a different airline that did not service that airport. So he had to go to another city, get someone to take him via car up to his bike, then proceed to fix it (his thoughts on his bike: I’m not sure how the rear wheel didn’t fall off as I drove) and then make his way back home. Of course, there was a second round of historically bad weather and another bike breakdown with more shivering on the side of the highway. He ended up having to get someone to come get him because he simply couldn’t make it the last hundred miles or so. The costs of his plan were in the ballpark of a thousand dollars more than if he’d simply flown straight from his local airport. And he was forced to ask friends and family for favors during the holidays. But on the plus side, he cataloged the whole trip, videoing almost every waking moment, so I’m hoping for a Trains, Planes, and Automobiles type of film to come out of the whole ordeal. And then there was this book, which was about a jillion times more terrifying to me than thinking about my kid and his death wish. While this book has nothing at all to do with anything I’ve previously typed, it does connect for me because it makes it clear that life on this planet is a large scale war for survival and that we live in a sea of parasites that will eat your brain, your organs, your flesh, and make you dream of a quick death. They may change how you think, how you live, and how you act – only to benefit them – and make you believe it’s a great idea that you’re living your life based on what they need. Nightmares. All the world is a nightmare. Regardless, I feel I have to point out that this is the longest I have EVER wanted to read a book before I actually set down to read. I read a pre-release excerpt from it in Discover Magazine in what I think was the very late 90’s (could have been early 2000’s) and really wanted to give it a try then. It ended up taking me 20 years to finally get around to it. So, wow. Time flies."
213,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2072674-aj-payne,4,"I find parasites fascinating. Freaky and disturbing, but fascinating. Especially the ones that hijack living creatures to go against their instincts to do things solely to help the parasites. I've always been fascinated by the viruses and bacterias that, for example, force you to sneeze to expel them into new hosts, or force you to have diarrhea to get them back into the water supply. This book wasn't about viruses and bacteria, but about the bigger parasites that all living things live with.And it was super interesting. Zimmer is adept at taking scientific things and making them easy to understand for the lay reader while not getting too bogged down in the details. In this book he describes the history of parasitology, some of the freakiest things parasites do, and what the health of parasites means for the health of the earth. All of it well done and really interesting. Almost makes you want to run off back to school to become a parasitologist. Almost. "

The author jumped from topic to topic but it suited my attention span and in the end he showed the interconnection of the stories he told. And yes, I am indeed calling different ways parasites can infect other living beings as stories because the author had a very prosaic style of writing. If you're interested in random kinda gross biological facts I recommend this book."

He doesn’t touch on parasites in humans a whole lot (although the little he explains was interesting) but I found the rest of the book to be fascinating. Especially the last chapter, where Zimmer explains that as bad as most parasites are, they’re so ingrained and evolved that some species do worse without them.

I thought it would be a list of various parasites and how they live, (similar to his other book, Planet of Viruses,) but this book actually deals more with parasites as a group. The author leaves you with a profound appreciation for how complicated parasites are, and for how big of an impact they have had on our lives.

According to science journalist Carl Zimmer, the majority of animal species are parasitic (p. 187). Bambi and Mickey Mouse had 'em, the sparrows outside your window are riddled with them, and you and I have them. What you'll read about here is how creatures insinuate themselves into other creatures and take control of them; how, for example, a wasp inserts its eggs into a caterpillar and how the larva eat the caterpillar's flesh, and other equally ghastly processes. The result is a view of life without rose colored glasses or any cute Disney characters.I had a dream one night before going to the dentist. I dreamed that there were scores of little white noodles like spaghetti coming out of my gums and tongue when I pressed them. Initially I thought this was a dream of the grooming instinct. But after reading Carl Zimmer's creepy but utterly fascinating book, I believe this primeval dream may have been a dream of parasites.In a sense this is the scariest book I have ever read. I had to put it aside twice because the horror depicted on its pages was affecting my usually buoyant state of mind. Make no mistake about it, however objectively we may try to view our fellow creatures, it is impossible (at least for me) to see parasites as anything other than ugly and despicable. (I'm working on it, however.)But Zimmer has an important purpose in writing this book aside from scaring us. He makes it clear that we cannot understand how an ecology works without understanding the role parasites play in that ecology. For example on page 111 we have wolves choosing to attack a moose that is slow and wheezing, a moose riddled with tapeworms, tapeworms seeking their final host, the wolf! The wolves are led to choose the infected moose perhaps by a scent in the moose's breath, created by the tapeworms. ""The thinning of the herd is an illusion, not the service of the predator but the side effect of a tapeworm traveling through its life.""In Chapter 3, ""The Thirty Years' War,"" Zimmer shows how the immune system fights against parasites. It is an excellent exposition on how the immune system works, and one of the highlights of the book. In the chapter ""Evolution from Within,"" we see parasites as a driving force in evolution. The idea that sexuality began as a way to fight disease, the so-called ""Red Queen"" hypothesis is presented. Zimmer shows how being different instead of a clone of the mother (asexual reproduction) can lead to characteristics that foil parasites. There are sixteen pages of glossy photos of parasites, several showing the grotesque heads of tapeworms in intimate detail. There are photos of a crustacean parasite that invades a fish's mouth, eats its tongue and then takes the place of the tongue.A question that might be asked is, what is a parasite? Certainly in biology a parasite is different than a symbiont, which is distinguished from a predator, etc. Zimmer gives Richard Dawkins's definition that ""Parasitism is any arrangement in which one set of DNA is replicated with the help of--and at the expense of--another set of DNA"" (p. 126). By this definition perhaps humans are parasites on Planet Gaia. Zimmer suggests as much on page 245 adding that ""There's no shame in being a parasite...But we are clumsy in the parasitic way of life."" He explains that expert parasites do no more harm than is necessary. ""If Gaia had an immune system, it might be disease and famine"" to keep ""an exploding species from taking over the world. But we have dodged these safeguards with medicines and toilets and other safeguards...""Zimmer ends the book on a rather cheery note: parasites as the canary in the coal mine. He argues that parasites are not only an indication of ecological health (plenty of parasites suggests a healthy ecosystem; a drop in their numbers suggests trouble, perhaps from pollution), but are vital to the ecology by keeping animal populations in check (pp. 241-243). He also gives some idea of how parasites might benefit us more directly, such as a fungus that invades insects as ""the source of cyclosporin, an important antibiotic"" or the use of blood-clotting molecules produced by hookworms as blood thinners in surgery (p. 238). Although there have been failures in the use of parasites to control insect populations, and Zimmer recounts two or three, there is also the story of how a parasitic wasp imported from South America saved the African cassava crop from mealybugs (pp. 220-228).As others have noted, reading this book will forever change the way you view the natural world, and might make you cancel that trip to the tropics. --Dennis Littrell, author of “The World Is Not as We Think It Is”"
234,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6093453-colin,4,"This is an oldie but a goodie.Parasite Rex is a broad overview, not just of its titular subject, but also of the ways that the notion of the parasite is evolving, and how it should be understood by people. It traces the genealogy of the study of parasitism from the origins of the word in Greek all the way to the 19th century disdain of such creatures as degenerate life forms and evolutionary dead ends that depend utterly upon their host and gave rise to the moral stigma associated with being called a parasite.Zimmer's project is to demonstrate just how complex and well-adapted parasites are as lifeforms, and the ways in which they play an important part in balancing their various ecosystems. Of course, the term parasite is a broad one; it can range from anything from a single celled organism to a large animal like a cuckoo that lays its eggs in the nests of other birds.Parasites are, to put it simply, organisms that are adapted to survive and reproduce at the partial expense of other creatures. Their playground is not the savannahs, hills and jungles of your typical animal, but the bodies of other organisms. In that respect they are as beautifully adapted to these environments as the gazelle is to the Serengeti.The bodies of organisms are treacherous places that have evolved immune responses to foreign invaders. In that respect, parasites are resourceful creatures that constantly innovate (via evolutionary adaptations) creative responses to thrive amidst it, ranging from hiding in plain sight within red blood cells, or constantly changing forms so that T-cells can't keep track of them.Having infested their hapless hosts, parasites need to ensure they are able to propagate to the next stage of their life cycles. And it is in this where parasites get much of their well-deserved reputation as nature's horrors - employing all sorts of creative but ghoulish ways to make their hosts serve their ends - from Sacculina turning male crabs into hapless castrated zombies, to toxoplasma gondii making rats more reckless to ensure they are eaten by cats, hence allowing the parasite to settle into its true feline home. Sometimes these adaptations allow the host to live relatively normal lives, albeit as unwitting Typhoid Marys; in other cases, the death of the host is the prerequisite of the flowering of the parasite into its succeeding life stage.But despite these macabre innovations, Carl Zimmer gives parasites their due as vital players in the diversity of life. Parasites may have played a role in accelerating the evolution of sexual reproduction, energy intensive as it might be, as a means of allowing animals to generate enough species diversity to throw off the pernicious effects of parasites.And parasites play a bigger role in ecosystems than might first appear. Consider the relationship between a predator and prey. The usual narrative is that predators keep populations in check and increase the health of the herd, because usually the weakest prey is the meal of the predator. But perhaps this salutary vision is just an illusion, and it is the parasite that weakens the host to allow it to be captured by the predator, which is its next presumptive host. Parasites, though ghoulish at times, may be the signifiers of healthy, robust ecosystems.Even human evolution has been shaped in large part because of the existence of parasites. We've evolved various responses to common parasites, so much so that in our modern industrialised society, the eradication of such parasites has indirectly led to the rise in new autoimmune diseases such as colitis, as well as an increase in allergies.Zimmer writes in a dense but approachable style, peppering the narrative with interesting stories and examples of parasites and their behaviors, painting an erudite picture of how we should think about the broader role that parasites play in the web of life. Written in the early 2000s as it is, perhaps some of the facts and hypotheses described have been validated or disproven, but ultimately, Parasite Rex still remains a comprehensive and engaging starter guide on how we should think about parasites.I give this: 4 out of 5 guinea worms"
235,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60074558-xander,3,"This book is superbly written: easy to follow, emphasizing the biology behind parasites withot getting too technical and mixing in some pieces of journalism (interviews with experts) with a scientific story. But enough about the book and its style: the content of the book is what it's all about. Zimmer describes how parasites make up most of the existing (and possibly extinct) forms of life on earth. But not only that, parasites are also an indication of the health of entire ecosystems: in natural habitats where parasites thrive in hosts, the ecology is a healthy balance, with the parasites keeping a check on the number of hosts, which in turn leads to a natural check on things like overgrazing and exhaustion of resources. Zimmer details this 'main' story with lots of examples of parasites. After reading this, a reader will be more aware of the importance of parasites for life itself, the impact of parasites on evolution (arms races, immune systems, etc.) and the complex life cycles of parasites - some species take different forms, living in different hosts, before reproducing and dying off (e.g. there are species of lancet flukes that take over the neural systems of ants, driving the ants up grass leaves, waiting to be eating by cattle, after which the fluke lays its eggs inside the intestines of a cow; the eggs get transported through the digestive canal and entire the nature through cow dung, after which the eggs hatch and find new ants to control and start a new life cycle - simply amazing!).The only moment of nuisance came at the last two pages (bummer...), where Zimmer compares the human race to a parasite, living of the totality of ecosystems on earth. The only difference between us and 'normal' parasites, according to Zimmer, is that we are an amateurish species of parasite: not keeping track of the condition of our host ('Gaia') and thereby exterminating ourselves. Apart from the issues about the ambiguous predictions of climate change and loss of biodiversity (especially their impact on humanity), the comparison is in another way misleading. There's only one earth; there's no species of Gaia's. This might sound like an argument some obscure armchair philosopher would concoct, but really it is a crucial one. By comparing humanity to parasites, Zimmer might give the impression that humanity can adapt to changes in the immune system of its host (earth), but the changes in earthly ecosystems (amongst other things) happen much faster than mankind's ability to procreate and thereby adapt. Not to mention the immense suffering of the people that are naturally 'weeded' out in this transitions Something we should not forget when trying to live within the natural boundaries of our little planet. (I guess in general it's a safe rule of thumb not to compare people with parasites at all).But I shouldn't end this review on such a boring note; I really enjoyed this book and apart from the last 2 pages I was (positively) amazed by the lively content - something I didn't expect before opening the book. An this is for a large part due to Zimmer's way of writing and his choices of the material. Well done Zimmer! (I guess it's only fair that Zimmer got a parasite named after himself, as he writes in the new epilogue: the Acanthobotrium zimmeri, a tapeworm living inside a newly discovered whip ray)."
236,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2915426-tippy-jackson,5,"Wow. Just wow. To begin, the first chapter is about defining a parasite and bemoaning the lack of parasite research and scientists. I found it boring and inconclusive. I kept pushing because I figured like most scientific writing once they get the definitions out of the way the good stuff comes. Seriously, that is exactly what happened. Don't give up on this book! It gets better and better as it goes. This book is well organized and split into clear section. In one of my favorites, it describes some of the absolutely astonishing ways parasites avoid being expelled from animals (including sometimes humans)by immune systems. The trickery! A body is a seriously hostile environment and the way these parasites will use their hosts own systems against them or keeps changing their skin so the host immune system doesn't recognize it. It's positively brilliant! They can hijack our own mechanisms to hide from us. It's crazy.There is another section on chemical mind control. I would have thought it would be my favorite, but all of the examples were ones I've already known. Still, parasites altering host behavior or turning hosts into zombies will never not be interesting. Then the author goes into details of parasite evolution, followed by how parasites shape the evolution of their hosts. Some of the experiments he mentions are very convincing and some of the ideas he shares are still in speculation and hypothesis phases, but all are really fascinating. Among my favorites are the development of allergies and human intestinal diseases that may have arisen from the current lack of parasites that our body has adapted to and the evolution of sex as a means of reproduction. He also briefly writes about how chimps may be self-medicating against parasites and he describes a few of the behavioral adaptations that have developed to avoid parasites (i.e. caterpillar poop canons. Lastly, he beautifully writes about the parasites' role in the world and their ecosystems as well as the importance of parasites to the balance of nature. Although always intrigued by them, I've never thought about how important they really are. They are! I swear! We need parasites! And I have never come across an argument for the parasites' place on this planet that is so convincing. He also provides decent reasoning for using parasites as indicator species. And gives the best description of the red queen hypothesis I have ever heard or read.A couple of the specifics I found interesting:page 181:""When a plant is attacked by a parasite, it defends itself with its own version of an immune system by creating poisonous chemicals that the parasite eats as it chews on the plant. But it also fights by sending out cries for help. When a caterpillar bites a leaf, the plant can sense it-a feeling not carried by nerves but felt nevertheless. And in response, the plant makes a particular kind of molecule that wafts into the air. The odor is like perfume for parasitic wasps; as they fly around searching for a host they are powerfully lured by the plant's smell. They follow it to the wounded leaf and find the caterpillar there, and they inject it with eggs. These conversations between plants and wasps are not only timely but precise. Somehow the plant can sense exactly which species of caterpillar is dining on it and spray the appropriate molecule into the air. A parasitic wasp will respond only if the plant lets it know that its own species of host sits on a leaf."" I've also heard of a spider that uses a chemical lure to attract moths and can determine what moths are in the area and choose the correspondingly appropriate chemical. But a plant??? Amazing.page 188-189:""Another way parasites might be able to create a new species is by mucking up the sex lives of their hosts. A bacterium called Wolbachia lives in 15 percent of all insects on Earth as well as many other invertebrates. It lives within its host's cells, and the only way it can infect a new host is by colonizing a female's eggs. When the egg that Wolbachia lives inside becomes fertilized and grows into an adult, it grows up with a case of Wolbachia infection. There's a downside to this way of life: if Wolbachia should grow up in a male it faces a dead end, because there are no eggs for it to infect. As a result, Wolbachia has taken control of its hosts' sex lives. In many of its host species, it tampers with the sperm of infected males so that they can successfully mate only with Wolbachia-carrying females. If on of these infected males should try to mate with a healthy female, all of their offspring will die. Wolbachia uses a different strategy in some species of wasps: normally these insects are born as males and females, which reproduce sexually, but when Wolbachia infects them, the wasps become female-only, able to mother only more females. By turning its hosts all female, the bacteria gives itself that many more hosts. In both these cases, Wolbachia genetically isolates the infected hosts from the uninfected ones. A newly born host will be the offspring of either Wolbachia-carrying parents or two healthy ones. It won't be a healthy-unhealthy hybrid. by setting up this reproductive wall, the parasite may be able to set the stage for a new species to form. Wolbachia is only the best-known parasite out of many to tamper with their hosts' sex lives, so this may turn out to be a common way new species form."" page 238:""Most medicines trace their genealogy to some natural compound in some organism, be it penicillin from a fungus or digitalis from foxglove. Only in the past few years have scientists begun to work their way through the parasite's pharmocopeia. Cordyceps, a fungus that invades insects and sprouts flowerlike stalks out of its body, is the source of cyclosporin, an important antibiotic. hookworms produce molecules that clasp perfectly with clotting factors in human blood, and biotechnology companies are putting them through trials as blood thinners for surgery. Ticks can also tamper with out blood to make their drinking easier, using chemicals that not only solve clots but reduce inflammation and kill bacteria that try to enter a wound. There are other parasitic tricks that still await an explanation. Blood flukes can steal substances out of our own blood to camouflage themselves from the immune system, but no one has figured out how they do it. If scientists did, they might be able to apply their discover to transplanted organs. A doctor might be able to pump a patient's blood through a donor lung and essentially turn it into a gigantic protected fluke. That could spare patients from the dangers of immune-suppressing drugs. And these are only a few parasites; who knows what sorts of chemicals the millions of other have evolved?""Overall, I would say that having at least some science background, particularly that of the immune system and evolution, will significantly increase your reading pleasure of this book. I feel like he tries to explain complicated biology and only partially succeeds, so if you already know what he's getting at then this will be more interesting. If that description fits you, I would highly recommend this book. It is awesome.BTW, for some shameless self-promotion, if you like reading about animals, check out my blog on wildlife at http://backyardzoologist.wordpress.com/"
237,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1879990-adam,5,"I love parasites so much I'm trying to write a fantasy novel about them. They're the most fascinating thing in nature in so many ways. I also loved Carl Zimmer's book She Has Her Mother's Laugh. I was guaranteed to love this and I did. I was obviously up to speed on a lot of the broad-strokes material here, but it never felt like it was wasting my time. A particular peril in books about gross or otherwise taboo subjects is that the author spends so much time talking about the attitudes they assume the audience brings in with them that they barely say anything meaningful about the subject. All the books about rats I've read have that issue. But Zimmer is genuinely curious and knows how to share the curiosity and insight of scientists past and present, and he wastes no time doing anything else. There are tons of wonderful new stories and ideas here, from the Kuchenmeister experiments to the simple semiotics of fluke navigation within the body to the obvious and elegant but somehow novel-to-me idea that humans are a parasite within the global ecosystem and find things to learn from other parasites in balancing that pursuit. The only disappointment really is that this feels massively too short. There's a part in the epilogue, written for the second edition, where Zimmer tells this story about how he learned about jewel wasps acting as parasitoids of cockroaches. And he even says, just as I as thinking the same thing, ""how did I write a whole book about parasites and never learn about this?"" Especially odd considering he does quote Darwin on Ichneumon wasps, and there's a whole section on biocontrol wasps. There are huge realms of parasitology that never come up. I had expected this to be twice as long as it is and cover twice as much and I guess that might not be a fair thing to dock a star (so I guess I won't) for but it just feels really short? Kleptoparasitism doesn't come, or inquilines, or strepsiptera. I would have loved to get Zimmer's more skeptical take on the parasite theory of politics, too. "
238,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19861338-erin-pallott,5,"If you read this, you might come away thinking that parasites are the most important organisms on the planet. I was already a big fan of them, but this book just solidified that. Carl Zimmer is a very popular science writer, and this book is a good example why. Here he gives a great introduction to parasitism and the field of parasitology through everyone's favourite method: the grizzly and gruesome details.This book provides great explanations of how the most deadly parasitic diseases have been so successful, as well as giving examples of lesser known examples that you might see in that one nature documentary (or your nightmares).Zimmer does a great job explaining the concepts of parasitism and showing their place in the bigger picture by expanding into the fields of evolution, medicine and history.Some of the more negative reviews have expressed that parts of this book are hard to read and aren't very accessibly to people who aren't in scientific fields. I would have to disagree and I think this book was written with a wide audience in mind. It is written very clearly (with a handy, long glossary at the back) and provides a lot of great analogies to explain scientific concepts in a way most people should understand. To make this book easier, it would either have to be much longer with lessons in basic biology between each chapter, or have some sections cut out entirely. As this is a scientific book, it shouldn't be a surprise if you do come across words that you have to Google or find some parts confusing. That is just part of science and if you knew it already, you wouldn't need to read the book. I could recommend this book to many people, whether they're someone who already knows some parasitology and wants to gain more knowledge on the subject, or someone that just wants to learn a bunch of cool gross facts to share with their friends and family at the dinner table."
239,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89613608-islomjon,4,"What are the true drivers of evolution? There are multiple answers for this held from various scientists. They consider that drivers are viruses, bacteria, humans, parasites, etc. Each one of them may give us competent arguments for it and they might be true. Yet parasites seem to hurt their hosts most: they give nothing and leave devastating outcomes from their presence, and the same time they lead us to evolve.Carl Zimmer in his book argues that parasites (no matter single celled or multi-cellular organisms) must be why there is an evolution. Furthermore, he masterfully described the micro world that we encounter every day, parasites that kill people, animals and plants. It was wonderful to note how parasites are masters in their metabolism, reproduction and maturing. They seemed more interesting than viruses. Yet they are living organisms and have a little automated orders to survive whatever it takes.However, there are parts that Zimmer had not discussed. For example, the clue of symbiosis that may play a crucial role in host and parasite connection, and perhaps parasites' unique genetics."

242,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4153215-rusty,4,"I’m going to try to get a little closer to current by the end of the year on my reviews. So, watch out internet, Rusty may be posting several reviews over the next few weeks (by which, I mean, essentially, a blog post where I talk about whatever I want to, and at some point may or may not mention the book being reviewed). I think I may have mentioned my kid coming to visit me here. It was an awesome time. What I didn’t mention is that he has a habit of doing risky things and usually turning out okay in the end. Turns out, he had a plan of riding his motorcycle from his place in the southern US to the airport in New York to catch his flight (and later return), because, presumably, the flights were nominally cheaper. Most people that knew and cared for him advised him that this plan was somewhere between ‘monumental stupidity’ and ‘ill-conceived.’ But like many twentysomething men, the world was full of idiots and he was doing it anyway. Anyhow, he missed his flight here, as he was too busy shivering on the side of the interstate about 600 miles south of the airport when it took off. He racked up some motel costs as he called the airlines and made arrangements to fly out of the nearest airport and rebook his flight to Bermuda. But you know what? He made it. He said it was a lesson learned and an experience he’s glad he had. Satisfied that that was about as close as I’ll ever get to a ‘you were right’ sort of thing, my question about his return was simple: Is the return flight to NY? Or to the airport where your motorcycle is? Needless to say, hilarity ensued. Another round of rebooking, extra fees, and longer transit times followed. He couldn’t get to the airport his motorcycle was at because her return flight was through a different airline that did not service that airport. So he had to go to another city, get someone to take him via car up to his bike, then proceed to fix it (his thoughts on his bike: I’m not sure how the rear wheel didn’t fall off as I drove) and then make his way back home. Of course, there was a second round of historically bad weather and another bike breakdown with more shivering on the side of the highway. He ended up having to get someone to come get him because he simply couldn’t make it the last hundred miles or so. The costs of his plan were in the ballpark of a thousand dollars more than if he’d simply flown straight from his local airport. And he was forced to ask friends and family for favors during the holidays. But on the plus side, he cataloged the whole trip, videoing almost every waking moment, so I’m hoping for a Trains, Planes, and Automobiles type of film to come out of the whole ordeal. And then there was this book, which was about a jillion times more terrifying to me than thinking about my kid and his death wish. While this book has nothing at all to do with anything I’ve previously typed, it does connect for me because it makes it clear that life on this planet is a large scale war for survival and that we live in a sea of parasites that will eat your brain, your organs, your flesh, and make you dream of a quick death. They may change how you think, how you live, and how you act – only to benefit them – and make you believe it’s a great idea that you’re living your life based on what they need. Nightmares. All the world is a nightmare. Regardless, I feel I have to point out that this is the longest I have EVER wanted to read a book before I actually set down to read. I read a pre-release excerpt from it in Discover Magazine in what I think was the very late 90’s (could have been early 2000’s) and really wanted to give it a try then. It ended up taking me 20 years to finally get around to it. So, wow. Time flies."
243,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2072674-aj-payne,4,"I find parasites fascinating. Freaky and disturbing, but fascinating. Especially the ones that hijack living creatures to go against their instincts to do things solely to help the parasites. I've always been fascinated by the viruses and bacterias that, for example, force you to sneeze to expel them into new hosts, or force you to have diarrhea to get them back into the water supply. This book wasn't about viruses and bacteria, but about the bigger parasites that all living things live with.And it was super interesting. Zimmer is adept at taking scientific things and making them easy to understand for the lay reader while not getting too bogged down in the details. In this book he describes the history of parasitology, some of the freakiest things parasites do, and what the health of parasites means for the health of the earth. All of it well done and really interesting. Almost makes you want to run off back to school to become a parasitologist. Almost. "

The author jumped from topic to topic but it suited my attention span and in the end he showed the interconnection of the stories he told. And yes, I am indeed calling different ways parasites can infect other living beings as stories because the author had a very prosaic style of writing.

Zimmer shares examples of various parasites, their behaviors and how they evolved into master manipulators. He describes how they affect certain species specifically and how parasites can end up altering entire ecosystems. He doesn’t touch on parasites in humans a whole lot (although the little he explains was interesting) but I found the rest of the book to be fascinating. Especially the last chapter, where Zimmer explains that as bad as most parasites are, they’re so ingrained and evolved that some species do worse without them. Highly recommend this if you enjoy reading biology or science!"

It wasn't what I was expecting, but I really enjoyed it. I thought it would be a list of various parasites and how they live, (similar to his other book, Planet of Viruses,) but this book actually deals more with parasites as a group. The author leaves you with a profound appreciation for how complicated parasites are, and for how big of an impact they have had on our lives.

263,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,5,"Ugh, yuck and yike!The prevalence of parasites in the earth's ecosystems is perhaps the worst of the dirty little secrets of life. According to science journalist Carl Zimmer, the majority of animal species are parasitic (p. 187). Bambi and Mickey Mouse had 'em, the sparrows outside your window are riddled with them, and you and I have them. What you'll read about here is how creatures insinuate themselves into other creatures and take control of them; how, for example, a wasp inserts its eggs into a caterpillar and how the larva eat the caterpillar's flesh, and other equally ghastly processes. The result is a view of life without rose colored glasses or any cute Disney characters.I had a dream one night before going to the dentist. I dreamed that there were scores of little white noodles like spaghetti coming out of my gums and tongue when I pressed them. Initially I thought this was a dream of the grooming instinct. But after reading Carl Zimmer's creepy but utterly fascinating book, I believe this primeval dream may have been a dream of parasites.In a sense this is the scariest book I have ever read. I had to put it aside twice because the horror depicted on its pages was affecting my usually buoyant state of mind. Make no mistake about it, however objectively we may try to view our fellow creatures, it is impossible (at least for me) to see parasites as anything other than ugly and despicable. (I'm working on it, however.)But Zimmer has an important purpose in writing this book aside from scaring us. He makes it clear that we cannot understand how an ecology works without understanding the role parasites play in that ecology. For example on page 111 we have wolves choosing to attack a moose that is slow and wheezing, a moose riddled with tapeworms, tapeworms seeking their final host, the wolf! The wolves are led to choose the infected moose perhaps by a scent in the moose's breath, created by the tapeworms. ""The thinning of the herd is an illusion, not the service of the predator but the side effect of a tapeworm traveling through its life.""In Chapter 3, ""The Thirty Years' War,"" Zimmer shows how the immune system fights against parasites. It is an excellent exposition on how the immune system works, and one of the highlights of the book. In the chapter ""Evolution from Within,"" we see parasites as a driving force in evolution. The idea that sexuality began as a way to fight disease, the so-called ""Red Queen"" hypothesis is presented. Zimmer shows how being different instead of a clone of the mother (asexual reproduction) can lead to characteristics that foil parasites. There are sixteen pages of glossy photos of parasites, several showing the grotesque heads of tapeworms in intimate detail. There are photos of a crustacean parasite that invades a fish's mouth, eats its tongue and then takes the place of the tongue.A question that might be asked is, what is a parasite? Certainly in biology a parasite is different than a symbiont, which is distinguished from a predator, etc. Zimmer gives Richard Dawkins's definition that ""Parasitism is any arrangement in which one set of DNA is replicated with the help of--and at the expense of--another set of DNA"" (p. 126). By this definition perhaps humans are parasites on Planet Gaia. Zimmer suggests as much on page 245 adding that ""There's no shame in being a parasite...But we are clumsy in the parasitic way of life."" He explains that expert parasites do no more harm than is necessary. ""If Gaia had an immune system, it might be disease and famine"" to keep ""an exploding species from taking over the world. But we have dodged these safeguards with medicines and toilets and other safeguards...""Zimmer ends the book on a rather cheery note: parasites as the canary in the coal mine. He argues that parasites are not only an indication of ecological health (plenty of parasites suggests a healthy ecosystem; a drop in their numbers suggests trouble, perhaps from pollution), but are vital to the ecology by keeping animal populations in check (pp. 241-243). He also gives some idea of how parasites might benefit us more directly, such as a fungus that invades insects as ""the source of cyclosporin, an important antibiotic"" or the use of blood-clotting molecules produced by hookworms as blood thinners in surgery (p. 238). Although there have been failures in the use of parasites to control insect populations, and Zimmer recounts two or three, there is also the story of how a parasitic wasp imported from South America saved the African cassava crop from mealybugs (pp. 220-228).As others have noted, reading this book will forever change the way you view the natural world, and might make you cancel that trip to the tropics. --Dennis Littrell, author of “The World Is Not as We Think It Is”"
264,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6093453-colin,4,"This is an oldie but a goodie.Parasite Rex is a broad overview, not just of its titular subject, but also of the ways that the notion of the parasite is evolving, and how it should be understood by people. It traces the genealogy of the study of parasitism from the origins of the word in Greek all the way to the 19th century disdain of such creatures as degenerate life forms and evolutionary dead ends that depend utterly upon their host and gave rise to the moral stigma associated with being called a parasite.Zimmer's project is to demonstrate just how complex and well-adapted parasites are as lifeforms, and the ways in which they play an important part in balancing their various ecosystems. Of course, the term parasite is a broad one; it can range from anything from a single celled organism to a large animal like a cuckoo that lays its eggs in the nests of other birds.Parasites are, to put it simply, organisms that are adapted to survive and reproduce at the partial expense of other creatures. Their playground is not the savannahs, hills and jungles of your typical animal, but the bodies of other organisms. In that respect they are as beautifully adapted to these environments as the gazelle is to the Serengeti.The bodies of organisms are treacherous places that have evolved immune responses to foreign invaders. In that respect, parasites are resourceful creatures that constantly innovate (via evolutionary adaptations) creative responses to thrive amidst it, ranging from hiding in plain sight within red blood cells, or constantly changing forms so that T-cells can't keep track of them.Having infested their hapless hosts, parasites need to ensure they are able to propagate to the next stage of their life cycles. And it is in this where parasites get much of their well-deserved reputation as nature's horrors - employing all sorts of creative but ghoulish ways to make their hosts serve their ends - from Sacculina turning male crabs into hapless castrated zombies, to toxoplasma gondii making rats more reckless to ensure they are eaten by cats, hence allowing the parasite to settle into its true feline home. Sometimes these adaptations allow the host to live relatively normal lives, albeit as unwitting Typhoid Marys; in other cases, the death of the host is the prerequisite of the flowering of the parasite into its succeeding life stage.But despite these macabre innovations, Carl Zimmer gives parasites their due as vital players in the diversity of life. Parasites may have played a role in accelerating the evolution of sexual reproduction, energy intensive as it might be, as a means of allowing animals to generate enough species diversity to throw off the pernicious effects of parasites.And parasites play a bigger role in ecosystems than might first appear. Consider the relationship between a predator and prey. The usual narrative is that predators keep populations in check and increase the health of the herd, because usually the weakest prey is the meal of the predator. But perhaps this salutary vision is just an illusion, and it is the parasite that weakens the host to allow it to be captured by the predator, which is its next presumptive host. Parasites, though ghoulish at times, may be the signifiers of healthy, robust ecosystems.Even human evolution has been shaped in large part because of the existence of parasites. We've evolved various responses to common parasites, so much so that in our modern industrialised society, the eradication of such parasites has indirectly led to the rise in new autoimmune diseases such as colitis, as well as an increase in allergies.Zimmer writes in a dense but approachable style, peppering the narrative with interesting stories and examples of parasites and their behaviors, painting an erudite picture of how we should think about the broader role that parasites play in the web of life. Written in the early 2000s as it is, perhaps some of the facts and hypotheses described have been validated or disproven, but ultimately, Parasite Rex still remains a comprehensive and engaging starter guide on how we should think about parasites.I give this: 4 out of 5 guinea worms"
265,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60074558-xander,3,"This book is superbly written: easy to follow, emphasizing the biology behind parasites withot getting too technical and mixing in some pieces of journalism (interviews with experts) with a scientific story. But enough about the book and its style: the content of the book is what it's all about. Zimmer describes how parasites make up most of the existing (and possibly extinct) forms of life on earth. But not only that, parasites are also an indication of the health of entire ecosystems: in natural habitats where parasites thrive in hosts, the ecology is a healthy balance, with the parasites keeping a check on the number of hosts, which in turn leads to a natural check on things like overgrazing and exhaustion of resources. Zimmer details this 'main' story with lots of examples of parasites. After reading this, a reader will be more aware of the importance of parasites for life itself, the impact of parasites on evolution (arms races, immune systems, etc.) and the complex life cycles of parasites - some species take different forms, living in different hosts, before reproducing and dying off (e.g. there are species of lancet flukes that take over the neural systems of ants, driving the ants up grass leaves, waiting to be eating by cattle, after which the fluke lays its eggs inside the intestines of a cow; the eggs get transported through the digestive canal and entire the nature through cow dung, after which the eggs hatch and find new ants to control and start a new life cycle - simply amazing!).The only moment of nuisance came at the last two pages (bummer...), where Zimmer compares the human race to a parasite, living of the totality of ecosystems on earth. The only difference between us and 'normal' parasites, according to Zimmer, is that we are an amateurish species of parasite: not keeping track of the condition of our host ('Gaia') and thereby exterminating ourselves. Apart from the issues about the ambiguous predictions of climate change and loss of biodiversity (especially their impact on humanity), the comparison is in another way misleading. There's only one earth; there's no species of Gaia's. This might sound like an argument some obscure armchair philosopher would concoct, but really it is a crucial one. By comparing humanity to parasites, Zimmer might give the impression that humanity can adapt to changes in the immune system of its host (earth), but the changes in earthly ecosystems (amongst other things) happen much faster than mankind's ability to procreate and thereby adapt. Not to mention the immense suffering of the people that are naturally 'weeded' out in this transitions Something we should not forget when trying to live within the natural boundaries of our little planet. (I guess in general it's a safe rule of thumb not to compare people with parasites at all).But I shouldn't end this review on such a boring note; I really enjoyed this book and apart from the last 2 pages I was (positively) amazed by the lively content - something I didn't expect before opening the book. An this is for a large part due to Zimmer's way of writing and his choices of the material. Well done Zimmer! (I guess it's only fair that Zimmer got a parasite named after himself, as he writes in the new epilogue: the Acanthobotrium zimmeri, a tapeworm living inside a newly discovered whip ray)."
266,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2915426-tippy-jackson,5,"Wow. Just wow. To begin, the first chapter is about defining a parasite and bemoaning the lack of parasite research and scientists. I found it boring and inconclusive. I kept pushing because I figured like most scientific writing once they get the definitions out of the way the good stuff comes. Seriously, that is exactly what happened. Don't give up on this book! It gets better and better as it goes. This book is well organized and split into clear section. In one of my favorites, it describes some of the absolutely astonishing ways parasites avoid being expelled from animals (including sometimes humans)by immune systems. The trickery! A body is a seriously hostile environment and the way these parasites will use their hosts own systems against them or keeps changing their skin so the host immune system doesn't recognize it. It's positively brilliant! They can hijack our own mechanisms to hide from us. It's crazy.There is another section on chemical mind control. I would have thought it would be my favorite, but all of the examples were ones I've already known. Still, parasites altering host behavior or turning hosts into zombies will never not be interesting. Then the author goes into details of parasite evolution, followed by how parasites shape the evolution of their hosts. Some of the experiments he mentions are very convincing and some of the ideas he shares are still in speculation and hypothesis phases, but all are really fascinating. Among my favorites are the development of allergies and human intestinal diseases that may have arisen from the current lack of parasites that our body has adapted to and the evolution of sex as a means of reproduction. He also briefly writes about how chimps may be self-medicating against parasites and he describes a few of the behavioral adaptations that have developed to avoid parasites (i.e. caterpillar poop canons. Lastly, he beautifully writes about the parasites' role in the world and their ecosystems as well as the importance of parasites to the balance of nature. Although always intrigued by them, I've never thought about how important they really are. They are! I swear! We need parasites! And I have never come across an argument for the parasites' place on this planet that is so convincing. He also provides decent reasoning for using parasites as indicator species. And gives the best description of the red queen hypothesis I have ever heard or read.A couple of the specifics I found interesting:page 181:""When a plant is attacked by a parasite, it defends itself with its own version of an immune system by creating poisonous chemicals that the parasite eats as it chews on the plant. But it also fights by sending out cries for help. When a caterpillar bites a leaf, the plant can sense it-a feeling not carried by nerves but felt nevertheless. And in response, the plant makes a particular kind of molecule that wafts into the air. The odor is like perfume for parasitic wasps; as they fly around searching for a host they are powerfully lured by the plant's smell. They follow it to the wounded leaf and find the caterpillar there, and they inject it with eggs. These conversations between plants and wasps are not only timely but precise. Somehow the plant can sense exactly which species of caterpillar is dining on it and spray the appropriate molecule into the air. A parasitic wasp will respond only if the plant lets it know that its own species of host sits on a leaf."" I've also heard of a spider that uses a chemical lure to attract moths and can determine what moths are in the area and choose the correspondingly appropriate chemical. But a plant??? Amazing.page 188-189:""Another way parasites might be able to create a new species is by mucking up the sex lives of their hosts. A bacterium called Wolbachia lives in 15 percent of all insects on Earth as well as many other invertebrates. It lives within its host's cells, and the only way it can infect a new host is by colonizing a female's eggs. When the egg that Wolbachia lives inside becomes fertilized and grows into an adult, it grows up with a case of Wolbachia infection. There's a downside to this way of life: if Wolbachia should grow up in a male it faces a dead end, because there are no eggs for it to infect. As a result, Wolbachia has taken control of its hosts' sex lives. In many of its host species, it tampers with the sperm of infected males so that they can successfully mate only with Wolbachia-carrying females. If on of these infected males should try to mate with a healthy female, all of their offspring will die. Wolbachia uses a different strategy in some species of wasps: normally these insects are born as males and females, which reproduce sexually, but when Wolbachia infects them, the wasps become female-only, able to mother only more females. By turning its hosts all female, the bacteria gives itself that many more hosts. In both these cases, Wolbachia genetically isolates the infected hosts from the uninfected ones. A newly born host will be the offspring of either Wolbachia-carrying parents or two healthy ones. It won't be a healthy-unhealthy hybrid. by setting up this reproductive wall, the parasite may be able to set the stage for a new species to form. Wolbachia is only the best-known parasite out of many to tamper with their hosts' sex lives, so this may turn out to be a common way new species form."" page 238:""Most medicines trace their genealogy to some natural compound in some organism, be it penicillin from a fungus or digitalis from foxglove. Only in the past few years have scientists begun to work their way through the parasite's pharmocopeia. Cordyceps, a fungus that invades insects and sprouts flowerlike stalks out of its body, is the source of cyclosporin, an important antibiotic. hookworms produce molecules that clasp perfectly with clotting factors in human blood, and biotechnology companies are putting them through trials as blood thinners for surgery. Ticks can also tamper with out blood to make their drinking easier, using chemicals that not only solve clots but reduce inflammation and kill bacteria that try to enter a wound. There are other parasitic tricks that still await an explanation. Blood flukes can steal substances out of our own blood to camouflage themselves from the immune system, but no one has figured out how they do it. If scientists did, they might be able to apply their discover to transplanted organs. A doctor might be able to pump a patient's blood through a donor lung and essentially turn it into a gigantic protected fluke. That could spare patients from the dangers of immune-suppressing drugs. And these are only a few parasites; who knows what sorts of chemicals the millions of other have evolved?""Overall, I would say that having at least some science background, particularly that of the immune system and evolution, will significantly increase your reading pleasure of this book. I feel like he tries to explain complicated biology and only partially succeeds, so if you already know what he's getting at then this will be more interesting. If that description fits you, I would highly recommend this book. It is awesome.BTW, for some shameless self-promotion, if you like reading about animals, check out my blog on wildlife at http://backyardzoologist.wordpress.com/"
267,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1879990-adam,5,"I love parasites so much I'm trying to write a fantasy novel about them. They're the most fascinating thing in nature in so many ways. I also loved Carl Zimmer's book She Has Her Mother's Laugh. I was guaranteed to love this and I did. I was obviously up to speed on a lot of the broad-strokes material here, but it never felt like it was wasting my time. A particular peril in books about gross or otherwise taboo subjects is that the author spends so much time talking about the attitudes they assume the audience brings in with them that they barely say anything meaningful about the subject. All the books about rats I've read have that issue. But Zimmer is genuinely curious and knows how to share the curiosity and insight of scientists past and present, and he wastes no time doing anything else. There are tons of wonderful new stories and ideas here, from the Kuchenmeister experiments to the simple semiotics of fluke navigation within the body to the obvious and elegant but somehow novel-to-me idea that humans are a parasite within the global ecosystem and find things to learn from other parasites in balancing that pursuit. The only disappointment really is that this feels massively too short. There's a part in the epilogue, written for the second edition, where Zimmer tells this story about how he learned about jewel wasps acting as parasitoids of cockroaches. And he even says, just as I as thinking the same thing, ""how did I write a whole book about parasites and never learn about this?"" Especially odd considering he does quote Darwin on Ichneumon wasps, and there's a whole section on biocontrol wasps. There are huge realms of parasitology that never come up. I had expected this to be twice as long as it is and cover twice as much and I guess that might not be a fair thing to dock a star (so I guess I won't) for but it just feels really short? Kleptoparasitism doesn't come, or inquilines, or strepsiptera. I would have loved to get Zimmer's more skeptical take on the parasite theory of politics, too. "
268,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19861338-erin-pallott,5,"If you read this, you might come away thinking that parasites are the most important organisms on the planet. I was already a big fan of them, but this book just solidified that. Carl Zimmer is a very popular science writer, and this book is a good example why. Here he gives a great introduction to parasitism and the field of parasitology through everyone's favourite method: the grizzly and gruesome details.This book provides great explanations of how the most deadly parasitic diseases have been so successful, as well as giving examples of lesser known examples that you might see in that one nature documentary (or your nightmares).Zimmer does a great job explaining the concepts of parasitism and showing their place in the bigger picture by expanding into the fields of evolution, medicine and history.Some of the more negative reviews have expressed that parts of this book are hard to read and aren't very accessibly to people who aren't in scientific fields. I would have to disagree and I think this book was written with a wide audience in mind. It is written very clearly (with a handy, long glossary at the back) and provides a lot of great analogies to explain scientific concepts in a way most people should understand. To make this book easier, it would either have to be much longer with lessons in basic biology between each chapter, or have some sections cut out entirely. As this is a scientific book, it shouldn't be a surprise if you do come across words that you have to Google or find some parts confusing. That is just part of science and if you knew it already, you wouldn't need to read the book. I could recommend this book to many people, whether they're someone who already knows some parasitology and wants to gain more knowledge on the subject, or someone that just wants to learn a bunch of cool gross facts to share with their friends and family at the dinner table."
269,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89613608-islomjon,4,"What are the true drivers of evolution? There are multiple answers for this held from various scientists. They consider that drivers are viruses, bacteria, humans, parasites, etc. Each one of them may give us competent arguments for it and they might be true. Yet parasites seem to hurt their hosts most: they give nothing and leave devastating outcomes from their presence, and the same time they lead us to evolve.Carl Zimmer in his book argues that parasites (no matter single celled or multi-cellular organisms) must be why there is an evolution. Furthermore, he masterfully described the micro world that we encounter every day, parasites that kill people, animals and plants. It was wonderful to note how parasites are masters in their metabolism, reproduction and maturing. They seemed more interesting than viruses. Yet they are living organisms and have a little automated orders to survive whatever it takes.However, there are parts that Zimmer had not discussed. For example, the clue of symbiosis that may play a crucial role in host and parasite connection, and perhaps parasites' unique genetics."

272,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4153215-rusty,4,"I’m going to try to get a little closer to current by the end of the year on my reviews. So, watch out internet, Rusty may be posting several reviews over the next few weeks (by which, I mean, essentially, a blog post where I talk about whatever I want to, and at some point may or may not mention the book being reviewed). I think I may have mentioned my kid coming to visit me here. It was an awesome time. What I didn’t mention is that he has a habit of doing risky things and usually turning out okay in the end. Turns out, he had a plan of riding his motorcycle from his place in the southern US to the airport in New York to catch his flight (and later return), because, presumably, the flights were nominally cheaper. Most people that knew and cared for him advised him that this plan was somewhere between ‘monumental stupidity’ and ‘ill-conceived.’ But like many twentysomething men, the world was full of idiots and he was doing it anyway. Anyhow, he missed his flight here, as he was too busy shivering on the side of the interstate about 600 miles south of the airport when it took off. He racked up some motel costs as he called the airlines and made arrangements to fly out of the nearest airport and rebook his flight to Bermuda. But you know what? He made it. He said it was a lesson learned and an experience he’s glad he had. Satisfied that that was about as close as I’ll ever get to a ‘you were right’ sort of thing, my question about his return was simple: Is the return flight to NY? Or to the airport where your motorcycle is? Needless to say, hilarity ensued. Another round of rebooking, extra fees, and longer transit times followed. He couldn’t get to the airport his motorcycle was at because her return flight was through a different airline that did not service that airport. So he had to go to another city, get someone to take him via car up to his bike, then proceed to fix it (his thoughts on his bike: I’m not sure how the rear wheel didn’t fall off as I drove) and then make his way back home. Of course, there was a second round of historically bad weather and another bike breakdown with more shivering on the side of the highway. He ended up having to get someone to come get him because he simply couldn’t make it the last hundred miles or so. The costs of his plan were in the ballpark of a thousand dollars more than if he’d simply flown straight from his local airport. And he was forced to ask friends and family for favors during the holidays. But on the plus side, he cataloged the whole trip, videoing almost every waking moment, so I’m hoping for a Trains, Planes, and Automobiles type of film to come out of the whole ordeal. And then there was this book, which was about a jillion times more terrifying to me than thinking about my kid and his death wish. While this book has nothing at all to do with anything I’ve previously typed, it does connect for me because it makes it clear that life on this planet is a large scale war for survival and that we live in a sea of parasites that will eat your brain, your organs, your flesh, and make you dream of a quick death. They may change how you think, how you live, and how you act – only to benefit them – and make you believe it’s a great idea that you’re living your life based on what they need. Nightmares. All the world is a nightmare. Regardless, I feel I have to point out that this is the longest I have EVER wanted to read a book before I actually set down to read. I read a pre-release excerpt from it in Discover Magazine in what I think was the very late 90’s (could have been early 2000’s) and really wanted to give it a try then. It ended up taking me 20 years to finally get around to it. So, wow. Time flies."
273,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2072674-aj-payne,4,"I find parasites fascinating. Freaky and disturbing, but fascinating. Especially the ones that hijack living creatures to go against their instincts to do things solely to help the parasites. I've always been fascinated by the viruses and bacterias that, for example, force you to sneeze to expel them into new hosts, or force you to have diarrhea to get them back into the water supply. This book wasn't about viruses and bacteria, but about the bigger parasites that all living things live with.And it was super interesting. Zimmer is adept at taking scientific things and making them easy to understand for the lay reader while not getting too bogged down in the details. In this book he describes the history of parasitology, some of the freakiest things parasites do, and what the health of parasites means for the health of the earth. All of it well done and really interesting. Almost makes you want to run off back to school to become a parasitologist. Almost. "

It wasn't what I was expecting, but I really enjoyed it. I thought it would be a list of various parasites and how they live, (similar to his other book, Planet of Viruses,) but this book actually deals more with parasites as a group. The author leaves you with a profound appreciation for how complicated parasites are, and for how big of an impact they have had on our lives. (Who knew that rise in allergies has been linked to a decrease in intestinal parasites?)"

Beyond the creep factor, there is much here to think about. For example, does a healthy ecosystem actually depend on parasites to thrive? How much of evolution occurs in the partnership between parasite and host? The human animal lives in a web of connections— most of which we try very hard to ignore. Yet the health of an ecosystem may actually depend on the balance between parasites and host. "

This book does a great job of showing us the world of parasites. Even though parasites are simple creatures they are very effective at what they do. Many parasites redirect or control the behavior the the host they are infecting. Even human behavior is controlled when the human is infected with particular parasites. This is a surprisingly thought provoking book. Definitely worth reading!

293,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,5,"Ugh, yuck and yike!The prevalence of parasites in the earth's ecosystems is perhaps the worst of the dirty little secrets of life. According to science journalist Carl Zimmer, the majority of animal species are parasitic (p. 187). Bambi and Mickey Mouse had 'em, the sparrows outside your window are riddled with them, and you and I have them. What you'll read about here is how creatures insinuate themselves into other creatures and take control of them; how, for example, a wasp inserts its eggs into a caterpillar and how the larva eat the caterpillar's flesh, and other equally ghastly processes. The result is a view of life without rose colored glasses or any cute Disney characters.I had a dream one night before going to the dentist. I dreamed that there were scores of little white noodles like spaghetti coming out of my gums and tongue when I pressed them. Initially I thought this was a dream of the grooming instinct. But after reading Carl Zimmer's creepy but utterly fascinating book, I believe this primeval dream may have been a dream of parasites.In a sense this is the scariest book I have ever read. I had to put it aside twice because the horror depicted on its pages was affecting my usually buoyant state of mind. Make no mistake about it, however objectively we may try to view our fellow creatures, it is impossible (at least for me) to see parasites as anything other than ugly and despicable. (I'm working on it, however.)But Zimmer has an important purpose in writing this book aside from scaring us. He makes it clear that we cannot understand how an ecology works without understanding the role parasites play in that ecology. For example on page 111 we have wolves choosing to attack a moose that is slow and wheezing, a moose riddled with tapeworms, tapeworms seeking their final host, the wolf! The wolves are led to choose the infected moose perhaps by a scent in the moose's breath, created by the tapeworms. ""The thinning of the herd is an illusion, not the service of the predator but the side effect of a tapeworm traveling through its life.""In Chapter 3, ""The Thirty Years' War,"" Zimmer shows how the immune system fights against parasites. It is an excellent exposition on how the immune system works, and one of the highlights of the book. In the chapter ""Evolution from Within,"" we see parasites as a driving force in evolution. The idea that sexuality began as a way to fight disease, the so-called ""Red Queen"" hypothesis is presented. Zimmer shows how being different instead of a clone of the mother (asexual reproduction) can lead to characteristics that foil parasites. There are sixteen pages of glossy photos of parasites, several showing the grotesque heads of tapeworms in intimate detail. There are photos of a crustacean parasite that invades a fish's mouth, eats its tongue and then takes the place of the tongue.A question that might be asked is, what is a parasite? Certainly in biology a parasite is different than a symbiont, which is distinguished from a predator, etc. Zimmer gives Richard Dawkins's definition that ""Parasitism is any arrangement in which one set of DNA is replicated with the help of--and at the expense of--another set of DNA"" (p. 126). By this definition perhaps humans are parasites on Planet Gaia. Zimmer suggests as much on page 245 adding that ""There's no shame in being a parasite...But we are clumsy in the parasitic way of life."" He explains that expert parasites do no more harm than is necessary. ""If Gaia had an immune system, it might be disease and famine"" to keep ""an exploding species from taking over the world. But we have dodged these safeguards with medicines and toilets and other safeguards...""Zimmer ends the book on a rather cheery note: parasites as the canary in the coal mine. He argues that parasites are not only an indication of ecological health (plenty of parasites suggests a healthy ecosystem; a drop in their numbers suggests trouble, perhaps from pollution), but are vital to the ecology by keeping animal populations in check (pp. 241-243). He also gives some idea of how parasites might benefit us more directly, such as a fungus that invades insects as ""the source of cyclosporin, an important antibiotic"" or the use of blood-clotting molecules produced by hookworms as blood thinners in surgery (p. 238). Although there have been failures in the use of parasites to control insect populations, and Zimmer recounts two or three, there is also the story of how a parasitic wasp imported from South America saved the African cassava crop from mealybugs (pp. 220-228).As others have noted, reading this book will forever change the way you view the natural world, and might make you cancel that trip to the tropics. --Dennis Littrell, author of “The World Is Not as We Think It Is”"
294,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6093453-colin,4,"This is an oldie but a goodie.Parasite Rex is a broad overview, not just of its titular subject, but also of the ways that the notion of the parasite is evolving, and how it should be understood by people. It traces the genealogy of the study of parasitism from the origins of the word in Greek all the way to the 19th century disdain of such creatures as degenerate life forms and evolutionary dead ends that depend utterly upon their host and gave rise to the moral stigma associated with being called a parasite.Zimmer's project is to demonstrate just how complex and well-adapted parasites are as lifeforms, and the ways in which they play an important part in balancing their various ecosystems. Of course, the term parasite is a broad one; it can range from anything from a single celled organism to a large animal like a cuckoo that lays its eggs in the nests of other birds.Parasites are, to put it simply, organisms that are adapted to survive and reproduce at the partial expense of other creatures. Their playground is not the savannahs, hills and jungles of your typical animal, but the bodies of other organisms. In that respect they are as beautifully adapted to these environments as the gazelle is to the Serengeti.The bodies of organisms are treacherous places that have evolved immune responses to foreign invaders. In that respect, parasites are resourceful creatures that constantly innovate (via evolutionary adaptations) creative responses to thrive amidst it, ranging from hiding in plain sight within red blood cells, or constantly changing forms so that T-cells can't keep track of them.Having infested their hapless hosts, parasites need to ensure they are able to propagate to the next stage of their life cycles. And it is in this where parasites get much of their well-deserved reputation as nature's horrors - employing all sorts of creative but ghoulish ways to make their hosts serve their ends - from Sacculina turning male crabs into hapless castrated zombies, to toxoplasma gondii making rats more reckless to ensure they are eaten by cats, hence allowing the parasite to settle into its true feline home. Sometimes these adaptations allow the host to live relatively normal lives, albeit as unwitting Typhoid Marys; in other cases, the death of the host is the prerequisite of the flowering of the parasite into its succeeding life stage.But despite these macabre innovations, Carl Zimmer gives parasites their due as vital players in the diversity of life. Parasites may have played a role in accelerating the evolution of sexual reproduction, energy intensive as it might be, as a means of allowing animals to generate enough species diversity to throw off the pernicious effects of parasites.And parasites play a bigger role in ecosystems than might first appear. Consider the relationship between a predator and prey. The usual narrative is that predators keep populations in check and increase the health of the herd, because usually the weakest prey is the meal of the predator. But perhaps this salutary vision is just an illusion, and it is the parasite that weakens the host to allow it to be captured by the predator, which is its next presumptive host. Parasites, though ghoulish at times, may be the signifiers of healthy, robust ecosystems.Even human evolution has been shaped in large part because of the existence of parasites. We've evolved various responses to common parasites, so much so that in our modern industrialised society, the eradication of such parasites has indirectly led to the rise in new autoimmune diseases such as colitis, as well as an increase in allergies.Zimmer writes in a dense but approachable style, peppering the narrative with interesting stories and examples of parasites and their behaviors, painting an erudite picture of how we should think about the broader role that parasites play in the web of life. Written in the early 2000s as it is, perhaps some of the facts and hypotheses described have been validated or disproven, but ultimately, Parasite Rex still remains a comprehensive and engaging starter guide on how we should think about parasites.I give this: 4 out of 5 guinea worms"
295,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60074558-xander,3,"This book is superbly written: easy to follow, emphasizing the biology behind parasites withot getting too technical and mixing in some pieces of journalism (interviews with experts) with a scientific story. But enough about the book and its style: the content of the book is what it's all about. Zimmer describes how parasites make up most of the existing (and possibly extinct) forms of life on earth. But not only that, parasites are also an indication of the health of entire ecosystems: in natural habitats where parasites thrive in hosts, the ecology is a healthy balance, with the parasites keeping a check on the number of hosts, which in turn leads to a natural check on things like overgrazing and exhaustion of resources. Zimmer details this 'main' story with lots of examples of parasites. After reading this, a reader will be more aware of the importance of parasites for life itself, the impact of parasites on evolution (arms races, immune systems, etc.) and the complex life cycles of parasites - some species take different forms, living in different hosts, before reproducing and dying off (e.g. there are species of lancet flukes that take over the neural systems of ants, driving the ants up grass leaves, waiting to be eating by cattle, after which the fluke lays its eggs inside the intestines of a cow; the eggs get transported through the digestive canal and entire the nature through cow dung, after which the eggs hatch and find new ants to control and start a new life cycle - simply amazing!).The only moment of nuisance came at the last two pages (bummer...), where Zimmer compares the human race to a parasite, living of the totality of ecosystems on earth. The only difference between us and 'normal' parasites, according to Zimmer, is that we are an amateurish species of parasite: not keeping track of the condition of our host ('Gaia') and thereby exterminating ourselves. Apart from the issues about the ambiguous predictions of climate change and loss of biodiversity (especially their impact on humanity), the comparison is in another way misleading. There's only one earth; there's no species of Gaia's. This might sound like an argument some obscure armchair philosopher would concoct, but really it is a crucial one. By comparing humanity to parasites, Zimmer might give the impression that humanity can adapt to changes in the immune system of its host (earth), but the changes in earthly ecosystems (amongst other things) happen much faster than mankind's ability to procreate and thereby adapt. Not to mention the immense suffering of the people that are naturally 'weeded' out in this transitions Something we should not forget when trying to live within the natural boundaries of our little planet. (I guess in general it's a safe rule of thumb not to compare people with parasites at all).But I shouldn't end this review on such a boring note; I really enjoyed this book and apart from the last 2 pages I was (positively) amazed by the lively content - something I didn't expect before opening the book. An this is for a large part due to Zimmer's way of writing and his choices of the material. Well done Zimmer! (I guess it's only fair that Zimmer got a parasite named after himself, as he writes in the new epilogue: the Acanthobotrium zimmeri, a tapeworm living inside a newly discovered whip ray)."
296,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2915426-tippy-jackson,5,"Wow. Just wow. To begin, the first chapter is about defining a parasite and bemoaning the lack of parasite research and scientists. I found it boring and inconclusive. I kept pushing because I figured like most scientific writing once they get the definitions out of the way the good stuff comes. Seriously, that is exactly what happened. Don't give up on this book! It gets better and better as it goes. This book is well organized and split into clear section. In one of my favorites, it describes some of the absolutely astonishing ways parasites avoid being expelled from animals (including sometimes humans)by immune systems. The trickery! A body is a seriously hostile environment and the way these parasites will use their hosts own systems against them or keeps changing their skin so the host immune system doesn't recognize it. It's positively brilliant! They can hijack our own mechanisms to hide from us. It's crazy.There is another section on chemical mind control. I would have thought it would be my favorite, but all of the examples were ones I've already known. Still, parasites altering host behavior or turning hosts into zombies will never not be interesting. Then the author goes into details of parasite evolution, followed by how parasites shape the evolution of their hosts. Some of the experiments he mentions are very convincing and some of the ideas he shares are still in speculation and hypothesis phases, but all are really fascinating. Among my favorites are the development of allergies and human intestinal diseases that may have arisen from the current lack of parasites that our body has adapted to and the evolution of sex as a means of reproduction. He also briefly writes about how chimps may be self-medicating against parasites and he describes a few of the behavioral adaptations that have developed to avoid parasites (i.e. caterpillar poop canons. Lastly, he beautifully writes about the parasites' role in the world and their ecosystems as well as the importance of parasites to the balance of nature. Although always intrigued by them, I've never thought about how important they really are. They are! I swear! We need parasites! And I have never come across an argument for the parasites' place on this planet that is so convincing. He also provides decent reasoning for using parasites as indicator species. And gives the best description of the red queen hypothesis I have ever heard or read.A couple of the specifics I found interesting:page 181:""When a plant is attacked by a parasite, it defends itself with its own version of an immune system by creating poisonous chemicals that the parasite eats as it chews on the plant. But it also fights by sending out cries for help. When a caterpillar bites a leaf, the plant can sense it-a feeling not carried by nerves but felt nevertheless. And in response, the plant makes a particular kind of molecule that wafts into the air. The odor is like perfume for parasitic wasps; as they fly around searching for a host they are powerfully lured by the plant's smell. They follow it to the wounded leaf and find the caterpillar there, and they inject it with eggs. These conversations between plants and wasps are not only timely but precise. Somehow the plant can sense exactly which species of caterpillar is dining on it and spray the appropriate molecule into the air. A parasitic wasp will respond only if the plant lets it know that its own species of host sits on a leaf."" I've also heard of a spider that uses a chemical lure to attract moths and can determine what moths are in the area and choose the correspondingly appropriate chemical. But a plant??? Amazing.page 188-189:""Another way parasites might be able to create a new species is by mucking up the sex lives of their hosts. A bacterium called Wolbachia lives in 15 percent of all insects on Earth as well as many other invertebrates. It lives within its host's cells, and the only way it can infect a new host is by colonizing a female's eggs. When the egg that Wolbachia lives inside becomes fertilized and grows into an adult, it grows up with a case of Wolbachia infection. There's a downside to this way of life: if Wolbachia should grow up in a male it faces a dead end, because there are no eggs for it to infect. As a result, Wolbachia has taken control of its hosts' sex lives. In many of its host species, it tampers with the sperm of infected males so that they can successfully mate only with Wolbachia-carrying females. If on of these infected males should try to mate with a healthy female, all of their offspring will die. Wolbachia uses a different strategy in some species of wasps: normally these insects are born as males and females, which reproduce sexually, but when Wolbachia infects them, the wasps become female-only, able to mother only more females. By turning its hosts all female, the bacteria gives itself that many more hosts. In both these cases, Wolbachia genetically isolates the infected hosts from the uninfected ones. A newly born host will be the offspring of either Wolbachia-carrying parents or two healthy ones. It won't be a healthy-unhealthy hybrid. by setting up this reproductive wall, the parasite may be able to set the stage for a new species to form. Wolbachia is only the best-known parasite out of many to tamper with their hosts' sex lives, so this may turn out to be a common way new species form."" page 238:""Most medicines trace their genealogy to some natural compound in some organism, be it penicillin from a fungus or digitalis from foxglove. Only in the past few years have scientists begun to work their way through the parasite's pharmocopeia. Cordyceps, a fungus that invades insects and sprouts flowerlike stalks out of its body, is the source of cyclosporin, an important antibiotic. hookworms produce molecules that clasp perfectly with clotting factors in human blood, and biotechnology companies are putting them through trials as blood thinners for surgery. Ticks can also tamper with out blood to make their drinking easier, using chemicals that not only solve clots but reduce inflammation and kill bacteria that try to enter a wound. There are other parasitic tricks that still await an explanation. Blood flukes can steal substances out of our own blood to camouflage themselves from the immune system, but no one has figured out how they do it. If scientists did, they might be able to apply their discover to transplanted organs. A doctor might be able to pump a patient's blood through a donor lung and essentially turn it into a gigantic protected fluke. That could spare patients from the dangers of immune-suppressing drugs. And these are only a few parasites; who knows what sorts of chemicals the millions of other have evolved?""Overall, I would say that having at least some science background, particularly that of the immune system and evolution, will significantly increase your reading pleasure of this book. I feel like he tries to explain complicated biology and only partially succeeds, so if you already know what he's getting at then this will be more interesting. If that description fits you, I would highly recommend this book. It is awesome.BTW, for some shameless self-promotion, if you like reading about animals, check out my blog on wildlife at http://backyardzoologist.wordpress.com/"
297,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1879990-adam,5,"I love parasites so much I'm trying to write a fantasy novel about them. They're the most fascinating thing in nature in so many ways. I also loved Carl Zimmer's book She Has Her Mother's Laugh. I was guaranteed to love this and I did. I was obviously up to speed on a lot of the broad-strokes material here, but it never felt like it was wasting my time. A particular peril in books about gross or otherwise taboo subjects is that the author spends so much time talking about the attitudes they assume the audience brings in with them that they barely say anything meaningful about the subject. All the books about rats I've read have that issue. But Zimmer is genuinely curious and knows how to share the curiosity and insight of scientists past and present, and he wastes no time doing anything else. There are tons of wonderful new stories and ideas here, from the Kuchenmeister experiments to the simple semiotics of fluke navigation within the body to the obvious and elegant but somehow novel-to-me idea that humans are a parasite within the global ecosystem and find things to learn from other parasites in balancing that pursuit. The only disappointment really is that this feels massively too short. There's a part in the epilogue, written for the second edition, where Zimmer tells this story about how he learned about jewel wasps acting as parasitoids of cockroaches. And he even says, just as I as thinking the same thing, ""how did I write a whole book about parasites and never learn about this?"" Especially odd considering he does quote Darwin on Ichneumon wasps, and there's a whole section on biocontrol wasps. There are huge realms of parasitology that never come up. I had expected this to be twice as long as it is and cover twice as much and I guess that might not be a fair thing to dock a star (so I guess I won't) for but it just feels really short? Kleptoparasitism doesn't come, or inquilines, or strepsiptera. I would have loved to get Zimmer's more skeptical take on the parasite theory of politics, too. "
298,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19861338-erin-pallott,5,"If you read this, you might come away thinking that parasites are the most important organisms on the planet. I was already a big fan of them, but this book just solidified that. Carl Zimmer is a very popular science writer, and this book is a good example why. Here he gives a great introduction to parasitism and the field of parasitology through everyone's favourite method: the grizzly and gruesome details.This book provides great explanations of how the most deadly parasitic diseases have been so successful, as well as giving examples of lesser known examples that you might see in that one nature documentary (or your nightmares).Zimmer does a great job explaining the concepts of parasitism and showing their place in the bigger picture by expanding into the fields of evolution, medicine and history.Some of the more negative reviews have expressed that parts of this book are hard to read and aren't very accessibly to people who aren't in scientific fields. I would have to disagree and I think this book was written with a wide audience in mind. It is written very clearly (with a handy, long glossary at the back) and provides a lot of great analogies to explain scientific concepts in a way most people should understand. To make this book easier, it would either have to be much longer with lessons in basic biology between each chapter, or have some sections cut out entirely. As this is a scientific book, it shouldn't be a surprise if you do come across words that you have to Google or find some parts confusing. That is just part of science and if you knew it already, you wouldn't need to read the book. I could recommend this book to many people, whether they're someone who already knows some parasitology and wants to gain more knowledge on the subject, or someone that just wants to learn a bunch of cool gross facts to share with their friends and family at the dinner table."
299,074320011X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89613608-islomjon,4,"What are the true drivers of evolution? There are multiple answers for this held from various scientists. They consider that drivers are viruses, bacteria, humans, parasites, etc. Each one of them may give us competent arguments for it and they might be true. Yet parasites seem to hurt their hosts most: they give nothing and leave devastating outcomes from their presence, and the same time they lead us to evolve.Carl Zimmer in his book argues that parasites (no matter single celled or multi-cellular organisms) must be why there is an evolution. Furthermore, he masterfully described the micro world that we encounter every day, parasites that kill people, animals and plants. It was wonderful to note how parasites are masters in their metabolism, reproduction and maturing. They seemed more interesting than viruses. Yet they are living organisms and have a little automated orders to survive whatever it takes.However, there are parts that Zimmer had not discussed. For example, the clue of symbiosis that may play a crucial role in host and parasite connection, and perhaps parasites' unique genetics."
