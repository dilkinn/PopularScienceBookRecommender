0,0871404133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3948872-laura,4,"When I was a teenager, I read Gilgamesh. One of my parents had a battered paperback copy from college. It was revelatory. From my mother, I had absorbed the notion that Death was the great Evil: Satan, the Lord of the Flies, Hitler, Doctor Strangelove, Darth Vader. Gilgamesh opened my eyes to the fact that it was her fear of death that made her assign it the role of The Evil One. It made me grok that death isn’t The Adversary. Death is an agent of change, of evolution, of growth, of ethical opportunities. Later, from Terry Pratchett, I learned he rides a pale horse named Binky. And he is good. 	Death over the millennia made us human. Death, Wilson suggests, works as an evolutionary agent on the group level as well as the individual, at least for the social animals. Evolution, he suggests, is multilevel. If we want to understand ourselves, posits Wilson, we need to know where we come from. And it’s not just, he says, just from selfish genes competing, though that is a part of it. An important part, worth honoring. “For the entire course of evolution leading from our primitive mammalian forebears of a hundred million years ago to the single lineage that threaded its way to become the first Homo sapiens, the total number of individuals it required might have been one hundred billion. Unknowingly, they all lived and died for us.” (21-22). I raise my (metaphorical) beer to you, one hundred billion individuals who died for me. 	This book is an attempt to explain how evolution works in social animals, like humans, ants, wasps, bees and termites. It gives humanity’s divided nature, selfless and selfish, primacy of place, and says we are the product of both. It repudiates both the selfish gene and kin selection theory based on math. More on that later. Parts of this book are awesome. For example, from the first chapter: 	 “The creation stories gave the members of each tribe an explanation for their existence. It made them feel loved and protected above all other tribes. . . . and offered meaning to the cycles of life and death. No tribe could long survive without the meaning of its existence defined by a creation story. The option was to weaken, dissolve, and die. In the early history of each tribe, the myth therefore had to be set in stone. 	“The creation myth is a Darwinian device for survival. Tribal conflict, where believers on the inside were pitted against infidels on the outside, was a principal driving force that shaped biological human nature. The truth of each myth lived in the heart, not the rational mind. By itself, mythmaking could never discover the origin and meaning of humanity. But the reverse order is possible. The discovery of the origin and meaning of humanity might explain the origin and meaning of myths, hence, the core of organized religion.	“Can these two worldviews ever be reconciled? The answer, to put the matter honestly and simply, is no. They cannot be reconciled. Their opposition defines the difference between science and religion, between trust in empiricism and belief in the supernatural.	“If the great riddle of the human condition cannot be solved by recourse to the mythic foundations of religion, neither will it be solved by introspection . . . Most of the activities of the brain are not even perceived by the conscious mind. The brain is a citadel, as Darwin once put it, that cannot be taken by direct assault. 	“Thinking about thinking is the core process of the creative arts, but it tells us very little about how we think the way we do, and nothing of why the creative arts originated in the first place. Consciousness *9, having evolved over millions of years of life-and-death struggle, and moreover because of that struggle, was not designated for self-examination. It was designed for survival and reproduction. Conscious thought is driven by emotion: to the purpose of survival and reproduction, it is ultimately and wholly committed. The intricate distortions of the mind may be transmitted by the creative arts in fine detail, but they are constructed as though human nature never had an evolutionary history.” (8-9).	I love that. Just weeks ago, I had a fascinating conversation with a dear friend about the uses of philosophy in a world where any philosophy that starts producing testable hypotheses gets calved off into its own science or, at least, specialty. Wilson goes beyond Bertrand Russell (if I remember aright) and starts asking the big questions of life in terms of evolutionary biology. Hark: 	“[W]e look in vain to philosophy for the answer to the great riddle. Despite its noble purpose and history, pure philosophy long ago abandoned the foundational questions about human existence. The question itself is a reputation killer. It has become a Gorgon for philosophers, upon whose visage even the best thinkers fear to gaze. They have good reason for their aversion. Most of the history of philosophy consists of failed models of the mind. The field of discourse is strewn with the wreckage of theories of consciousness. After the decline of logical positivism in the middle of the twentieth century, and the attempt of this movement to blend science and logic into a closed system, professional philosophers dispersed in an intellectual diaspora. They emigrated into the more tractable disciplines not yet colonized by science – intellectual history, semantics, *10 logic, foundational mathematics, ethics, theology, and, most lucratively, problems of personal life adjustment. 	“Philosophers flourish in these various endeavors, but for the time being, at least, and by a process of elimination, the solution of the riddle has been left to science. What science promises, and has already supplied in part, is the following. There is a real creation story of humanity, and one only, and it is not a myth. It is being worked out and tested, and enriched and strengthened, step by step.” “Are people innately good, but corruptible by the forces of evil? Or, are they instead innately wicked, and redeemable only by the forces of good? People are both. And so it will be forever unless we change our genes, because the human dilemma was foreordained in the way our species evolved, and therefore an unchangeable part of human nature. In a constantly changing world, we need the flexibility that only imperfection provides.	“The dilemma of good and evil was created by multilevel selection, in which individual selection and group selection act together on the same individual but largely in opposition to each other. Individual selection is the result of competition for survival and reproduction among members of the same group. It shapes instincts in each member that are fundamentally selfish with reference to other members. In contrast, group selection consists of competition between societies, through both direct conflict and differential competence in exploiting the environment. Group selection shapes instincts that tend to make individuals altruistic toward one another (but not toward members of other groups). Individual selection is responsible for much of what we call sin, while group selection is responsible for the greater part of virtue. Together they have created the conflict between the poorer and the better angels of our nature.” 	“Are people innately good, but corruptible by the forces of evil? Or, are they instead innately wicked, and redeemable only by the forces of good? People are both. And so it will be forever unless we change our genes, because the human dilemma was foreordained in the way our species evolved, and therefore an unchangeable part of human nature. In a constantly changing world, we need the flexibility that only imperfection provides."" (241) Better than philosophy. 	The difficulty with this book is that it is a very beautiful attempt to communicate a hypothesis in a scientific paper that has a whole lot of math in it. This paper, written by Wilson and two mathematicians, attempted to show that the math of the selfish gene and kinship selection to explain human evolution does not work; that there is a better hypothesis that fits the facts and makes useful predictions: inclusive fitness. He published this paper and many evolutionary biologists, including Richard Dawkins (who I adore) had kittens. Probably metaphorically. Hopefully metaphorically. Dawkins wrote at least one brutal review: http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/mag.... 	Wilson’s response is attached to the end of the review, and it’s fascinating. He throws down the gauntlet and says – show me the problem with my math, young man who has not published any scientific work for decades. Show me the problem. 	I don’t know if Dawkins did. I am dimly aware of how to get hold of the paper, but I am acutely aware that I would not understand it, would not be able to critique it. On the one hand, AWESOME, I just got a briefing on an important, evolving (snicker) question of science. On the other hand, judging it is beyond my lawyerly skills. We’re strongly encouraged to hire other people to do our math for us, after all, and I’m a math wiz in my world because I can usually figure out the appropriate tip in my head. 	So. I loved reading the book. Glad I did. It gave me a wonderful feeling of being a part of something, like I was back in law school jousting with libertarians. I so would have quoted this passage had I had it: 	“Our species is not Homo oeconomicus. At the end of the day, it emerges as something more complicated and interesting. We are Homo sapiens, imperfect beings, soldering on with conflicted impulses through an unpredictable, implacably threatening world, doing our best with what we have.	“And beyond the ordinary instincts of altruism, there is something more, delicate and ephemeral in character but, when experienced, transformative. It is honor, a feeling born of innate empathy and cooperativeness. It is the final reserve of altruism that may yet save our race.” (251). 	I’m looking at you, Jeff Barr, who announced grandly in Sid Delong’s jurisprudence class one day (April 21, 1999), “we are all homo economists, whether we like to admit it or not.” I didn’t think he was right, and so I said. I do not think the libertarian notion of what it means to be human was right. I still don’t, and this book makes me feel good, because it tells me that E. O. Wilson doesn’t believe it is right either. And because E. O. Wilson, Alabama boy raised in the Baptist church believes, as I do, that “A society that condemns homosexuality harms itself.” (254). 	This book is beautiful. Just wish I understood Wilson’s actual thesis, and the evidence for it, better. But I don’t understand the Higgs-Boson either. "
1,0871404133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,4,"I am a fan of E.O. Wilson's writings, but this book is not quite as good as some of his others. I learned a few interesting things, but not as much as would be expected from a book of this type.The central concept in the book is ""eusociality"", which is the cooperative care of offspring and the cooperative division of labor. Among the animal kingdom, there are only several species of ants, bees, and termites that are truly eusocial. And, there are humans. Quite a chunk of the book goes into the behavior patterns of the eusocial insects. This is understandable, as Wilson is a recognized expert in these types of insects. The central question in the book, is how did eusocial behavior evolve in insects, as well as in humans.Wilson describes the theory that was prevalent until about ten years ago, called ""kin selection"", also known as the ""inclusive fitness theory"". Hamilton developed this theory in 1963. The theory says that social behavior evolved not only as a direct linkage between an individual's genes and fitness for reproduction, but also through an indirect linkage between an individual and relatives that share some fraction of his/her genes. Thus, the theory attempts to explain altruistic behavior, especially between close relatives.But, Wilson disagrees with this theory, as he describes reasons for its failing. In the past ten years, evidence has grown that the mathematics developed by Hamilton to support his theory may be faulty. Wilson replaces the theory with what he calls standard genetics applied to multiple levels of natural selection. By multiple levels, he means that there is a competition between selection for individual survival within a group, and cooperation between individuals to advance group survival. This is the basis of so many moral dilemmas that face people. It is the source, for example, of the competition between heroism and cowardice.Wilson also tackles the evolution of language. I thought it was fascinating, how languages with few words for colors, distribute their meager selection of words. For example, all languages with just two color words, have ""black"" and ""white"". All languages with three words also include ""red"". Those with four words add either ""yellow"" or ""green"". Those with five words have ""yellow"" and ""green"". Those with six words add ""blue"", and those with seven words add ""brown"". Note that other color words, like purple, orange, and pink, are not used in these languages.And, in regard to language evolution of course, Wilson had to mention the writings of Steven Pinker, which are very readable, and those of Chomsky, which are not. Wilson writes, For a long time, Chomsky succeeded because, if for no other reason, he seldom suffered the indignity of being understood.Wilson also made an interesting observation about the quality of life in various countries. The wealthiest countries with the highest average quality of life are those with the narrowest differential between the wealthiest and poorest citizens. These include Japan and the Nordic countries, and the U.S. state of New Hampshire. The countries with the lowest quality of life have the biggest differential in wealth, and include the United Kingdom, Portugal, and the remainder of the United States.Although it is well-written, this book is not easy reading. I had to re-read many sections to really understand the main points. A second reading might clarify some of my remaining confusions. There isn't much technical jargon, but it is written by a scientist, seemingly for other scientists. "
2,0871404133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1651956-riku-sayuj,3,"On Human Nature Redux. More ants and bees this time. Better constructed but not as readable and thought-provoking as the earlier book. The stages of eusociality evolution are better explained here. Readers would do well to read On Human Nature first and complement that reading with Part III of this book, which discusses these stages in detail.The Invention of EusocialityE. O. Wilson postulates that the invention/Evolution of Eusociality in any species will consist, broadly, of a series of stages: 1. The formation of groups or social arrangements. In the earliest stages of eusocial evolution, in species with already existing predispositions, this leads to superficial dominance hierarchies and crude division of labor.  2. The occurrence of a valuable and defensible nest, which aids survival and hence provides and incentive to increase and improve the crude social cohesion. The nest (early campsites in the case of humans) is the single most important step for Wilson. This is where the future course of the eusocial organism is fixed. The nest guides further evolution and is itself guided by existing predispositions. Much of the book focuses on how human condition changed forever around the earliest campsites. 3. The appearance of mutations that prescribe the persistence of the group, most likely by the knockout of dispersal behavior. Evidently, a durable nest remains the key element in maintaining the prevalence. Primitive eusociality may emerge immediately due to spring-loaded preadaptations—those evolved in earlier stages that by chance cause groups to behave in a eusocial manner. 4. Emergent traits caused by either the genesis of specialized workers or the interaction and division of labour, altruistic behavior, etc, of group members are shaped through group-level selection by environmental forces. Group selection ensures that group-fitness determines survival and not only individual fitness. 5. Group-level selection drives changes in the colony/group life cycle, social structures and social technologies (such as communication, recognition, etc.) often to bizarre extremes, producing elaborate superorganisms, and civilizations!

3,0871404133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1108123-bettie,3,"Narrator: Jonathan HoganDescription: Where did we come from? What are we? Where are we going? In a generational work of clarity and passion, one of our greatest living scientists directly addresses these three fundamental questions of religion, philosophy, and science while “overturning the famous theory that evolution naturally encourages creatures to put family first” (Discover magazine). Refashioning the story of human evolution in a work that is certain to generate headlines, Wilson draws on his remarkable knowledge of biology and social behavior to show that group selection, not kin selection, is the primary driving force of human evolution. He proves that history makes no sense without prehistory, and prehistory makes no sense without biology. Demonstrating that the sources of morality, religion, and the creative arts are fundamentally biological in nature, Wilson presents us with the clearest explanation ever produced as to the origin of the human condition and why it resulted in our domination of the Earth’s biosphere.  This book opens out with a potted biography of Gauguin with a view to his privitism.3* The Social Conquest of Earth4* Conscilience"
4,0871404133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12174361-krishna,3,"A bit underwhelmed, considering the quality of Wilson's other books. The main thesis is that human evolution proceeded through a combination of individual selection and group selection - the former in the classical mode of evolution, and the latter through competition between groups based on the degree to which they encourage altruism, cooperation and unity for the social good. Parts of the book are an extended polemic against the prevailing orthodoxy of kin selection or inclusive fitness, which theory argues that individuals sacrifice themselves (reducing their own reproductive fitness) because it increases the chances of their kin's survival and procreation, and therefore their own chances of passing down their genes indirectly. It is not however clear (to me at least) why that theory is flawed, though Wilson says there are complicated reasons (which we the lay readers will not understand) why the theory has been found to no longer work. The best part of the book is -- and Wilson is most authoritative -- when he talks about his own specialty of myrmecology (the study of ants). The evolution of eusociality, defined as the tendency of species to form multigenerational societies of cooperative individuals who divide labor and defend a common nesting site, is at the root of the social insects' conquest of the earth. In a remarkable twist, Wilson argues that social insects cooperate not because they are related, but they are related because they cooperate. The order of evolution is this: normal individuals of a non-social species begin to nest together for defense against parasites or predators; division of labor emerges; if the gene causing offspring to disperse gets mutated (turned off) through random chance, the nesting site becomes multi-generational; group selection takes over as neighboring groups begin to compete for resources; those groups with the genes that promote cooperation and altruism succeed, making eusociality the norm in the species. In extreme cases, individuals surrender their reproductive rights so totally to the group that only one breeding individual (the queen) procreates with everyone else becoming a genetic clone of the queen. The fact that many separate preadaptations have to evolve in order is why we have so few eusocial species -- Wilson says, if I recall correctly, that there are 20-odd, among the millions of animal species.That does not happen in humans because we, unlike the social insects, have balanced individual and group selection. This explains humans' tendencies to support both cooperative (group oriented) characteristics such as self-sacrifice, obedience, discipline, humility etc., as well as the characteristics that contribute to individual fitness (competitiveness, cheating, etc)."
5,0871404133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8660033-aaron-thibeault,5,"*A full executive-style summary of this book is available at newbooksinbrief.wordpress.comSince the dawn of self-awareness we human beings have struggled to understand ourselves. This struggle has found form in religion, philosophy, art and, most recently, science. The most pivotal turning point in science's quest to understand humanity came with Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection in the mid 19th century. While the application of this theory to understand human behaviour has taken time (and engendered a great deal of controversy), enough progress has now been made to outline the story in full, and to fill in several of the details. It is just this task that legendary biologist E.O. Wilson takes up in his new book `The Social Conquest of Earth'.For Wilson, understanding humanity must begin with an understanding of how we came to be the ultrasocial species that we are. Drawing upon evidence from other eusocial species (such as bees, wasps, termites and ants--the latter of which Wilson has spent much of his career studying), as well as numerous sciences focused in on humanity and its past, Wilson recreates this story. According to the author, the story reaches its first major turning point when our ancestors began establishing home-bases at which they raised their young, and near which they foraged and scavenged for food. This development itself was largely a result of a genetic modification that led our ancestors to rely more and more on meat in their diet (and was greatly spurred on by, if not entirely dependent upon, the ability to control fire, which fire was used to establish more lasting campsites).Once human beings had established nests, environmental pressures began selecting for traits that increasingly drew group members into cooperative relationships with one another (which cooperation was beneficial in such enterprises as hunting expeditions). This added cooperation not only contributed to the extent to which these early humans could reap resources from the environment, but also helped them in competition with other groups--especially in warfare. The benefits of cooperation and cohesion in allowing groups to out-compete other groups eventually allowed group-level selection to add a layer of tribalist sentiment to the members of our species (which tribalist sentiment draws from us a deep attachment to our in-groups, and a corresponding mistrust and contempt for members of out-groups). This tribalist sentiment eventually set the stage for the development of the first religions. The cooperative and tribalist sentiments that evolved during this time ultimately explains why our psyches are torn between selflessness and selfishness, virtue and vice. (On the topic of group-level selection, it turns out that this theory has been out of favour in the scientific community for over 40 years, and a big part of Wilson's purpose here is to resurrect the theory, and reestablish its credibility.)Backing up in our story just a bit, for our in-group cooperation to occur, added mental equipment was needed (and evolved) that allowed humans to understand each others' intentions and work together to achieve goals. This added mental ability drew upon earlier increases in brain capacity that our ancestors had used first for life in the trees, and later for life on the ground, to fashion rudimentary tools. Eventually, the added mental capacity evolved into the ability to understand abstraction, and to use arbitrary symbols for communication, thus leading to the evolution of language.Once the capacity for abstraction and language were established, the capacity for culture exploded and our ancestors were set on the fast track that led to our current way of life. Specifically, the onset of language led to the development of religion, art and music, and all of the other trappings of culture that we know and enjoy today. Wilson takes us through each of them one by one, and the process of gene-culture co-evolution that acted upon them, in order to help us understand how this process unfolded. Later, the explosion of culture led to technology that eventually gave rise to agriculture, and then to the rise of chiefdoms, and finally states and the first true civilizations.Wilson's work is well geared to a general audience and he very rarely goes outside of what might reasonably be expected from such an audience. On the rare occasions when he does, he is sure to follow this up with a simplified summary of his line of thought. Also, Wilson occasionally strays outside of his story to moralize and (at the end) prognosticate on the future, and at times these efforts seem awkward and out of place. Again, though, these forays are few and far between, and many will no doubt enjoy them. A full and comprehensive summary of the main argument of the book is available on the website newbooksinbrief.wordpress.com; the information in the article will also be available in a condensed version as a podcast soon.

6,0871404133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5925863-bastian-greshake-tzovaras,2,"While he wants to answer questions like «Where did we come from? What are we? Where are we going?» he sidesteps this goal often and uses the book to heavily promote his newly found belief that eusociality does evolve through group/multilevel selection instead of kin selection/inclusive fitness. The Nature publication of Nowak et al. was heavily criticized when it was published (you can find some of the replies to the original paper above the linked study). He uses his beloved ants to argue for his view of group selection by pointing out that ant colonies maybe shouldn't even be viewed as superorganisms of multiple individuals but that all the worker- and soldier-ants are merely an extended phenotype of their queen, robots without much of an own interest (how ironic, given that he also argues against robots & AI in the book). Reviewers have pointed out that this description of the non-queen ants probably isn't true and that Wilson cherry-picked his citations to make it fit his view (e.g. it is known that worker/soldier ants can start a rebellion against their queen). But even if we consider the extended phenotype-hypothesis it becomes clear that this view eliminates the problem of eusocial behavior all together: If there is no social superorganism we neither need inclusive fitness nor group selection to explain the allegedly altruistic behavior because there is no eusociality at all. So I don't feel convinced that his ""alternative"" is much of an improvement. Given his cherry-picking of facts I'm also not sure how well good his descriptions of early humans really are. Often it feels like those just-so stories which can often be found in Evolutionary Psychology, but maybe an anthropologist could help me out on this… Oh, and did I mention that Wilson doesn't also opposes robots, but also manned space travel? So: If you want to learn more about ants I'd recommend to read Wilson's/Hölldobler's The Leafcutter Ants: Civilization by Instinct. And if you're more interested in the evolution of human nature you might read The Red Queen: Sex and the Evolution of Human Nature, which feels much better researched."
7,0871404133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/182022-brian,5,"Wonderful book. No matter which evolutionary process you agree with, kin selection versus group selection, Wilson's ideas of competing ethical drives within man are terrifically insightful in a way that Plato, Aristotle, and everyone down their line have yet to explain as clearly.If you just read the first and last chapter of this book, you'll gain a valuable new perspective on what it means to be human.The following are some passages from E.O. Wilson's ""The Social Conquest of Earth"" that will give a general impression of the book:""The necessity for fine-graded evaluation by alliance members meant that the prehuman ancestors had to achieve eusociality in a radically different way from the instinct-driven insects. The pathway to eusociality was charted by a contest between selection based on the relative success of individuals within groups versus relative success among groups. The strategies of this game were written as a complicated mix of closely calibrated altruism, cooperation, competition, domination, reciprocity, defection, and deceit....Thus was born the human condition, selfish at one time, selfless at another, the two impulses often conflicted.""""Tribalism Is a Fundamental Human Trait""""The social world of each modern human is not a single tribe, but rather a system of interlocking tribes, among which it is often difficult to find a single compass. People savor the company of like-minded friends, and they yearn to be in one of the best—a combat marine regiment, perhaps, an elite college, the executive committee of a company, a religious sect, a fraternity, a garden club—any collectivity that can be compared favorably with other, competing groups of the same category.""""The expected consequences of this evolutionary process in humans are the following: • Intense competition occurs between groups, in many circumstances including territorial aggression. • Group composition is unstable, because of the advantage of increasing group size accruing from immigration, ideological proselytization, and conquest, pitted against the opportunities to gain advantage by usurpation within the group and fission to create new groups. • An unavoidable and perpetual war exists between honor, virtue, and duty, the products of group selection, on one side, and selfishness, cowardice, and hypocrisy, the products of individual selection, on the other side. • The perfecting of quick and expert reading of intention in others has been paramount in the evolution of human social behavior. • Much of culture, including especially the content of the creative arts, has arisen from the inevitable clash of individual selection and group selection. In summary, the human condition is an endemic turmoil rooted in the evolution processes that created us. The worst in our nature coexists with the best, and so it will ever be. To scrub it out, if such were possible, would make us less than human.""""There is no grail more elusive or precious in the life of the mind than the key to understanding the human condition"" ""We have created a Star Wars civilization, with Stone Age emotions, medieval institutions, and godlike technology""""No tribe could long survive without the meaning of its existence defined by a creation story. The option was to weaken, dissolve, and die. In the early history of each tribe, the myth therefore had to be set in stone. The creation myth is a Darwinian device for survival. Tribal conflict, where believers on the inside were pitted against infidels on the outside, was a principal driving force that shaped biological human nature.""""Consciousness, having evolved over millions of years of life-and-death struggle, and moreover because of that struggle, was not designed for self-examination. It was designed for survival and reproduction.""""Moreover, we look in vain to philosophy for the answer to the great riddle. Despite its noble purpose and history, pure philosophy long ago abandoned the foundational questions about human existence. The query itself is a reputation killer. It has become a Gorgon for philosophers, upon whose visage even the best thinkers fear to gaze. They have good reason for their aversion.

8,0871404133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19126984-jane,5,"This is one of the most important books I've read in a long time. It lays out the fundamentals of humanity's biological and social evolution on this planet. Wilson states that humans are ""by any conceivable standard...life's greatest achievement...are the mind of the biosphere, the solar system, and--who can say?--perhaps the galaxy."" But we are creatures who have at once ""...created a Star Wars civilization, with Stone Age emotions, medieval institutions, and god-like technology. We thrash about. We are terribly confused by the mere fact of our existence, and a danger to ourselves and to the rest of life.""In the beginning of the book, Wilson discusses eusociality, a stage of social evolution in which ""group members are made up of multiple generations and are prone to perform altruistic acts as part of their division of labor."" Humans are among the relatively few species on the planet ever to have evolved to a level of eusociality. (So are ants and bees, which are not given short shrift in the book.)The main argument Wilson proposes is that eusociality has evolved by ""group selection"" and NOT by ""inclusive fitness"" (kin selection). Inclusive fitness was the accepted wisdom from around the 60s to the 90s. It says that, ""kinship plays a central role in the origin of social behavior. In essence, it says that the more closely related individuals in a group are, the more likely they are to be altruistic and cooperative, hence the more likely are the species that formed such groups to evolve into eusociality."" Inclusive fitness has ""powerful intuitive appeal"" but does not hold up to scientific scrutiny and mathematical evaluation, he argues.Group selection, on the other hand, proposes that it is hereditary altruists forming ""groups so cooperative and well-organized as to outcompete nonaltruist groups.""In the end, Wilson argues that human eusociality is a product of multilevel natural selection. ""At the higher level of the two relevant levels of biological organization, groups compete with groups, favoring cooperative social traits among members of the same group. A the lower level, members of the same group compete with one another in a manner that leads to self-serving behavior. The opposition between the two levels of natural selection has resulted in a chimeric genotype in each person. It renders each of us part saint and part sinner."" (p. 289)The other important concept that is covered is that of ""gene-culture coevolution,"" which deals with the causal relation between the evolution of genes and the evolution of culture--briefly, that ""many properties of human social behavior are affected by heredity... and that the innate properties of human nature must have evolved as adaptations.""I've used mostly quotes from the book in writing this review because I didn't want to get it wrong. A couple of the chapters were difficult reading for me, so I read and re-read and looked stuff up on the Web to get a better understanding. It was definitely worth the effort.This book should be one of the basic starting points for everyone who is interested in how humanity might understand itself better in order to leave aside some of the beliefs that are causing us to do so much damage."
9,0871404133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2613351-linda-robinson,4,"Evolution confuses me. A woman wondered aloud last weekend if we really descended from chimpanzees, why are there still chimpanzees? And another person thought a better question is why aren't we still evolving into another genus? We could ask the Denisova Hominidae, but they left the planet 30,000 years ago. I saw Dr. Wilson speak at MSU a couple years ago. He's engaging and smart as any five people I know, and he writes, not quite down to my level, but enough that I can glean a little of the genius work he's accomplished. He loves ants. He likes all eusocial groups which include bees and wasps, and one particular gang of shrimp. He'd like to make a case for humans being a eusocial group, too, but when was the last time a despot ant queen made a decision to make you a drone or a breeding sister queen? When was the last time you sacrificed a long-held personal goal in favor of the group's success? Altruistic reciprocity is in our future perhaps. All I can think of is Spock in Star Trek changing his mind that the good of the many outweighs the good of the one. Humans have a few genes that select in the direction of group behavior; and a fistful that lean toward independence. That's why we're not likely to sort it out before we consume our nest completely. Wilson changed his mind in the face of newer research. He and Spock have my utmost respect."
10,0871404133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,3,"I have a lot of respect for Wilson, but I felt this book spent unduly too much time on group selection, which happens to be Wilson’s new conviction in evolutionary theory. Group selection was in vogue for some time, then was replaced by kin selection compatible with the selfish gene theory, but now it’s back. Wilson starts the book with Paul Gaugin’s painting titled: Where did we come from? What are we? Where are we going? Religions offer only tribal myths to answer these questions. Philosophy and introspection, in the form of unaided rational inquiry, can lead to conclusions that are not anchored in reality. Ultimately, we’re a biological species living in a biological world. Our body is subject to the laws of physics and chemistry, and our mind is a product of biological/cultural evolution. We cannot understand ourselves without the aid of science. This is where group selection (multilevel natural selection) takes a prominent role. Wilson spends a lot of time on group selection so that he can explain human condition based on that concept. This book offers the best definition of human nature that I’ve seen: Human nature is the inherited regularities of mental development common to our species. "
11,0871404133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12031280-paul,5,"Wow -- what a cool book! A fascinating read, start to finish.Relates the conflict we perceive within human nature as a development in evolution of the conflict between group selection and individual selection. Individuals with selfish motives and actions are more successful than those who are altruistic, but groups of altruists are much more successful than groups of selfish individuals.Touches on questions of consciousness, the development of language, art and religion. Useful for understanding the impulse to storytelling, the means by which we empathize and sympathize with others, and how humans managed to come to dominate despite the appearance of other eusocial creatures -- primarily insects like ants and bees -- millions of years earlier. Hint: it involves our ability to control and use fire.Also explains why humans the world over have a similar aesthetic when it comes to landscaping -- roughly, the aesthetic of a beautiful public park, with open spaces punctuated by trees and, preferably, some water as in a stream or fountain. Reason: such an aesthetic recalls our primal birthplace in Africa -- the Serengeti."
12,0871404133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57086222-tom-woolf,5,"In this book, Wilson attempts two somewhat different tasks, and generally succeeds at both, but is not perfect at either. First, he draws a broad outline of the evolution of humanity, and specifically of the evolution of human culture and social traits. Secondly, he presents an argument for the rejection of kin selection and inclusive fitness theory in favor of group selection. Below, I'll briefly outline the structure of the book, then comment on where I thought the book succeeded and where it was lacking.After an introductory section laying out his central questions, Wilson embarks on a lengthy section describing the basics of human evolution. If you've already read extensively on this topic, Wilson does not add much here in the way of new ideas -- which was one of the reasons this book was slow to grab me. He does lay some groundwork here for his argument about group selection, but for the most part this section covers ground that is pretty well-trodden. He follows with a section on the evolution of eusocial insects. This was somewhat less familiar territory for me, and therefore the point where the book started to suck me in. Insects are Wilson's specialty, and the insights here do not disappoint.But ultimately, the descriptions of eusocial insects are more groundwork for the fourth section, in which Wilson establishes the central claim of the work: that inclusive fitness theory and kin selection have failed to match real-world observations of eusocial animals, and that natural selection operating on the group level (as opposed to the organism level) successfully explains the evolution of altruism, culture, and social behavior. Finally, Wilson spends a fifth section addressing the role of biological evolution in the development of specific aspects of humanity: culture, language, religion, morality, and the creative arts. As I stated above, the central argument in this book is an argument about the merits of group selection versus kin selection theory. This is a fascinating and important argument in evolutionary biology, but I think it is also a fairly technical -- even esoteric -- argument. I don't know to what extent the general reader will be invested in this argument. Perhaps Wilson succeeded in bringing this question to a general readership -- but in doing so, I feel like he omitted some of the details of the experimental evidence that would be desired by the more knowledgeable reader. Not that he ignores experimental evidence, but I would have appreciated a more thorough treatment.I appreciated the broad scope of the book's last section, but this scope carries with it inherent weaknesses. The questions that Wilson addresses here -- the evolutionary and biological origins of language, culture, religion, and morality -- are far from settled science. Wilson makes his case -- sometimes a strong case -- for group selection pressures as driving forces in each of these areas, but much of this work is necessarily speculative. The ideas are intriguing and provocative, but certainly not conclusive. (The religiously-oriented will likely take particular issue with some of Wilson's conclusions about the origins and nature of religious faith, but I will leave that debate to others.)For whatever flaws it may have, I still gave this book five stars, and I would still recommend it highly to anyone interested in evolution or the origins of humanity. Wilson pioneered the integration of biology and the social sciences, and his ideas in this arena continue to resonate. For the reader who has a bit of background in evolutionary bio, Wilson provides a strong counterpoint to the ideas of gene-level selection advocated by Richard Dawkins (not that gene-level, organism-level, and group-level selection are mutually exclusive, but Wilson and Dawkins take strongly diverging views on the relative importance of each). For the reader who has little or no background on human evolution, I would add this to my short-list for ""Books to choose from if you read only one book about evolution."""
13,0871404133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,1,"There is one interesting and unique point made in this book:Eusocial organisms arise when there is a common, group ""nest"".Wilson champions the theory of ""multiple level"" or ""group"" selection.Group selection is a fine way of looking at colonies/tribes.There's a lot of info about human and ant/termite history.Cool stuff, that.1. But, in this book, Wilson goes on to put down another fine theory.He takes every opportunity to trash ""kin selection"" and ""inclusive fitness"".His criticism of kin selection is fair because of its limited use.But he profoundly misrepresents and incorrectly rejects inclusive fitness.Hamilton's theory is a mathematical model which works well in many cases.It is not disproved, debunked, wrong, or incorrect.Wilson would have the reader believe the contrary, and take his word for it.And he does so over, and over, as though saying it enough will make it true!He seems not to have read The Selfish Gene by Richard Dawkins.Though he does call worker bees a ""phenotypic extension"" of the queen.Of course, no credit is given to Dawkins for coining the term!Wilson comes across as a total ass-hat, obsessed with crushing others.This is flagrant dishonesty so abhorrent that I give only 1-star.For those curious about this argument, read more here:http://richarddawkins.net/articles/64...There are other serious deal breakers between me and this book:2. Wilson calls selecting embryo to avoid genetic disease ""eugenics"".He expresses his hope that it will never become common place.By this reasoning, would he deny live-saving care to premature babies?It is clearly an evil, incorrect moral assessment.3. He claims organisms living in water can ever develop technology.His argument is that they cannot possess fire, metal, etc.This seems like a very weak argument.It reminds me of the Gw'oth from Larry Niven's novels.4. Another of Wilson's unmerited personal opinions is about AI.He claims computers can never have human emotions.He justifies this by pointing out our special biological origins.Computers may not share our direct origins, but programmers makes the rules.The trick to a human-like AI is to simulate the various of the brain.These parts have their function thanks to evolution.There is nothing to stop a computational model from replicating ANY function!5. Another moment in the book that made me vomit and shit at the same time:Wilson argues that we should ABANDON MANNED SPACE TRAVEL!If this doesn't convince you Wilson is an ass-hat, I don't know what will.He says its cheaper and safer to stay on Earth, FOREVER!I don't know what compels Wilson to throw in his stupid beliefs around.But they certainly don't belong in a non-fiction book like this.I wish he would stick to talking about ants!"
14,0871404133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1677868-steven-peterson,4,"There are any number of lively debates within evolutionary circles, such as the pace of evolutionary change (gradualism versus punctuated equilibrium) or the level at which evolution takes place (individual versus group versus multiple levels).One of these issues is joined in this volume.Wilson says that group selection was quite prominent in human evolution from 50,000 to 60,000 years ago. In his words (2012, p. 91):""Bands and communities of bands with better combinations of cultural innovations became more productive and better equipped for competition and war. Their rivals either copied them or else were displaced and their territories taken. Thus group selection drove the evolution of culture.""A key concept in Wilson's book is ""eusociality,"" which refers to (2012, p. 17) ""group members containing multiple generations and prone to perform altruistic acts as part of their division of labor."" He notes that humans and a number of social insects manifest this trait. Eusocial behavior is a product of both individual and group selection; since more eusocial groups would be likelier to survive, this introduces an element of group selection to the process.This volume has created considerable debate among evolutionary theorists. The volume is well written and worthy of discussion. "
15,0871404133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8776230-delany,4,"I've been reading a bit about the huge controversy over kin selection vs. group selection. Wilson is receiving harsh criticism over his apparent defection from his own previous ideas about kin selection, which are endorsed by nearly all evolutionary biologists. At this point, I am not entirely sure that Wilson's ideas about group selection are completely incompatible with orthodox kin selection theory. Here's a nice brief discussion of the problem: Science Creative Quarterly. An excerpt: ""The debate among biologists on the legitimacy of group selection theory continues unabated today, (Wilson, 2005 and Foster et al., 2005), and the ongoing struggle to resolve interpretations of how selection acts at the ‘organismal’ or ‘superorganismal’ (or even cellular or molecular) level is certain to challenge the limits of human perspective for a long time to come. This struggle to find a resolution, a seamlessly ‘unified’ selection theory that bridges the gap from the smallest nucleic acid to the largest populations, is essentially at the heart of smaller controversial issues like group selection, and is part of the reason why these heated topics have persisted since Darwin started it all."""
16,0871404133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11641-laleh,5,"I could not comprehend a good deal of the complex biology concepts. What I did learn and enjoyed was the theory of group selection replacing the previous theory of kin selection. In simplistic terms, humans are left with contradictory traits from genes evolved through both group selection and individual selection. This results in forever conflicting impulses and drives: heroism, altruism, seeking justice etc. on one hand and cowardice, deception, betrayal etc on the other.What blew my mind was results of a study on societies with limited number of distinct words for colors. Societies with two words for color have words for white and blank only. Those with three words have: white, black and red. Four words: white, black, red and green or yellow and so on. I found this theory so thrilling that I would love to read more books on origins of language and linguistics. I'm also very much inspired to read more from Edward Wilson and also the ""Silent Hands"" which was referenced in the book."
17,0871404133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8670076-john-doyle,3,"Two thirds of ""The Social Conquest of Earth"" is devoted to the social behaviors of ants, termites, and bees as examples of the adaptive power of group selection to shape the characteristics of individual group members. For me, the last third of the book was gripping. In particular, the examination of multi-level selection and the adaptive superiority of selfishness in competition between individuals and of altruism within groups was fascinating. Religion is explained as adaptive for groups inasmuch as it creates and sustains shared identity and altruistic behavior by group members. "
18,0871404133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3749410-aaron-arnold,4,"Wilson is such a poetic guy that you almost hate to disagree with him based on prose style alone. Seriously, his sentences have the sorts of graceful rhythms that you associate with British authors that have had an expensive classical education, which makes reading him enjoyable even if, as many seem to feel, he's completely wrong. This book is a typically Wilsonian exploration of the human need to find meaning in our lives that's based on biology but aims at culture. He's never liked C. P. Snow's famous division between hard science and ""soft studies"", so in his introduction, he used Paul Gaugin's famous painting ""D'où Venons Nous / Que Sommes Nous / Où Allons Nous"" (""Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?"") as an example of the type of questioning that occupies most philosophy, art, and culture, and, while acknowledging the power of the fruits of these artistic labors, dismissed them as being unable, on their own, to answer those questions. As he's famously said in the past, in one of those imperious statements that tend to polarize readers, most historical philosophy is essentially worthless, being based on ""failed models of the brain"", and in his view only the techniques of modern science, with their tradition of rigor, empiricism, and dismantling dogma, can deliver even partially true answers to the Big Questions. The most controversial aspect of the book, from a scientific standpoint, is that after a lifetime of championing kin selection, the current mainstream view of how evolution operates, Wilson has now decided that group selection is the way to go. Essentially he's arguing that eusociality, the collective, collaborative interactions characteristic of humans and ants among very few other species, is the key to understanding ourselves, and that requires understanding where it came from along with a new understanding of evolution. So there are very thought-provoking discussions of humans and ants wrapped in a troubling heresy. In humans, he traced our current dominance to the lucky confluence of a few necessary preadaptations that separate us from our protohuman ancestors and relatives. These are: dwelling on land (even brilliant cetaceans can't develop fire); large body size (tiny creatures just can't get brains large enough for general-purpose intelligence); grasping hands (far superior to claws and fangs for manipulating tools); bipedalism (freeing up our hands to interact with the world more); diet (meat, though hard to hunt, is rich in energy); fire (duh); and division of labor (this is a fascinating link that deserves a book of its own - is Adam Smith-style division of labor itself a source of intelligence, or merely a product of it?). You may have noticed that very few of those attributes are true of ants; hold that thought. He immediately pivoted towards declaring kin selection a failure and declaring that group selection was a necessary component of a multi-level theory of evolution. I confess that at first I simply didn't understand how he was able to reach that conclusion. As discussed by writers like Richard Dawkins in his excellent The Extended Phenotype, a huge amount of incredibly complicated behavior that reaches all the way up to the level of an organism's interaction with its peers can be explained by the interactions of genes and only genes; there simply is no group-level counterpart of a gene that can be inherited or replicated, and though epigenetic artifacts like memes seem to behave in analogous ways on a ""higher"" level, they are merely the products of combinations of genes and don't necessarily have a ""real"" existence independent of the individuals that create them. Cultural markers like religious affiliation, language, sexual practices, sporting traditions, economic arrangements, or conventions on which side of the road to drive on may look like they are the group-level equivalent to genes because they get passed on to succeeding generations, seem to have an effect on the fitness of the groups that practice them, and undergo gene-like mutations and alterations, but they are at base mere phenotypes, and no appeal to ""top-down"" processes like group selection or ""superior culture"" are needed to explain them. The ""centrifugal force"" of between-group conflict and ""centripetal force"" of in-group altruism that Wilson devotes much of the book to discussing are, in the mainstream view, no different, and so I had some trouble enjoying the (very interesting and well-written) Out-of-Africa chapters thereof because I was constantly wondering when Wilson was going to circle back around and fully explain his bombshell. There were many points where he brings up evidence that seems like trouble for his group-selection theory, such as when he uses the example of the full competence of Australian aboriginal children brought up by white families - if the 45,000 genetic divergence of native Australians and modern white Australians is able to be so easily overcome by upbringing in a particular culture, how does that disprove the theory that cultural differences are essentially interchangeable epiphenomena of our overwhelmingly similar genes? He cited an insight from the great cybernetician Herbert Simon about the fact that human societies are decomposable into nearly discrete sub-systems shows the advantages of division of labor to a hierarchical society, but mere complexity is not in itself a sign of a qualitatively different type of evolution; Simon himself had a bit in his pioneering The Sciences of the Artificial where he discussed how complex behavior can be merely the result of complexities in the environment, and not in the system directly. For example, Modern France is much more complex than the France of 1500 AD, but any kind of group evolution would have to work on what seems to be implausibly fast levels to have any role in this, and the fact that groups can descend to much lower levels of complexity (e.g. post-Fall Romans, Easter Islanders, the Mayans) without any noticeable changes in the genetic makeup of the populations made me skeptical that group selection is anything other than the interface of genetic epiphenomena with the outside world. It took until the ant chapters for me to really come to terms with his thesis, maybe because I had fewer preconceived notions and was more open to his theory when it was put in terms of ants rather than people. He explained two criteria for eusociality: first, every eusocial species typically has large investments in nests, with the corollary that some percentage of individuals never leave the nest; second, each eusocial species also has a division of labor, with the corollary that some individuals labor for the good of the collective instead of for direct personal gain. Thus bees have their hives with attendant workers and soldiers, while humans have cities with the same, and this kind of multi-generational investment and specialization (""capital accumulation"" and ""career paths"", in human terms) give individual members of the collective/polity more advantages than if they were simply fending for themselves and had to begin each generation from scratch. This reframing of traditional Adam Smith-style economics is both banal and pretty clever, and it reminded me of Paul Krugman's short essay ""What Economists Can Learn from Evolutionary Theorists"" on the similarities between neoclassical economic models and their biological counterparts in population simulations and so forth, in that it showed the interesting conclusions you can get by broadening your scope to include other disciplines. The ant sections are also where Wilson made the clearest preparatory arguments for his group selection thesis by going over the analogous preadaptations that insect species went through in order to develop eusociality: fortified nest sites, protection against predators, and the presence of some incremental advantage to being in a hive versus being solitary. The one bright line appears to be the emergence of a distinct worker caste. With that discussion of the nature of eusociality, Wilson then turned to why individual selection seemed unable to explain it. The distinction between the gene as a unit of heredity and the gene or individual as the unit of selection, phenotype plasticity (the tendency for identical genes to have different phenotypes depending on environmental circumstances, such as humans having distinct fingerprints even though we all have the same finger genes), and the puzzle of why some eusocial species are diploid versus haplodiploid formed the main platform for the discussion of Hamilton's inequality, which is at the heart of kin selection theory. Stated briefly, ""rb > c, meaning that an allele prescribing altruism will increase in frequency in a population if the benefit, b, to the recipient of the altruism, times r, the degree of kinship to the altruist, is greater than the cost to the altruist."" This had always seemed very reasonable to me, and it still does, though Wilson spent a great deal of time going over its theoretical and empirical shortcomings. As a layman I'm obviously not qualified enough to fully judge his conclusions, but I did not see a real falsifiable prediction in the book: is it actually impossible for something like a sterile worker caste to evolve using the principle of kin selection? There was a lot of talk about the failings of kin selection in simulations, yet it seemed like the actual proof was left to an appendix that never arrived. Furthermore, it seemed like he was only interested in the question of which type of selection was correct as a way to talk about eusociality, which seemed like putting the cart before the horse. The way he discussed it, eusociality is to individualism roughly as multicellularism is to unicellularism, which makes sense on an analogical level, yet the book just plain needed more about group selection to back that up. However, his discussion of eusociality was awesome, and seemed full of good insights. Much much more could be written about group and individual forces, and the sections that talked about how they interacted in terms of culture were really good, especially when he mentioned art or religion. His insights on how much of art is merely patterns that excite the pattern-recognition systems of the human brain are not new, but the argument gains new meaning in the context of the social purposes of art and what artistic endeavors do for group solidarity. His closing contention that space travel is a harmful, expensive mirage annoyed me as a science fiction fan and as someone who thinks that space travel is a logical next step in the long-term evolution of Earth life, but that ending aberrance shouldn't detract from the fascinating meditation on the true nature of our species and its ultimate destination. These sentences in particular touch on a very important theme in all politics: ""[A]n iron rule exists in genetic social evolution. It is that selfish individuals beat altruistic individuals, while groups of altruists beat groups of selfish individuals. The victory can never be complete; the balance of selection pressures cannot move to either extreme. If individual selection were to dominate, societies would dissolve. If group selection were to dominate, human groups would come to resemble ant colonies."" Wilson may not have definitively answered the question of Where Are We Going?, but I would love for some further discussion from him, and from the other geneticists who oppose group selection, yet have not given eusociality the kind of treatment it gets here."
19,0871404133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1026842-kathleen-brugger,5,"In this book Dr. Wilson has created an incredibly positive portrait of the human family: we have prospered because we have learned to work together.E. O. Wilson is an expert on ants, and in the 1970s popularized the theory of kin selection in his book Sociobiology. This theory was an attempt to explain why certain organisms form social groups at the cost to an individual’s survival. Why do worker bees give up the ability to reproduce, for example? This seems to fly in the face of Darwin’s theory of evolution. The kinship theory stated that if, by not having offspring yourself, you could help more of your sister’s offspring survive, that would still be a survival strategy because your sister shares many of your genes. Dr. Wilson shows in The Social Conquest of Earth that, in fact, this is an incredibly effective survival strategy. The creatures who have learned to form cooperative societies are the masters of their ecological niche: “The twenty thousand known species of eusocial insects, mostly ants, bees, wasps, and termites, account for only 2 percent of the approximately one million known species of insects. Yet this tiny minority of species dominates the rest of the insects in their numbers, their weight, and their impact on the environment.”Kinship theory seemed to explain insect cooperative societies very well, but over time it became clear that it was unsatisfactory to explain human society. Humans will help non-relatives to survive; we will even risk our lives to save a stranger. This required a different explanation, and this book is Wilson’s popular exposition of his new theory of group selection.Most of the book is about establishing the evidence for this new theory, including that this is the best way to explain the evolution of social groups among humans. What really sets humans apart is that our cooperation makes us more successful as individuals. Unlike insects that diminish their individual survival through cooperation (unless you happen to be the queen), humans maximize their individual survival.In fact, this is what makes humans so dynamic: we are a delicate balance of selfishness and cooperation. That is our strength, but also the source of conflict. Unlike the insects, in the midst of our cooperative societies we also compete with each other for mates and resources.Studies show young children will help a stranger without second thought, unlike chimpanzees who show no interest in helping. Humans don’t have to be trained to be kind and helpful.Tens of thousands of years of evolution has give us as many cooperative instincts as selfish ones, yet modern American society acts as if the only true instincts are the selfish ones, and that altruism is some aberrant behavior. When reporting on a natural disaster like Hurricane Sandy in the Northeast, reporters love to pull out the stories of sacrifice and selfless aid to strangers, and speak with wonder as if this is uncommon. It’s not uncommon; it’s part of our nature. Being helpful to our neighbor is part of who we are. In terms of the political, you could say conservatives act as if we were all selfishness, and liberals act as if we are only cooperators. The truth is we’re both. But in this country the conservative worldview has mostly prevailed. We’re taught that cooperation is unnatural; that our biological nature is purely and solely selfish. My hope is that this new theory will eventually bring a balance to our understanding of society—cooperation is as natural a part of us as competition.Dr. Wilson asserts that the first step in the progression to sociality in a species is the creation of a communal nest. I loved his image of early humans learning to control fire: fire became our nest, our gathering place. This in turn could have been the spur to develop language—when it’s dark and there’s nothing else to do, early peoples could talk about the day. Does this explain why we still love to sit around campfires and tell stories and sing songs together? Why the fireplace is the heart (hearth) of the home? "
20,0871404133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5964499-francisco-viliesid,5,"The fact that Man has been searching to understand the Human condition for ages is the question this book delves into. Wilson’s biology specialization on social insects is the background from where he peeks into Mankind’s own evolution to the point where we stand today, for good or bad Man is the supreme conqueror of Earth. He posits that there are a few special characteristics which, when acquired through preadaptation, animals become social. A very unique dynamic consisting of the rise of bipedalism, tool making, control of fire, hunting in groups, a grasping hand, speech/language, an increasingly larger brain for a rapidly developing intelligence, among many, all arising at one or another stage of our evolution. But Wilson highlights the advent of eusociality as a key adaptation that defined the distinct path that humans would take and would make them what we are today. Eusociality means tribalism, the identification with a group of whatever kind. It also means owning a habitat, a home to protect and defend. Social insects build those homes, their nests, and defend them against aggresors. The success of those insect colonies, or superorganisms, is the distribution of labour among specialized variants of the insect units. Humans did not acquire such a trait, and so all humans are basically equal (thus our Human Rights). In our history there are abundant examples of attempts at establishing organizations similar to those of insects, slavery in one form or another, but thankfully most of us have realized it is not human. The instinct is there, but we cannot create workers, and soldiers or other by silencing some genes through what we feed our progeny. Leadership is the human way to make up for it. Not so much in the book but the question does arise: when did intelligence undergo that special singularity or leap that made it so different to its existing cousins, the Neanderthals, Denisovans or Floresians? How come Man is so curious and intelligent that it has been able to develop a Science through which to try and unravel its own nature? All of the above --and yes that of eusociality which very many had not so much considered until recently, perhaps focusing on the rise of agriculture …and cooking thanks to fire-- but in my view the latter characteristic, that of an unquenchable thirst for knowledge and understanding and the capacity to gradually develop it, has been the most important human trait. ""We are an evolutionary chimera, living on intelligence steered by the demands of animal instinct"" (p.13). ""There is a real creation story of humanity and it is not a myth. Science is it, and it is continuously tested, enriched and strengthened in time"" (p.10)."
21,0871404133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4277669-caitlin,4,"I haven't read Wilson before this although he is a prolific writer and scientist. I love the subject of the development of humanity and culture and was thrilled to find this new publication at the airport when I had a 5 hour layover followed by a 6 hour flight! Wilson writes clearly and for the most part in layman's terms comparing the development of eusociality in ants and bugs and humans. He delves into the reason that the bugs never went further in their development, evolving into the creative, independent beings that humans are. I found this book to be very interesting. It is a bit repetitive in places, but I think that is because he is very much aware of his scientific mind and he wants his readers to fully grasp his explanations and comparisons. With my limited knowledge of his field, I can say what he posits makes sense. Wilson believes that eusociality evolved from his clunky term of ""gene-culture coevolution."" Our genes and cultures evolved from the dual drives of group selection and individual selection. Humanity relates to each other and the world in ways wholly different than even the next-in-line most intelligent creatures, like chimpanzees or dolphins. Our ability to be both altruistic and selfish is what created our deeply divided human nature, and our struggles with good versus evil. As humans struggled to understand the world around them and their selves, they invented gods, creation myths, rituals, etc. to explain everything. Now that we have evolved so much, and are always evolving, science needs to displace religion as the chief explanation for the natural world, and our physiological and psychological meaning. He makes some claims against religious personages, declaring that they falsely give comfort and knowledge to their respective followers that I at first felt affronted by, but as I kept reading I found it hard to deny his points. I don't believe as Marx did that religion has no value, deep faith is a comfort for many people and should never be taken from them. However, science should not continue to be relegated to the back seat, especially in politics. There is so much in-fighting and religiosity in the world today that climate change, animal and plant extinction, the loss of rain forests and savannas,the development of truly better than oil technologies, are falling by the wayside to promote one belief system above another, or polticians' pride above these important realities. Wilson is concerned and so should we be. "
22,0871404133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4442364-franz,4,"The theme of Wilson's book is expressed by the title of one of Gauguin's last Tahitian masterpieces: Where did we come from? What are we? Where are we going? Wilson brings a lifetime of study, research, and reflection to bear on these questions. Much of the early part of the book is devoted to Wilson's passion, ants, as well as other social insects. He shows how through natural selection these social insects came to dominate the invertebrate species on land, that there is a biological advantage to eusociality--the presence of two or more generations that evolved to establish and protect nests, and to nurture new generations. When he switches his focus to humanity, he demonstrates, based on what is currently known about the path of human evolution, how eusociality emerged as the social pattern that resulted in the domination of Earth by homo sapiens. The bulk of the story he tells is about where we came from, and some of his arguments raised a dust storm of controversy. Decades ago he was on of the most important proponents of what's become know as the the selfish gene account of human evolution, which focuses on humans acting to preserve and transmit their own genes and those of their closest kin. Wilson no longer accepts that account, and now urges that a more accurate picture of human evolution must also include group selection. He points out that the kinship theory, in which an individual promotes the transmission of his own genes, is individualistic, selfish, and promotes some of the darker aspects of human behavior. Group selection, on the other hand, explains more readily the more angelic nature of humankind, namely our tendency to act altruistically, especially when it comes to protecting our own tribe, many of whose members are not kin. As to where we are going, he is very optimistic despite the path humans have taken and the destructive forces we have unleashed in the last few decades, especially with respect to global warming. He believes we will be able to ultimately save ourselves from the total disaster of engineering our own extinction. Wilson writing is relatively free of jargon, and given his advanced age may be his final great work. If you don't like the chapters about the insects, they can be easily skipped, though I found his descriptions of the insect world fascinating."
23,0871404133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2662643-john-stepper,4,"There are two main takeaways from this book for me. First is that humans have evolved extraordinarily complex cooperation & collaboration strategies that include both self-ish behavior and altruistic behavior. And this conflicting mix of motivations and intentions are a result of natural selection at both the individual and group level. So are we selfish or are we altruistic? We’re both. The second takeaway is that our altruistic behavior can be director at those we consider to be in our group, and for humans the definition of “our group” is extraordinarily flexible and ever-changing. This gives me hope that, over time, we may be able to actually apply the ancient wisdom that we are all connected. Further, as he alluded to I. The final chapter, we may someday realize that the Earth is our shared home - our “nest to be protected” which is a foundation of eusocial behavior - and our natural tendencies for tribalism and group-level selection can be extended to a much wider population Han is currently the case for almost all of us.

The mind seeks but cannot find the precise place and hour. We have created a Star Wars civilization, with Stone Age emotions, medieval institutions, and godlike technology. We thrash about. We are terribly confused by the mere fact of our existence, and a danger to ourselves and to the rest of life.”Edward O Wilson frames his book around three questions found in script at the top left of Gaugin’s Tahitian painting: Who are we? Where did we come from? Where are we going? More precisely, how and why did social behavior evolve?His answer is compelling, as are some of his arguments around the origin of art and religion. He walks you through the evolution of Homo sapiens and how individual adaptations have lead directly to current behaviors and psychological schisms. It’s hard to talk about this book without coming right out and listing his thoughts. I’ll just say that if the above sounds at all interesting to you, you’ll like this book. "

26,0871404133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73783-taka,3,"While I loved his discussion of ants, bees, and termites, as well as the concepts of eusociality and gene-culture coevolution, his exposition wasn't always clear or illuminating, especially the crucial chapters on eusociality. There were places where he was trying to explain it to the lay audience with some patience and other places where he just gives up and glosses things over without fully explaining the links and concepts while presupposing some knowledge of evolutionary theory and genetics. Some of the chapters in the middle section felt repetitive and though I appreciate Wilson's ""intelligent"" prose sometimes, for the most part it felt stiff (did he write it in a hurry?) and lacked clarity. Another criticism is that where he talks about subjects outside his speciality (language, cave art, and religion), he is either out of his depth (music, he claims, probably came from language—a controversial claim in itself, especially in light of Steven Brown's fascinating but equally speculative claim that both music and language sprang from a common ancestor called ""musilanguage""), or not all that informative or illuminating at all: the topics he deals with in the last part of his book are HUGE, complex, and controversial, and probably requires a book each, but he condenses all the fascinating discussions (and speculations) into succinct chapters, which might be what he intended for the lay audience, but which personally left me quite unsatisfied and even frustrated. As far as kin selection vs. group selection is concerned, I don't know if I fully understand the arguments and counterarguments completely—something I wanted from the book—and so it looks like I'll have to turn to the paper that launched 134 angry scientists arguing against it and to Nowak's Supercooperators. On the whole, though, despite all the gripes, the book did shed light on group selection and altruism from exactly the angle I was hoping it would (not SOLELY from selfish interests) and it did give a manageable account of human prehistory, and hence the 3 stars."
27,0871404133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/176653-mark,3,"Edward O. Wilson has clearly done enough research and investigation of nature for his opinions to be taken seriously. However, I did not find his explanations in many areas convincing. In part it is understandable, because nature and biology are so complex and we are so close to the beginning on the path to understanding. Nevertheless, here are a few criticisms and comments:-- Wilson's view that humans are so much farther along and so superior to other animals on the Earth. This comes across over and over again throughout the book. Nevermind the fact that the brain size of whales is about 9 times larger than human brains, for example.-- The weakness of the connection between genes and behavior. If some new behavior would be beneficial, then just give it a few years, a random mutation, and suddenly this new behavior appears, according to Wilson. See the book ""The Signature in the Cell"" by Stephen Meyer for criticism of the power of mutations. It's a pretty big leap (even allowing the possibility that a useful mutation could occur) to go from a change in the genetic code to changes in behavior of organisms.-- His criticism of ""Inclusive Fitness Theory"" which he repeats again in his book ""The Meaning of Human Existence"" (as well as multiple times in this book) is poorly explained and somewhat egotistical. Perhaps it was just me, but after reading about it several times, it is still not clear to me what he is saying.-- His dismissal of UFOs and alien life is typical of scientists. As Richard Dolan said, ""try reading a book"". Richard Dolan has written numerous great books on the mystery of UFOs.-- His observations and information about how insect societies behave and the composition of their genes, I found interesting. It's when he strays from the observations to draw what I see as far-fetched conclusions that he really, in my view, becomes unscientific. How is it that a worker ant has a completely different body than the queen, and yet it has the same genes? Perhaps this is common knowledge, but I don't understand it, and Wilson did not explain it."
28,0871404133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7552897-sebastian,2,"“All science is either physics, or stamp collecting”, as Ernest Rutherford rather apocryphally said, and Wilson seems to be intent on proving this quip to be absolutely correct. This book is a rather odd mix of his personal musings on the ineffable nature of man and the biology of eusocial species, and as it oscillates between the two topics it also oscillates wildly in quality. Whenever Wilson is talking about his area of expertise – eusocial insects – the book is fascinating, though it does devolve into “stamp collecting” – rote repetition of facts at a level just a step above reading a Wikipedia article. When, on the other hand, he tries to go beyond this and expound on his views on philosophy, art, or the humanities in general, he devolves into pointless banality, repeating primary school lessons as if they are piercing insights into The Big Questions. A large part of the book is also dedicated to some kind of quixotic battle against kin selection theory, something that could have been summarized within a page or two, but which the author chose to expound on at quite a boring length.On top of all that, every now and then he steps out on a wild tangent to present his seriously misguided opinion on topics he doesn’t seem to know much about, e.g. railing on against the possibility of developing human-level AI (apparently, because human intelligence is a complex product of the interplay of brain structure and its environment) or against manned space exploration (apparently, because it’s hard and dangerous), coming off as a kooky old man complaining against “all this new-fangled tekmelogy stuff”.This book would have found itself on the DNF pile really quickly had it not contained the bits about insects. In point of fact, I got to reading Wilson precisely because his insect books were highly recommended, yet this was the only one of his non-fiction titles I could find. Well, if you are looking to learn interesting stuff from a world-class expert on (eu)social insects, look to some of his other works."
29,0871404133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91367912-taufiq-murtadho,3,"Where do we come from? What are we? Where are we going? One can find these questions on the corner of Paul Gauguin’s painting that becomes the cover of “The Social Conquest of Earth”. Wilson, in this book, is embarked on a mission of answering these existential questions. He combines arguments and evidence from sociobiology, archeology, and anthropology to move closer toward the answer. He begins by narrating a history of human evolution, from our split with ape’s common ancestor until the arrival of Homo sapiens (modern human). Today, all our closest evolutionary relatives such as Neanderthals and Homo erectus have gone extinct. It is now widely accepted that the most likely explanation for their extinction is us. We killed them either directly or indirectly through competition and natural selection. Based on archaeological evidence, Homo sapiens prevailed because we developed higher social capacity compared to other human relatives. Enhancement of social capacity would increase the size and cooperation strength of a tribe. Thus, Homo sapiens gained advantage compared to its relatives in both full-blown confrontation and resource competition. It is then necessary to ask, how did we achieve that higher level of sociality? In other words, how did advance social life such as us exist?We are not unique as a social species. Many mammals and insects are also social species. Some of them achieve an extraordinarily high level of sociality called eusociality. Eusocial species do not only interact and cooperate with one another, but they also occupy a defensible nest where more than one generation live, and they organize themselves into reproductive and non-reproductive classes through division of labor. Eusocial insects are mostly the members of Hymenoptera group (ants, bees, wasps), while mole-rat is the example of eusocial species in mammals. In a eusocial colony, members belonging to a certain class sacrifice their reproductive chance for the reproductive success of another class. For instance, soldier ants sacrifice their reproductive chance for the reproductive success of the queen ant. They instead become the protector of the nest, ready to attack anything that threatens the colony. In some sense, soldier ants behave altruistically in favor of the queen’s reproduction.There is a heated debate on the origin of eusociality and altruism in Darwinian framework. On the one hand, there is kin selection that has been suggested by Darwin himself when he discusses his observation of social bees. In kin selection, an individual may behave “altruistically” when it benefits the reproductive success of the individual’s relatives. The closer genetic relationship between individuals, the more likely they display altruistic behavior toward one another. Thus, the soldier ants behave altruistically in favor of the queen’s reproductive success because the queen carries a significant part of its gene. Richard Dawkins is one of the most famous biologists who support kin selection. He elaborates his arguments in favor of kin selection in his best-selling book “The Selfish Gene”. On the other hand, there is group selection. It asserts that natural selection is multi-level. It acts on both individual level and group level. Group level natural selection, or group selection for short, is when natural selection favors certain groups over the others based on their collective fitness. Altruism (between group members at least) evolves because it increases collective fitness of a group. Moreover, group selection does not assume kin selection. Therefore, altruistic behavior would be equally likely among group members, regardless of their genetic relatedness, as long as it benefits the group as a whole. Wilson is the supporter of group selection. In this book, he criticizes kin selection and points out its weakness in explaining eusociality.Is human eusocial? If one uses the strict definition of eusociality, where there must be fixed reproductive and non-reproductive social classes, then obviously the answer is no. However, Wilson argues that human is eusocial by loosening the definition of eusociality. He argues that because human have defensible “nest” (tribe, kingdom, nation, etc), form groups, and display altruistic behavior between group members that favor reproductive success of certain individuals, human can be considered as a eusocial species. Wilson further argues that group selection can explain a great deal of what’s often called ‘human nature’. He suggests that our instinct is shaped by two different levels of natural selection such that we are in a constant dilemma between selfish and selfless behavior. Individual selection encourages selfish behavior while group selection encourages altruistic behavior between group members. The proportion of egoistic behavior and cooperation is what governs the dynamics of human society. Furthermore, Wilson discusses the origins of the primary sources for human culture: language, morality & honor, religions, and art. He demonstrates how these traits benefit group selection such that they survive until today. In the last chapter of the book, Wilson explains his vision regarding the next step that humankind would take. He is convinced that, although tribalism is what drives the social evolution of human species, now has come the time for us to overcome it. The exponential development of science and technology simultaneously increase our power to self-destruct and our capability to cooperate. If tribalism persists, it could cause catastrophic wars that threaten the whole human species. On the other side, the invention of airplanes, internet, and other technologies decreases the relevance of tribe, nation, and religion in establishing cooperation. So what will happen after we overcome tribalism? Wilson is skeptical to the idea of human colonization on another planet. But, he strongly believes that human is capable to turn the earth into living heaven for all of us. The last paragraph of this review will be my opinion about this book. I personally like how Wilson connects the study of biology to human social behavior. My favorite part is how multilevel natural selection can explain the human dilemma between selfish and altruistic behavior. I think the idea is very attractive and elegant. Of course, I can not say anything on whether it is actually true. I leave kin selection vs group selection controversy to the biologist. However, I believe some parts of this book is too heavy for general readers, especially when Wilson dives in into group selection vs kin selection debate and when he discusses gene-culture coevolution. I think in order to have a full experience with this book, one needs a background in evolutionary biology and be familiar enough with its mathematical modeling. Nevertheless, I enjoy this book very much and I learn a lot from it. As a final message, I would recommend this book for anyone interested in how evolution can explain the existence of social species and how it affects human behavior in society."
30,0871404133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32553593-elliott-bignell,3,"I had hoped to be writing a five-star review tonight, but despite a rather attractive pointillist effect made up of fragments of erudition, this book simply failed to carry me. The overall focus of the picture was missing. Wilson has a formidable reputation as a biologist, but as a popular science author he lacks both Gould's grace and Dawkins' talent for making one feel intelligent.When reading Dawkins on linkage disequilibrium one comes up feeling like one has had a bracing swim; I could explain the concepts still today, more than a decade later. Reading Wilson on group selection, I am not convinced right now, the day I finished, that the concept is even coherent. He says that it has been mathematically shown to be distinct from kin selection, yet I never saw the slightest hint of how this ""proof"" was achieved. It sounds like an assertion.The book is not without merit. In fact, it's packed with it. Wilson rattles off examples of eusociality in nature and outgroup-prejudice among randomly grouped human test-subjects with equal fluency. The man is an expert, but there is an unfocussed attack on kin selection per se which seems to have no basis in its specific failings vis-a-vis eusociality. It feels, frankly, like prejudice - the bad air left by a fight that took place before you entered the room.There were one or two really trivial details that got on my nerves, the worst of which was the repeated use of the anti-word ""repertory"", but also a just-so story about the origin of vowels. I can overlook the occasionally infantile-sounding vocabulary, and there is a lot to enjoy in this work, but the lack of clarity around the definition of group selection strikes me as a fatal flaw in a piece whose central concern it is. "
31,0871404133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5923189-tina-cipolla,5,"I love reading a book that makes me feel like I'm in the presence of greatness. Edward O. Wilson is a genius and it shows in this book. Although intended for the general reader this has a lot of complex science packed into it that might not have been necessary to the central point. As a professional academic though, I imagine it difficult for this author to ""tone it down"" for the rest of us. That said, his arguments seemed well backed up to me (although other reviewers on this site found the support lacking.) The most interesting parts of the book are when he applies the science to illuminating how eusociality has impacted the human race and how eusociality works in evolutionary science.Toward the end of the book he makes the some statements about the impossibility of colonizing space that I found at odds with the rest of the book. Earlier he discussed how technology is advancing so quickly now that it is impossible to realistically look beyond 10 years into the future. If that is so, why put down the idea of colonizing space as impossible? He can't know what will be possible in 100 or 1000 or 5000 years. And the fact that his planet was never visited in its multi-billion year history, how can he state this with such assuredness? Was he here 3 billion years ago? Was he here when the planet was uninhabitable? Does he KNOW that no alien civilization ever did a fly by? He can't know this, and I find it annoying that he just blows off the possibility of humans expanding beyond Earth someday after he just argued that we cannot claim to see into the future because things are happening too quickly in science now.All in all a great read with lots of insight into why social behavior was an evolutionary advantage to us and other social species.

32,0871404133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17886556-richard-block,5,"Ant-tastic!Those who challenge EO Wilson's slow conversion to group selection over kin selection, obviously hate this erudite ode to eusociality, and rightly so. It demonstrates the wisdom of his careful and detailed demolition of kin selection as a limited and mostly irrelevant determinant of evolutionary behaviour. I would imagine it was Wilson's unchallengable mastery of the insect world - and his 40 year obsession to link the behaviour of man to insect - that finally swayed him to this new understanding.Edward O. Wilson is a professor emeritus at Harvard University in entymology and a founder of evolutionary biology and psychology. He is one of the world's great intellectuals. He is as influential in his sphere as the Beatles were to mid-sities pop music. He writes with clarity and ease, and cares deeply about science. His long dissection of the group vs. kin selection rests on eusociality, the societies of insects and people, who rule the earth through group co-operation. One memorable idea is that, while a selfish individual might triumph over a co-operative one, a selfish group loses out to a co-operative group - all the time. Some of the detailed anecdotes about insect behaviour still astonish the non-scientists among us (me!)I particularly loved the final chapters of this book, especially the one in which he evicerates religion. In this he makes Dawkins look hysteric without much effort. To Wilson, the natural world, with all its wonders, knocks the spots off the imaginary world of 'faith.' Be prepared to take another look at The Selfish Gene and other works based in kin selection. There is a better idea, and Wilson shows it to us"
33,0871404133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5075000-gregg-sapp,4,"The following is slightly modified from my Library Journal review of E.O. Wilson's ""The Social Conquest of Earth.""WILSON, Edward O. The Social Conquest of Earth. Liveright, April 2012. c 352 p. illus, index. 978-0-87140-423-8, $27/95According to Wilson, recent advances in evolutionary science provide practical answers to two of humanity’s enduring existential questions: Who Are We? and Where Did We Come From? Succinctly, we are members of a “eusocial” species with behaviors, aptitudes, and perceptions that evolved through an interplay between multilevel evolutionary forces. Our innate, interdependent social organization evolved in response to pressures that weren’t fundamentally different from those that led to stratified insect “superorganism” colonies (see his ""The Superorganism: The Beauty, Elegance, and Strangeness of Insect Societies"", 576 pages : W.W. Norton, 2008). The difference-maker is intelligence, though, and Wilson shows how culture, religion, altruism, conflict, and even art can be explained by an evolutionary tug-of-war between the pressures of individual versus group selection. A positive answer to humanity’s last big question – Where Are We Going? – depends upon our ability to use species self-knowledge to create the world we want. For the record, he thinks that it is possible for us to manufacture our own human paradise right here on earth. VERDICT: Wilson is a prolific and popular biological theorist, and this significant addition to his legacy of thought will be controversial, provocative, and influential. Gregg Sapp, Olympia WA"
34,0871404133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9813886-kat,5,"I enjoyed The Social Conquest of Earth, though I had to return the book to the library before I could finish it (bah, these new releases! More reason for me to maybe get an e-reader). Anyway, of what I read of it, I was thoroughly impressed with E.O. Wilson's writing style, his fluidity, and ability to translate scientific research into easily digested bits of information. I enjoyed his synopsis on the evolution of humans. He goes over the many characteristics, usually individually touted, for making us uniquely dominant species on the planet. Among these include our large brains, our bipedal movement, our social, cultural, and agricultural networks and advancements. Wilson does a good job describing some of the contemporary/emerging changes in theories about human evolution. One of the emerging concepts I liked was the relationship between altruistic behavior and fitness (ability to pass on genes). In the past, it was argued that organisms acted altruistically in part because they could be helping out a relative with similar genes; therefore, I help out so-and-so and maybe they help pass on my genes inadvertently. The newer idea is that we stick together in groups, so our fitness is not just a function of individual fitness, but group fitness! So, if you're altruistic, you're doing your part to keep the group strong. "
35,0871404133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22449911-munthir-mahir,1,"Does not even add up to a theory, this book reads off personal musings of the author. A very significant part of the book goes into discrediting the kin-selection theory of social evolution and promoting/marketing his earlier work (something I find very unprofessional). Another part is dedicated to opinions and thoughts on different aspects of human social life like religion and language. Litttle of the book actually goes into what the author posits as a theory. The proposition offers group-selection as the evolutionary driver of social evolution; though it is not offered as a replacement to kin-selection, it builds on it. What I found problematic and hard to understand is the dynamics and relationship between the two theories. Wilson, set to rebut the kin theory goes on to build his theory on the same kin theory. (confusing, right?) How these theories build into each other is apparent but not clear. Another major problem with this theory is the definition on which a distinction is made between a simple or non-social system and an advanced social system (which the author limits to exclusively modern homo sapiens and in lower degrees some ape species). The author uses eusociality to make this distinction, and how he defines it is vague and very general to qualify as a foundation for a theory."
36,0871404133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2568370-micah,4,"The overarching idea of this book is that our social minds were shaped by the interplay between group selection (one group winning out over another) and individual selection (one individual -- and their progeny -- winning out over another). Group selection favors altruism because groups in which people cooperate do better than those in which people don't. Individual selection, on the other hand, favors selfishness.This is an evidence-based argument, but I also find it appealing in a dramatic sense, because it explains the inherent conflict we have within us between good and evil, between the better angels of our nature and our baser selves. It also goes a long way towards explaining our tribalism, how we tend to form groups and make enemies of people in other groups (Go Denver Broncos, GO USA!) Ironically, as human beings we are going to have to find ways to mitigate and rise above these instincts if we are to survive and prosper as a species.I admire the ambition of Wilson's thinking and writing - he's after a unifying theory of the biology behind human social life. It's exciting to live in a time where our basic understanding of evolutionary biology is undergoing such rapid and drastic revisions."
37,0871404133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4177031-troy-blackford,4,"Very interesting, but I am giving it four stars instead of five because he claims to turn the last 50 years of biological science with regards to kin selection on its head and to have proven that selection at the level of the group is a thing, but wants us to just sort of take his word for it. I would expect a more rigorous argument and for him to have spent a lot longer 'proving' his case, but he seems like he expects his audience of non-experts (he points out again and again that this is a book for popular consumption, and it's really well-written and easy to understand so it definitely is) to think 'Gee, he really sounds like he knows what he's talking about.' He might well be right, but if he is it's one of the most profound and shocking revelations/revolutions in the biological sciences for decades, and I'm not just going to flop over and cast 50 years of research from people all over the globe into the recycle bin thanks to a couple paragraphs in a popular science book.Other than that, it was a remarkable and fascinating book."
38,0871404133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4542177-duff,3,"Very good approach to understanding the changes in evolutionary theory, particularly in the light of genetic research. The concept of ""voltional selection"" as an end element of the theory was new to me and especially enlightening. Wilson bases the work on ""eusociality"" and the parallels for this in both human and animal evolution. Did get bogged down a few times in intricate discussions of insect eusocial adaptation!! His definition is clear: ""Eusociality, the condition of multiple generations organized into groups by means of altruistic division of labor""....and he states ""one of the major innovations in the history of life."" He prepares the ground for the stages required for this development. The later chapters on human evolution, the arts, religion and other cultural issues is fascinating to read from a scientist's point of view. Not necessary to agree with it all to find it worthwhile.

39,0871404133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11166290-bob-gustafson,5,"Edward O. Wilson combines his vast and authoritative knowledge of insects and insect genetics, with recent discoveries in the more general field of genetics and in anthropology to answer the questions, ""who are we?"", ""where did we come from?"" and ""where are we going?"" It is done excellently.I came to this book after reading ""Wonderful Life"" by Stephen Jay Gould, which served as an introduction, (biology was my academic weak suite) and ""Life, Inc."" by Douglass Rushkoff, which answers those questions in the very brief context of the last millennium or so. Wilson deals with the period in between.The book is well-structured. The details of the organizations of bees, termites, ants and the other eusocial beings gets to be a little long, for me, but might be just right for anyone else. He leads you to the conclusions that he spells out in chapters 20 through 27.I recommend this book to any intelligent person."

As a lay reader without much biology background, quite a few sections got too technical for me to enjoy them. However, the main points were interesting. The author describes how rather than evolution being about individual selection (survival of the fittest people) it was about group selection (survival of the fittest groups), and explains how our species lives in two realms that are constantly in tension: the group realm of selflessness and cooperation, and the individual realm of selfishness. Except for the fact that he got a bit more scientific than I was looking for, the concepts are pretty great. He also gets into the origins of religion, language, and where the world is going. If you've never read an evolution book before, this is still a pretty cool place to start."

The book explores in both great depth and accessibility social evolution as shaping force of human nature, language, culture,morality & honor, religion, and creative arts.

It is also a nice challenge to kinship theory. It describes the process humans took toward eusociality and it's a nice primer on cultural and social evolution, but it's all over the place and veers off at the end into climate change and anti-religion without supporting any of it. I'm not saying that those suggestions are bad, but the end just came out of nowhere. It was sort of like--ok, I'm done and by the way, here are a few things that bug me..."

Pagine 330. 15,24 €Edward O. Wilson è un vecchio signore del Sud (è nato a Birmingham in Alabama il 10 giugno 1929 – a proposito, auguri in ritardo!). Ne abbiamo parlato più volte su questo blog, da ultimo qui (mi pare), ma soprattutto recensendo il suo unico romanzo, Anthill. Purtroppo, ho letto gli altri suoi libri in epoca ante-blog e quindi non li ho recensiti qui (né da nessuna altra parte, perché non mi imponevo quella forma di disciplina che il blog ha portato con sé).Ho però raccontato, nella recensione al romanzo, che questo vecchio signore del Sud dall’aria serena è stato al centro di furiose polemiche per il suo Sociobiology. The New Synthesis del 1975. Adesso è di nuovo al centro delle polemiche per questo libro che, nelle sue intenzioni, voleva essere una sintesi dei suoi studi sugli organismi eu-sociali – come li chiama lui stesso – cioè gli insetti sociali e gli umani.Il problema è che per fare questo, Wilson ha bisogno di rigettare la teoria della kin selection originariamente formulata da Hamilton e cui Wilson stesso aveva aderito all’epoca di Sociobiology e aderire invece a quella della group selection, vivacemente e ferocemente avversata dai darwiniani puri e duri.Sorgono spontanee 2 domande: chi ha ragione nella disputa, Wilson o i suoi oppositori? o meglio: è sostenibile una teoria della group selection? e quella della kin selection è davvero stata smentita? nell’ipotesi che il libro di Wilson sia affetto da errori teorici gravi, vale la pena egualmente di leggerlo?* * *Sulla prima questione, per affrontarla senza troppi tecnicismi, penso sia opportuno partire dal punto specifico del libro di Wilson in cui l’autore abbandona la prospettiva della kin selection: For almost half a century, it has been popular among serious scientists seeking a naturalistic explanation for the origin of humanity, I among them, to invoke kin selection as a key dynamical force of human evolution. […] Unfortunately for this perception, the foundations of the general theory of inclusive fitness based on the assumptions of kin selection have crumbled, while evidence for it has grown equivocal at best. The beautiful theory never worked well anyway, and now it has collapsed. A new theory of eusocial evolution, drawn in part from my collaboration with the theoretical biologists Martin Nowak and Corina Tarnita, and in part from the work of other researchers, provides separate accounts for the origin of eusocial insects on the one hand and the origin of human societies on the other. [859-866. Il riferimento è come di consueto alle posizioni sul Kindle]Naturalmente, abbandonare una posizione cui si era aderito in passato è perfettamente lecito: solo gli imbecilli, si dice, restano attaccati alle proprie idee contro ogni evidenza come patelle agli scogli. Quello che però Wilson non dice – e questo io lo trovo particolarmente grave in un libro rivolto al pubblico non specialistico – è che l’articolo di Nowak, Tarnita & Wilson “The evolution of eusociality“, pubblicato nel 2010 sul numero 466 di Nature, ha suscitato un vespaio di polemiche: sia perché l’articolo non sarebbe transitato attraverso il normale processo di peer review grazie all’autorevolezza di Wilson (succede anche a Nature, evidentemente), sia perché le conclusioni cui giunge sono state contestate da circa 150 scienziati in 5 risposte al paper di Nowak, Tarnita & Wilson. Quello che questi scienziati sostengono è che la teoria della kin selection e della inclusive fitness sono tutt’altro che crollate, come invece Wilson dà per assodato.Questo spiega ampiamente perché The Social Conquest of Earth sia stato accolto con molte critiche e poco entusiasmo. Ne riassumo qualcuna di quelle con cui sono entrato in contatto.Michael Gazzaniga sul Wall Street Journal del 6 aprile 2012 (Evolution Revolution) paragona la delusione provata leggendo quest’ultima prova di Wilson con quella che gli appassionati di jazz sono destinati a provare, prima o poi, per i loro beniamini: At a certain point in their careers, great jazz musicians are almost bound to disappoint their fans. Think of John Coltrane venturing into free jazz in the late 1960s or Miles Davis going electric a few years later. The vision that made them great the first time pushes them into new territory, and the magnitude of their early accomplishments – and the number of admirers they have attracted – makes their public’s sense of betrayal all the more bitter. All they can do is keep playing, undaunted by the dissent.La metafora jazzistica è anche funzionale a notare che (purtroppo) Wilson procede per improvvisazione, per grandi pennellate, nascondendoci il dettaglio del ragionamento che lo ha portato ad abbandonare il modello della inclusive fitness. ed evitando di rispondere alle critiche dei 150 scienziati che hanno contestato il suo modello su Nature. Jazz artists improvise. Mr. Wilson does too as he goes through his argument in “The Social Conquest of Earth.” I say “improvise” because he chooses not to give the reader the complete story, properly annotated with references that would capture the huge controversies that accompany almost all the facts he reviews. […] While Mr. Wilson may have tired of all the rancor, it would have been intriguing to have his full account of how he arrived at his conclusions.Jennifer Schuessler sul New York Times dell’8 aprile, più che una recensione, ci offre un ritratto di Edward O. Wilson (Lessons From Ants to Grasp Humanity) che non rifugge però dal riassumere i termini della controversia: If no one is quite ready to dump a pitcher of water over Dr. Wilson’s head, many colleagues are mystified and dismayed by his late-life embrace of group selection – a highly controversial notion among biologists – and rejection of the kin-selection theory that he helped popularize in “Sociobiology.” “ ‘Sociobiology’ is still a very great book, and now he’s trashing it all,” said Jerry Coyne, a professor of ecology and evolution at the University of Chicago. “It’s crazy.” Dr. Coyne was one of more than 150 scientists who signed four letters published last spring in the journal Nature criticizing a 2010 paper by Dr. Wilson, written with the mathematicians Martin A. Nowak and Corina E. Tarnita, outlining his group-selection arguments. But Dr. Wilson, putting on a fleece vest under his professorial green tweed jacket in preparation for a rainy walk through Central Park, seemed unruffled by the fracas, which is only passingly acknowledged in the new book. “I don’t mind it,” he said of the criticism, adding that he had full confidence in his co-authors’ complex math. “I actually expect it for any important change. No pain, no gain.”Un concetto simile era già stato espresso da Wilson in un articolo di Jonah Lehrer comparso sul numero del 5 marzo 2012 del New Yorker (Kin and Kind. A fight about the genetics of altruism): “I’ve always been an ambitious synthesizer,” he told me. “But I’m now wise enough to know the limitations of that approach.” These days, he regards the books that made him famous – ”Sociobiology” and “On Human Nature” (1979) – as flawed accounts of evolution, marred by their uncritical embrace of inclusive fitness.La recensione di Steven Mithen – appena pubblicata su The New York Review of Books, nel numero datato 21 giugno 2012 (How Fit Is E.O. Wilson’s Evolution?) – ha il pregio, secondo me, di mettere chiaramente in luce le responsabilità dello scienziato che scrive per il vasto pubblico e non per gli specialisti e i colleghi: My greater concern is about the responsibility of the scientist writing for the general reader, especially a scientist of Wilson’s academic reputation. Such readers, the type targeted by Wilson and his publisher, may never have heard of Nature and would be unlikely to consult endnotes. Such readers, owing to his failure to acknowledge the extent of opposition to his views, would be entirely misled into thinking that Wilson had indeed “demonstrated that inclusive fitness theory, often called kin selection theory, is both mathematically and biologically incorrect.” […] I cannot avoid the impression that the manner in which Wilson presents his views verges toward polemic rather than providing a responsible work of popular science.Ho lasciato di proposito per ultima la recensione più completa, e anche la più feroce: quella di Richard Dawkins pubblicata su Prospectdel 24 maggio 2012 (The descent of Edward Wilson. A new book on evolution by a great biologist makes a slew of mistakes). Suggerirei, se il vostro inglese lo consente (ma se non lo consentisse probabilmente non leggereste questo blog), di leggere l’articolo di Dawkins nella sua interezza, per almeno 3 motivi: Dawkins scrive bene e in modo molto chiaro e articolato; Dawkins è un polemista pungente ed efficacissimo (a tratti uno prova anche un po’ pena per il malcapitato Wilson); La spiegazione di Dawkins dei motivi per cui ritiene corretta la teoria della kin selection ed erronea quella della group selection.Per i più pigri (e per mio gusto) metterò qui i punti essenziali: [I]it was a good idea to write a book comparing these two pinnacles of social evolution [social insects and humans], but unfortunately one is obliged to wade through many pages of erroneous and downright perverse misunderstandings of evolutionary theory. In particular, Wilson now rejects “kin selection” (I shall explain this below) and replaces it with a revival of “group selection” – the poorly defined and incoherent view that evolution is driven by the differential survival of whole groups of organisms. […] Then there’s the patrician hauteur with which Wilson ignores the very serious drubbing his Nature paper received. He doesn’t even mention those many critics: not a single, solitary sentence. Does he think his authority justifies going over the heads of experts and appealing directly to a popular audience, as if the professional controversy didn’t exist – as if acceptance of his (tiny) minority view were a done deal? “The beautiful theory [kin selection, see below] never worked well anyway, and now it has collapsed.” Yes it did and does work, and no it hasn’t collapsed. For Wilson not to acknowledge that he speaks for himself against the great majority of his professional colleagues is – it pains me to say this of a lifelong hero – an act of wanton arrogance. […] “Inclusive fitness” was coined as a mathematical device to allow us to keep treating the individual organism (“vehicle”) as the level of agency, when we could equivalently have switched to the gene (“replicator”). You can say that natural selection maximises individual inclusive fitness, or that it maximises gene survival. The two are equivalent, by definition. On the face of it, gene survival is simpler to deal with, so why bother with individual inclusive fitness? Because the organism has the appearance of a purpose-driven agent in a way that the gene does not. Genes lack legs to pursue goals, sense organs to perceive the world, hands to manipulate it. Gene survival is what ultimately counts in natural selection, and the world becomes full of genes that are good at surviving. But they do it vicariously, by embryologically programming “phenotypes”: programming the development of individual bodies, their brains, limbs and sense organs, in such a way as to maximise their own survival. Genes programme the embryonic development of their vehicles, then ride inside them to share their fate and, if successful, get passed on to future generations. So, “replicators” and “vehicles” constitute two meanings of “unit of natural selection.” Replicators are the units that survive (or fail to survive) through the generations. Vehicles are the agents that replicators programme as devices to help them survive. Genes are the primary replicators, organisms the obvious vehicles. But what about groups? As with organisms, they are certainly not replicators, but are they vehicles? If so, might we make a plausible case for “group selection”? It is important not to confuse this question – as Wilson regrettably does – with the question of whether individuals benefit from living in groups. Of course they do. Penguins huddle for warmth. That’s not group selection: every individual benefits. Lionesses hunting in groups catch more and larger prey than a lone hunter could: enough to make it worthwhile for everyone. Again, every individual benefits: group welfare is strictly incidental. Birds in flocks and fish in schools achieve safety in numbers, and may also conserve energy by riding each other’s slipstreams – the same effect as racing cyclists sometimes exploit. Such individual advantages in group living are important but they have nothing to do with group selection. Group selection would imply that a group does something equivalent to surviving or dying, something equivalent to reproducing itself, and that it has something you could call a group phenotype, such that genes might influence its development, and hence their own survival. […] Edward Wilson has made important discoveries of his own. His place in history is assured, and so is Hamilton’s. Please do read Wilson’s earlier books […]. As for the book under review, the theoretical errors I have explained are important, pervasive, and integral to its thesis in a way that renders it impossible to recommend. To borrow from Dorothy Parker, this is not a book to be tossed lightly aside. It should be thrown with great force. And sincere regret.* * *Ecco, Dawkins risponde negativamente alla mia seconda domanda (nell’ipotesi che il libro di Wilson sia affetto da errori teorici gravi, vale la pena egualmente di leggerlo?). Io sono però di diverso parere, e penso che invece possa essere letto fruttuosamnente, anche se con qualche cautela.Il breve capitolo 5, intitolato Threading the evolutionary maze, è un capolavoro di sintesi che riassume i 2 pagine l’origine dell’umanità da una prospettiva evoluzionistica.E la metafora del labirinto evoluzionistico è un efficacissiomo esempio di intuition pump: The possible evolution of a species can be visualized as a journey through a maze. As a major advance such as the origin of eusociality is approached, each genetic change, each turn in the maze either makes the attainment of that level less likely, or even impossible, or else keeps it open for access to the next turn. In the earliest steps that keep other options alive, there is still a long way to go, and the ultimate, far distant attainment is least probable. In the last few steps, there is only a short distance to go, and the attainment becomes more probable. The maze itself is subject to evolution along the way. Old corridors (ecological niches) may close, while new ones may open. The structure of the maze depends in part on who is traveling through it, including each of the species. [414]Ma nel libro ci sono anche altri spunti profondi, che aprono vaste prospettive di riflessione. Ad esempio sulla divisione del lavoro, all’origine della crescita economica e del progresso: Along with fireside campsites came division of labor. It was spring-loaded: an existing predisposition within groups to self-organize by dominance hierarchies already existed. There were in addition earlier differences between males and females and between young and old. Further, within each subgroup there existed variations in leadership ability, as well as in the proneness to remain at the campsite. The inevitable result emerging quickly out of all these preadaptations was a complex division of labor. [811]O la riflessione che, l’acquisto di informazione ha un costo, la sua perdita è gratis: For the neuroscientist, this explanation of an ethical decision by the would-be knifer has one very attractive feature: it involves only the loss of information, not its effortful acquisition or storage. The learning of complex information and its storage in memory are deliberate, painstaking processes, but the loss of information seems to take place with no trouble at all. Damping any one of the many mechanisms involved in memory can explain the blurring of identity required by this theory. [3981]Ci sono poi le incursioni nei campi dell’economia … Additional studies suggest (but have not yet conclusively proved) that leveling is beneficial even for the most advanced modern societies. Those that do best for their citizens in quality of life, from education and medical care to crime control and collective self-esteem, also have the lowest income differential between the wealthiest and poorest citizens. Among twenty-three of the world’s wealthiest countries and individual U.S. states, according to an analysis in 2009 by Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett, Japan, the Nordic countries, and the U.S. state of New Hampshire have both the narrowest wealth differential and the highest average quality of life. At the bottom are the United Kingdom, Portugal, and the remainder of the United States. [4037]… della politica … If personal benefit from group memberships rises high enough or, alternatively, if selfish leaders can bend the colony to serve their personal interests, the members will be prone to altruism and conformity. Because all normal members have at least the capacity to reproduce, there is an inherent and irremediable conflict in human societies between natural selection at the individual level and natural selection at the group level. [911]… della religione … The evidence that lies before us in great abundance points to organized religion as an expression of tribalism. Every religion teaches its adherents that they are a special fellowship and that their creation story, moral precepts, and privilege from divine power are superior to those claimed in other religions. […] The goal of religions is submission to the will and common good of the tribe. [4186-4192] For outsiders openly to doubt such dogmas is regarded an invasion of privacy and a personal insult. For insiders to raise doubt is punishable heresy. [4197]… della musica … Patel has referred to music as a “transformative technology.” To the same degree as literacy and language itself, it has changed the way people see the world. Learning to play a musical instrument even alters the structure of the brain, from subcortical circuits that encode sound patterns to neural fibers that connect the two cerebral hemispheres and patterns of gray matter density in certain regions of the cerebral cortex. Music is powerful in its impact on human feeling and on the interpretation of events. It is extraordinarily complex in the neural circuits it employs, appearing to elicit emotion in at least six different brain mechanisms. [4583]Ci sono poi alcune frasi fulminanti nella loro profondità: […] from diversity comes opportunity […] [480] In a constantly changing world, we need the flexibility that only imperfection provides. [3887] […] prepared learning, the inborn propensity to learn something swiftly and decisively. [1009]E infine, “semplici” esempi di divertito “bello scrivere”. We have created a Star Wars civilization, with Stone Age emotions, medieval institutions, and godlike technology. [201] Now, except for behaving like apes much of the time and suffering genetically limited life spans, we are godlike. [4639] […] the response of Samuel Foote to John Montagu, fourth Earl of Sandwich, when warned that he would die either by venereal disease or by the hangman’s noose. Foote responded, “My Lord, that will depend upon whether I embrace your lordship’s mistress or your lordship’s morals.” [4028]* * *PS: mentre mi accingevo a esporre questo post sulla bacheca è sceso in campo (c"
51,0871404133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11509692-dave-schey,4,E.O. Wilson is a pleasure to read and clearly expresses his position in this book.
52,0871404133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8802881-sven-k-mmerer,4,"“Where do we come from? Who are we? Where are we going?” - These are the questions that E. O. Wilson addresses in this book. E. O. Wilson is a biologist and, taking the stance that while the “answer to the existential questions must lie in history”, “history itself is truncated, in both timeline and it’s perception of the human organism. History makes no sense without prehistory, and prehistory makes no sense without biology.” Hence E. O. Wilson posits that as “humanity is a biological species in a biological world” human lives and their developments are inevitably restrained by one law of biology, namely that “all of life’s entities and processes have arisen through evolution by natural selection”.How exactly that worked is described by E. O. Wilson in great detail in this book. He starts billions of years back and compellingly summarizes research to explain how we got to where we currently are, what makes us who we are, and why we have turned out this way. As such it is a very interesting read.I am no biologist and cannot judge on E. O. Wilson’s most adamant claim that the existing evolutionary theory of kin selection is faulty – that it is on the other hand multilevel selection which has been at works to get us to become the eusocial homo sapiens that we are. Wilson's baby, multilevel selection, is described as a two step evolutionary process: “at the higher level (…) groups compete with groups, favoring cooperative social traits among members of the same group. At the lower level, members of the same group compete with one another in a manner that leads to self-serving behavior.”While I am not able to take up arms in the kin selection vs multilevel selection battle due to my own scientific ignorance I can say that – especially after reading Richard Dawkin’s vicious critique of E. O. Wilson’s work – I do tend to lean towards the Wilson side of things. Dawkin’s critique, which is avalaible here http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/sci... appears at first convincing, however the answer of E. O. Wilson (below the article) and especially the scientific debate by the researchers battling each other in the comments below the article tells me that E. O. Wilson is on the right track. Ultimately however, I tend to favor Wilson over Dawkin because of a feeling in my gut: I feel that Wilson is right, and if you listen to yourself carefully, you will feel it, too: It is multilevel selection’s beautiful ability to explain why we human beings are facing a constant struggle of selfish and altruistic behavior: “The opposition between the two levels of natural selection has resulted in a chimeric genotype in each person. It renders each of us part saint, part sinner.” Deep down, I guess we all know this is true. In a way, this book has helped me to understand myself and people around me better and has provided me a well working theory of why it is that we are the way we are. That alone makes the book recommendable, but it is not only that: The book’s discussion of human nature, culture, origins of language, morality, and religion make the book well worth reading as well. For a non-english native speaker the book can be quite tough to understand at times however, and I encourage you to take your time or get it in your native language. I’d like to close this review with my favorite excerpt from the book’s last chapter “A new enlightenment”. I choose this excerpt, which briefly summarizes E.O. Wilson’s thoughts on religion, ecosystem destruction and science, for I found myself nodding the entire time while reading it. “(…) humanity lives in a largely mythic, spirit-haunted world. We owe that to our early history. When our remote ancestors acquired a full recognition of their personal mortality, probably 100,000 to 75,000 years ago, they sought an explanation of who they were and the meaning of the world each was destined soon to leave. They must have asked, Where do the dead go? Into the spirit world, many believed. And how might we see them again? It was possible to do so at any time by dreams, or drugs, or magic, or self-inflicted privation and torture.The early humans had no knowledge of Earth beyond the reach of their territory and trading networks. They knew nothing of the sky beyond the celestial sphere on the inner surface across which travelled the sun, moon, and stars. To explain the mysteries of their existence, they believed in the superior beings otherwise like themselves, the divine ones who built not just stone tools and shelters but the whole universe. As chiefdoms and the political states evolved, the people imagined that supernatural rulers must exist in addition to the Earth-bound rulers they followed.The early humans needed a story of everything important that happened to them, because the conscious mind cannot work without stories and explanations of its own meaning. The best, the only way our forebears could manage to explain existence itself was a creation myth. And every creation myth, without exception, affirmed the superiority of the tribe that invented it over all other tribes. That much assumed, every religious believer saw himself as a chosen person.Organized religions and their gods, although conceived in ignorance of most of the real world, were unfortunately set in stone in early history. As in the beginning, they are everywhere still an expression of tribalism by which the members establish their own identity and special relation to the supernatural world. Their dogmas codify rules of behavior that the devout can accept absolutely without hesitation. To question the sacred myths is to question the identity and worth of those who believe in them. That is why skeptics, including those committed to different, equally absurd myths, are so righteously disliked. In some countries, they risk imprisonment or death.Yet the same biological and historical circumstances that led us into the sloughs of ignorance have in other ways served humanity well. Organized religions preside over the rites of passage, from birth to maturity, from marriage to death. They offer the best a tribe has to offer: a committed community that gives heartfelt emotional support, and welcomes, and forgives. Beliefs in the gods, whether single or multiple, sacralize communal actions, including the appointment of leaders, obedience to laws, and declarations of war. Beliefs in immortality and ultimate divine justice give priceless comfort, and they steel resolution and bravery in difficult times. For millennia, organized religions have been the source of much of the best in creative arts.Why, then, is it wise openly to question the myths and gods of organized religions? Because they are stultifying and divisive. Because each is just one version of a competing multitude of scenarios that possibly can be true. Because they encourage ignorance, distract people from recognizing problems of the real world, and often lead them in wrong directions into disastrous actions. True to their biological origins, they passionately encourage altruism with their membership and systematically extend it to outsiders, albeit usually with the additional aim of proselytization. Commitment to a particular faith is by definition religious bigotry. No Protestant missionary ever advises his flock to consider Roman Catholicism or Islam as a possibly superior alternative. He must by implication declare them inferior. Yet it is foolish to think that organized religions can be pulled up anytime soon by their deep roots and replaced with a rationalist passion for morality. More likely it will happen gradually, as it is occurring in Europe, pushed along by several ongoing trends. The most potent of the trends is the increasingly detailed scientific reconstruction of religious belief as an. evolutionary biological product. When placed in opposition, to creation myths and their theological excesses, the reconstruction is increasingly persuasive to any even slightly open mind. Another trend against the misadventure of sectarian devotion is the growth of the internet and the globalization of institutions and people using it. A recent analysis has shown that the increasing interconnection of people worldwide strengthens their cosmopolitan attitudes. It does so by weakening the relevance of ethnicity, locality, and nationhood, as sources of identification. It enhances a second trend, the homogenization of humanity in race and ethnicity through intermarriage. Inevitably, it will weaken confidence in creation myths and sectarian dogmas.A good, first step toward the liberation of humanity from the oppressive forms of tribalism would be to repudiate, respectfully, the claims of those in power who say they speak for God, are a special representative of God, or have exclusive knowledge of God’s divine will. Included, among these purveyors of theological narcissism are would-be prophets, the founders of religious cults, impassioned evangelical ministers, ayatollahs, imams of the grand mosques, chief rabbis, Rosh yeshivas, the Dalai Lama, and the pope. The same is true for dogmatic political ideologies based on unchallengeable precepts, left or right, and especially where justified with the dogmas of organized religions. They may contain intuitive wisdom worth, hearing. Their leaders may mean well. But humanity has suffered enough from grossly inaccurate history told by mistaken prophets.(…)Another argument, for a new Enlightenment is that we are alone on this planet with whatever reason and understanding, we can muster, and hence solely responsible for our actions as a species. The planet we have conquered is not just a stop along the way to a better world out there in some other dimension. Surely one moral precept we can agree on is to stop destroying our birthplace, the only home humanity will ever have. The evidence for climate warming, with industrial pollution as the principal cause, is now overwhelming. Also evident upon even casual inspection is the rapid disappearance of tropical forests and grasslands and other habitats where most of the diversity of life exists. If global changes caused by HIPPO (Habitat destruction, Invasive species, Pollution, Overpopulation, and Overharvesting, in that order of importance) are not abated, half the species, of plants and animals could be extinct or at least among the “living dead” — about to become extinct — by the end of the century. We are needlessly turning the gold we inherited from our forebears into straw, and for that we will be despised by our descendants.The obliteration of biodiversity in the living world has received much less attention than climate changes, depletion of irreplaceable resources, and other transformations of the physical environment. It would be wise to observe the following principle: if we save the living world, we will also automatically save the physical world, because in order to achieve the first we must also achieve the second. But if we save only the physical, world, which appears our present inclination, we will ultimately lose them both. Until recently there existed many kinds of birds we will never again see fly. Gone are frogs we will never again hear calling on warm rainy nights. Gone are fish flashing silver in our impoverished lakes and streams.It will be useful in taking a second look at science and religion to understand the true nature of the search for objective truth. Science is not just another enterprise like medicine or engineering or theology. It is the wellspring of all the knowledge we have of the real world that can be tested and fitted to preexisting knowledge. It is the arsenal of technologies and inferential mathematics needed to distinguish the true from the false. It formulates the principles and formulas that tie all this knowledge together. Science belongs to everybody. Its constituent parts can be challenged by anybody in the world, who has sufficient information to do so. It is not just “another way of knowing” as often claimed, making it coequal with religious faith. The conflict between scientific knowledge and the teachings of organized religions is irreconcilable. The chasm will continue to widen and cause no end of trouble as long as religious leaders go on making unsupportable claims about supernatural causes of reality.”"
53,0871404133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15604468-nick,4,"I feel like EO Wilson is trying to do two things in The Social Conquest of Earth 2012. One is to defend multilevel selection versus individual genetic selection by using ants, bees, and termites as examples of eusocial species and the compare/contrast them to humans. The second thing is to demonstrate that humans really are altruistic/eusocial on a real level because the mechanism of group selection operates on us at a genetic level. Back in the 1970s when he coined the term sociobiology Wilson was a proponent of individual inclusive fitness. Inclusive fitness is the view that natural selection acts on the level of genes which through the vehicle of the individual organism aim to pass themselves on to the next generation. The two forms of altruism that can occur with inclusive fitness are kin selection, direct benefit to relatives who share genes by different degrees, and reciprocal altruism in which one helps others for benefit in return, “you scratch my back I’ll scratch yours.” Group selection also operates at a genetic level but sees genes as influencing individual behavior toward their social group which is a unit selected for genetic expression. Group selection was more widely accepted before the 1960s and 1970s when mathematical models of individual fitness proved themselves more useful. Since the 1990s however a repackaging of group selection has come about called multilevel selection, proposed by David Sloan Wilson (no relation to EO Wilson). Selection does occur on the individual level, but can also occur on the group level under certain conditions, hence multilevel. Genes they would argue already operate on different levels on individuals, whether it be protein formation or eye color. If groups are a concrete enough influence and compete with one another, then genes can be selected for individuals which orient them to the good of the group. Wilson seems to have switched his position because of his work with ant colonies and what to him seems to be research conflicting with inclusive fitness. The case for multilevel selection as existing at all is the most interesting even for those who disagree. The best parts of the book are the middle and latter parts which discusses eusocial colonies. Eusocial means “true social”; organisms which behave and sacrifice their lives for the good of others. Hymenoptera (bees, wasps, termites, ants) are the best example of eusocial organisms in which their many members cooperate for the good of the hive/colony, sacrificing themselves in defense and not breeding, only the queen doing so. But as Wilson points out most organisms and even most insects aren’t eusocial. “The twenty thousand known species of eusocial insects, mostly ants bees wasps and termites, account for only 2 percent of the approximately one million known species of insects. Yet this tiny minority of species dominate the rest of the insects in their numbers, their weight, and their impact on the environment.” Eusociality is rare, but if the conditions are met, it can be very advantageous. So what are the conditions for eusociality? There are two important preliminary steps: 1) a defensible nest, and, 2) multigenerational division of labor. Birds make the first step of having nests, but don’t stay around the young long enough for step 2. In an ant colony the queen stays and the workers forage for food. Multigenerational living is what creates the group. The parents or older generations stay with the young past childhood and exert a greater influence, create stronger bonds. Eusociality works because everyone in the colony is related, born of the queen. The insects aren’t altruistic the we think of it, they are really the “robotic extension of the mother’s genome.” The ants are the extended phenotype of the queen. A home to return to gives an incentive to work together, dividing the labor, as some must maintain the home and others to find food. Wilson admits this isn’t the altruism we think of, which is on the individual level and toward strangers for no benefit to the individual and instead a cost. But it demonstrates to him the possibility of the group level of selection. Eusociality has further steps to become adaptive. 1) formation of groups 2) nest 3) alleles for eusocial traits 4) favorable environmental forces 5) group selection sufficient to produce changes. The third step is very important, the alleles which are altruistic must be capable of genetic selection. Flexible alleles capable of different expression help the division of labor. For these alleles to be selected favorable environmental forces must be present. Wilson says that for humans these are large body size and limited mobility which make us dependent on each other. We need protection when traveling as we don’t go very fast on two legs, and females can’t easily leave and start their own family because of their limited mobility as well as that of the infant which can’t walk for at least a year. It takes a while to develop our big brains, so we go through a long period of physical dependency on others.For vertebrates eusociality is extremely uncommon. Only the naked mole rat and, Wilson claims, humans have made it to true sociality. The case for human eusociality doesn’t actually begin with our big brains, as there isn’t a strong correlation between brain size and eusocial behavior. Apes are quite smart and have rudimentary social communication but aren’t truly altruistic. So what are the causes/evidence for humans being eusocial? Humans have defensible campsites as well as multigenerational living. Having campsites is something predatory carnivore species like wolves and lions have, to return to after hunting and to protect offspring when away. Humans stuck around for a long time after the birth of children to raise them to maturity, which takes a long time. The argument is really that the transition to hunting life with the challenges of the last ice age are what changed us from a primate social order to eusociality because of a home base, greater male cooperation and investment in offspring, women raising children for a long period of time, growing brain size enabled by all of this and finally technological innovation with the control of fire and later agriculture. Humans live in social groups, though these were much smaller in Paleolithic times, 30 to 100. Likely it was that everybody in the group was related and being social also means excluding as well as including; non-kin. Having multigenerational living, an extended family, with a basic division of labor would be the factors inducing eusociality. William Hamilton came up with the famous formula for inclusive fitness, rb>c; the degree of kinship to the altruist times the benefit to the recipient must be greater than the cost to the altruist for altruistic behavior to occur. Wilson reverses the equation and argues that sometimes organisms cooperate not because they are related genetically, but are related because they cooperate. The incentive for developing group selection is competition with other groups. If certain traits allow the group to outcompete another group for resource conflict, then they will pass their genes on. The criticism Wilson sort of touches on is how the hell does an organism know it’s degree of relatedness to others? Also do organisms calculate the costs and benefits of every action? Most of this behavior in social encounters occurs without conscious choice, so something else is operating. It is genetic selection, but of what kind? The example in the book is the Westermarck effect; we aren’t as sexually attracted to people we grow up with. This is an example of behavior evolved for a specific social purpose which benefits the species, preventing incest. The effect applies to even non-kin if one is raised in close enough proximity early on. It is a pro-social adaptation which can operate without even knowledge of genetic relatedness. What Wilson wants to argue for humans is that human altruism is genuine, rooted in our genes, and not just from relatedness or an extended phenotype. What seems to be going on is what is called coercive empathy or negative altruism. Emotions of stress and anger are produced when acting in certain nonadaptive selfish ways, so that one literally feels the pain inflicted onto others. Presumably this has to do with proposed mirror neurons which activate the same areas of the brain for certain activities we observe in others. The amygdala emotionally charges memories of our earliest relationships which form attachment patterns later in life. We feel pleasure at the punishment of those who don’t follow our expectations of behavior towards other, displacing our own anxieties which in turn reinforces our own expectations. All this is prior to the rational judgement of the cerebral cortex, which is above the amygdala-limbic system and evolved later. Some physiological adaptations like a visible white sclera, crying, and blushing make shame easier to induce as our emotions tend to follow what our body is doing. Individuals and groups would have their genes passed on because of these mechanisms/behaviors which benefit us in our social lives, rather than the genetic advantage leading us to as unconscious Machiavellians to manipulate people’s emotions.I find myself in agreement with multilevel selection. It is compatible with the neo-darwinism synthesis and with inclusive fitness."
54,0871404133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,4,"Stephen Pinker recently wrote an essay (on the site edge.org) titled ""The False Allure of Group Selection"". It is probably safe to say that no major newsmedia carried the story, but amongst the intellectual elite (and I use that term without any trace of irony), it was a shot heard 'round the world. Richard Dawkins (pro), Jonathan Haidt (con), Daniel Dennett (mostly pro), and a host of others weighed in. Not just on edge.org; the Social Evolution Forum also saw an explosion of responses.What was Pinker so worked up about, to necessitate such a forceful (and, for a web essay, rather lengthy) statement of disapproval? What was the reason so many others who think about Important Ideas felt the urge to stop what they were doing and proclaim their opinions one way or the other?The short answer is: this guy, and this book.Why? First, let's talk about the book, what it says and who is saying it.E.O.Wilson has been the subject of controversy before. Essentially because he believed that genes influence culture, at a time (the 1970's) when anything but a ""blank slate"" approach to human culture smacked of eugenics, he was doused with a pitcher of water when speaking at the 1978 conference of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. His best known book is probably ""Sociobiology"", but he is also known as a leading scientist in the study of ants. He is one of the primary proponents of the idea that an ant colony is often best thought of as a single organism, with natural selection applying to the colony as a whole.In ""The Social Conquest of Earth"", Wilson's ant background comes up again, as he takes us in the early chapters through what is known about how ants (and bees and termites and other social insects) came to be what is sometimes called ""eusocial"". Unlike herds of ungulates or schools of fish, social insects don't just cluster together, they do so in ways that involve unmistakeable altruism. Many, even most, individuals give up even the opportunity to reproduce, which seems to be something of a unique challenge to the Darwinian theory of natural selection.Wilson's theory asserts that the most important driver in the evolution of eusociality is defense of a shared nest. Once multiple individuals share the same nest (perhaps simply because the instinct of the young to leave when they grow up is deficient), he asserts that evolution can undergo a bit of a phase transition. No longer does a random mutation have to benefit the one who has it, in order to be passed down; it can benefit the ones who are nearby, since they are working to defend (and perhaps to expand) the same nest.This seemingly simple change leads us into the realm of group selection, and once we are there, someone like Stephen Pinker or Richard Dawkins may dump a pitcher of water on our head (no, not really, only metaphorically). Group selection is the idea that natural selection may operate on the level of groups, not just individuals.In some ways, this is surprising. Richard Dawkins was the primary early advocate of the idea of the ""selfish gene""; of the idea that natural selection might favor certain genes, irrespective of whether or not they were good for the entire organism. This would make natural selection among individual organisms already a bit of a group selection, wouldn't it? If natural selection can operate at both the level of the gene and the level of the individual, then adding a third level (the group) doesn't seem so revolutionary.Stephen Pinker, for his part, has written about how humans are NOT a blank slate (in his book called ""The Blank Slate""), and how the way humans live in groups has changed over time towards less and less violent behavior (""The Better Angels of Our Nature""), with at least a nod towards the idea that some of the reason might be genetic selection (a propensity towards getting into violent conflict being a lot less advantageous in a modern city with the rule of law, than it was in the prehistoric African savannah).What Wilson thinks is important about group selection, is that it can explain a great deal of human nature, those traits or behavior that make humans different (at least by degree) than other mammals, and even other primates. He lists these in the chapter titles of the penultimate section, which is titled ""What Are We?""- What Is Human Nature?- How Culture Evolved- The Origins of Language- The Evolution of Cultural Variation- The Origins of Morality and Honor- The Origins of Religion- The Origins of the Creative ArtsThere it is, the next to last one, slipped in there quietly, not put at the end where it might draw too much attention to itself. It did, I think, nonetheless. Don't get me wrong; Wilson proclaims himself devoid of religion, and believes we will eventually outgrow it. However, by pointing out how group selection might favor the development of religion (by making the members of the group more likely to work towards the good of the group and less likely to sell it out for personal gain), Wilson contributes to a quiet but growing unease which is spreading amongst the New Atheists.Science seems to be providing reasons for the existance of religion.This is a very recent trend. Science has long had to defer to the religious sensibilities of the powerful (or numerous). People like Galileo and Darwin are known and revered among pro-science atheists as much for the fact that they incurred religious disfavor as for their theoretical advances. But, until a decade ago or so, scientists either denounced religion, kept their mouth shut about it, or (like Stephen Jay Gould and Carl Sagan) tried to negotiate a sort of armistice in which each side would leave the other's field alone.But more recently, a few scientists have begun to turn the instruments of science on religion itself. Not the claims of religion (creationism and past lives and so forth), but the phenomenon of religion itself. This kind of study is still new, but it has already revealed a few things:1) there is at least a partial genetic basis for religiousity. What religion you have is mostly cultural, but how religious you are seems to be inherited genetically (this has been demonstrated by comparing identical twins, fraternal twins, siblings, half-siblings, and adopted siblings)2) religion makes people more likely to trust each other (but only if they are of the same religion). Most disturbingly, atheists are not more likely to trust each other, or to be worthy of that trust in laboratory studies that offer the opportunity for subjects to either betray or not betray other subjects. In other words, people of the same religion can trust each other in a way that atheists cannot.Put these two facts together (and there is a lot more that has been learned), and you have an explanation of how religiousity is advantageous from the standpoint of group selection. If a religious group can shame or expel traitors and work together better than non-religious groups, and if the tendency towards religiousity is at least significantly genetic in nature, then the New Atheist dream of an end to religion is a fantasy. In fact, it might even suggest that the claims of conservatives that undermining religious belief will lead to a breakdown of society...could have a bit of truth to it?If you want to really hack off people like Stephen Pinker and Richard Dawkins, you not only give a justification of religion, you use the theory of evolution to do it. If you are, moreover, a quite prominent biologist and professor emeritus of Harvard, then it will add to this the sting of betrayal of the group, apostasy among the non-believers. It's not the sort of thing that will change anyone's mind today, or this year, but intellectuals are (almost by definition) believers in the power of an idea. If it is not clear that religion is just superstitious nonsense, but perhaps an advantageous adaptation, then you cannot count on the next generation of scientists being as solidly in the non-religious camp as the current one.E.O.Wilson is, again, not a religious man. In fact, in his final chapter he states that he thinks religion is too tribal, too divisive, and hopes that it will fade away with the passage of time. But, whether he believes this or not, Pinker, Dawkins, and the rest are not amused or placated. Group selection is an idea which, if true, threatens to make the last two decades of progress in pushing atheism into the mainstream moot, if not even dangerous. They have this idea squarely in their sights, and will throw everything they've got at it. ""Dangerous Allure"", Stephen Pinker called it; well he should.In some ways Wilson's book, for standing at the center of such a high-powered battle of intellects and ideas, is disappointingly un-revolutionary in tone. But it is no less significant for that, and Wilson's writing style is engaging and friendly. If you want to read something that is, in the most literal sense of the term, thought-provoking, ""The Social Conquest of Earth"" is for you."
55,0871404133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25096689-ng-yihang,5,"Edward Wilson's ""The Social Conquest of Earth"" is an ambitious work that delves into the first principles of the human condition - how we originated as a species, how evolution shaped our physical, mental, and cultural characteristics, and how humanity is likely to develop in the future. It is metaphysics - with ants. Wilson's contribution to multi-layered evolutionary pressures - acting concurrently on individual-levels and group-levels; and the attendant conflict between the two (i.e. individual pressures encourage selfish behaviour while group-level pressures encourage altruistic, cooperative behaviours, and both operate at the same time) is extremely interesting - especially how this dichotomy shapes the structuring of human society, our internal struggles of good vs. evil, and how it affects the development of morality. Likewise, his linkages to insect societies (especially ants - his domain of expertise as a celebrated entomologist) to make his point on eusociality (i.e. complex social systems that have arisen in certain rare species - mostly thanks to a defensible nest) is remarkable and refreshing. This constant reference to ants - an easily overlooked pest - really drives home the point that despite the lack of existing counterfactuals to Earthborn organisms, we can still derive many lessons about the human condition from existing, unassuming species (which are way more complex than is commonly thought). More fundamentally, the book has this profound ability to erode anthropocentric mindsets. It posits humanity as a byproduct of evolution, of which it has taken a number of improbable, winding pathways (""the extreme improbability of ... preadaptations necessary [for] the human condition... to occur at all""). By tracing the human condition backwards - our culture, our psychology, our language - to first principles and ultimate causes, Wilson takes potshots at many myths along the way - human self-centeredness, the importance of culture in shaping the human condition, the tribalism that is religiosity, and free will (gasp). There is also a nice section on how humanity only really enjoys a small sliver of reality due to our limited perception in color, sound and smell. Overall, Wilson's book is a tour de force representative of a lifetime's work in entomology, sociobiology, and the study of evolution. It might - at first sight - seem like easy reading especially with his conversational style and short, handy chapters, but it is deceptively chock full of ideas. There are many times when I had to re-read certain sections to understand his points. Nonetheless, it was well worth the effort."
56,0871404133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4867998-abby,3,"Salient points:*Genetically, we’re programmed for both cooperation (group fitness) and competition (individual fitness), which means that our evolutionary legacy is both ""good"" and ""bad"" traits. (This is called ""multi-level selection"" and in the last decade has replaced the prevalent theory of ""inclusive-fitness"" or ""kin"" selection a la Dawkins's The Selfish Gene.)*“An iron rule exists in genetic social evolution. It is that selfish individuals beat altruistic individuals, while groups of altruists beat groups of selfish individuals. The victory can never be complete; the balance of selection pressures cannot move to either extreme. If individual selection were to dominate, societies would dissolve. If group selection were to dominate, human groups would come to resemble ant colonies.”*Eusociality = cooperative brood care, overlapping generations within a colony of adults, and a division of labor into reproductive and non-reproductive groups. Many evolutionary steps lead to this kind of civilization, so it's extremely rare among living things. We share this quality with certain kinds of insects like ants and bees. (Some scientists argue that humans aren't necessarily “eusocial” because we don’t have division of reproductive labor; still, unarguably we're highly developed socially.)*Humans are intensely tribal. Religion/mythmaking is an expression of tribalism and an evolutionary development to keep tribes together.* “A good first step toward the liberation of humanity from the oppressive forms of tribalism would be to repudiate, respectfully, the claims of those in power who say they speak for God, are a special representative of God, or have exclusive knowledge of God’s divine will.” AMEN.* “Earth, by the twenty-second century, can be turned, if we so wish, into a permanent paradise for human beings, or at least the strong beginnings of one. . . .out of an ethic of simple decency to one another, the unrelenting application of reason, and acceptance of what we truly are”E.O. Wilson is probably the king of sociobiology. Personally, I'm less keen on the nitty-gritty genetics, so my attention flagged in the middle of the book. I also felt like there was a lot of repetition--maybe how an article in a science journal would read. I'd recommend this if you're truly interested in the science and pick something else if you're not. I learned a lot from primatologist Frans de Waal."
57,0871404133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46928987-charlyd,3,"This book opened with a history of Gauguin's painting ""Where Are We From?/Who Are We?/Where Are We Going? (D'ou Venons Nous / Que Sommes Nous / Ou Allons Nous). The prologue included this description of the painting by Gauguin:""The idol is there not as a literary explanation, but as a statue, less statue perhaps than the animal figures; less animal too, becoming one in my dream, in front of my hut, with the whole of nature, dominating our primitive soul, the imaginary consolation of our sufferings and what they contain of the value and the uncomprehending before the mystery of our origins and our future."" (Gauguin's emphasis)This quote left me excited to take a deep dive into the mystery and beauty of the questions asked by the title of that painting. Mr. Wilson is an accomplished scientist who feels that all knowledge must have a firm foundation in science. In the remainder of the book the author attempts to address the questions of the painting's title applying extensive use of his skills and knowledge as an entomologist but very little speculation.In one section, he offers a detailed description of the evolution of eusocial (cooperative, altruistic) societies in insects. While wading through the complex science described in this section, I had difficulty understating the pertinence of that science to humans. At the conclusion of that section, Mr. Wilson offers that some particular major steps listed in that evolutionary process do not apply to humans. I was very interested to learn of the particular aspects of homo sapiens that allowed our species to become the pinnacle of evolution and how those aspects were developed. Mr. Wilson does provide many details of the evolution of our species but that history is presented as a slow, natural selection process over millennia without a major transition.The capacity for abstract thought was briefly described in a single paragraph with no description of the evolution of that capacity. The effects of attaining that capability were listed as birth of ""the first true, productive language, constructed from arbitrary words and symbols. Language was followed by visual art, music, dance and the ceremonies and rituals of religion."" This development should have been a central focus of the book."
58,0871404133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5338819-ed-bernard,3,"Maybe 3.5 starsEO Wilson is a towering, and occasionally controversial, scientific figure – I studied his work in college 40 years ago. This book summarizes his thoughts on the current state of his field – what he used to call “Sociobiology” but is now generally referred to as Evolutionary Biology. Like several science books I’ve listened to, this one suffers from being read aloud. There are a number of mathematically-based concepts and assorted other information that simply goes by too quickly for me (at least) to absorb. Nonetheless, this was a fascinating review. Wilson’s expertise is the insect world, where “eusociality” (the highest form of social behavior, according to Wilson) is surprisingly common (though still quite rare, which Wilson explains). He believes that the community for these insects actually represents a single organism, with individual insects being the equivalent of the many cells that make up a human being. He spends much of the second part of the book musing about scientific answers to fundamental human questions, as well as how evolutionary biology leads to art, culture, morality, language, etc., which was actually the least interesting part, at least to me. This is not typical for me – with other science books, I have to work my way through the science up front to get to the more thoughtful applications in the end. However, Wilson’s examples and descriptions of social behavior in insects is dazzling. An enjoyable book, marred by the author’s over-reach and the audiobook format.Grade: B"
59,0871404133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18061078-emma,4,"Wilson says that humans are eusocial, but any definition of ""eusocial"" broad enough to include humans also includes many other social species. Humans are highly social, but I don't think you can say they're 'one of the very few eusocial species' without a definition of eusocial that includes the majority of social animals. The conflict Wilson talks about a lot between individual competion and group selection prevents humans from being eusocial. In general he knows about insects (it's EO Wilson, of course he knows about insects) and humans but seems to forget about other vertebrates and takes some liberties that make humans look more unique than they actally are for the sake of the book. I found myself comparing his statements about humans to wolves, and he implied that humans were the first ones to do several social things that wolves have been doing for quite a while. As of now I am relatively convinced that kin selection doesn't matter much in the sense that its effect is probably always swamped by the more immediate fitness effects from group selection-- but I'm about to read some of the back-and-forth papers between Wilson et al and people defending the kin selection math, so we'll see if I'm still convinced after that. Either way group selection is definitely important; if your individual fitness relies on the success of the group, kin selection won't have anything to act on if you have no social/group promoting traits.
