0,038549517X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,4,"Of course, nobody really knows exactly, so that all research can just be based on assumptions, theories, hypothesis,... that are mixed with actual brain science, evolutionary psychology and well, large field studies. Just in theory, because no scientist gets the millions of funding to base her/his ideas on hard, provable facts so that we doubtfully enter the minefield of subjective assumptions.The subject is fascinating both in humans and animals and how it may evolve in the future with our senses changing and how women's´ minds and their ability to select and choose may develop in combination with AR, VR, genetic testing (""Give me your probe or leave, I won´t waste time dating someone who is a potential horrible genetic match."" ""Yes, Ma´am."" ""Don´t call me that and where are you going?"" ""You said you wanted a sample of..."" Not that, you perv idiot, just a saliva sample."" ""Oh, I see. Well, then..."" ""Not anymore!"") and bio-digital fusion, is interesting.Most of the book focuses on animal behavior and concludes that it have always been the females who made a species successful in preventing catastrophes by choosing carefully and mindfully. That might have been one of many reasons that evolution pimped brains and upgraded males, but Miller should have clearly differentiated that is was one of many, unknown driving forces and that is is impossible to name a clear favorite. To define horniness as the only motivation for art, science, charity, humor, interest in upbringing, humanities, everything, seems very far-fetched and I would say that many give a f*** (hoho, wordplay alert) and are just interested in the subject itself, not the groupies.There are some funny theories, not related to this book but worth mentioning in this context, about that nature might tend to make more experiments with the intelligence of males because it might get fatal when women where, well, as dumb as some men. I don´t know any numbers and this is so close to gender racism that there might never be any long-term studies done, but I love the picture of a kind of Gaia entity who orchestrates all evolutions and thinks: ""Doesn´t matter if many of the males are too stupid to survive, they aren´t important for the survival of the species, so I will instead fix the minimum intelligence for women to avoid problems."" To get highly subjective, I have really met much more stupid men than women and about the same amount of both species, so maybe there is really something behind it, who knows, duh, ""look, primary and secondary sexual characteristics, beer, sports and hordes of befriended males with lovely group dynamics, must go, it hardly ever ends in small disasters or world wars if we do that.""To take everything with a grain of salt and to not criticize authors who dare to risk to make hypotheses that could become true is important in this case. The problem might be that there are inherent dangers if one of those ideas gets too much media or even public attention and is misused or misinterpreted for one´s own agenda.It´s ingenious by Miller to interpret models of society, politics, and economics depending on his thesis, and mind games integrating evolutionary biology and psychology in sociology and history could be played much more often than just the isolated historical, psychological or political interpretations alone. It also shows how unscientific especially political theory and economics are, how weak the foundations must be that it is so easy to reliably question and reinterpret them without the possibility to negate it. An expert can cherrypick parts of those theories and built whatever she/he wants out of them, make epic battle disses or praises. Try to do this with an engine or in medicine, it will explode or kill the patient.It´s so funny that we eliminated natural selection and that now everybody is lying even more, because an ape or primitive human couldn´t fake smartness, success, etc. or get detailed tutorials by nasty pick-up artists and immoral personal coaches. No wonder women had to develop defense mechanisms against so much deception, falsehood, and virility. The best and most valid security for a women might be, as mentioned, gene tests, as long as males don´t have the option to manipulate their saliva, blood, etc. to seem fitter, but the evolutionary arms race of males trying to fake and delude women into mating may go on forever until we evolve into entities. And it might even continue then when it comes to creating new AIs. Why does anything in my reviews has to evolve to transhuman, superhuman, immortal status...I am highly biased and tend to jay to evolutionary and to meh at psychology, but try to stay objective.I truly don´t write far too wordy and adjectively reviews to seem smart and attractive to potential female mating partners. Damn it, Miller debunked me. Sigh. By the way, now that it doesn´t matter anymore, I am a 35 year old Austrian...A wiki walk can be as refreshing to the mind as a walk through nature in this completely overrated real life outside books:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mating_...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categor..."
1,038549517X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,3,"One way of looking at this book is that it claims women have been selectively breeding men for the last few hundred thousand years. They've prioritized intelligence, creativity, sensitivity and good parenting skills. And they've done a fine job. As Miller says, in an early chapter: a human male is about 100 times more likely to kill his stepchild than his biological child. Almost unbelievably good news for human stepchildren, if you for instance compare with male lions, who routinely kill the previous litter when they take a new mate. I happen to be male, but since exactly half of my ancestors are women, I don't see why I'm obliged to favor one side over the other. Thus, without being a gender traitor, I must say that, if Miller is correct, I'm entirely with the chicks. Unfortunately, I felt that his analysis was on the speculative side, with little hard evidence to back it up. A pity - I would so like to believe it was true. Of course, if Miller's theories are correct, it follows that he wrote the book mainly to impress potential mates, so it doesn't entirely matter whether it's correct or not. I'm curious to know whether female readers were turned on by his arguments. Ladies, what are your honest thoughts on this?"
2,038549517X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/290581-jonatron,3,"First off, I found this book very hard to read. Not because I'm illiterate, but because it just wasn't enjoyable. I've finally just finished it, 14 months after buying it, because I never felt like picking it up and reading another chapter. It feels as though he just restates the same ideas over and over again with too many words. (Though I suppose verbosity might be a good way to impress certain potential mates.)Despite the praise of science and the chapter's worth of references in the back, it felt less like a scientific exploration and more like a speculative argument, stating the conclusion first and then rounding up a bunch of evidence to back it up. I guess any evolutionary psychology book is going to sound mostly speculative, though.Though not engrossing, I didn't find much to disagree with. Simply put, he argues that most of the evolved behaviors that are unexplainable by kin selection or reciprocity can actually be explained by runaway sexual selection, in the same way as handicap fitness indicators in other animals like peacocks or bowerbirds. It takes a lot of energy, health, and control of natural resources to create art (or make money to buy art), learn a large vocabulary, write fiction, practice religion, give to charity, and so on, yet none of these things provide much of a direct survival benefit. The conclusion is that they serve mostly to impress potential mates and compete against other suitors.For example, he points out the way very rich and powerful people will volunteer their time to work at a soup kitchen for a day, when they could have used that time to earn money and pay a hundred other people to work in the soup kitchen for them. The primary reason for charity is to show off your helpfulness to potential mates, not to actually maximize the altruistic benefit to other people.In the conclusion, he talks about how science is a subversion of these natural instincts to push them towards other ends. This is a very useful idea, as is the idea of consciously manipulating equilibrium selection to push society towards a more desirable equilibrium, which I've also had kicking around in my head for a while, but didn't have a name for until now.His glossary definition of ""marriage"" is amusing: ""A socially legitimated sexual relationship in which sexual fidelity and parental responsibilities are maintained through the threat of social punishment.""Other favorite quotes: ""Existing political philosophies all developed before evolutionary game theory, so they do not take equilibrium selection into account. Socialism pretends that individuals are not selfish sexual competitors, so it ignores equilibria altogether. Conservatism pretends that there is only one possible equilibrium—a nostalgic version of the status quo—that society could play. Libertarianism ignores the possibility of equilibrium selection at the level of rational social discourse, and assumes that decentralized market dynamics will magically lead to equilibria that yield the highest aggregate social benefits. Far from being a scientific front for a particular set of political views, modern evolutionary psychology makes most standard views look simplistic and unimaginative.""""Scientific theories never dictate human values, but they can often cast new light on ethical issues. From a sexual selection viewpoint, moral philosophy and political theory have mostly been attempts to shift male human sexual competitiveness from physical violence to the peaceful accumulation of wealth and status. The rights to life, liberty, and property are cultural inventions that function, in part, to keep males from killing and stealing from one another while they compete to attract sexual partners."""
3,038549517X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/532334-jeroen,5,"If you want to know how sexual selection produces diversity and, in the case of the human species, our consciousness... Brilliant... For me it was the final piece in the puzzle for understanding human behaviour... And NO don't tell me Freud already said something about the importance for sexuality for human behaviour... First of all he said so much nonsense that there will always be something for someone to find... And second, his blabbering about sexuality doesn't even come close to the ray of light this book shines on the subject..."
4,038549517X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/196037-jrobertus,5,"This is one of the most important books I have read. The concept of sexual selection was proposed by Darwin himself, and he spent more time on it than on natural selection. His inspired insights have lain fallow for a century, but this book brings the matter up with panache. Miller makes a compelling case that much of human speech, artistic drive, morality, and wit resulted from sexual selection. By mechanisms similar to those clearly identified in other species, much of our mental activity serves as a general fitness display for mate choice. In addition to its high impact on my world view, this book is written for a popular audience and has a nice, engaging, style."
5,038549517X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3286533-jurij-fedorov,5,"Trully a great book. If you like philosophy and evolutionary psychology then this is a must read. I would recommend it for anyone with the intelligence and knowledge to understand it. It's not popular literature so don't think you can read it in one week. You have to think, read, think, read and repeat. Miller has created a timeless classic that is even more relevant today than it was in 2001. If you like intelligent books and like science and academia you will definitely love this one. Every second page is an intelligent mind blow."
6,038549517X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8882972-aarti,3,"There were many ideas expressed in this book that were new to me. The one that made the most impression was his theory that human nature has evolved due to a female's mate choice not the male's. Moral vision, language skills, humor, altruism are fitness indicators. He warn's that this is not a theory of ""subconscious motivation""(what can drive us) but evolutionary function( how it works). This is easy to confuse. His statement ""Human altruism is not an evolutionary paradox. It is a sexual ornament"", was powerful in explaining this idea. Toward's the end he also mentions playfulness/unpredictability as a fitness/youth indicator and talks a bit about game theory. I was hoping he would go further into it, and wasn't quite clear where he was taking this idea.It was good that he acknowledged that he may be biased in his views since he is writing from a male perspective, as I found some of his views on females traditional and simplistic. He repeats a lot. I wished the book was more concise. "
7,038549517X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,2,"Miller argues that most of what we see as distinctively human (i.e., products of our mind) are derived from females selecting intelligent males. Mind, Miller says in short, is a ""sexual ornament."" Miller does not discount adaptationist theory. Even though many of our traits evolved through sexual selection, they still had to pass the survival test (not be harmful for survival) and many, in fact, were later adapted for survival functions. Miller says that women selected intelligent males for mating purposes and thereby created the human mind as we know it. His approach is to work backwards from today and then explain how certain traits came to be. He says that women liked good story tellers, art and music, ""a wide vocabulary"" and ""poetic language,"" wit and imagination and that males therefore adopted these capacities in abundance. All in all, females found creative males ""delightful."" This is all a bit much, suggesting male serenades and harps and flutes, and males and females having fine cocktail conversation in the cave, over drinks with lifted little fingers.Miller says that life back then was not at all red in tooth and claw: ""It is a mistake to envision our hominid ancestors as bedraggled, dirty, shuffling, sniffling, unhealthy cave-dwellers. They lived outside on a sort of perpetual camping trip, and got a lot of exercise."" This sounds like Rousseau's vision of an idyllic past, but the basis for this picture is not evident. With that type of harmonic backdrop, it allows the author to argue that women back then checked out - at least in tropical climes - the males and selected those with large (relative to other primates) penises for mating purposes. Miller goes on to say that ""Some studies have shown that when a woman returns home from a long trip, her partner tends to produce a much larger ejaculate than normal, as if to overwhelm any competitor's sperm that may have found its way into his unwatched partner's vagina."" That explanation may be overthought. Perhaps after a long abstinence, the male is overly horny. If penises and sperm are not good enough, males can impress the females with their art, presuming that women didn't do artwork themselves, like baskets and beads and necklaces (as that would have no role in a female sexual selection theory). Miller then explains away the ""handaxe"" that dominated hominid tools for well over a million years, because he says the so-called ""killer frisbee hypothesis"" for killing large animals has ""not fared well,"" although we don't know why it's ""not fared well."" Rather, Miller theorizes, it was an art object, a ""sexual attractant."" Males are all about marketing themselves, he says. If not art, they engage (today) in ""ruthless sexual competition"" like mountain climbing, to impress women. That observation might catch a mountain climber who engages in his or her life and death challenges as more than slightly off beat, but Miller explains that objection away by stating that males do these competitions without really knowing why, because ""Evolution does that for us."" Miller argues that the adaptionist perspective cannot explain the higher human products of consciousness such as creative art and language. I don't know where that observation that comes from. Consciousness provides a significant advantage for survival - learning from experience, predicting the future and coordinating means and ends. Once consciousness moves into the abstract and representational realm, then creativity - once basic needs are met - can be applied to those finer things of life that Miller emphasizes. In other words, and similar to Pinker (?), the distinctive mental traits that Miller writes about can reasonably be viewed as byproducts of a brain that was designed for survival. Miller emphatically disagrees with this perspective, however. Miller's thesis is that intelligence attracts intelligence and this explains the progressive development of the human mind, save, perhaps, for the few hunter-gatherers that remain today. Relative to other animals, the human mental capacity is significant, but that is a different matter than stating that all humans are equally intelligent or that other functions, such as raw physical attraction, might override the finer impulses that Miller writes about.Moving beyond the intelligence thesis itself, Miller also argues that females selected males for their kindness and this is the basis for trust and our morality. Miller rightly criticizes kin selection theory when it extends itself in a sloppy seconds sort of way to explain reciprocal altruism. Miller says that kin selection violates its own principles in doing that. While he says that kin selection theory explains altruism toward blood relatives, it cannot jump the blood line to non-kin. Rather, he argues that women select for kindness. Waitresses know more about human kindness than most moral philosophers he asserts, as if quid pro quo tipping for service or making an impression on attractive waitresses represents the full domain of kindness. He also quotes a woman who expressed sexual admiration for Rockefeller's charity donations, but Miller says nothing about Rockefeller's extreme status and wealth as an alternative explanation for the attraction, something put there by evolution but something which she may not have been aware of or something she would have been able to comment on if she was aware of it. But on this subject of morality and human kindness, Miller might go back to the first section of Darwin's ""Descent"" which does a hefty job of explaining that the origin of our social instincts has everything to do with individual survival depending on being a member of a group. Miller's revitalization of Darwin's theory of sexual selection is eye opening. In many ways, it is a breath of fresh air as it gets the reader to think out of the box when it comes to evolutionary theory. Although Miller does not go this far, there's even a hint of a challenge to the standard mantra that evolution's ""goal"" is to move genes into the next generation. If sexual attraction is the driver for many of our distinctive traits, and so long as what we come up with in that regard is not harmful to survival, then reproduction of our genes might be but a byproduct of a far more immediate, tangible and arbitrary process. "
8,038549517X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2451237-jason,5,"I am always impressed when very smart people in very technical fields can effectively explain their work to the rest of us. Miller does this, and he does it in an entertaining (and sexy) way.What I was most impressed with was how compelling this book was, even when laying a foundation that included some things I already knew. Parts of the book even read like fiction, where I was intrigued to turn the page and find out where we were headed next. Miller does a very good job of explaining concepts in a clear and engaging manner, and his own excitement for the topic really comes through.Substantively, I'd say it felt like the first 2/3 of the book or so are setting up a foundation, while only the last 1/3 offers Miller's thesis/new ideas. My only criticism is that by the time we did get to the chapters on art, morality, and creative intelligence, it felt a little anti-climactic. However, this is largely because he had done such a good job in the set-up that I could anticipate exactly how it would be applied to each of these three areas. For the record, I would consider that a success. I was interested throughout the book, I felt persuaded (if not actually convinced) by the arguments, and I could follow Miller's logic as he constructed his theory.This book has everything from the basics of natural selection, to a (possible) explanation of the evolution of human sex organs, to a theory of sports and creativity as a mating tool. I don't know much about evolutionary psychology and its place in the science world, but this book makes me want to know more."
9,038549517X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/101404-natalie,2,"I got about 100 pages in. I just couldn't force myself to finish this before it's due at the library. Maybe I just wasn't in the right frame of mind to read this. But it just kept on getting frustrating. Miller kept on explaining and seemingly trying to prove a theory just to say ""but that's probably not right, so here, let me convince you of another theory just to say it's probably not right either."""
10,038549517X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9812427-blerina,5,"I have always been interested in psychology alone and watched more than read on evolution (David Attenborough's life series and the planet earth documentary series), but this book brings these two sciences together in a way that now I can hardly think of each of one separately. I'm new to evolutionary psychology but after reading this book this science sure tops my list of interests.Geoffrey Miller focuses on Darwin's sexual selection theory, how sexual preferences have driven the species to produce costly ornamentation of no survival relevance, which would be fitness indicators to attract a mate and procreate. The phenomena is explained by many examples from birds, primates and humans such as the Peacock's tail, the Bird of Paradise plumage and dancing skills, a nightingale's 1000 song repertoire, large vocabularies in humans, poetry, art and science, conspicuous charity and conspicuous consumption as wealth-indicators and displays to intimidate competitors.There are some lines of crude truth in the book that may come up as very cold, however they are indeed true, such as this ""Survival without reproduction means evolutionary oblivion"". This almost makes me drop out of my master course, forget about my future phd and go find someone to mate with so that I make sure my genes will not just die with me and my credentials. But then again, this paragraph keeps me still ""Science is not asexual or passionless, but neither is it a result of some crudely sublimated sex drive. Rather, it is one of our most sophisticated arenas for human courtship, which is the most complex and conscious form of matting that has ever evolved on our planet.""I loved this book, read it."
11,038549517X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/873611-angie,3,"This is a layman’s Anthropology book delving into the idea that mate selection could explain all of those inexplicable bits of human behavior like art, music, and language. Maybe humans all those 100’s of thousands of years ago preferred to mate with people who showed a special flair for these qualities just like peahens prefer to mate with peacocks with the most elaborate tails. It was a very interesting read, but I think I’d prefer a concise essay hitting the highpoints. In book form, it got a little long and overly detailed for my taste."
12,038549517X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22878608-jacob-o-connor,5,"I recently picked this book back up to do some research.  I read it a few years ago.  I really enjoyed it, and I still quote from it often.Geoffrey Miller is an evolutionary psychologist.  This is a new approach to psychology that reasons we can figure out how we evolved in the past by looking at how we behave now. In the case of The Mating Mind, Miller defends what he calls ""sexual selection"".  Why does the peacock have those cumbersome feathers that make it harder to avoid predators?  Certainly not survival of the fittest.  Miller believes that peacock risks his neck with those feathers because it is a “fitness indicator” to attract peahens. He also speculates that the reason human beings excel at certain things that do not make it any easier to survive is that these have been ""selected"" by our ancestors.  For instance, the women in your ancestry may have preferred men with good singing voices.  Over generations, your people became better and better singers.  Ultimately, Miller believes this is why the ""mind"" evolved into existence.  It was necessary for cavemen to think, or become more creative, to outcompete their rivals for the love of Wilma or Betty. I've read a number of books in this genre.  One of the reasons I find this material so fascinating is that the conclusions they draw make great additions to the teleological argument for the existence of God. That is, evolutionary psychologists can give incredible insight into the ""design"" of our bodies and minds.  Our brains, physical features, and talents are perfectly suited to attract the opposite sex. Geoffrey Miller would say this is because of evolution.  For me, it is a powerful reason to believe in a creator. "
13,038549517X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4696922-ushan,2,"The human mind has many unique properties. Miller claims that they are due to sexual selection: they are useless for survival in the human ancestral environment, but useful for mate choice; women chose men with the best brains to have sex with and have children by. I don't believe it; the hunters-gatherers whose lifestyles were recorded by ethnologists in the 20th century made full use of their minds for everyday survival. It takes brains to prepare curare and make curare-tipped darts and a blowgun, not to mention discover the poison and invent the weapon (and the ancestors of Amazonian Indians, like those of all other American Indians, came from icy Beringia). In modern times, the men who use their brains the most, which is to say the nerds, are not the ones who enjoy the best sexual and reproductive success; were things different in ancient times?"

15,038549517X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31807791-tirumarai-selvan,2,I couldn't go past 100 pages in this book because of the logical gaps in the arguments. 
16,038549517X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1680974-alex-zakharov,4,"A fast, fun, and speculative ride on evolution of human intelligence through sexual selection. Miller starts off by outlining main challenges to explaining evolution of the brain and creative culture via mainstream natural selection (brain size, lag between cost and survival benefit, no obvious payoffs for humor, creativity, music). He enumerates a few attempts to solve this evolutionary puzzle by way of gene-culture co-evolution, “social brain” hypothesis, tribal warfare and finds these theories wanting.And so Miller reboots good old sexual selection, jacks it up with Fisher’s fitness indicators and Zahavi’s handicaps, and mounts it on top of human behavioral genetics and “genic capture”. Within such framework, brain becomes an increasingly large mutational target, yielding increasingly complex behaviors that signal genetic health and correlate via g factor.Now we can revisit art, creativity, language, and even morals and argue for adaptive value through reproductive success. To get these to work Miller needs a better solution to altruism than kin selection or reciprocity, and without falling into the morass of group selection. He dusts off John Nash and argues for altruism via “equilibrium selection”. I like it.With altruism out of the way, we can piggy back art off fitness signaling, and argue for language as a perfectly selfish courtship tool. Then we can start bootstrapping morals as equilibrium selection of costly wasteful signals. Finally, Miller’s mechanism for creativity is kinda cute too – he frames it as a generalized form of Protean behavior where unpredictability signals agility of the mind.Good read, and certainly more entertaining than the more mainstream theories of Pinker, Buss, Henrich, and Dunbar. And for my money – more plausible too."
17,038549517X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19007827-arron-kallenberg,5,"Despite Miller's recent well publicized self-described ""idiotic, impulsive, and badly judged"" tweet, which seems to have generally lowered his social status and sexual attractiveness, I still found ""The Mating Mind"" to be quite entertaining, informative, progressive and open-minded, so much so that I nearly can't believe the same person crafted both the book and the tweet. What I like most about this book is that it demonstrates how much more complex, chaotic and integrated nature and evolution are than the predominant survival of the fittest paradigm would lead us to believe. Miller suggests that processes, such as those that embace randomness, novelty, creativity, language, art, along with a whole host of other other seemingly useless and wasteful natural occurrences, are not mealy footnotes to evolution but the essential drivers of sexual selection, which itself is the gateway through which any lifeforms lucky enough to be naturally selected must first pass. Miller goes on to demonstrate that Darwin himself identified and took great pains to detail the incredible importance of sexual selection. In addition, he points out that, because of the Victorian era male dominated scientific community to which Darwin proposed both sexual and natural selection, sexual selection did not until recently receive the attention it deserves. The rest of the book is devoted to rethinking many of the most wonderful aspects of being human, not in the context of Machiavellian-minded natural selection, but in the much more subtle and diverse context of sexual selection and mate choice."
18,038549517X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4353795-greg-linster,5,"I once heard someone say that we evolved ears so that we could wear earrings. No joke. The more classic statement that follows that line of reasoning is the claim that we evolved noses in order to wear glasses. I know, it sounds pretty silly. Evolution is a highly controversial topic and our vague understanding of it has left many important questions unanswered. Darwinian concepts such as “natural selection” and the “survival of the fittest” are certainly relevant when discussing evolution, but they give us a rather incomplete picture of the process. I’ve long been fascinated by evolution, but I was always left to ruminate about countless deep questions, some of which include: Why do male peacocks have extravagant tails? Why did humans develop language, but other apes didn’t? How did a human taste for art evolve? How did the human mind evolve?Read the rest of my review of The Mating Mind here."
19,038549517X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,4,"Sexual selection writ large, very largeThere was a commercial for Toyota's Paseo a few years ago in which its reliability was being touted when suddenly an insistent voice came on and whispered what Toyota hoped was the subliminal truth: ""Women dig it!""I think the perception of the human brain as a sexual ornament--Geoffrey Miller's primary argument in this book--is in the same class. Sex may help to sell cars, and the fact that women are attracted to men of means with expensive cars (forget the Paseo) is not to be doubted, but to suppose that the primary function of any automobile is symbolic or ornamental is mistaken. While witty conversation and musical display certainly are attractive attributes of a well-made brain, they are secondary to the social, political and subsistence skills of that brain as reasons for its being.The brain, as Miller points out, is a very expensive organ, eating up a disproportional amount of our caloric intake, requiring a long period of development both inside and outside the womb, as well as making childbirth painful and dangerous--which are some of the reasons it has never grown so disproportionately large in any other creature. Such an organ must have some very fine compensating qualities to make it adaptive. The fact that women dig it (or men for that matter) isn't enough. The case of the peacock with its huge showy tail feathers and the Irish elk with its enormous antlers are cited as examples of runaway sexual ornamentation, and they are that, I suppose. But the Irish elk is extinct and the peacock is not exactly a favorite to survive for very much longer. Most creatures do not develop features that are so grossly expensive strictly as lures for the opposite sex. Most such lures are modest, the coloring of birds, the combs on roosters, the mane on a lion, a woman's breasts, etc. Miller knows this and his book does not contradict what I have written. The problem is one of perception and understanding. Evolutionary theory, seemingly so simple at first glance, is an incredibly complex subject, so much so that no one person can hope to grasp it all--or, I should say, grasp what little we now know. Evolutionary psychology, which follows from the fact of evolution just as surely as evolutionary biology does, is also an incredibly complex subject awaiting its first genius. But separating ""just so stories"" from genuine insights is extraordinarily difficult. There is no way Miller or others can prove that the human brain developed in part because of sexual selection--although I personally do not doubt that it did. Nor do I doubt that the elephant's size was also enhanced through sexual selection, perhaps even the cheetah's speed as well. But how to prove it? Consequently, it becomes a matter of opinion to what extent the thesis is correct. Is Miller overstating the case? There is no sure way of deciding. Each reader must weigh the arguments and reach his own conclusions. This is why evolutionary psychology, despite its enormous power to provide insight into who we are and why we behave as we do, is difficult for some people to understand and will continue to be controversial for decades to come.But this very readable and thought-provoking work goes well beyond its primary thesis as Miller explores sexual selection theory over a wide range of human ability and ornamentation. One of the most exciting things he does is to recognize that biologist Amotz Zahavi's handicap principle can function as a fitness indicator not only to predators but to members of the opposite sex. Thus springboks jump into the air to show predators that they have energy to spare, while women incur the ""handicap"" of growing large, fatty breasts to show that they have foraged well and have reserves to feed their children. In this way fitness is demonstrated, the former to discourage a fruitless chase, the latter to advertise ready fertility to members of the opposite sex.I also appreciate his recall of neotony--the retention of child-like features in the adult--as a significant feature of sexual selection. Most recent books on evolutionary psychology have forgotten Ashley Montagu's Growing Young (1989) and Stephen J. Gould's Ontongeny and Phylogeny (1977) both cited by Miller. Sexual selection makes us appear more childlike as a youth indicator, consistent with choosing a mate that will serve us well as a partner for many years to come.Miller will find his critics here because one of the things he is trying to do is diminish the idea that the intellectual and artistic abilities of the brain are merely fortuitous side effects of its subsistent and social function, which is the position of Stephen Jay Gould and others. In this attempt I don't think Miller is going to be entirely successful. Fortuitous side effects of organs are at the very heart of evolutionary change, sometimes becoming more important than the earlier function. We see this in the case of fins that became legs, or light-detecting organs that became capable of discerning movement and color, and so on. The best explanation for the rapid and disproportionate growth of the human brain is its social/political function. Following in importance is its ability to understand the environment in a way that allows us to find food and shelter and avoid predators. Then, I would say, its tertiary function is to display itself to the opposite sex, to be ""sexy.""It is impossible to do justice to this ambitious work in a review limited to a thousand words; however had I more space, given the wide terrain explored by Miller, I would be inadequate to the task. Quite simply, this is an incredibly complex work by a gifted young scientist trying to establish himself as one of the leaders in the growing field of evolutionary psychology, and a book all interested persons should read. --Dennis Littrell, author of “Understanding Evolution and Ourselves”"

Or it doesn't come with new ideas. This was more thought-provoking and, creative. I think that's the catch though, I think there's plenty in the book that's speculative. I think bolstering these ideas with non-human animals is a good choice.So I really enjoyed this, and I hope that the more speculative hypotheses will be put to the test. It really gives me a lot of food for thought and material to dig deeper in.

Topics include art, morality, language, creativity, and humor.The first half of the book spends a lot of time detailing the general forces of sexual selection and the adaptations favored by it, giving examples drawn from other organisms.

There were stretches where Miller provides fresh insight upon fresh insight, really showing how evolutionary psychology can reshape one's perspective about what it means to be human. But there were also long chunks of the book where my mind glazed over as Miller plodded through evolutionary hypotheses, digging deep into their minutiae, only to eventually reveal that they are, in all likelihood, misguided. It felt like he was caught between writing a book for a popular audience that would lap up his speculations versus one for an academic audience who would be highly skeptical. But when he hits it, he nails it. Basically, Miller says that we should all have listened to Darwin when he stressed that sexual selection shapes many of the traits of sexual species, and is in fact a process that's different from natural selection. And if we hope to understand ourselves, this difference matters. Modern scientists tend to describe traits as either survival adaptations or byproducts of survival adaptations. For instance, Steven Pinker has said that music is likely a byproduct of other adaptations that evolved for survival. But Miller thinks that such explanations are missing something. Many traits that we find sexually attractive (but which offer few survival benefits) may exist for one obvious reason: our ancestors also found them sexually attractive, so were more likely to mate with those who displayed them. In this way, sexually attractive traits—such as high intelligence, artistic ability, athleticism, beauty, a strong moral sense, etc.—were amplified through sexual selection, gifting us with our uniquely human minds. Because scientists have been so preoccupied with the survival value of traits, they've been unable to explain the evolution of many human traits. As Miller explains, you need sexual selection to understand all sorts of things, from the existence of useless adjectives to the large size of human penises. By focusing on survival adaptations or byproducts, you miss one of the key forces that made our species. As Miller says, ""The human mind's most impressive abilities are like the peacock's tail: they are courtship tools, evolved to attract and entertain sexual partners.""And since I always like reviewing my reading notes, here are more quotes:""...before language evolved, our ancestors could not easily perceive one another's thoughts, but once language had arrived, thought itself became subject to sexual selection.""""Evolution's job is to motivate us, not to satisfy us.""""Attention guides behavior to adjust the world to one's desires, or guides learning to adjust one's world-model to reality.""""The minds of our ancestors were relatively naked compared to ours. They did not spend twenty years in formal education ornamenting their memory with dead people's ideas. They did not read daily newspapers so that they could recount human-interest stories. In courtship, they had to make up their ideas, stories, jokes, myths, songs, and philosophies as they went along. There was no masking a poor imagination with a good education, or a poor sense of rhythm with a good CD collection.""""Instead of averting our eyes from the unsightly front of another person's head, where harmful mutations show themselves most readily as unusual proportions and asymmetries, we are sometimes so rude as to stare at it, instead of their penis or their breasts. Have we no courtesy? Indeed, we pick the one part of the body where fitness differences are most manifest, and regard that as the seat of personhood.""""... how can a qualitatively novel structure arise through gradual, quantitative changes? The answer, of course, is that the whole universe unfolds by processes that turn quantitative change into qualitative novelty. The incremental process of gravitational attraction turns interstellar dust clouds into star systems. The incremental processes of capital investment and education turns poor villages into prosperous cities. The incremental process of growth turns a fertilized egg into a human baby. There is nothing special about evolution in this respect. Every thing in the world that we bother to name is a bundle of qualitatively novel properties emerging from an accumulation of quantitative stuff.""""From a sexual selection perspective, science is a set of social institutions for channeling our sexually selected instincts for ideological display in certain directions according to strict rules. These rules award social status to individuals for proposing good theories and gathering good data, not for physical attractiveness, health, kindness, or other fitness indicators.""""It is our responsibility to design social institutions that reap maximum social benefits from individual instincts for sexual competitiveness.""""Animals have been playing God ever since they first evolved powers of sexual choice."""
37,038549517X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27609086-travis-scher,2,"Miller's thesis here is simple - humans developed tremendous intelligence and creativity not just to survive (ie. not die before reproducing), but also to attract mates (by demonstrating their intelligence, which is an indication that their offspring are more likely to survive and reproduce). In my mind, the concepts of survival of the fittest and sexual selection are therefore inseparable, and obviously both true. The more controversial part is that males developed more creativity or are at least more likely to display it, because females are choosier. This is true across species, and makes sense as men, unlikely child bearing women, can afford to reproduce more recklessly. Overall, though, I found the book disappointing and I dropped it after 100 pages. I felt it could have been condensed into an interesting 20 pages article. Miller is redundant and fails to back up his arguments with interesting pieces of evidence (not that I doubt his claims, but the lack of evidence makes its specific insights rather limited).

It fills some gaps, for sure, and provides more complete picture of human origin, especially the psychological constitution. It's not 100% complete, so I might want to read more on the topic, but that's a good start. The only downside is that the book seems too overextended, it could have been 1.5 times shorter still keeping the same argumentation and value."

At many places it feels speculative and you'd think the opposite argument could be made just as convincingly (but probably not). Most of the rationale presented sounds reasonable and if true, explains many of the traits in humans that can not be explained without employing sexual choice theory. One could justify the arguments using personal experience, if not from proved hypotheses. That's what makes it a successful attempt at understanding the mating-driven minds of humans."

Men ask more questions after lectures. Men post more e-mail to Internet discussion groups. To say this is due to patriarchy is to beg the question of the behavior's origin. If men control society, why don't they just shut up and enjoy their supposed prerogatives? The answer is obvious when you consider sexual competition: men can't be quiet because that would give other men a chance to show off verbally. Men often bully women into silence, but this is usually to make room for their own verbal display. If men were dominating public language just to maintain patriarchy, that would qualify as a puzzling example of evolutionary altruism—a costly, risky individual act that helps all of one's sexual competitors (other males) as much as oneself. The ocean of male language that confronts modern women in bookstores, television, newspapers, classrooms, parliaments, and businesses does not necessarily come from a male conspiracy to deny women their voice.

I randomly came across this quote, and read it aloud to my boyfriend. So, I wondered, why did  Enheduanna  write her poetry? If the only reason to want to write is based on the desire to sleep with chicks - then why did she write? Why did she spend hours upon hours painfully noting down poems honoring a goddess? Was she perhaps a lesbian like  Sappho ? Why did  Murasaki Shikibu  write hundreds upon hundreds on pages about a selfish prince? Maybe she was a lesbian as well, my boyfriend offers unhelpfully.So fine, if we've established that the only conceivable notion that anyone would write anything is their desire to sleep with women, I continue, does that make me a lesbian? Or at least a bi-sexual. Not that I would mind the least, but that's news to me.More interestingly perhaps, what about notable gay men? Did Oscar Wilde write so that he could get more pussy? Truman Capote? I could name an endless amount, and even though many of them might have been bisexual, a fair amount would not, so then where are we?Could it be that sexual desire and competition exists among all genders? Could it be that when people look at the game theory that is mating they severely overvalue the importance of male ability to spread their seed and undervalue women's ability to compete over the best potential nurturing monogamous fathers? When it comes to men's over-representation it is also interesting to consider the following quote: ""As an editor, I can’t tell you how many submissions I’ve had from women, who, despite encouraging rejections, never submitted to me again. But there are always men, despite extremely non-encouraging rejection letters, who submit over and over and over. Women never do this. And for some of these men, because they’re dedicated, this strategy will eventually pay off."""
57,038549517X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17942027-lage-von-dissen,4,"Geoffrey Miller explores sexual selection and its relation to the evolution of the human species. He proposes that human traits such as consciousness, language, and the arts (to name a few) as well as the relatively abrupt increase in brain size (leading to higher intelligence and more cognitive faculties) that accompanied/facilitated these human traits, were likely the result of sexual selection. That is, it was the mate choice of ""choosy females"" that largely influenced and catalyzed the development of these traits in human beings. This position stands in stark contrast with the traditional view of evolutionary psychologists -- that these human traits and/or constructs are merely epiphenomena of surplus brain size as opposed to adaptations of some kind. Miller makes a convincing case against this traditional view and reminds the reader just how powerful sexual selection can be. Whenever particular traits are being evaluated for evolutionary adaptive value, that is, to see if they are an adaptation of some form (rather than a cultural invention/construct or otherwise), if a direct adaptive value can't be found, rather than abandoning the classification of that trait as an adaptation, one should at least consider the often overlooked sexual selection pressures. In general, inter-sexual selection encompasses multiple possible mechanisms including: sensory bias, fitness indicators, genetic compatibility, direct phenotypic benefits, and runaway (i.e. Fisherian) selection. Miller mentions most of these inter-sexual selection mechanisms (all except for genetic compatibility), and illustrates their potential impact on the evolution of the human mind. To see the bulk of the human condition as a result of female sexual choice brings a whole new meaning to the term ""Mother Nature"", and it truly highlights the unequivocal importance and multi-level integration of sex in relation to everything that human beings value most.

Not all is bad for Geoffrey Miller still managed to conduct his logical thread of presenting three big evolution theories and use them to explain four uniquely human aspects - morality, arts, creativity and language - and only the zeitgeist of the 2000's stopped him from going further in this exciting trail that clearly deviates from everything we might have heard about or known in the scientific world and common sense."

In my mind, the concepts of survival of the fittest and sexual selection are therefore inseparable, and obviously both true. The more controversial part is that males developed more creativity or are at least more likely to display it, because females are choosier.

I randomly came across this quote, and read it aloud to my boyfriend. So, I wondered, why did  Enheduanna  write her poetry? If the only reason to want to write is based on the desire to sleep with chicks - then why did she write? Why did she spend hours upon hours painfully noting down poems honoring a goddess? Was she perhaps a lesbian like  Sappho ? Why did  Murasaki Shikibu  write hundreds upon hundreds on pages about a selfish prince? Maybe she was a lesbian as well, my boyfriend offers unhelpfully.So fine, if we've established that the only conceivable notion that anyone would write anything is their desire to sleep with women, I continue, does that make me a lesbian? Or at least a bi-sexual. Not that I would mind the least, but that's news to me.More interestingly perhaps, what about notable gay men? Did Oscar Wilde write so that he could get more pussy? Truman Capote? I could name an endless amount, and even though many of them might have been bisexual, a fair amount would not, so then where are we?Could it be that sexual desire and competition exists among all genders? Could it be that when people look at the game theory that is mating they severely overvalue the importance of male ability to spread their seed and undervalue women's ability to compete over the best potential nurturing monogamous fathers? When it comes to men's over-representation it is also interesting to consider the following quote: ""As an editor, I can’t tell you how many submissions I’ve had from women, who, despite encouraging rejections, never submitted to me again. But there are always men, despite extremely non-encouraging rejection letters, who submit over and over and over. Women never do this. And for some of these men, because they’re dedicated, this strategy will eventually pay off."""
87,038549517X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17942027-lage-von-dissen,4,"Geoffrey Miller explores sexual selection and its relation to the evolution of the human species. He proposes that human traits such as consciousness, language, and the arts (to name a few) as well as the relatively abrupt increase in brain size (leading to higher intelligence and more cognitive faculties) that accompanied/facilitated these human traits, were likely the result of sexual selection. That is, it was the mate choice of ""choosy females"" that largely influenced and catalyzed the development of these traits in human beings. This position stands in stark contrast with the traditional view of evolutionary psychologists -- that these human traits and/or constructs are merely epiphenomena of surplus brain size as opposed to adaptations of some kind. Miller makes a convincing case against this traditional view and reminds the reader just how powerful sexual selection can be. Whenever particular traits are being evaluated for evolutionary adaptive value, that is, to see if they are an adaptation of some form (rather than a cultural invention/construct or otherwise), if a direct adaptive value can't be found, rather than abandoning the classification of that trait as an adaptation, one should at least consider the often overlooked sexual selection pressures. In general, inter-sexual selection encompasses multiple possible mechanisms including: sensory bias, fitness indicators, genetic compatibility, direct phenotypic benefits, and runaway (i.e. Fisherian) selection. Miller mentions most of these inter-sexual selection mechanisms (all except for genetic compatibility), and illustrates their potential impact on the evolution of the human mind. To see the bulk of the human condition as a result of female sexual choice brings a whole new meaning to the term ""Mother Nature"", and it truly highlights the unequivocal importance and multi-level integration of sex in relation to everything that human beings value most. "

The Mating Mind is written in a more commercial overtune with clear allusions to marketing other than the tradition of offering evolutionary examples from other animals of the tree of life. Not all is bad for Geoffrey Miller still managed to conduct his logical thread of presenting three big evolution theories and use them to explain four uniquely human aspects - morality, arts, creativity and language - and only the zeitgeist of the 2000's stopped him from going further in this exciting trail that clearly deviates from everything we might have heard about or known in the scientific world and common sense."

There were stretches where Miller provides fresh insight upon fresh insight, really showing how evolutionary psychology can reshape one's perspective about what it means to be human. But there were also long chunks of the book where my mind glazed over as Miller plodded through evolutionary hypotheses, digging deep into their minutiae, only to eventually reveal that they are, in all likelihood, misguided. It felt like he was caught between writing a book for a popular audience that would lap up his speculations versus one for an academic audience who would be highly skeptical. But when he hits it, he nails it. Basically, Miller says that we should all have listened to Darwin when he stressed that sexual selection shapes many of the traits of sexual species, and is in fact a process that's different from natural selection. And if we hope to understand ourselves, this difference matters. Modern scientists tend to describe traits as either survival adaptations or byproducts of survival adaptations. For instance, Steven Pinker has said that music is likely a byproduct of other adaptations that evolved for survival. But Miller thinks that such explanations are missing something. Many traits that we find sexually attractive (but which offer few survival benefits) may exist for one obvious reason: our ancestors also found them sexually attractive, so were more likely to mate with those who displayed them. In this way, sexually attractive traits—such as high intelligence, artistic ability, athleticism, beauty, a strong moral sense, etc.—were amplified through sexual selection, gifting us with our uniquely human minds. Because scientists have been so preoccupied with the survival value of traits, they've been unable to explain the evolution of many human traits. As Miller explains, you need sexual selection to understand all sorts of things, from the existence of useless adjectives to the large size of human penises. By focusing on survival adaptations or byproducts, you miss one of the key forces that made our species. As Miller says, ""The human mind's most impressive abilities are like the peacock's tail: they are courtship tools, evolved to attract and entertain sexual partners.""And since I always like reviewing my reading notes, here are more quotes:""...before language evolved, our ancestors could not easily perceive one another's thoughts, but once language had arrived, thought itself became subject to sexual selection.""""Evolution's job is to motivate us, not to satisfy us.""""Attention guides behavior to adjust the world to one's desires, or guides learning to adjust one's world-model to reality.""""The minds of our ancestors were relatively naked compared to ours. They did not spend twenty years in formal education ornamenting their memory with dead people's ideas. They did not read daily newspapers so that they could recount human-interest stories. In courtship, they had to make up their ideas, stories, jokes, myths, songs, and philosophies as they went along. There was no masking a poor imagination with a good education, or a poor sense of rhythm with a good CD collection.""""Instead of averting our eyes from the unsightly front of another person's head, where harmful mutations show themselves most readily as unusual proportions and asymmetries, we are sometimes so rude as to stare at it, instead of their penis or their breasts.

Or at least a bi-sexual. Not that I would mind the least, but that's news to me.More interestingly perhaps, what about notable gay men? Did Oscar Wilde write so that he could get more pussy? Truman Capote? I could name an endless amount, and even though many of them might have been bisexual, a fair amount would not, so then where are we?Could it be that sexual desire and competition exists among all genders? Could it be that when people look at the game theory that is mating they severely overvalue the importance of male ability to spread their seed and undervalue women's ability to compete over the best potential nurturing monogamous fathers? When it comes to men's over-representation it is also interesting to consider the following quote: ""As an editor, I can’t tell you how many submissions I’ve had from women, who, despite encouraging rejections, never submitted to me again. But there are always men, despite extremely non-encouraging rejection letters, who submit over and over and over. Women never do this. And for some of these men, because they’re dedicated, this strategy will eventually pay off."""
117,038549517X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17942027-lage-von-dissen,4,"Geoffrey Miller explores sexual selection and its relation to the evolution of the human species. He proposes that human traits such as consciousness, language, and the arts (to name a few) as well as the relatively abrupt increase in brain size (leading to higher intelligence and more cognitive faculties) that accompanied/facilitated these human traits, were likely the result of sexual selection. That is, it was the mate choice of ""choosy females"" that largely influenced and catalyzed the development of these traits in human beings. This position stands in stark contrast with the traditional view of evolutionary psychologists -- that these human traits and/or constructs are merely epiphenomena of surplus brain size as opposed to adaptations of some kind. Miller makes a convincing case against this traditional view and reminds the reader just how powerful sexual selection can be. Whenever particular traits are being evaluated for evolutionary adaptive value, that is, to see if they are an adaptation of some form (rather than a cultural invention/construct or otherwise), if a direct adaptive value can't be found, rather than abandoning the classification of that trait as an adaptation, one should at least consider the often overlooked sexual selection pressures. In general, inter-sexual selection encompasses multiple possible mechanisms including: sensory bias, fitness indicators, genetic compatibility, direct phenotypic benefits, and runaway (i.e. Fisherian) selection. Miller mentions most of these inter-sexual selection mechanisms (all except for genetic compatibility), and illustrates their potential impact on the evolution of the human mind. To see the bulk of the human condition as a result of female sexual choice brings a whole new meaning to the term ""Mother Nature"", and it truly highlights the unequivocal importance and multi-level integration of sex in relation to everything that human beings value most.

126,038549517X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20262189-tristan,3,"""Language puts minds on public display, where sexual choice could see them clearly for the first time in human history.""Much of this book was stellar but much of it was not. There were stretches where Miller provides fresh insight upon fresh insight, really showing how evolutionary psychology can reshape one's perspective about what it means to be human. But there were also long chunks of the book where my mind glazed over as Miller plodded through evolutionary hypotheses, digging deep into their minutiae, only to eventually reveal that they are, in all likelihood, misguided. It felt like he was caught between writing a book for a popular audience that would lap up his speculations versus one for an academic audience who would be highly skeptical. But when he hits it, he nails it. Basically, Miller says that we should all have listened to Darwin when he stressed that sexual selection shapes many of the traits of sexual species, and is in fact a process that's different from natural selection. And if we hope to understand ourselves, this difference matters. Modern scientists tend to describe traits as either survival adaptations or byproducts of survival adaptations. For instance, Steven Pinker has said that music is likely a byproduct of other adaptations that evolved for survival. But Miller thinks that such explanations are missing something. Many traits that we find sexually attractive (but which offer few survival benefits) may exist for one obvious reason: our ancestors also found them sexually attractive, so were more likely to mate with those who displayed them. In this way, sexually attractive traits—such as high intelligence, artistic ability, athleticism, beauty, a strong moral sense, etc.—were amplified through sexual selection, gifting us with our uniquely human minds. Because scientists have been so preoccupied with the survival value of traits, they've been unable to explain the evolution of many human traits. As Miller explains, you need sexual selection to understand all sorts of things, from the existence of useless adjectives to the large size of human penises. By focusing on survival adaptations or byproducts, you miss one of the key forces that made our species. As Miller says, ""The human mind's most impressive abilities are like the peacock's tail: they are courtship tools, evolved to attract and entertain sexual partners.""And since I always like reviewing my reading notes, here are more quotes:""...before language evolved, our ancestors could not easily perceive one another's thoughts, but once language had arrived, thought itself became subject to sexual selection.""""Evolution's job is to motivate us, not to satisfy us.""""Attention guides behavior to adjust the world to one's desires, or guides learning to adjust one's world-model to reality.""""The minds of our ancestors were relatively naked compared to ours. They did not spend twenty years in formal education ornamenting their memory with dead people's ideas. They did not read daily newspapers so that they could recount human-interest stories. In courtship, they had to make up their ideas, stories, jokes, myths, songs, and philosophies as they went along. There was no masking a poor imagination with a good education, or a poor sense of rhythm with a good CD collection.""""Instead of averting our eyes from the unsightly front of another person's head, where harmful mutations show themselves most readily as unusual proportions and asymmetries, we are sometimes so rude as to stare at it, instead of their penis or their breasts. Have we no courtesy? Indeed, we pick the one part of the body where fitness differences are most manifest, and regard that as the seat of personhood.""""... how can a qualitatively novel structure arise through gradual, quantitative changes? The answer, of course, is that the whole universe unfolds by processes that turn quantitative change into qualitative novelty. The incremental process of gravitational attraction turns interstellar dust clouds into star systems. The incremental processes of capital investment and education turns poor villages into prosperous cities. The incremental process of growth turns a fertilized egg into a human baby. There is nothing special about evolution in this respect. Every thing in the world that we bother to name is a bundle of qualitatively novel properties emerging from an accumulation of quantitative stuff.""""From a sexual selection perspective, science is a set of social institutions for channeling our sexually selected instincts for ideological display in certain directions according to strict rules. These rules award social status to individuals for proposing good theories and gathering good data, not for physical attractiveness, health, kindness, or other fitness indicators.""""It is our responsibility to design social institutions that reap maximum social benefits from individual instincts for sexual competitiveness.""""Animals have been playing God ever since they first evolved powers of sexual choice."""
127,038549517X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27609086-travis-scher,2,"Miller's thesis here is simple - humans developed tremendous intelligence and creativity not just to survive (ie. not die before reproducing), but also to attract mates (by demonstrating their intelligence, which is an indication that their offspring are more likely to survive and reproduce). In my mind, the concepts of survival of the fittest and sexual selection are therefore inseparable, and obviously both true. The more controversial part is that males developed more creativity or are at least more likely to display it, because females are choosier. This is true across species, and makes sense as men, unlikely child bearing women, can afford to reproduce more recklessly. Overall, though, I found the book disappointing and I dropped it after 100 pages. I felt it could have been condensed into an interesting 20 pages article.

At many places it feels speculative and you'd think the opposite argument could be made just as convincingly (but probably not). Most of the rationale presented sounds reasonable and if true, explains many of the traits in humans that can not be explained without employing sexual choice theory. One could justify the arguments using personal experience, if not from proved hypotheses. That's what makes it a successful attempt at understanding the mating-driven minds of humans."

His arguments are well supported and besides that, he makes this book entertaining to read with appealing anecdotes. I particullary enjoyed this part: “Men write more books. Men give more lectures. Men ask more questions after lectures. Men post more e-mail to Internet discussion groups. To say this is due to patriarchy is to beg the question of the behavior's origin. If men control society, why don't they just shut up and enjoy their supposed prerogatives? The answer is obvious when you consider sexual competition: men can't be quiet because that would give other men a chance to show off verbally. Men often bully women into silence, but this is usually to make room for their own verbal display. If men were dominating public language just to maintain patriarchy, that would qualify as a puzzling example of evolutionary altruism—a costly, risky individual act that helps all of one's sexual competitors (other males) as much as oneself. The ocean of male language that confronts modern women in bookstores, television, newspapers, classrooms, parliaments, and businesses does not necessarily come from a male conspiracy to deny women their voice. It may come from an evolutionary history of sexual selection in which the male motivation to talk was vital to their reproduction.”"

I randomly came across this quote, and read it aloud to my boyfriend. So, I wondered, why did  Enheduanna  write her poetry? If the only reason to want to write is based on the desire to sleep with chicks - then why did she write? Why did she spend hours upon hours painfully noting down poems honoring a goddess? Was she perhaps a lesbian like  Sappho ? Why did  Murasaki Shikibu  write hundreds upon hundreds on pages about a selfish prince? Maybe she was a lesbian as well, my boyfriend offers unhelpfully.So fine, if we've established that the only conceivable notion that anyone would write anything is their desire to sleep with women, I continue, does that make me a lesbian? Or at least a bi-sexual. Not that I would mind the least, but that's news to me.More interestingly perhaps, what about notable gay men? Did Oscar Wilde write so that he could get more pussy? Truman Capote? I could name an endless amount, and even though many of them might have been bisexual, a fair amount would not, so then where are we?Could it be that sexual desire and competition exists among all genders? Could it be that when people look at the game theory that is mating they severely overvalue the importance of male ability to spread their seed and undervalue women's ability to compete over the best potential nurturing monogamous fathers? When it comes to men's over-representation it is also interesting to consider the following quote: ""As an editor, I can’t tell you how many submissions I’ve had from women, who, despite encouraging rejections, never submitted to me again. But there are always men, despite extremely non-encouraging rejection letters, who submit over and over and over. Women never do this. And for some of these men, because they’re dedicated, this strategy will eventually pay off."""
177,038549517X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17942027-lage-von-dissen,4,"Geoffrey Miller explores sexual selection and its relation to the evolution of the human species. He proposes that human traits such as consciousness, language, and the arts (to name a few) as well as the relatively abrupt increase in brain size (leading to higher intelligence and more cognitive faculties) that accompanied/facilitated these human traits, were likely the result of sexual selection. That is, it was the mate choice of ""choosy females"" that largely influenced and catalyzed the development of these traits in human beings. This position stands in stark contrast with the traditional view of evolutionary psychologists -- that these human traits and/or constructs are merely epiphenomena of surplus brain size as opposed to adaptations of some kind. Miller makes a convincing case against this traditional view and reminds the reader just how powerful sexual selection can be. Whenever particular traits are being evaluated for evolutionary adaptive value, that is, to see if they are an adaptation of some form (rather than a cultural invention/construct or otherwise), if a direct adaptive value can't be found, rather than abandoning the classification of that trait as an adaptation, one should at least consider the often overlooked sexual selection pressures. In general, inter-sexual selection encompasses multiple possible mechanisms including: sensory bias, fitness indicators, genetic compatibility, direct phenotypic benefits, and runaway (i.e. Fisherian) selection. Miller mentions most of these inter-sexual selection mechanisms (all except for genetic compatibility), and illustrates their potential impact on the evolution of the human mind. To see the bulk of the human condition as a result of female sexual choice brings a whole new meaning to the term ""Mother Nature"", and it truly highlights the unequivocal importance and multi-level integration of sex in relation to everything that human beings value most.

The Mating Mind is written in a more commercial overtune with clear allusions to marketing other than the tradition of offering evolutionary examples from other animals of the tree of life. Not all is bad for Geoffrey Miller still managed to conduct his logical thread of presenting three big evolution theories and use them to explain four uniquely human aspects - morality, arts, creativity and language - and only the zeitgeist of the 2000's stopped him from going further in this exciting trail that clearly deviates from everything we might have heard about or known in the scientific world and common sense."

186,038549517X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20262189-tristan,3,"""Language puts minds on public display, where sexual choice could see them clearly for the first time in human history.""Much of this book was stellar but much of it was not. There were stretches where Miller provides fresh insight upon fresh insight, really showing how evolutionary psychology can reshape one's perspective about what it means to be human. But there were also long chunks of the book where my mind glazed over as Miller plodded through evolutionary hypotheses, digging deep into their minutiae, only to eventually reveal that they are, in all likelihood, misguided. It felt like he was caught between writing a book for a popular audience that would lap up his speculations versus one for an academic audience who would be highly skeptical. But when he hits it, he nails it. Basically, Miller says that we should all have listened to Darwin when he stressed that sexual selection shapes many of the traits of sexual species, and is in fact a process that's different from natural selection. And if we hope to understand ourselves, this difference matters. Modern scientists tend to describe traits as either survival adaptations or byproducts of survival adaptations. For instance, Steven Pinker has said that music is likely a byproduct of other adaptations that evolved for survival. But Miller thinks that such explanations are missing something. Many traits that we find sexually attractive (but which offer few survival benefits) may exist for one obvious reason: our ancestors also found them sexually attractive, so were more likely to mate with those who displayed them. In this way, sexually attractive traits—such as high intelligence, artistic ability, athleticism, beauty, a strong moral sense, etc.—were amplified through sexual selection, gifting us with our uniquely human minds. Because scientists have been so preoccupied with the survival value of traits, they've been unable to explain the evolution of many human traits. As Miller explains, you need sexual selection to understand all sorts of things, from the existence of useless adjectives to the large size of human penises. By focusing on survival adaptations or byproducts, you miss one of the key forces that made our species. As Miller says, ""The human mind's most impressive abilities are like the peacock's tail: they are courtship tools, evolved to attract and entertain sexual partners.""And since I always like reviewing my reading notes, here are more quotes:""...before language evolved, our ancestors could not easily perceive one another's thoughts, but once language had arrived, thought itself became subject to sexual selection.""""Evolution's job is to motivate us, not to satisfy us.""""Attention guides behavior to adjust the world to one's desires, or guides learning to adjust one's world-model to reality.""""The minds of our ancestors were relatively naked compared to ours. They did not spend twenty years in formal education ornamenting their memory with dead people's ideas. They did not read daily newspapers so that they could recount human-interest stories. In courtship, they had to make up their ideas, stories, jokes, myths, songs, and philosophies as they went along. There was no masking a poor imagination with a good education, or a poor sense of rhythm with a good CD collection.""""Instead of averting our eyes from the unsightly front of another person's head, where harmful mutations show themselves most readily as unusual proportions and asymmetries, we are sometimes so rude as to stare at it, instead of their penis or their breasts. Have we no courtesy? Indeed, we pick the one part of the body where fitness differences are most manifest, and regard that as the seat of personhood.""""... how can a qualitatively novel structure arise through gradual, quantitative changes? The answer, of course, is that the whole universe unfolds by processes that turn quantitative change into qualitative novelty. The incremental process of gravitational attraction turns interstellar dust clouds into star systems. The incremental processes of capital investment and education turns poor villages into prosperous cities. The incremental process of growth turns a fertilized egg into a human baby. There is nothing special about evolution in this respect. Every thing in the world that we bother to name is a bundle of qualitatively novel properties emerging from an accumulation of quantitative stuff.""""From a sexual selection perspective, science is a set of social institutions for channeling our sexually selected instincts for ideological display in certain directions according to strict rules. These rules award social status to individuals for proposing good theories and gathering good data, not for physical attractiveness, health, kindness, or other fitness indicators.""""It is our responsibility to design social institutions that reap maximum social benefits from individual instincts for sexual competitiveness.""""Animals have been playing God ever since they first evolved powers of sexual choice."""
187,038549517X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27609086-travis-scher,2,"Miller's thesis here is simple - humans developed tremendous intelligence and creativity not just to survive (ie. not die before reproducing), but also to attract mates (by demonstrating their intelligence, which is an indication that their offspring are more likely to survive and reproduce). In my mind, the concepts of survival of the fittest and sexual selection are therefore inseparable, and obviously both true. The more controversial part is that males developed more creativity or are at least more likely to display it, because females are choosier. This is true across species, and makes sense as men, unlikely child bearing women, can afford to reproduce more recklessly. Overall, though, I found the book disappointing and I dropped it after 100 pages. I felt it could have been condensed into an interesting 20 pages article. Miller is redundant and fails to back up his arguments with interesting pieces of evidence (not that I doubt his claims, but the lack of evidence makes its specific insights rather limited). It's also not written that well. I'd skip this one. "

It fills some gaps, for sure, and provides more complete picture of human origin, especially the psychological constitution.

216,038549517X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20262189-tristan,3,"""Language puts minds on public display, where sexual choice could see them clearly for the first time in human history.""Much of this book was stellar but much of it was not. There were stretches where Miller provides fresh insight upon fresh insight, really showing how evolutionary psychology can reshape one's perspective about what it means to be human. But there were also long chunks of the book where my mind glazed over as Miller plodded through evolutionary hypotheses, digging deep into their minutiae, only to eventually reveal that they are, in all likelihood, misguided. It felt like he was caught between writing a book for a popular audience that would lap up his speculations versus one for an academic audience who would be highly skeptical. But when he hits it, he nails it. Basically, Miller says that we should all have listened to Darwin when he stressed that sexual selection shapes many of the traits of sexual species, and is in fact a process that's different from natural selection. And if we hope to understand ourselves, this difference matters. Modern scientists tend to describe traits as either survival adaptations or byproducts of survival adaptations. For instance, Steven Pinker has said that music is likely a byproduct of other adaptations that evolved for survival. But Miller thinks that such explanations are missing something. Many traits that we find sexually attractive (but which offer few survival benefits) may exist for one obvious reason: our ancestors also found them sexually attractive, so were more likely to mate with those who displayed them. In this way, sexually attractive traits—such as high intelligence, artistic ability, athleticism, beauty, a strong moral sense, etc.—were amplified through sexual selection, gifting us with our uniquely human minds. Because scientists have been so preoccupied with the survival value of traits, they've been unable to explain the evolution of many human traits. As Miller explains, you need sexual selection to understand all sorts of things, from the existence of useless adjectives to the large size of human penises. By focusing on survival adaptations or byproducts, you miss one of the key forces that made our species. As Miller says, ""The human mind's most impressive abilities are like the peacock's tail: they are courtship tools, evolved to attract and entertain sexual partners.""And since I always like reviewing my reading notes, here are more quotes:""...before language evolved, our ancestors could not easily perceive one another's thoughts, but once language had arrived, thought itself became subject to sexual selection.""""Evolution's job is to motivate us, not to satisfy us.""""Attention guides behavior to adjust the world to one's desires, or guides learning to adjust one's world-model to reality.""""The minds of our ancestors were relatively naked compared to ours. They did not spend twenty years in formal education ornamenting their memory with dead people's ideas. They did not read daily newspapers so that they could recount human-interest stories. In courtship, they had to make up their ideas, stories, jokes, myths, songs, and philosophies as they went along. There was no masking a poor imagination with a good education, or a poor sense of rhythm with a good CD collection.""""Instead of averting our eyes from the unsightly front of another person's head, where harmful mutations show themselves most readily as unusual proportions and asymmetries, we are sometimes so rude as to stare at it, instead of their penis or their breasts. Have we no courtesy? Indeed, we pick the one part of the body where fitness differences are most manifest, and regard that as the seat of personhood.""""... how can a qualitatively novel structure arise through gradual, quantitative changes? The answer, of course, is that the whole universe unfolds by processes that turn quantitative change into qualitative novelty. The incremental process of gravitational attraction turns interstellar dust clouds into star systems. The incremental processes of capital investment and education turns poor villages into prosperous cities. The incremental process of growth turns a fertilized egg into a human baby. There is nothing special about evolution in this respect. Every thing in the world that we bother to name is a bundle of qualitatively novel properties emerging from an accumulation of quantitative stuff.""""From a sexual selection perspective, science is a set of social institutions for channeling our sexually selected instincts for ideological display in certain directions according to strict rules.

217,038549517X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27609086-travis-scher,2,"Miller's thesis here is simple - humans developed tremendous intelligence and creativity not just to survive (ie. not die before reproducing), but also to attract mates (by demonstrating their intelligence, which is an indication that their offspring are more likely to survive and reproduce). In my mind, the concepts of survival of the fittest and sexual selection are therefore inseparable, and obviously both true. The more controversial part is that males developed more creativity or are at least more likely to display it, because females are choosier. This is true across species, and makes sense as men, unlikely child bearing women, can afford to reproduce more recklessly.

Men ask more questions after lectures. Men post more e-mail to Internet discussion groups. To say this is due to patriarchy is to beg the question of the behavior's origin. If men control society, why don't they just shut up and enjoy their supposed prerogatives? The answer is obvious when you consider sexual competition: men can't be quiet because that would give other men a chance to show off verbally. Men often bully women into silence, but this is usually to make room for their own verbal display. If men were dominating public language just to maintain patriarchy, that would qualify as a puzzling example of evolutionary altruism—a costly, risky individual act that helps all of one's sexual competitors (other males) as much as oneself. The ocean of male language that confronts modern women in bookstores, television, newspapers, classrooms, parliaments, and businesses does not necessarily come from a male conspiracy to deny women their voice. It may come from an evolutionary history of sexual selection in which the male motivation to talk was vital to their reproduction.”"

I randomly came across this quote, and read it aloud to my boyfriend. So, I wondered, why did  Enheduanna  write her poetry? If the only reason to want to write is based on the desire to sleep with chicks - then why did she write? Why did she spend hours upon hours painfully noting down poems honoring a goddess? Was she perhaps a lesbian like  Sappho ? Why did  Murasaki Shikibu  write hundreds upon hundreds on pages about a selfish prince? Maybe she was a lesbian as well, my boyfriend offers unhelpfully.So fine, if we've established that the only conceivable notion that anyone would write anything is their desire to sleep with women, I continue, does that make me a lesbian? Or at least a bi-sexual. Not that I would mind the least, but that's news to me.More interestingly perhaps, what about notable gay men? Did Oscar Wilde write so that he could get more pussy? Truman Capote? I could name an endless amount, and even though many of them might have been bisexual, a fair amount would not, so then where are we?Could it be that sexual desire and competition exists among all genders? Could it be that when people look at the game theory that is mating they severely overvalue the importance of male ability to spread their seed and undervalue women's ability to compete over the best potential nurturing monogamous fathers? When it comes to men's over-representation it is also interesting to consider the following quote: ""As an editor, I can’t tell you how many submissions I’ve had from women, who, despite encouraging rejections, never submitted to me again. But there are always men, despite extremely non-encouraging rejection letters, who submit over and over and over. Women never do this. And for some of these men, because they’re dedicated, this strategy will eventually pay off."""
237,038549517X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17942027-lage-von-dissen,4,"Geoffrey Miller explores sexual selection and its relation to the evolution of the human species. He proposes that human traits such as consciousness, language, and the arts (to name a few) as well as the relatively abrupt increase in brain size (leading to higher intelligence and more cognitive faculties) that accompanied/facilitated these human traits, were likely the result of sexual selection. That is, it was the mate choice of ""choosy females"" that largely influenced and catalyzed the development of these traits in human beings. This position stands in stark contrast with the traditional view of evolutionary psychologists -- that these human traits and/or constructs are merely epiphenomena of surplus brain size as opposed to adaptations of some kind. Miller makes a convincing case against this traditional view and reminds the reader just how powerful sexual selection can be. Whenever particular traits are being evaluated for evolutionary adaptive value, that is, to see if they are an adaptation of some form (rather than a cultural invention/construct or otherwise), if a direct adaptive value can't be found, rather than abandoning the classification of that trait as an adaptation, one should at least consider the often overlooked sexual selection pressures. In general, inter-sexual selection encompasses multiple possible mechanisms including: sensory bias, fitness indicators, genetic compatibility, direct phenotypic benefits, and runaway (i.e. Fisherian) selection. Miller mentions most of these inter-sexual selection mechanisms (all except for genetic compatibility), and illustrates their potential impact on the evolution of the human mind. To see the bulk of the human condition as a result of female sexual choice brings a whole new meaning to the term ""Mother Nature"", and it truly highlights the unequivocal importance and multi-level integration of sex in relation to everything that human beings value most.

I randomly came across this quote, and read it aloud to my boyfriend. So, I wondered, why did  Enheduanna  write her poetry? If the only reason to want to write is based on the desire to sleep with chicks - then why did she write? Why did she spend hours upon hours painfully noting down poems honoring a goddess? Was she perhaps a lesbian like  Sappho ? Why did  Murasaki Shikibu  write hundreds upon hundreds on pages about a selfish prince? Maybe she was a lesbian as well, my boyfriend offers unhelpfully.So fine, if we've established that the only conceivable notion that anyone would write anything is their desire to sleep with women, I continue, does that make me a lesbian? Or at least a bi-sexual. Not that I would mind the least, but that's news to me.More interestingly perhaps, what about notable gay men? Did Oscar Wilde write so that he could get more pussy? Truman Capote? I could name an endless amount, and even though many of them might have been bisexual, a fair amount would not, so then where are we?Could it be that sexual desire and competition exists among all genders? Could it be that when people look at the game theory that is mating they severely overvalue the importance of male ability to spread their seed and undervalue women's ability to compete over the best potential nurturing monogamous fathers? When it comes to men's over-representation it is also interesting to consider the following quote: ""As an editor, I can’t tell you how many submissions I’ve had from women, who, despite encouraging rejections, never submitted to me again. But there are always men, despite extremely non-encouraging rejection letters, who submit over and over and over. Women never do this. And for some of these men, because they’re dedicated, this strategy will eventually pay off."""
267,038549517X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17942027-lage-von-dissen,4,"Geoffrey Miller explores sexual selection and its relation to the evolution of the human species. He proposes that human traits such as consciousness, language, and the arts (to name a few) as well as the relatively abrupt increase in brain size (leading to higher intelligence and more cognitive faculties) that accompanied/facilitated these human traits, were likely the result of sexual selection. That is, it was the mate choice of ""choosy females"" that largely influenced and catalyzed the development of these traits in human beings. This position stands in stark contrast with the traditional view of evolutionary psychologists -- that these human traits and/or constructs are merely epiphenomena of surplus brain size as opposed to adaptations of some kind. Miller makes a convincing case against this traditional view and reminds the reader just how powerful sexual selection can be. Whenever particular traits are being evaluated for evolutionary adaptive value, that is, to see if they are an adaptation of some form (rather than a cultural invention/construct or otherwise), if a direct adaptive value can't be found, rather than abandoning the classification of that trait as an adaptation, one should at least consider the often overlooked sexual selection pressures. In general, inter-sexual selection encompasses multiple possible mechanisms including: sensory bias, fitness indicators, genetic compatibility, direct phenotypic benefits, and runaway (i.e. Fisherian) selection. Miller mentions most of these inter-sexual selection mechanisms (all except for genetic compatibility), and illustrates their potential impact on the evolution of the human mind. To see the bulk of the human condition as a result of female sexual choice brings a whole new meaning to the term ""Mother Nature"", and it truly highlights the unequivocal importance and multi-level integration of sex in relation to everything that human beings value most.

276,038549517X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20262189-tristan,3,"""Language puts minds on public display, where sexual choice could see them clearly for the first time in human history.""Much of this book was stellar but much of it was not. There were stretches where Miller provides fresh insight upon fresh insight, really showing how evolutionary psychology can reshape one's perspective about what it means to be human. But there were also long chunks of the book where my mind glazed over as Miller plodded through evolutionary hypotheses, digging deep into their minutiae, only to eventually reveal that they are, in all likelihood, misguided. It felt like he was caught between writing a book for a popular audience that would lap up his speculations versus one for an academic audience who would be highly skeptical. But when he hits it, he nails it. Basically, Miller says that we should all have listened to Darwin when he stressed that sexual selection shapes many of the traits of sexual species, and is in fact a process that's different from natural selection. And if we hope to understand ourselves, this difference matters. Modern scientists tend to describe traits as either survival adaptations or byproducts of survival adaptations. For instance, Steven Pinker has said that music is likely a byproduct of other adaptations that evolved for survival. But Miller thinks that such explanations are missing something. Many traits that we find sexually attractive (but which offer few survival benefits) may exist for one obvious reason: our ancestors also found them sexually attractive, so were more likely to mate with those who displayed them. In this way, sexually attractive traits—such as high intelligence, artistic ability, athleticism, beauty, a strong moral sense, etc.—were amplified through sexual selection, gifting us with our uniquely human minds. Because scientists have been so preoccupied with the survival value of traits, they've been unable to explain the evolution of many human traits. As Miller explains, you need sexual selection to understand all sorts of things, from the existence of useless adjectives to the large size of human penises. By focusing on survival adaptations or byproducts, you miss one of the key forces that made our species. As Miller says, ""The human mind's most impressive abilities are like the peacock's tail: they are courtship tools, evolved to attract and entertain sexual partners.""And since I always like reviewing my reading notes, here are more quotes:""...before language evolved, our ancestors could not easily perceive one another's thoughts, but once language had arrived, thought itself became subject to sexual selection.""""Evolution's job is to motivate us, not to satisfy us.""""Attention guides behavior to adjust the world to one's desires, or guides learning to adjust one's world-model to reality.""""The minds of our ancestors were relatively naked compared to ours. They did not spend twenty years in formal education ornamenting their memory with dead people's ideas. They did not read daily newspapers so that they could recount human-interest stories. In courtship, they had to make up their ideas, stories, jokes, myths, songs, and philosophies as they went along. There was no masking a poor imagination with a good education, or a poor sense of rhythm with a good CD collection.""""Instead of averting our eyes from the unsightly front of another person's head, where harmful mutations show themselves most readily as unusual proportions and asymmetries, we are sometimes so rude as to stare at it, instead of their penis or their breasts. Have we no courtesy? Indeed, we pick the one part of the body where fitness differences are most manifest, and regard that as the seat of personhood.""""... how can a qualitatively novel structure arise through gradual, quantitative changes? The answer, of course, is that the whole universe unfolds by processes that turn quantitative change into qualitative novelty. The incremental process of gravitational attraction turns interstellar dust clouds into star systems. The incremental processes of capital investment and education turns poor villages into prosperous cities. The incremental process of growth turns a fertilized egg into a human baby. There is nothing special about evolution in this respect. Every thing in the world that we bother to name is a bundle of qualitatively novel properties emerging from an accumulation of quantitative stuff.""""From a sexual selection perspective, science is a set of social institutions for channeling our sexually selected instincts for ideological display in certain directions according to strict rules. These rules award social status to individuals for proposing good theories and gathering good data, not for physical attractiveness, health, kindness, or other fitness indicators.""""It is our responsibility to design social institutions that reap maximum social benefits from individual instincts for sexual competitiveness.""""Animals have been playing God ever since they first evolved powers of sexual choice."""
277,038549517X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27609086-travis-scher,2,"Miller's thesis here is simple - humans developed tremendous intelligence and creativity not just to survive (ie. not die before reproducing), but also to attract mates (by demonstrating their intelligence, which is an indication that their offspring are more likely to survive and reproduce). In my mind, the concepts of survival of the fittest and sexual selection are therefore inseparable, and obviously both true. The more controversial part is that males developed more creativity or are at least more likely to display it, because females are choosier. This is true across species, and makes sense as men, unlikely child bearing women, can afford to reproduce more recklessly. Overall, though, I found the book disappointing and I dropped it after 100 pages. I felt it could have been condensed into an interesting 20 pages article. Miller is redundant and fails to back up his arguments with interesting pieces of evidence (not that I doubt his claims, but the lack of evidence makes its specific insights rather limited). It's also not written that well. I'd skip this one. "
278,038549517X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8693407-dmitrii,4,"This book is a perfect complement to the Richard Dawkins' ""The Selfish Gene"" book. While The Selfish Gene theory explains how all life forms developed and interact between each other on a biology level, ""The Mating Mind"" offers a solid theory of human mind evolution as a result of sexual selection. It fills some gaps, for sure, and provides more complete picture of human origin, especially the psychological constitution. It's not 100% complete, so I might want to read more on the topic, but that's a good start. The only downside is that the book seems too overextended, it could have been 1.5 times shorter still keeping the same argumentation and value."

At many places it feels speculative and you'd think the opposite argument could be made just as convincingly (but probably not). Most of the rationale presented sounds reasonable and if true, explains many of the traits in humans that can not be explained without employing sexual choice theory. One could justify the arguments using personal experience, if not from proved hypotheses. That's what makes it a successful attempt at understanding the mating-driven minds of humans."
