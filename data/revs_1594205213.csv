So since I liked Bernd Heinrich's Mind of the Raven and his other books on ravens, owls and geese, I prepared to meet another 5-star natural history book. But I was disappointed.Not very. It's still a 4 star (just) read. But although it is science-based, to some extent, it is full of unproven theories and anecdotes, some of which are very charming and some which belabour the point at length. I always have a problem with scientists' testing of animals because we are testing them in comparison to our own intelligence not to themselves. I also have a problem with scientific pronouncements of animal behaviour being taken as gospel and anecdotes considered frivolous when they actually might be even more meaningful. Witness Jane Goodall's paradigm-shifting observations of the Gombe chimps.Once I had an experience with some wild golden pheasants in Kew Gardens in London. It was spring, mating season and my son had got very close to a big, beautiful male bird and called me over. We were able to get within 6' of the bird. He didn't seem to care at all. Up strode another equally big and beautiful male accompanied by two drab females who were walking slightly behind him.There was a row. The two male birds flew into the air and had a considerable fight with feathers flying and the earth kicked up. The two females stood together and watched the proceedings with interest. The first bird beat the second one, he even lost a feather or two and slunk off.Now,in the tv documentaries, which invariably are presented and written by men, the two drab females are supposed to remain with the winner. Indeed, the winner thought so too! But the females went off with the loser, one on each side of him inclining their heads towards him that, anthropomorphism or not, definitely looked like they were comforting him. They hadn't watched the right documentaries!So I do question both when the author says, ""some scientists say"" and when she goes off about, for instance the colour blue being so important to bower birds because it is the rarest colour in nature. She gives far to few theories about the homing instinct and ability to navigate and since I'm reading The Homing Instinct: Meaning and Mystery in Animal Migration right now, I'm amazed by all the different methods birds and other animals have to find their way home. The difference between Bernd Heinrich and Jennifer Ackerman, is one of degree. Heinrich is a better scientist, better observer and better writer. His books are 10 star and hers... 4, enjoyable but too light."

To learn an 8 step method to get food might get tricky to impossible to many animals that are smart too.What is unique and has the most potential for genetic engineering is the optimization of the use of space in those relatively small bird brains, that are, in relation to body size, as large as the ones of mammals, but minimized for optimized natural lightweight construction. If one would take this immense concentration of brainpower and put it in a whale or elephant, it¬¥s computational power would explode, although there may be a problem with the heat and general overload of the system. Certainly, that could be fixed too by adapting the whole metabolism and organs to fit to the new brain but until then just understanding how so much can be processed by such a tiny unit will open up many other applications. Orientation and navigation in birds are still a mystery and there seem to have evolved different methods of how to find the right way over thousands of kilometers. As melodious as singing birds are, as unclear is how they learn it and how complex their vocabulary might be, if they use it to express emotions and if they may be able to talk about the past, maybe dead birds they remember or complex philosophical topics.All the included theories and ideas that might be the reason for the high intelligence make the book in some part fictional which I highly appreciate between the theoretical parts.Because birds have tool use, understand complex correlations and human art, are descendants of the magnificent dinosaurs, can get very old, teach their kids, lie, fake, manipulate, can adapt to new environments, etc. they might evolve to something of very high intelligence in millions of years. If they would lose the ability to fly for higher possible brain size that still stays as highly connected as it was necessary for flying, evolve more and more skillful claws and live together in complex groups, building their houses together and get civilization diseases. Based on a different brain architecture with many similarities to humans in functioning, they could become equal to human intelligence.

Parakeets, delightful finches, a crockety Cockatiel and some very clever love birds. Then my asthma became debilitating and I found birds have more allergies than dogs and cats. Who knew? So, I had to give away my two lovebirds. I knew how clever birds could be and even how cunning, but those in this book will surprise.Ravens that use tools. Can figure out eight step puzzles and other games. I loved the shrub Jay's who hide their nuts for the winter, but are also thieves that steal nuts from others. They have also figured out a way to psyche out other would be thieves. Chickadees that have a early warning system based on perceived threat levels. They show empathy when confronted with a dead bird. Some hnow compassion to their partners. So much info is included, and explained so well. Many I hadn't heard of an spent time looking them up on wiki, but I enjoyed this book immensely.

4,1594205213,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"This is a marvelous book about the intelligence of birds. In this book, Jennifer Ackerman describes a wide range of bird species, brain sizes and capabilities. Bird brains, in size relative to body weight, are similar to those of mammals. Of course, in absolute terms they are small, as their total weight must be minimal in order to fly. I learned so much from this book. I had no idea about some of the capabilities of our feathered friends.The smartest birds appear to be crows, ravens, and parrots. The most clever bird seems to be the New Caledonian crow. Take a look at this video which shows a crow that has learned an 8-step method to get to some food. Only four animals make complex tools; humans, chimps, orangutans, and New Caledonian crows. And, the crows make hook tools; the only other species than humans. New Caledonian crows demonstrate cumulative technological change. Their tools are too complex to be invented by a single bird. New Caledonian crows have an extended juvenile period of learning tool-making from parents. Also, the lack of predators on New Caledonia allow crows time and ease of mind to tinker with sticks and barbed leaves. Keas (small parrots) like play most of all; they love to horseplay. And they are practical jokesters. They have stolen TV antennae from houses, deflated automobile tires, and stolen money from cars. And, it seems like some birds actually enjoy playing, just for the fun of it. Take a look at this video, showing a crow enjoying sledding down a snow-covered roof on a jar lid, again and again. Bird brains have evolved separately from mammals, so their brain architecture is quite different from that of humans. Nevertheless, their neural connection patterns are quite similar to those of humans. Sleep patterns and functions are similar between birds and mammals; these patterns seem to have evolved separately, in parallel.Birds have a trade-off at birth, between immediate functionality--flying almost as soon as they are hatched--and greater brainpower, later. The question this book raises is not whether birds are smart--some are definitely smart--but rather, ""why are they smart?"" The best answer seems to be that birds are smart so that they can solve problems in their environment; how to get food from hard-to-get places. In Japan, crows drop nuts onto a roadway, and position the nuts so that passing cars break the nuts which they then recover. Crows and ravens have been observed to dig up rocks and drop them on invading researchers.Scrub jays play a shell game with food that they store in caches. They bury, then later move or pretend to move food from one cache to another. They try to trick and confuse other scrub jays. They do this only in front of rival birds--not their mates. But they play this shell game only if they themselves have pilfered food from others in the past.There is a fascinating description of how birds learn to sing, with parallels with humans learning to speak. It is a mystery, how birds and humans independently evolved similar approaches for vocal learning. One theory is that birds and humans evolved neural circuits that control body movements into vocal capabilities.The book describes the art projects that male bower birds develop in order to attract mates. And this is followed by Darwin's 
really
 dangerous idea; colorful feathers or beautiful bowers might not just be indicators of a male's fitness, vigor and health--they can be desirable qualities, beatiful traits in the mind of the female. The female's preference has acted to evolve these traits in the male. Birds have been trained to distinguish between paintings by Picasso and Monet; they could distinguish impressionists from cubists. They could also learn to discriminate between good and bad paintings, as defined by human critics.There are lots more areas where birds excel, even in comparison with humans. I won't cover them all here. I simply recommend to everyone who enjoys watching birds to read this book. It is beautifully written, comprehensive in scope, and the writing style is very engaging.Oh, and one more thing; last night I dreamt that I was a bird. I flew up into the upper region of a big tree, worrying whether the thin, upper branches could support my weight. I figured out how to perch on a branch (a feat that seemed difficult at first), and then I talked with some of the other birds in the tree."

I walk a few times a week for exercise, but because it was boring to do so on a treadmill, I chose to walk outside. At first, I had earbuds for listening to music and audiobooks jammed into my ears most of the time because I assumed it would be a little dull walking outside too. But eventually I realized I was hearing birdsong all over the place. I wondered what kind of birds were making those sounds. I identified: https://youtu.be/LfMsUuU9KtQand https://youtu.be/fpTsnpsJJ2kand https://youtu.be/ZNsF_tyHiUYand https://youtu.be/PkOnpk8Wmowand maybe https://youtu.be/umFe7NLfQFwand day, I saw a hawk sitting on top of a tall evergreen tree; the hawk caused a birdsong pandemonium, much like this video:https://youtu.be/nOeKqvop6rwand the following sound was one I heard all of the time despite that I am a mile away from Elliot Bay:https://youtu.be/A-79gD1gMcoWho were these little noisy fellows (some not so little)? Why so noisy? I live in a medium-sized city with chunks of tamed parkland and an occasional polluted stream around me. How do birds survive in my urban environment? What and who are these birds of all colors and sizes? Crows in particular surround my area, in fact every area I have ever lived on the west coast. Are they the bosses, top of the bird food chain? How do birds sing anyway? What are they thinking? Do they think? No book about birds can answer every question about birds. An encyclopedia set couldn‚Äôt include everything we have seen through millennia about birds. What ‚ÄòThe Genius of Birds‚Äô explores is primarily what has been discovered about how some birds think and communicate their thoughts, if they have thoughts. If birds have thoughts, what do they think about, and how does it specifically relate to their lives?Jennifer Ackerman discusses some of the testing scientists have devised for observing birds‚Äô thinking behavior. The chapters are:From Dodo to CrowThe Bird WayBoffinsTwitterFour Hundred TonguesThe Bird ArtistA Mapping MindSparrowville One bird, the New Caledonian crow, is tested frequently because it may be the smartest bird in the world! The book describes the tests the crow passes with ease. It can solve three-step puzzles using tools!https://youtu.be/LF77qpbvkxoScientists have only recently seen with what organ birds use to sing and communicate! The author, Jennifer Ackerman, describes bird vocal chords, recently seen by an MRI. She also discusses various theories of if and why a species of bird devises different tunes and even accents - are songs passed down from parent to child? Or does the knowledge of tunes come along with the baby birds at birth? Is the how of birds that sing and talk related to human brain mechanisms? Are birds actually saying anything intellectually meaningful? Scientists can only make guesses about observed bird sounds and behavior. For instance, why do birds imitate the sounds of other birds, chainsaws, human babies crying and doors opening? Do they sing just to hear themselves, or only to attract mates, or do they also sound off to warn and teach young‚Äôuns? Do other species of birds or animals listen for a different bird species‚Äô warnings, or recognize songs as warnings?https://youtu.be/GpfF1xUqbOESome lovely bird tunes:https://youtu.be/q15dT8h-ORUhttps://youtu.be/mSB71jNq-yQAccording to ‚ÄòThe Genius of Birds‚Äô, scientists and amateur birdwatchers have made some fascinating discoveries about bird cognition, culture (omg, birds appear to have culture, and it varies around the world even within the same species!), aesthetics, building skills, mapping talents, and adaptation skills, particular in adapting to us humans. What brain neurons are at work? Are their neurons the same as humans? Do their neurons function like our neurons when doing the same task? Do birds intentionally trick other species of birds and animals and if so, what kind of mental cognition is involved? Can birds connive and scheme? Do birds play around just for fun? She describes the suspected brain talents of various bird species. Her writing is cogent, and she has chosen interesting things to describe to us readers.Most of what Ackerman discusses is what scientists (professional and amateur) have seen in studies and tests showing what possible cognitive activity is occurring behind the actions different species of birds do under certain circumstances. She describes what bird owners have told about what their pet birds have done (some stories are very funny). This book is interesting, but while fairly comprehensive in some bird brain studies, it left me wanting more. But clearly birds have a working intelligence behind their beautiful eyes!Thankfully, Ackerman has included sections for Acknowledgements, Notes and Index.It is an interesting book!I am not the only one who has wondered what birds do with their lives. People see remarkable bird behavior all of the time once they begin to look.

Talking birds can speak VERY clearly, even if it might be only a mindless imitation. And I do think some birds are NOT simply imitating you...they are TALKING. They have feelings. Some like to cuddle and play and do mischievous tricks. They get mad. They pick up on cues from living with people.

6,1594205213,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3920693-richard-derus,4,"Rating: 4.5* of five, rounded down for jargoneeringI voted for this book in the 2016 Goodreads Choice Awards. It deserves ever one of its stars! I was fascinated by the breadth of the study's scope. I was impressed by Ackerman's lucidity of prose, despite the (inevitable, I suppose) use of a lot of scientific jargon.I've been a bird fancier since the first time I saw a Baltimore oriole's nest in 1967. In fact, after the birds had raised their chicks and migrated north again, I scaled (for the one and only time in my life! so scared of heights I had to be rescued by my aunt's gardener) the pecan tree where I'd watched them live their South Texas breeding lives and got me that empty nest. It was a staple of my home decor until a careless mover crushed it in 1999. I was so angry I had to leave the house for an hour or I'd've crushed him.Crows fascinate me to this day. In Austin in the 1970s, the street I lived on had gob-oodles of trees. Crows liked to perch in them because there was an extensive open space very near us. Great place to grub around (in the literal sense of the verb) and thus I could, over time, learn that there were certain trees where certain crows could normally be found. I also discovered that crows like multi-grain bread, which I do not, so they appreciated my gifts of whole crumbled loaves of the stuff that my mother couldn't afford to replace with anything except my preferred rye or pumpernickel bread. Thanks, guys!This book resonated with me for those reasons, and also taught me a goodly amount of new information. I am completely unsurprised by the expanded knowledge scientists are accumulating about birds. They've been evolving for over 300MM years! Dinosaurs weren't stupid to begin with; add the last 65MM years for the birds to accumulate new knowledge and it shouldn't surprise us they're smart, it should surprise us if we find that they're dimwitted instinct-driven dum-dums.Very highly recommended if you're already interested in birds; still recommended if you're only mildly curious about the avian family that we continue to decimate with our carelessness about the planet we live on. Pretty soon, ladies and gentlemen, 

 THE BIRDS will be a prediction not a cautionary tale."
7,1594205213,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13086055-jay-schutt,4,"I was hoping to have more fun with this read. It is a scientific and close-up and personal look at the varying species of our avian neighbors and how they compare to other members of the animal kingdom, including humans.This extensively researched book is for the more serious birder and contains many results of experiments on varying species of birds the world over.A 5* read for the serious birder and 4*'s for the casual enthusiast like myself.I'll just be happy watching the birds in my backyard. Everything from hawks to hummers."
8,1594205213,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1258773-douglas-wilson,4,"Full of fascinating details of the incredible mental processes of various kinds of birds. Just a delight. The reason for four stars instead of five is the running commentary that assumes evolution in the background, which had the disconcerting effect of making the reader think that Ackerman was telling us a bunch of true and stupefying things, but was not paying any attention to just how amazing they were.Darwinism is not just a house of cards -- it is an inverted house of cards, with the apex of the entire card pyramid being one upright joker, holding up the whole thing, and then, five stories up, the storytellers started adding bricks, cinder blocks, and anvils. Every couple pages, Ackerman heaves another brick at the top, as though there were nothing unusual going on at all."
9,1594205213,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50297885-joy-d,4,"Everything you ever wanted to know about birds, and more! The author has compiled research from many sources to convey the capabilities and talents of a wide variety of bird species. In addition to the scientific studies, Ackerman includes anecdotes, current speculations, and a bit of humor. It is logically arranged and flows smoothly. The author‚Äôs love of birds shines through. Highlights include:-	Birds with a preference for certain colors and art types-	The ability to remember where they cached food supplies, even months later-	Vocalization and songs as a form of bird communication-	Birds making and using tools, and teaching their young to do so-	Gift-giving -	Recognition of facial expressionsIt requires a strong interest in science, animal intelligence, ornithology, or ecology to fully appreciate it, as there is an enormous amount of information imparted in a somewhat technical manner. Ackerman recounts many experiments ‚Äì the setup, controls, and results. I listened to the audiobook, read by Margaret Strom. Her voice has a pleasing tone and she reads well. On a personal note, I have a water feature in my backyard and always look forward to the spring, when I can reactivate it after the snowy season. I watch the many varieties of birds (finches, cardinals, jays, robins, doves, sparrows, chickadees, and even quail) that come to drink, bathe, or play. It is one of the small joys of my year."
10,1594205213,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5117896-jana,4,"I found  The Genius of Birds to be both enjoyable and illuminating, especially with regard to the similarities between avian and human behavior, morphology, and evolution.  Jennifer Ackerman conveys complex scientific information in a completely approachable way, which I really appreciated, since I am an absolute novice when it comes to birds: I can recognize a robin or chickadee by sight, and I keep a bird feeder in my backyard, but I certainly can't distinguish birds by sound or nest structure. Still, I'm fascinated by these feathered creatures, and reading The Genius of Birds fed the part of my brain that wants to know more about backyard wildlife, as well as many species of birds from around the world.Ackerman doesn't provide the entire evolutionary history of birds, but she does touch on the important moments as they relate to various chapters, which focus on areas of interest such as bird brains, social interactions (both in the wild and in urban environments), levels of intelligence or communication, and their astonishing ability to navigate incredible distances. It's truly amazing to me that we understand so little about these creatures, even though they literally live on every habitable surface of this planet. Even the research which has been done to date has a tendency to raise more questions than answers, since--as Ackerman points out--we humans have difficulties separating our own reasons for certain behavior from why a bird or dog or virus might act. The risk of anthropomorphic explanations is great, and frequently unavoidable. Still, conscientious researchers do excellent work, and deserve attention for their findings.I really enjoyed learning about bird behavior across species, particularly the tool-making and -use by various corvids, and the surprising depth of communication skills used by parrots. After finding out that generations of crows in New Caledonia have certain family-specific ways of grooming leaves into their own versions of Swiss Army knives, I guarantee that I'll never look at a crow the same way again! There's still so much that we don't know about why and how birds learn to mimic human speech, or why they seize onto particular phrases or sounds, but what little we do know is fascinating to me.I do have a few questions after reading this book, which I expected. Ackerman describes a research project in which a student was asked to repeat a spoken phrase one hundred times; no matter how hard the student tried, he couldn't perfectly repeat himself, and included all manner of variations. The bird in the same study, however, had no such trouble, and could repeat a sung phrase impeccably. I wonder, did the research team consider asking a trained singer to sing a musical phrase or lyric one hundred times? Birds must practice their songs and calls innumerable times in order to repeat them flawlessly, as must human singers. I would be very interested to see the similarities and differences in the data from that particular study.Additionally, Ackerman makes the point that birds who face challenges while foraging and collecting food tend to be more intelligent, due to the greater stress placed upon their drive to survive. What she doesn't touch upon, however, is whether bird feeders of the sort used by backyard-birders such as myself contribute in some way to a taming, and therefore dumbing down, of urban bird populations. Considering all of the other ways in which humans are a detriment to global bird populations, including but not limited to urbanizing rural bird habitats, hunting to eradication, destroying habitats and food sources, and pollution, I know my concern about one or two bird feeders somehow contributing to the decline in species diversity might seem silly. But it's undeniable that humans have had an incredible, indelible impact on the world around us, to the point that we have the dubious honor of creating the sixth mass extinction (named the Anthropocene, in case its cause isn't quite obvious). I'd hate to think that what I had thought was a beneficial action is actually detrimental.All in all, I learned so much about both birds and humans from this book, and I'm absolutely going to seek out more of Jennifer Ackerman's work in the future. Highly recommended for backyard birders, amateur bird-watchers, and nature enthusiasts.I received a free advance copy of this title from the publisher, which did not affect my review in any way."
11,1594205213,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3555205-kimari,3,"The narrator of the audiobook frequently mispronounces words. For example, hypo-campus instead of hippocampus. I quickly switched to the ebook, and I'm happy that I did. John Burgoyne's illustrations, especially the cover, are lovely. He also illustrated Dog Songs by Mary Oliver.Thumbs up to the author for including references, citations, and a useful index. The Genius of Birds is mainly summaries of other people's research; most of which I was already familiar with. I would have preferred more original content. Frequently a topic is mentioned in several different chapters, sometimes in nearly identical wording, making the book feel even more repetitive.I noticed an error in the book, which hopefully will be corrected in future editions.Some say vocal mimicry in birds is more like the Batesian version of mimicry: The monarch butterfly mimics the wing design of the toxic viceroy butterfly to warn would-be predators, ‚ÄúEat me and you‚Äôll die.‚Äù Monarchs do not mimic Viceroys. It was once thought that Viceroys were Batesian mimics of Monarchs and Queens, but research by David Ritland and Lincoln Brower ([Nature 350:497-498 (1991)]) has shown a M√ºllerian model may be more appropriate. Viceroys are not toxic. Viceroy caterpillars feed on members of the willow family, sequestering salicylic acid, which tastes bitter but is not toxic to predators. Monarchs feed on milkweed, sequestering steroids called cardenolides, which are both unpalatable and toxic to predators.

I suppose if the only birds you are familiar with are domestic chickens and turkeys, you might think it‚Äôs appropriate, but if you‚Äôve ever studied wild birds, you‚Äôll know that it‚Äôs completely off the mark. Detailed observation of the domestic fowl might change your mind, too.Think of the hummingbird‚Äîwith a brain smaller than a pea, it manages to migrate long distances and maintain detailed mental maps of nectar sources in its territory, knowing when each flower will be refilled with sweet goodness and ready to be drained again! Or think about the Gray Jay, with its multitudinous stored foodstuffs, to be recovered before they have spoiled. Even the lowly pigeon can do amazing things‚Äîwitness the homing pigeons, used successfully by people to communicate over great distances.This book, while enjoyable, it not a scientific tome. Much of it consists of anecdotal evidence, which seems self-evident, but hasn‚Äôt necessarily been peer reviewed. If you are searching for a definite science textbook on bird intelligence, this book may leave you frustrated, but if you are a bird enthusiast you will enjoy gaining a new appreciation for our feathered neighbours."

The author reminded me of a kid writing a term paper and padding things trying to get to the minimum page limit. Just in the intro, she remarked 6 or 7 times about birds who cached their food and could find it later. Enough already.There were some interesting studies and stories, but I found myself skimming most of the book to get past the tedious parts.One chapter talked about birds creating elaborately decorated nests. Some photos would have been nice--here and other places."

As Jennifer Ackerman points out in The Genius of Birds, we do them a disservice by calling them ‚Äúbird brains.‚Äù This is a book precisely about that‚Äîbird brains. More than that, it‚Äôs also about bird minds. The eight chapters here each explore different kinds of bird intelligence, many of which are jaw-dropping. We‚Äôve been told for so long that we alone are the ‚Äúsmart‚Äù species that when we see evidence of intelligence elsewhere we tend to doubt it. We may be more arrogant than intelligent, when it comes to the final reveal.Chapter 1 is devoted to exploring the mental life‚Äîthe mind‚Äîof a variety of birds. There‚Äôs some amazing stuff here. Chapter 2 looks at the physical brain of birds; small, yes, but then so are their bodies (at least most of them.) It pays to keep in mind that we still have trouble sorting out human brains so we shouldn‚Äôt rush to judge others. The third chapter considers the smartest problem-solving birds‚Äîthe kinds the can make and use tools and can infer the ‚Äútheory of mind‚Äù we so preciously guard as human prerogative. Then the next chapters considers how birds live in society. They share social intelligence with us; and perhaps, looking at world politics, surpass us a good deal. Chapter 5 focuses on vocalization and the way that some birds have come to understand and mimic human language. Okay, so they don‚Äôt speak it like a native, but they comprehend more than we give them credit for. The sixth chapter looks at the artistic taste of birds and features the amazing bower bird that builds houses with decorations simply to impress one another. They don‚Äôt live in them, but they build them nevertheless. Chapter 7 treats the navigational ability of birds and discusses their various ways of finding out where they are, including sensing the earth‚Äôs magnetic field. The last chapter consider the scrappy house sparrow and how it has adapted to our human environment but then it quickly turns poignant as it shows how our behavior, and our global warming, is driving bird extinction.I note on my blog post about the book (Sects and Violence in the Ancient World) that humans tend to think intelligence rests only with us. We co-evolved with birds (and other creatures) to the place where we currently find ourselves. The animal world has much to teach us about how to live intelligently in the world. We need to pay attention before it‚Äôs too late."

Tim Low, no mean slouch as a bird man, writes in the foreword: Her engaging survey of recent findings about bird acumen delivers so many surprises it ends up a revelation‚Äô. It certainly was revelatory for me.Ackerman starts out with the idea of ‚Äògenius‚Äô. It‚Äôs ‚Äòthe knack for knowing what you‚Äôre doing ‚Äì for ‚Äúcatching on‚Äù to your surroundings, making sense of things, and figuring out how to solve your problems. In other words, it‚Äôs a flair for meeting environmental and social challenges with acumen and flexibility, which many birds seem to possess in abundance‚Äô. She moves on to talk about why cognition is a better word to use than intelligence when you‚Äôre talking about birds. ‚ÄòAnimal cognition is general defined as any mechanism by which an animal acquires, processes, stores, and uses information. It ususally refers to the mechanisms involved in learning, meory, perception and decision making‚Äô.I knew about crows who exploited traffic light sequences so that car wheels would crack nuts the birds would wait for and retrieve in the pedestrian light cycle. But a crow who can correctly open a food puzzle using 6 separate tools in correct order the first time? In less than 3 minutes? Or a grey parrot who can not only count and talk but who clearly understands a range of language and can carry on a sensible, if limited, conversation.Our copy is bulging with stick-it notes of various shapes and sizes. So many ideas, so many illuminating examples that you want to keep track of. If you're interested in how smart birds are, then this book is a must read. It's the most interesting science-base book I've read this year.The text is easy to read; references kept out of the main text and to found in 50+pages of notes at the end. It's also well-indexed. Here is what the Scientific American said about it:https://www.scientificamerican.com/ar...'Science journalist Ackerman sets out to show that being called a ‚Äúbirdbrain‚Äù should be a compliment, not an insult. Birds' clever social and environmental problem-solving skills, she shows, establish them among the most intelligent members of the animal kingdom. Crows frequently steal the show: for example, they craft tools, such as branching twigs perfectly pruned into solitary sticks that can retrieve meat from plastic tubes. Even birdsong is cause for admiration: some birds' ability to hear a sound and re-create it has much in common with our own capacity to learn language.Ackerman devotes each chapter to a different bird skill and ends the book with a discussion of avian adaptive capabilities, which will prove vital in the near future as climate change and loss of habitat have put more than half of North American bird species at risk, according to the Audubon Society'. [She writes for the Scientific America, by the way].An excellent review of both Are We Smart Enough to Know How Smart Animals Are? and The Genius of Birds is at: http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/01/boo...  "
17,1594205213,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40797795-liz,4,"I received a copy of this book in a Goodreads giveaway.This was an interesting book! I had been anticipating a book that described the intelligence and behaviors of birds to be a very dull read. I was wrong ... this was such an easy read that I just couldn't put it down. The author did a great job in introducing the attributes of birds from tool making, social networking, vocal ability and much more. I learned a lot and will never look at a bird in my yard the same way again. "
18,1594205213,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3498889-cheryl,3,"Ackerman is a good science writer. She gives negative examples, she explains about how some interpretations of data can be made to say 'oh look!' or can be explained away with a ""killjoy"" conclusion. She understands the scientific method of random sampling, control group, etc. She knows that there are lots and lots of unanswered questions, and insufficient data to be assured of the theories of those we think we probably have answered.But still, she's a journalist, not a scientist. There are so many reports here of birds doing amazing things, and notes in the back to justify all the anecdotes, that the impression a reader is given is one of total awe for birds' intelligence. But almost none of the anecdotes are backed up in the text with explanations of the research. All too often I wondered, ""How on earth could they measure that? Or figure out that?"" I prefer books with a tighter focus that take the time to construct the argument being made by the scientist author. This was often entertaining, but seldom enlightening. I still favor, as a recommendation for you about animal intelligence, Are We Smart Enough to Know How Smart Animals Are?, by the ethologist Frans de Waal.I do have some book darts here:I'm charmed by the mental image of the little stint, a sandpiper, skittering along the edge of the waves, as if thinking, ""can't get my knees wet, can't get my knees wet.""Crow researchers admit that ""The trick is keeping them amused,... making their tasks hard enough to keep them interested and engaged.""And in Stillwater, Oklahoma, where my middle son worked on a team of wildlife biologists, one crow ""lobbed three pine cones at a scientist's head as he climbed up to its nest."" (I'll have to ask my son about that.)"
19,1594205213,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10001905-lynn,3,"One must be a major devotee of birds to love this book. It is well researched and written: exploring avian intelligence, mating, migration, cognition, and evolution. It had a particularly elegant section on the dangers of anthropomorphism: the attribution of human characteristics to animals. However, my major criticism of the book was that it was guilty of the very thing it warned against."
20,1594205213,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1027612-jean,0,"The Genius of Birds, by Jennifer Ackerman is a gamechanger for the way in which the curious reader will think concerning birds. Perhaps you thought birds were cute but not very bright, for example. Get ready to change your mind when you read in chapter one about ""007"", a corbid (kind of crow from New Caledonia), who goes through 8 steps, using tools, within two and a half minutes to get to a piece of food, after one scrutiny of this puzzle. Many types of birds are very smart, in the manner which humans are smart. Interestingly, the birds which take the longest to raise in the nest are the smartest and have the biggest brains (with the appropriate neurons). This section discusses the brilliance of some kinds of birds.Here you will find the tool users and others, such as the kees, who love clowning around and horseplay. As an illustration of this, the author mentions a kee who was seen rolling up a doormat and pushing it down a flight of steps.The writing by the author Jennifer Ackerman is at times beautiful ( as when she is describing the rainforest at nightfall),or laugh-out-loud funny (she discusses attempts by a bird biologist to measure intelligence in his test subjects by disguising himself, wearing at different sessions: a kimono, a wig,sunglasses, or walking with a limp, or hopping. They always recognized him). I was totally rolling when I read this, thinking of Peter Sellers in the Pink Panther movies. She is always fresh too, with new news on birds right up to this year. As things have changed dramatically in what we know about birds within the past ten years, this book is welcome as an overview, now. This is a book for bird lovers of all sorts.There is a section about the social aspect of birds, subtitled ""twitter"". This is fascinating too. The reader will learn about how different types of birds bond, and how they teach their young to perform certain important actions they will eventually need to survive. Also discussed is how some types of birds teach others in their particular ""group"" techniques they have been trained. , Incredibly, researchers have taught certain birds to open feeders in a special manner. They then were able to watch and track as their trained birds performed the tasks in the woods. The birds they had trained managed to train additional wild members to do exactly as they did, What collaborative little creatures!Further on, you learn about vocal virtuosity. I particularly love bird song, as I find it incredibly uplifting. I didn't know that birds must be tutored to sing however. I understand this now, from this book.In this chapter you learn that among Thomas Jefferson's favorite pets were his mockingbirds. Later,when you read about Honey Child, a hand raised mockingbird, your jaw will drop with amazement at the repertoire of his songs, which he would add to and occasionally drop throughout the length of his life. Woodpeckers, wrens, jays, you name it, Honey Child is worth the read! You will learn that this intricate process of vocal learning is termed ""advanced"", because, it's done ""our way"", eg., the way humans teach their children, and the way children learn to selectively speak.The male songbirds who have better songs appeal to the females more, too.As the author writes, ""Listening for super-sexy syllables allows female canaries to rule out males with poor bilateral co-ordination"" This is important, if you are a lady canary!Read on, through this award-winning author's book, to learn about birds who decorate: ""the bird artist"", birds who can map: ""a mapping mind"" and finally, sparrows: ""sparrowville"".This is a book to curl up with in the winter, or to take along on your cruise. It doesn't really have photos, just a few sketches of birds opening each chapter, but that is not the point of this book. The Genius of Birds is about behaviors, patterns, reversal learning, which bird is the ""world's dumbest""--yes, it has an offering for that, but not the author's (and I cracked up at that part!!!), the importance of studying birds in their natural environment to learn more and better understand them, and plenty more. The Genius of Birds is a big read, but nothing in it is wasted on the willing reader. I applaud Ackerman for taking me outside and to all sorts of amazing places, when she wrote this uplifting, extraordinary book about beautiful, beautiful birds."
21,1594205213,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5395843-lisa-reads-reviews,5,Fascinating. Increased my appreciation of birds. 
22,1594205213,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,3,"Studying birds in evolutionary bio was so eye opening. I loved to learn about how females choose males, how males use song to compete with other males, how each sex fights off other birds who want to have sex with their mate, how bower birds build intricate structures to woo the females, how jays brilliantly hide their treasures and use Machiavellian trickery, etc. This book was well researched but I think only bird watchers or true bird lovers could fall in love with this book. It was too dry for me. I wanted to be wowed like I was in various classes about animal behavior. It took a lot for me to make myself concentrate. If you don't mind a dry presentation and have love for the amazing things birds can do, you will likely find this book worthy of more than 3 stars. "
23,1594205213,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4629416-betsy,5,"This is an excellent short book full of many tales of ""intelligent"" birds, as well as discussion of what is meant by that. Birds are fascinating creatures, very different from us, but also similar in many ways. Their cognitive abilities range from very high level navigation, to amazing singing and vocal mimicry, to tool making, art, and more. The author gives many examples of each, and explains the many experiments done to test such abilities, as well as the limitations on each. She also describes the latest knowledge of the bird's brain anatomy and functionality. Very well written and accessible to the lay reader, but also presents a fairly scholarly view."
24,1594205213,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13549870-ally,2,"This book has some really neat and interesting facts, like smart vultures in Zimbabwe that figured out that if they perch on barbed wire fences near minefields, they just have to wait for dinner to explode. I also found it really neat that the amount of dee dee's in a chickadee-dee-dee's call have significance and indicate the size and threat of a nearby predator.Where this book falls short for me was in authors original content. Literally 1/3 of this book is citations from other researcher's work. I got tired of hearing who said what and who studied whom. I really wanted original observations and I didn't get that.I also listened to this publication via audiobook and the narrator wasn't very good. There were long pauses at inappropriate places; like at commas, mid sentence, or before a word that isn't common (like they had to pause to find out proper pronunciation). This really effected my enjoyment of the book. Oh, one more fun fact, Turkey's are the closest thing on the planet to dinosaurs. From now on, I shall forever call them Turkeysaurus'."
25,1594205213,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2118933-leo-walsh,3,"I'm not sure why Jennifer Ackerman's The Genius of Birds bored me at times. Since I love birds, biology and cognitive science. But while the book blurb promises to survey the amazing field of bird cognition, it often reads like a David Attenborough nature series on PBS, with Ackerman flitting from bird to bird interspersed with interviews from scientists. Worse, the science is sort of old-hat if you watch PBS's nature and science programming as well. Still, the book does a great exploration of bird navigation and the often sophisticated internal maps. And were I uninitiated like some readers will no doubt be, I'd be shocked to learn of the creative problem-solving skills and adaptability of the smartest of these critters, like crows, house sparrows and magpies. Especially when compare to dim-witted turkeys, chickens and ostriches. Three stars. Good read... but it just didn't have ""it""... if you know what I mean. "
26,1594205213,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18906322-joanne,2,"I love birds, am fascinated by them, so I was looking forward to this book so much. I got to about page 65 before I admitted that I was never going to finish it. I was just so BORED with the style, the endless citation of studies. I wanted a chatty book with examples and anecdotes but instead, this book read like a thesis. So disappointing."
27,1594205213,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1526286-melike,5,"I find birds fascinating and only had a basic knowledge of their behavior until I read this book. Jennifer Ackerman writes so well and makes it easy for a beginner bird aficionado like me to learn about these wondrous creatures. Every chapter was engaging. Ackerman traveled around the world to where the latest research was taking place. She tells us about the brains of the various species of birds and their behavior. There are chapters on their singing, nesting, social behaviors and more that left me even more in awe of these incredible creatures. I look forward to her next book which will be coming out in Spring 2020."
28,1594205213,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6137835-jay,5,"I thought I knew a lot about birds and their habits (North American song birds in particular), but I really didn‚Äôt know much at all about how flat-out smart birds are and why they are so. Here are a few impressions of the book: 1) Jennifer Ackerman is a terrific writer. The book was a pleasure to read and moved right along, each chapter covering a different topic or behaviors of a particular bird species in just enough depth and appropriate humor to keep you hooked and not reaching for that double espresso. Plus, the book is copiously and well end-noted, which I appreciated, because buried in the notes are all manner of sign posts to other research and articles that have piqued my interest and sent me many times to Google for more. 2) She obviously loves birds and presents their stories in with tender respect. The chapters about how birds learn to ‚Äúsing‚Äù (they aren‚Äôt ‚Äúborn‚Äù with the ability) and why they sing (it really is a form of communication), how they are able to navigate unerringly over enormous distances, remember places and food stashes, and how they are able to survive and adapt in almost any environment are particularly rich in information. The final chapter on English sparrows (‚ÄúSparrowville‚Äù), and how intelligent and resourceful they are, really captured me. The anecdotes about city sparrow who line their nest‚Äôs with all forms of materials, other bird‚Äôs feathers, paper,-you name it-were interesting. The sparrow who lined its nest with discarded cigarette butts, however, was laugh-out-loud funny (I wrote in the margin: ‚ÄúA thinking bird‚Äôs filter; a smoking bird‚Äôs taste?‚Äù) According to the endnote, citing the published research: the tar, nicotine and other toxins in smoked cigarette butts ‚Äúreduces nest ectoparasite load in urban birds‚Äù. Who knew? Genius, indeed. 3) My only is that she seems fairly offhand about some of the investigative methods of bird researchers who, essentially, must kill the birds they are studying in order to study at the cellular level birds‚Äô brains and other parts of their internal anatomies. For instance, research shows that the size of the hippocampus in a bird‚Äôs brain varies greatly from species to species and, logically, birds with larger hippocampi (which includes hummingbirds) are now known to be ‚Äúsmarter‚Äù - better navigators, better problem solvers, better rememberers of thousands of details critical to their survival - than birds with smaller hippos. Size matters here, and I guess it would seem fairly self-evident, but maybe not. Obviously, in order to gather data on this aspect of a bird‚Äôs brain, the bird has to be dead. I mean, how do you reverse engineer a bird‚Äôs brain to determine the size and weight of its hippocampus in a live specimen? Finally, there isn‚Äôt much ink devoted to sea birds or fresh water birds except in passing. And there is virtually no discussion of raptors. I guess ducks, eagles and the wise old owls aren‚Äôt that smart. But I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the reason. This book is a delight to read on multiple levels, and will entertain and enlighten you, even if you‚Äôre not a ‚Äúfan‚Äù of birds or one of ‚Äúthem tree-hugger liberals‚Äù. But I think you will have a great deal more respect for these amazing creatures, their cognitive abilities and their places in our world after you read this book. "
29,1594205213,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1624588-bonny,5,"The Genius of Birds is a striking book in many ways, from the gorgeous cover, to the facts and information that Ackerman conveys to the reader, to the whole new way the reader will look at and appreciate birds after reading this excellent book. The author begins by defining the many ways intelligence or genius is manifested in birds, the difficulties scientists encounter in measuring it, and then goes on to write about some of the incredible things that birds are capable of. New Caledonian crows craft and use tools; blue jays can select fertile acorns with 88% accuracy and count to at least five; scrub jays have developed intricate systems of caching their food while performing elaborate tactical maneuvers to protect that cache from thieving jays, and many species of birds display amazing ‚Äúvocal virtuosity‚Äù, song cognition, and mimicry. The author discusses bird brain structure, the syrinx (the unique cartilage and membranous organ that allows birds to sing), and how birds listen and learn. She tells us about the marvels of nest-building and how birds make complex navigational decisions. This book is filled with facts, but they come from extensive research and are conveyed in interesting, informative, and entertaining ways. Ackerman describes the behavior of some exotic and unique birds, but also points out that we can all make the same types of observations on the birds that frequent our own backyard feeders. I learned a great deal and have a new appreciation for birds, their advanced cognition and abilities, and I think many readers will feel the same way after reading The Genius of Birds.Thank you to Penguin Press and NetGalley for providing me with a copy of the book."
30,1594205213,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5683254-carmen,4,"This lovely book took me a while to get through because I didn't want to rush the reading, or gloss over all of the marvelous facts Ackerman painstakingly presents.  The author's love and respect for our feathered friends is obvious in her summaries of quirks, personalities, and proclivities of birds. There are scientific facts, anecdotes, summaries, and observations of the level of intelligence and the sheer ingenuity of birds and how they reach their goals. While this is not a novel, it is very easy to read, and fills your mind with the fluttering and thought processes, which various species of birds go through. As a lay-birdwatcher and ardent feeder- replenisher, I very much enjoyed this and recommend it.  Many thanks to NetGalley for a copy of this book in exchange for my honest review. "
31,1594205213,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1340545-michael-livingston,4,"A snappily written summary of recent scientific findings demonstrating the remarkable intelligence of a variety of bird species, including tool-making and use by crows, identification of patterns by pigeons, incredible feats of navigation and on and on. It's probably not a book that's going to completely draw in the non-bird nerd, but it's compelling, entertaining and readable."
32,1594205213,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1013402-jennifer,5,"I really enjoyed this lovely book. It's a nice blend of science and anecdote, which makes it very readable, even if you're not an ornithologist (I have a zoology degree, but I'm not an ornithologist). The shift in thinking about the bird brains since the 1990's is significant. Previous to then, it was thought that bird brains were quite primitive in comparison to mammal brains. New research shows that to be not at all the case. It also reminded me of the importance of staying current in my field. I finished my degree in the mid-1990's, and while much of the research was familiar to me, it is a very different outlook to when I was in school. Some of the experiments designed to study bird navigation were ingenious, and I think my favorite thing about the results was that it seems that birds use a combination of things including sight, smell, and geomagnetics. Studies have shown that birds who use multiple types of navigation methods have more gray matter in the rear portion of the hippocampus, as do London cab drivers. Interesting (see quote below).On the other hand, by the end of the book, I was reflecting on the ethics of experimentation. What is the purpose of the study? Is it just to know more? Is there a vital need to know this information for the betterment of human or bird lives? How much pain or permanent damage is justified in the search for knowledge? I don't necessarily have answers for all these questions, but I think it's important to always be keeping them in mind as we seek knowledge.I will end with a quote that is food for thought:This raises a troubling question. If our human navigational efforts shape our hippocampus, what happens when we stop using it for this purpose - when we lean too hard on technology such as GPS, which makes navigation a brain-free endeavor? GPS replaces navigational demands with a very pure form of stimulus-response behavior (turn left, turn right). Some scientists fear that overdependence on this technology will shrink our hippocampus. Indeed, when researchers at McGill University scanned the brains of older adults who used GPS and those who didn't, they found that the people accustomed to navigating on their own had more gray matter in the hippocampus and showed less overall impairment than those who relied on GPS. As we lose the habit of forming cognitive maps, we may be losing gray matter (and along with it, if Tolman is right, our capacity for social understanding). "
33,1594205213,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2579781-paul,3,"This book is probably more of a 2.5 stars for me. It's an interesting enough survey of the various experiments that have been done on bird intelligence, but in the end it's far, far too ""pop science"" for me. This boils down to basically two issues: 1. she's imposing a narrative that I don't think is appropriate and 2. she's drawing fairly significant conclusions from what seem to me to be small studies.Issue #1 comes about basically because I felt like she was really trying to make the case for birds, saying how amazing they are at this or that when really they're just birds. They're surprisingly intelligent, yes, but they're not even close to as intelligent as a human, so really, they're just surprisingly smart for an animal. Even if this is giving short shrift to the birds, I feel like the case could have been made more dispassionately.Issue #2 is the bigger issue, which is that a good scientist or science journalist sounds very circumspect because science is often a very uncertain endeavor and generally it takes a long time to make solid conclusions about things. I am very suspicious about much of social science and psychological research and animal research falls into the same bin - it's very easy to fuck it up and it's very easy to do a half-assed study and just publish right away. The second half of this book seems like just an overview of the press release headlines from scientists studying birds rather than the kind of measured, balanced statements you'd expect.That said, I will say that I was convinced that birds are very intelligent. The weight of the research on this topic does seem to be on Ackerman's side on this matter."
34,1594205213,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4239658-karen-chung,5,An utterly delightful and richly informative book. Recommended highly to anybody with even the slightest interest in birds or in the intelligence of all creatures.
35,1594205213,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35088694-carly-friedman,5,"I thoroughly enjoyed this informative look at the intelligence of birds. Ackerman's writing is clear and very accessible, making everything from the evolution of bird brains to complex navigational and social relationship patterns easy to understand. Moreover, her own enthusiasm and fascination for the field is clear and makes the book a joy to read. It definitely held my interest the entire time!I was really intrigued by how birds (and sharks) are pretty much current-day dinosaurs. I loved hearing about how their size, skeleton, wings, and feathers evolved from dinosaurs. The information about bird brains and how they compare to other animals was also interesting.The section on tool use as a measure of intelligence is also fascinating. It is obviously just one measure of intelligence (self-recognition, communication, and other measures are equally) but I really enjoyed learning how tool use differs between bird species. I found it fascinating that crows demonstrate an understanding of water displacement similar to 5-to 7-year-old children. The discussion on their causal understanding was also interesting. The Twitter chapter on social relationships had great info on how complex social relationships and interactions are a sign of intelligence and in the chapter on vocalizations, I loved the part about brain evolution and communication. The fact that birds and humans are similar in this regard is fascinating. In the chapter on nest construction, the debate about making nests as art, inherited instinct, and/or mate attraction was interesting. I also enjoyed the discussion of how comparing possibles males to mate with is a sign of intelligence in females. One of my favorite chapters was on navigation. The research on the topic was explained so well, though it helped that I was familiar with the research on human use of mental maps. It makes so much sense that birds use cognitive integration to combine sensory input to find their way. Lastly, the last section on bird cognitive, evolution, and the impact humans have on both was fascinating and alarming. "
36,1594205213,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60022503-narilka,2,"Rating: 2.5 starsBasically the author looked up all the studies she could find on bird intelligence and wrote a research paper. It is definitely well researched and written, with the final third of the book being all her references and an appendix. While I do enjoy the topic, I was hoping for more original content."
37,1594205213,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1976637-jeff,4,"The Genius of Birds is an excellent look in to intelligence of birds covering topics such as their brain (which evolved differently than mammals), use of tools, complex social systems, vocal ""virtuosity"", aesthetic nature, and navigational acuity. I knew a lot about birds before I started the book as I listen to a number of science podcasts and have read about them since we moved to our home near the Mississippi River and started feeding them 28 years ago. Still, I learned a lot from this book and there were some neat mysteries addressed and mind blowing information which was new to me. Living by the mighty Mississip and on the Mississippi Flyway migration route and having eight different bird feeders / food options has brought in a huge variety of birds to our backyard! We bought a illustrated bird guide and have recorded for 28 years the date we see bird species show up for the first time in the spring. Their consistency is amazing, and some birds only spend a day or two before moving on. It's fun to have some species spend the whole summer nesting in our trees every year, and it's always melancholy when we realize they have migrated away. Most recently, the hummingbirds and orioles have abandoned us for warmer climes. Through observation, I've always appreciated and admired the intelligence and guile of birds and this book deepened my appreciation even more. Especially the navigational acumen that birds display during migration. It boggles the mind. I just heard on Science Friday yesterday that scientists estimate that North America has lost 32 billion birds since 1970, or one in four of all birds. This is due to loss of habitat, more buildings / windows, climate change, and a number other lesser factors. This is a shame, but not surprising as many animals species are in decline due to human encroachment on wild areas world wild. Birds are smart and resilient, though. All they need is a chance, like the bald eagle and peregrine falcon were given. Their numbers have rebounded dramatically. We now see more bald eagles on the river than we ever did before. This was more like bird musings from an old guy than a book review. I do highly recommend this book to anyone with even the slightest interest in birds. It is fascinating and full of interesting science. I think that anyone who reads  The Genius of Birds will develop a new appreciation of our feathered friends. And you'll know why chickadees change the number of their ""dees"" when they see you or your dog in the back yard!"
38,1594205213,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,3,"If you‚Äôve read much about animal intelligence, most of the stuff in this book won‚Äôt be all that surprising, though of course since it‚Äôs entirely about birds, it includes a lot more anecdotes and bird-focused studies. As a whole, the book definitely makes a case for birds as specialised, well adapted, and very intelligent in their own spheres. We won‚Äôt be having philosophical discussions with them any time soon, though, if that‚Äôs what you thought ‚Äògenius‚Äô meant. And I think honestly that Ackerman makes less of a case for bower birds‚Äô displays being art than others I‚Äôve read.It‚Äôs an easy read, and good for some ‚Äòhuh, cool‚Äô moments, but not the most rigorous or unmissable popular science book out there.Reviewed for The Bibliophibian."

I am sure my partner did not notice that their headphones were on while I was 'sharing'.Only kidding. We actually had many wonderful conversations about this book."
40,1594205213,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17746077-joshua-buhs,3,"Disappointing.The book has been lavishly praised, but the whole of it is far less than the sum of parts. The cover, though, is gorgeous.Ackerman knows her stuff. She has researched deeply into various experiments on bird intelligence. She has interviewed a number of scholars. She is a birder herself, and has traveled around the world in the service of learning more about birds.If all you are after is fact nuggets, you can dig through here and find some interesting bits.But, by the end, that was the only part of the book I found worthwhile, the various bits and facts. The surrounding matrix, not so much.There's the style, to begin with, which is incredibly light, with a surfeit of (bad puns) and a let's-gather-around-the-table-drink-tea-and-chat bonhomie that both seems inappropriate to the subject matter and grated on me greatly. That style inflates a lot of the claims, from cautious speculations into definitive statements about the genius of birds.There's the organization, too. Ackerman is a magazine writer, and the chapters each read like magazine articles, only tenuously connected to the ones before and after them; more, they read like unedited magazine articles, crammed with extra material to extend the word count. As a result of this structure, there is a lot--a lot, lot--of repetition. Its even within the chapters, but then each chapter repeats the same points, uses the same examples, introduces the same birds.Finally, there's the overall thrust of the argument, which is a muddle. Asking how intelligent birds are immediately suggests the need to make some distinctions. What kind of intelligence are we talking about? Ackerman offers a definition--one based on how innovative birds can be at dealing with novel situations--but then there's plenty of the book that merely treats birds evolutionary success as proof of intelligence, without bothering to try to tease apart how much of this might be stereotyped behavior and how much something more recognizable as intelligence.To be fair, she sometimes notes this distinction, but doesn't really do anything with it--which is more annoying, in its way, since she recognized the problem but did not address is systematically.Another distinction one is going to want to draw is between intelligence as it is thought of in relation to humans (and, to a lesser extent, other primates) and what bird intelligence would look like--birds are different animals, with different anatomies, physiologies, and ecologies, and so should have their own kind of intelligence. Again, Ackerman acknowledges this point, but then proceeds to ignore it.What she really cares about is how close to human intelligence is bird intelligence. This question seems miscast from the beginning. Of course they are not close at all.Crows can count, maybe, other birds can recognize categories and do abstract reasoning. But, seriously, birds are not going to beat someone at chess; they are not writing Middlemarch; they are not designing bridges.Which doesn't mean birds are not smart. I am sympathetic to Ackerman's bigger aim, which is to stake out a place for bird intelligence as something impressive. Yes, it is. But it is bird intelligence, not human intelligence, and comparing the two seems unfair to everyone involved.Eliding the distinction between birds and humans seems to be of a piece with Ackerman's general tendency of (pretending to?) not understanding basic points. She misconstrues some non-circular statements as circular, for reasons best known to her, and lards the first few paragraphs of the book with examples of humans dismissing bird intelligence. But these examples don't scan. Calling a powerless politician a lame duck isn't a shot at birds's smarts; and even her chief example--bird brain--can be interpreted to just mean that birds have small brains (they do!), not that they are stupid. Ackerman uses this clich√©s as proof of long-standing bias against bird intelligence, and that her thesis is something new, but I can remember reading Scientific American articles from two decades ago that made similar claims.All of this makes me think of Amy Clampitt's poem Syrinx. The problem isn't whether birds are smart or not, but are anthropocentric views--are insistence on fitting their fierce intelligence into shiny little boxes:... the aeolian syrinx, that reed in the throat of a bird, when it comes to the shaping of what we call consonants, is too imprecise for consensus about what it even seems to be saying: is it o-ka-lee or con-ka-ree, is it really jug jug, is it cuckoo for that matter?‚Äî much less whether a bird‚Äôs call means anything in particular, or at all."
41,1594205213,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37884382-corvus,2,"This book started off strong, giving credit to birds for being interesting and extravagantly skillful animals. In one study, all birds of all species shared their toys.‚úä‚í∂ But, it kept devolving away from this tenet over time into the same old boring, tired, and uncreative hypotheses of some researchers. Unsurprisingly, the researchers willing to do the most harmful, exploitative, and often painful captive research of birds had some of the most basic assessments of bird behavior- projecting their own needs for superiority over animals onto their assessments of birds behavior and loves.¬† There are these disgusting parts where where the author will talk about captive animal researchers with adoration. One of the biggest leaps I saw her make was in the discussion of how a monkey exploiter created such a gee golly great learning environment by crowding a bunch of monkeys in wire cages with no comfort or stimulation. Up until about halfway through the section on bird song, it was mostly creative field research of birds, offering a lot of interesting and entertaining information. But, it continued to go downhill. The author acknowledges that humans can't help but use ourselves as reference for what intelligence is. She discusses ways in which birds excel far more than us in many tasks. But, then often falls back into the trap of only valuing human referenced kinds of skills. Some researchers draw conclusions that are specious. Most design things that they see themselves interacting with and expect that if someone a fraction of their size with a feathered dinosaur body doesn't interact in the same way, that they aren't smart. Others project patriarchy and sense of hierarchy into bird interactions. The birdsong section is one of the worst examples of this, falling into patriarchal, heteronormative, speciesist trap of humans thinking the only reason birds do anything is to attract a mate. The focus is entirely on male bird singing and hetero pairing despite female birds singing and bird social groups being described as complex and varied in previous sections. We go from talking about bird culture, morality, and even crow funerals to the assumptions that birds are just breeding machines. When she moved onto the researcher who snatched wild songbirds from the wild to then put their feet in painfully hot water, and I'm sure other worse things, I realized the book had strayed completely from its premise.Also of note, the author has some progressive pronouning with humans, often defaulting to she/her for generic human anecdotes. But calls all birds ""it"" throughout the book- even ones she has met and knows. There's a lot of talk about birds being genius, social, feeling animals but in the end, it's clear that the author and people involved believe that birds are not really deserving of full consideration, respect, and liberation. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because there were some great parts before it went downhill."

43,1594205213,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39571700-josh-d,2,"I really wanted to like this book, and I really wanted to finish this book. Maybe I will someday. Not only am I interested both in birds and in cognitive science, but I received the book (for the first time ever!) as a giveaway winner. But I just reached a point today where I can't pretend anymore. I've reached that dreaded point where I'm avoiding reading because I don't want to read this book but I feel like I ""ought"" to. I don't like this book. So for full disclosure, my review is based on having completed only half of the book.The book is thoroughly researched, the author has clearly read and understood the scientific literature, and done a great deal of original interviewing with scientists.I think that however may be the seed of the problem with the book. It flits from topic to topic, with no overarching momentum to a chapter (other than the introduction, which I liked a great deal). Moreover, a lot of the word count is spent on explaining jargon that we really don't need to know because it won't be used later, or on repetition of certain refrains ad nauseum. It felt a little bit like the author simply had simply typed up all of her most interesting research notes, organized them roughly by topic and shoved them together, with a hefty dash of undergraduate pride in using and explaining jargon, and called the resulting work a book.Good non-fiction writing should still travel in an organized way toward a clear thesis, without retreading and with energy. Being non-fiction does not excuse a book from craftsmanship. So, despite my intrinsic interest in the topic and in the book itself, it has come time to put this book down."

I've learned a lot about them that I didn't know. It's easy to read and actually a fast read too (when one finds the time to sit down with it.). I enjoyed reading it and would like to read more about this subject :)

49,1594205213,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7366675-morgan,4,"This book is more for those into bird science than actually being interested in birds. There's no story, mostly interesting facts. I owned ducks and other birds in the past, mainly why I got this book to understand them better in case I ever get another bird. While owning the ducks, most of what this book talks about I could relate and compare. Ducks and other birds aren't stupid.Ackerman focuses on how a bird brain is like or similar to a primates (mostly human) brain. She makes some good points. I'm not going to go into them all, because you have to read the book for that, but birds remember, they can count, they have feelings, they have a langue, they use tools, some can even talk like a human. If your not convinced after reading this that birds aren't intelligent, maybe pay attention to that bird outside of your window or get a bird as a pet.This book talks a lot about Darwin and people like him. It talk about Darwin's ideas about evolution, but also talks about Darwin's study on birds. Darwin doesn't get enough credit on social media for his bird studies, I've noticed. This also brings up the fact that birds were dinosaurs. She claims the closest is the turkey. I see other bird close too just looking at dinosaur bones and watching a duck run or walk around.I'd give this five stars, but there are some criticisms I have with this book. Mostly the fact there aren't any photos of the birds or people she is talking about. They would have been helpful. The cover is beautiful and there are some (not a lot) of illustrations introducing each chapter, but wasn't enough. Yet, I see some don't like the fact this book sources and gives other names. I rather read a science book like this than something that doesn't source anything.If your looking for something quick this book isn't want you should pick up. It' full of information and scientific words you might have to look up afterwords. A glossary would have been helpful too. Like I said, this book is very scientific, but it was needed. Helped me understand my feather friends better.I should point about being an English major in college was was to read about the history of the slang and slurs with birds. Like how ""bird brain"" is actually kind of an insult to humans and birds. Size doesn't matter with the brain."

Infinitely quoted -For darn good reason too-it‚Äôs hardy advice as a metaphor. But perhaps when it is stripped of its meta-metaphoric usage, it reads & plays as an omnipresent force when discerning readers are stalking the shelves of their favourite bookstore. This is how ‚ÄòThe Genius of Birds‚Äô - Came to be in my possession, like always I judged not by the cover, rejecting my initial prejudices of it being a book about birds and read the first 3 pages. It is here I learned that the aforementioned advice, is very much taken for granted & once every so often, we find a book that drives message back into our frontal-lobes, like a Pileated Woodpecker ramming it‚Äôs reinforced cranium into cedar tree in search of Carpenter Ants.Like many great reads, in this meticulously written nonfiction things just aren‚Äôt what they seem. For this, we can thank both the author, as well as the remarkable subjects detailed in the chapters of her fun, insightful & beautifully unassuming book. Whether it is learning about the link in intelligence of birds to humans, or discovering that we really shouldn‚Äôt apply the same scale for any animals to any other outside of its species, or amazing death like being able to bury thousands upon thousands of buried feed oky to return months later & recover over 90% of them, or solve puzzles that the average child could only dream of solving or that some birds have been known to not only recognise and use but also create tools in order to use for a task otherwise impossible! Honestly, I don't think.ibe annoyed my wife more whisky reading another book thanks to wanting to instantly share so any incredible facts and anecdotal wonder.. Who knew?As you have probably presumed by now, I had a wonderful time being schooled on Birds, whilst also being freed of the tragic-myth amongst society that ‚Äòbirdbrain‚Äô is denoted as an affliction of ‚Äòlesser than‚Äô intelligence, but in fact should be used in the complete reverse manner.. Birds are simply remarkable creatures that I will never view remotely the same way again.Go on, surprise yourself.."
51,1594205213,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7029980-katie-doing-dewey,4,"Since getting into bird photography, I've also discovered a new interest in reading about birds. They're the most easily observable animals in my daily life and their behavior is always fascinating. The Genius of Birds was full of delightful anecdotes about how clever birds are. I was constantly stopping to share fun tidbits with my husband or to look up videos of surprising bird behavior online. I probably highlighted half the book as interesting enough to share.The only thing I didn't love about this book was the organization. Each chapter had a broad theme, but anecdotes passed by quickly enough that it felt disjointed. I couldn't settle into one story before we were on to another. Some paragraphs were simply lists of sentence-long fun facts. At the sentence level, the writing was enjoyable. The science was explained clearly and the author's passion for birds showed in some truly lovely descriptions. Honestly, I think if I were working with a longer attention span these days, I might have enjoyed this even more. As is, I'd still highly recommend it to anyone interested in the intelligence of animals or who just loves accessible science writing.This review was originally posted on Doing Dewey"
52,1594205213,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2355848-lois,4,"This book took me a very long time to read because I did it in small amounts between other readings, taking notes along the way to tell to a friend. Not because I was bored or disappointed or any such thing. Rather because there was so much information and so many interesting facts to absorb, so I didn't want to rush through it. I bought the book for that very reason, rather than getting a copy from the library. I love birds and have many kinds visiting the numerous feeders in my yard every day, so I already know how smart and flexible they can be. This book proves those things, with many examples, and notes on research. Plus, it doesn't just cover the obvious ""smart"" birds, like crows or parrots. It goes from the sparrows we all see every day, to exotic birds I've never heard of, but would love to see. They are all different in so many ways, and while some may not survive, due to climate change which will ruin their routines, others are able to clearly think things thru, and will likely change with the times. Some use ""tools"" in ways you'd never imagine, some have ways of remembering things or following their own map.....all are incredible!!"

I had heard about some of the behaviors in previous books and nature shows. It has always fascinated me how birds (and other animals navigate) and how they adapted to their environment ( now rapidly changing and putting many species at risk). I am always amazed when the ruby throated hummingbirds arrive in Maryland every spring. How do these tiny birds find their way back and forth from many places in North America to Central and South America? If you are interested in and enjoy observing the behavior of birds this is a worthwhile read.
